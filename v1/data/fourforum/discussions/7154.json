   "Of Dreams and Blessings- A Christmas Message\n \n Intently studying the new Christmas tree that her mother and father had just erected in their foyer, little Christina slowly walked up to it and was immediately taken with the wonderful aroma of pine cones and winter frost that still lingered on its branches.\n \n \"Mommy, why do people have Christmas trees,\" Christina asked? \n \"Oh, I suppose that the Christmas tree means different things to different people, honey,\" the mother cheerfully replied, as she worked the string of Christmas lights through the branches of the tree. \n \"But mommy, what does it mean for us - for you and me and for daddy?\" The child-like innocence of Christina's question made her mother hesitate and stop what she was doing. She turned around and sat down on the floor, crossed her legs and gently lifted little Christina into her lap. \n \"Christina, honey, I don't know what the Christmas tree means to other people, but I can tell you about all the wonderful things I think about when I see one.\" Let me tell you a little story. And starting with the birth of Jesus, she told Christina all the wonderful news about his birth, his life, his death, and his resurrection, and what it all meant. And then to put it into a child's perspective the mother smiled and said,\n \n \"You see, long ago on a mountain top, far, far away, there were three other little trees. And as they started to sprout their branches and reach for the sky, they each dreamed about what they wanted to become when they grew up.\n \n The first tree looked up to the stars and said, 'I want to be a treasure chest. I want to be covered with gold and filled with precious stones. I want to be the most beautiful treasure chest the world has ever seen.'\n \n The second little tree looked out at the small stream trickling by on its way to the ocean and said, 'I like the water. I want to be a mighty sailing ship carrying kings on their journeys across the seas. Why, I'll be the strongest ship in the whole world!'\n \n The third little tree looked down into the valley below and saw the hustle and bustle in the streets and the hectic pace of the people in the village and said, 'I don't want to leave the mountain top. I really like it here. I want to grow up and be so tall that when people look at me, they'll raise their eyes and look up to heaven and think of God. Why, I'll be the tallest tree in the whole world!' \n \n Years passed. The rains came and the winds blew, the sun shone bright, and the little trees grew tall and strong. And then one day three woodcutters climbed up the mountain .\n \n The first woodcutter looked at the first tree and said, 'This tree is beautiful. I have something special I want to make from it, and it'll be perfect for me.' And with one mighty swoop of his woodcutter's axe, the first tree fell.\n 'Now, the time has come for my dream to come true,' the first tree thought. 'Now I shall be made into a beautiful chest, and surely I shall hold wonderful treasures!' \n \n The second woodcutter looked at the second tree and said, 'This tree is strong. It will be perfect for me.' And with a swing of his powerful axe, the second tree fell to earth.\n 'Now my dreams also will come true,' thought the second tree. 'I will be hewn into a mighty ship to sail the seas, and great kings will ride my bow!'\n \n But then the third tree felt her heart sink when the third woodcutter looked her way. She stood straight and tall and pointed bravely to the heavens. \n 'Remember, I want to stay on the mountain top, she cried.'\n But the woodcutter never looked up. 'Any tree will do for me,' he muttered. \n And with a powerful swing of his shining axe, the third tree thundered to the earth.\n \n The first tree continued to rejoice when the woodcutter brought him into the carpenter's shop. But his joy was turned to sorrow when the carpenter fashioned him into a simple feed trough for animals. Instead of being covered with precious gold and jewels, he was now covered with sawdust and filled with hay for hungry farm animals to eat.\n \n The second tree smiled when the woodcutter took her into the shipyard.\n 'Now, my dreams will also come true!' she thought.\n But no mighty sailing ship was christened that day. Instead the once mighty oak was whittled, hammered, and sawn into a simple fishing boat. She was too small and frail to sail the mighty oceans, or navigate the raging rivers. Instead, crestfallen, she was taken to a lake, and there she would spend her days.\n \n The third tree was confused when the woodcutter cut into her strong and weathered timbers, and left her in a cluttered woodpile in the lumberyard.\n 'What happened?' asked the tree that once pointed to the heavens. 'All I ever wanted was to grace the top of the mountain and point to God...'\n \n Again, the years passed by. The dreams the little trees once had were nearly forgotten. But then, something wonderful happened. In the distance, the angels were heard singing to the shepherds. A bright and shining star began its transit across the heavens, and came to its place of rest above the hewn out timbers of the first tree, where a beautiful young mother placed her newborn son into the feedbox.\n 'I wish I had time to make a cradle for him,' the father whispered. The mother gently squeezed his hand and smiled as the starlight glistened off the smooth and sturdy wood.\n 'Why this manger is beautiful,' she said. 'There is no need for another.'\n And suddenly, the first tree knew that God had honored his dream, and that he was now holding the greatest and most precious treasure in the whole world.\n 'God sure works in mysterious ways,' he thought, 'but this is better than anything I could have ever imagined.'\n \n Some years later, a kindly stranger and his friends crowded into an old fishing boat. The weary traveler fell asleep as the second tree quietly sailed out upon the moonlit lake. But soon, a terrible storm arose. The rains came, the winds grew fierce, and time after time the waves crashed into the little boat, sending it reeling from side to side. The little tree shuddered and grew afraid. She knew she did not have the strength to carry so many passengers through such a raging storm. Then, the kind but tired traveler awoke. He took hold of the mastline and stood up on the bow of the little vessel, stretched out his hand, and said, 'Peace, be still.' The storm stopped as quickly as it had begun. And suddenly, the second tree knew that she was carrying the greatest King who had ever lived, and that in some mysterious way, God had also made her dreams come true.\n \n Shortly thereafter, early on a Friday morning, the third tree was startled when her beams were yanked from the forgotten woodpile. She flinched when she was carried through an angry, jeering crowd. She shuddered when the soldiers nailed the arms and feet of a weary and bleeding man to her cross timbers. She felt ugly, cruel, and harsh. In the middle of the day, the sky turned dark. And when it was over, a terrible earthquake shook the ground, and made the third little tree long for the peace and serenity of its favorite mountain top, and the now-forgotten dreams that seemed so real, not so long ago.\n \n But early on a Sunday morning, when the sun rose and the earth trembled with joy beneath her, the third little tree looked upon the risen Savior, and rejoiced that God's mysterious love had now changed everything. The third tree remembered her dream - 'I want to grow so tall that when people stop to look at me, they'll raise their eyes to heaven and think of God.' It made the tree glad. Now, whenever people think of that third little tree, they think of God. And surely that was better than being the tallest tree in the whole world.\"\n \n \"So you see, Christina, God really does make dreams come true, though not always in the ways we expect. When I look at a Christmas tree, I remember the birth of Christ. I see the first little tree that was made into a manger. I remember the second little tree that our Savior rode in and calmed the great storm that rose up. And I remember that last little tree upon which our Lord was crucified, and how precious it also was. These are the things I think about when I see a Christmas tree.\"",

   "The Cobbler and His Guest \n (story from \"Chicken Soup for the Christian Soul\")\n \n Now there lived in the city of Marseilles, a hundred years ago, an old shoemaker, who was loved and honored by all his neighbors, who affectionately called him \"Father Martin.\" One Christmas eve he sat alone in his little shop, reading about the visit of the wise men to the infant Jesus, and of the gifts that they brought him. So the cobbler said to himself, \"If tomorrow were the first Christmas, and if Jesus were to be born in Marseilles this night, I know what I would give him!\" He rose and took from a shelf two little shoes of the softest snow-white leather, with bright, silver buckles. \"I would give him these, my finest work. How pleased his mother would be!\" But then, as he turned around to place them back on the shelf, he thought to himself, But I'm a foolish old man. The Master has no need of my poor gifts.\n \n After replacing the shoes, he blew out his candle and retired to his bed. He had barely closed his eyes when he heard a voice softly call his name. \"Martin!\" Intuitively, he felt that it was the Lord who was speaking to him. \"Martin,\" the voice said, \"You have longed to see me. Tomorrow I shall pass by your window. If you see me and bid me to enter, I shall be your guest and sit at your table.\"\n \n Father Martin was electrified. He didn't sleep that night in anticipation of what was ahead. Before it was dawn he got up and tidied up his little shop. He swept the floor and put boughs of holly and fir along the rafters. On the table he placed a loaf of freshly baked bread, a jar of honey, a pitcher of milk; and over the fire he hung a caldron of hot chocolate. His simple preparations were complete.\n \n When all was in readiness, he took up his vigil at the window. He was sure he would know the Master when he came. As he watched the driving sleet and snow, he thought about how cold it was outside, but how warm and joyous it would be when the Master finally came.\n \n Presently, he saw an old street sweeper pass by, blowing upon his thin and gnarled hands to keep them warm. That poor fellow! He must be half frozen. Opening the door, Father Martin called out to him, \"Come in, my friend, and get warm, and I'll give you something hot to drink.\" No further urging was needed, and the man gratefully accepted the invitation.\n \n Another hour passed by, and Father Martin then saw a poor, miserably clothed woman carrying her baby. Stung by the cold winter blast, she paused, wearily, to rest in the shelter of his doorway. Quickly, he flung open the door and said, \"Come in from the cold. My shop is warm, and you can rest.\" She replied, \"I am going to the hospital. I'm hoping that they will take me and the baby in. My husband is away at sea, and I am ill, with no other place to go.\"\n \n \"You poor child!\" cried the old man. \"You must eat something while you are getting warm. And let me get a cup of warm milk for the little one. Ah!. What a bright and cheerful little fellow he is! Why, you have no shoes on him!\"\n \n \"I cannot afford to buy him anything,\" sighed the mother.\n \n \"Then he shall have this lovely pair I finished yesterday,\" the cobbler said. And with that Martin took down from the shelf the soft, little snow-white shoes with the silver buckles he had looked at the night before, and slipped them onto the child's feet. They fit perfectly. Shortly thereafter, when mother and child had been rested and refreshed, they went their way full of gratitude for what Father Martin had done for them, and Martin returned to his vigil at the window sill.\n \n Hour after hour went by, and one by one, many other needy travelers shared the meager hospitality of the old cobbler, but the expected guest, the Master, did not appear.\n \n At last, when night had fallen, Father Martin retired to his cot with a heavy heart. \"It was only a dream,\" he sighed. \"I did hope and believe, but the Master did not come.\"\n \n Suddenly, or so it seemed to his weary eyes, the room was filled with a warm, glorious light; and to the cobbler's astonishment, there, in a vision before him, appeared the street sweeper, the sick mother and her baby, and all the people whom he had given comfort to that day. One by one, they all smiled at him and said, \"Have you not seen me? Did I not sit at your table?\" And suddenly they vanished.\n \n Then softly out of the silence and the glorious light he heard again the gentle voice that he had heard the night before, saying, \"Whoever receives one such child as this in my name receives me.\" (Matt 18:5) \"For I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave me drink; I was a stranger and you took me in. Verily I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it also to Me.\" (Matt 25:35-40). (end of story)\n \n This Christmas season, let the gifts that we give to each other not necessarily be found beneath the Christmas trees of our homes, but let them be the gifts of love and compassion that we shower on each other. For surely with these presents we honor our Lord and Savior.\n \n Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!",
