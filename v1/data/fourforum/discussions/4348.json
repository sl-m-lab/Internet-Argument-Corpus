   "The Religious Wounding of Women\n \n The western collective confirmation of God as the Father, as male, has held our imaginations hostage. Within this thwarted imagination women are alienated from the Divine realm and forced to look outside of themselves, their bodies and their nature, for salvation and validation. This perception of the Divine has disempowered women in their way of seeing themselves and in their way of being in the world.\n \n Patricia Reilly suggests that it is time to name this damaging presumption of God's maleness, and to imagine the Divine as other than the bearded father-figure in the sky.\n \n -By Patricia Reilly\n All of us were wounded in one way or another in childhood. It may have been as a result of the piercing taunts of classmates, the betrayal of our trust by a beloved teacher, humiliation at the hands of our siblings, or the severe criticisms of a parent. There is no way to escape childhood without a scrape or two no matter how loving our family.\n Those of us who grew up in dysfunctional families were more seriously injured.\n \n Our awareness of these wounds no matter their intensity comes to us through the troubling and ineffective behaviours we bring into adulthood. These may include troublesome relationships; overeating; chronic debt; or addiction to substances, sex, or work. At some point we realise that these behaviours do not support the quality of life we desire as adults, and we reach out for help to deal with them.\n \n It becomes clear to us after years of therapy appointments, religious services, Twelve Step meetings, or women's support groups that there are extremely deep wounds beneath the behaviours we talk about each week.\n \n These injuries do not respond to psychological theory, no matter how skillfully employed by our therapist; or to elaborate theologies, no matter how carefully articulated by our minister; or to the rhetoric of recovery, no matter how informative or interesting the spokesperson.\n \n Trying to deal with our ineffective behaviours without acknowledging their roots in the wounds of childhood will always prove fruitless. These behaviours are the voices of our deep injuries. Some injuries require very little attention given time and a basically supportive environment, they heal. There are other wounds, however, that reach deeper and require tender care and special attention.\n \n Religious Wounds\n \n Although women choose a variety of spiritual paths, our wounds are similar based on our birth into a society that worships a male God and prefers men. Whether the face of our childhood God was comforting or frightening, punitive or kind, the exclusive imagining of God as male has deeply wounded women.\n \n Our immersion in these images convinced us that we are excluded from the Divine, that we are inferior to men, that we are in need of a male saviour, and that to name and imagine God in any other way than he has always been known is blasphemy. The religious images of childhood burrowed away in the girl-child's heart and mind. They limited her dreams and the expression of her gifts in the world. Until this deep wounding is acknowledged and healed, we hope and pray, we make resolutions, we commit to countless diet plans, and we try the advice of one expert after another but our efforts to change bring only momentary relief. Our ineffective behaviours are the indirect way these injuries seek to get our attention. They are our clues to look beneath them. To become entirely ready to have the behaviours transformed is to plunge into the woundedness of our lives.\n \n Exclusion: No Girls Allowed\n \n As a result of our immersion in male names and images of God, we have been excluded from the Divine.\n \n God and humankind (\"mankind\") have been imagined as male. Therefore, men have been considered representative of a full and complete humanity.\n \n They are divine and their experience is normative. We are not divine and our experience is considered peripheral. Thus we have been barred from full participation in family, world, and church. . . .\n \n http://www.aislingmagazine.com/aislingmagazine/articles/TAM17/Women.html",

Islam has similar problems. \n From a cultural standpoint. so does Judaism as practiced by some of the orthodox.\n \n However, if you look at the hebrew.. the term \"Holy Spirit' that is used to describe God is in feminine form. The concept of many people of the Jewish faith is that God has both feminie and masculine aspects, because he created both MEN and WOMEN in his image (generic his). The Orthodx jews consider\n the feminine aspect of god to be the Shekhina.",

   "Um, so who was around to defend all those poor helpless females when all the males were out hunting? Or, gone for years at a time to engage in warfare? Or, these males didn't make it back from the hunt, or war, or from fishing in a craft on a lake or the ocean?\n\n Um, maybe they were hiding or um, maybe safety in numbers or um, maybe being protected by boys and old men. Um, hard to be sure.\n \n\n Or, in your perfect world with females being the docile beauties they were meant to be and the males being the brave, handsome warriors to protect their beauties that they were meant to be...\n\n To quote Ronald Reagan, \"there you go again\".

Can you say LUNCH?\n \n You have chosen to characterize me as you see fit and that's fine. You'll never know what it means to be a man any more than I can know what it is to be a woman. The difference is that I don't pretend to know and I don't create dialog for you to help justify my indignation. I do rather like your pluck and so I will endevour to school you on rational debate.",

   "Protection from \"beasts\" both four legged and two legged to be sure. Point being that females are often not capable of physically defending themselves. I freely admit that human males represent the greatest threat to human females. Have we abandoned the notion of \"good guys\" and \"bad guys\"? \n\n \n Hey we are better able now now - 911 and guns and all. Not to mention now if you hurt us - in most places there are consequences. \n \n \nOn what planet do \"broads\" get along?. Not mine. Maybe in a world without males they would since competition for male attentions seems to be the driving force behind \"cattiness\". \n\n \n Man - you must know some really annoying women. Me and my girls do not play that way. Believe it or not, there are those of us who find the idea of turning on sister for some smelly fella quite foul. And we don't do it. We know you guys are over-rated...... :p \n \n \nI accept that there will always be individuals that are not especially suited for \"traditional\" roles both male and female. You go fish, girl!\n\n \n Waiting for spring.....\n \n \nYes, family-minded men appreciate fertile women. Infertile women are also devalued by other women especially in the more \"primitive\" cultures.\n\n \n ok dokey\n \n \nPregnancy may be sucky for you but some women actually enjoy it.\n\n \n Masochists.

   "Times have indeed changed, at least in our culture. I believe that to be the impetus for the \"equality\" movement and rightly so. I still don't like the idea of a 50% female fire department. Political correctness where peoples lives are at stake is plain stupid.\n\n \n Personally I am simply for a 100% effective fire department. I am sure many women fire-fighters are excellent fire-fighters. It's a pity we are caught in a numbers game. If we don't do it - entire, capable groups get left out (face it - prejudices still exist) - and we have a less than effective team - when we do we could end up with a less than quality team because numbers had to be met.\n \n However, although I do think things are better for women now - I want to give my sisters in a history a little more credit. Women nursed and even fought in both the American Revolution and the Civil War. Women in history have led nations (Hatsepshut, Empress Wu, Queen Elizabeth, Queen Victoria, Cleopatra), been scientists (Mary Curie), writers (Mary Shelly), put themselves at risk for the right cause (Harriett Tubman). Lewis and Clarke were led by a 16 pregnant girl through the wilderness (until she gace birth and then carried the infant on her back) - Sacajewa (sp?). Women moved to the American west and started business and bought and worked property. The self-sufficient woman didn't begin with Rosie the Riveter. WWII was not the first time women were left on their own. Women in the south got a huge wake up call during the Civil War and found themselves having to run farms and care for families. I believe women have been left to make their own way since the dawn of humanity, it whatever means were available to them at the time - which frequently wasn't much - but they did it. This has simply been left out of the history books.\n \n It's incredible to think what more this world would have today had women been provided opportunity, if the world could have acknowledged all that we are indeed capable of. But at the same time for women's independence to be real, it was something we had to realize on our own. Some women still don't give themselves enough credit. All of human kind has been tied down (and remains so) due to prejudices that led to denied opportunity. Traditional roles developed because they made some amount of good sense at the time - to remain tied to them now just because they are traditional is a complete lack of sense.\n \n A fire department that is 50% or even 100% female does not bother me - as long as they are all good at what they do.",

   "Words from an every day woman in 1851 \n ________________________________________________________\n \n Sojourner Truth (1797-1883): Ain't I A Woman?\n Delivered 1851\n Women's Convention, Akron, Ohio \n \n \n Well, children, where there is so much racket there must be something out of kilter. I think that 'twixt the negroes of the South and the women at the North, all talking about rights, the white men will be in a fix pretty soon. But what's all this here talking about? \n \n That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud-puddles, or gives me any best place! And ain't I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm! I have ploughed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me! And ain't I a woman? I could work as much and eat as much as a man - when I could get it - and bear the lash as well! And ain't I a woman? I have borne thirteen children, and seen most all sold off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mother's grief, none but Jesus heard me! And ain't I a woman? \n \n Then they talk about this thing in the head; what's this they call it? [member of audience whispers, \"intellect\"] That's it, honey. What's that got to do with women's rights or negroes' rights? If my cup won't hold but a pint, and yours holds a quart, wouldn't you be mean not to let me have my little half measure full? \n \n Then that little man in black there, he says women can't have as much rights as men, 'cause Christ wasn't a woman! Where did your Christ come from? Where did your Christ come from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with Him. \n \n If the first woman God ever made was strong enough to turn the world upside down all alone, these women together ought to be able to turn it back , and get it right side up again! And now they is asking to do it, the men better let them.",
