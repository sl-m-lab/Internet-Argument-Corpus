   "An excerpt from the respected New York Times. The so-called \"newspaper of record.\" So I would take this seriously.\n ===============================\n \n Muslim Group in France Is Fertile Soil for Militancy\n By CRAIG S. SMITH\n \n Published: April 28, 2005\n \n \n ST.-DENIS, France - Raouf Ben Halima, 39, sleeps on his side, never on his stomach. He enters the bathroom leading with his left foot but puts his pants on leading with his right. Instead of using a fork when he eats, he uses his index finger, middle finger and thumb.\n \n Mr. Halima is a member of the Tablighi Jamaat, or Preaching Party, a global army of Muslim missionaries helping to expand their religion and reinforce their faith. They believe that emulating the habits of the Prophet Muhammad is the surest way to restore Islam to its intended path.\n \n So Mr. Halima and his associates shave their upper lips but let their beards grow. They wear their pants or robes above the ankle because the prophet said letting clothes drag on the ground is a sign of arrogance.\n \n \"Halfway between the knee and the ankle is best,\" Mr. Halima explains, sitting amid stacks of religious tracts in his small home.\n \n His comments, made recently to a reporter during conversations about the growth of militant Islam, offered a rare window on the beliefs of a group that is unsettling to many here. The Tablighi are one of the primary forces spreading Islamic fundamentalism in Europe today, and many young Muslim men pass through the group on the way toward an extreme, militant interpretation of the religion.\n \n Beyond that, little about the group is known.\n \n The window Mr. Halima offered was open only briefly: he spoke only about his own experience and refused to accompany a reporter to France's main Tablighi mosque for fear of being seen breaching the sect's strict rules of secrecy.\n \n European terrorism officials who follow Tablighi closely say they know many cases in which terrorists have emerged from the movement, but they say they have never been able to penetrate the group sufficiently to prove that it plays any direct role. \"It is definitely fertile ground for breeding terrorism,\" said a French intelligence official who has traced many militants' religious awakening to their membership in the movement.\n \n Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person to be charged in the United States in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks, was once a Tablighi adherent in France. Herv\u00e9 Djamel Loiseau, a young Frenchman who died fleeing the 2001 American bombardment of Tora Bora in Afghanistan was, too. Djamel Beghal, an Algerian-born Frenchman and confessed Qaeda member recently convicted in Paris for plotting to blow up the American Embassy, was a Tablighi follower in the French town of Corbeil a decade ago...\n \n (snip)\n \n He acknowledged that young men wishing to migrate from the Tablighi to more militant forms of Islam had no trouble finding their way. \"Everyone knows which mosques attract Salafists, and if you go and ask, it's easy to get into the jihadi network,\" he said...\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/28/international/europe/28tablighi.html?",

   "Well, what is so revolutionary about defiining modern terrorism as essentially if not completely an outgrowth of radical Islam?\n\n \n Because it's ignorant. It ignores the fact that terrorism is not limited to one group. Unless you want to no longer call McVeigh a terrorist or have the state department take away the title of #1 domestic terrorist group from the ELF. \n \n \nHow many Buddists, or Hindus, or Jehovah's Witnesses have been involved in terrorism or flying air bombs into packed office buildings lately. Somehow that news never reached the U.S.\n\n \n The Us is not the world. How hard it that to understand? It was Buddhists who launched a sarin attack in Japan. To say that no terrorist attacks have occured by hindus in decades of fighting between Pakistan and India is retarded. Terorism is not merely linked to the Us. Just because you don't want to admit it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. \n \n \n\n BTW, not a single one of the so-called terrorist acts you mention threaten our way of life. Not one.\n\n \n Tell that to the Oklahoma city bombing survivors and families.\n Tell that to the owners of the land and cars that the ELF torched.\n \n Huh. Guess you're wrong. I suggest you stop going to VOR's school of no-thinking. \n \n \nBut radical Muslims certainly do and it is well established that bin Laden and his fellow gangsters are after the bomb; that is the nuclear bomb and/or \"dirty bomb.\" And they'll use it too.\n\n \n Considering that you are wrong, and if you wish to include gangsters as terrorists...you'll notice that in Chicago 18 members of a crime family were arrested. Guess they won't be affecting the way of our lives anymore. Sure they will use the bomb. Doesn't mean that terrorism is now defined as nuclear bomb usage only,.",
