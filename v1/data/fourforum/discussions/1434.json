And what we sold was only 1% of what they ever got.\n\n \n We gave Saddam massive loans as well as chemical-spraying helicopters and research facilities for anthrax and botulism. We did give them weapons, in a sense. They spent the money we loaned them to research chemical warfare and to buy arms from other - might I add \"closer\" - nations. \n We supported them fully in their war against Iran.\n There's also evidence that postulates the Iranians gassed Halabja and not the Iraqis. I've got a couple of articles to support this post saved on my desktop. When I get it back I'll post them both.\n I've also seen that chart that shows America as a very meagerly contributing demographic, but I'm still wondering if there were any transactions made that were cut-out. There was that 11,000 page document that was tampered with by the U.S. officials and was reduced to 3,000 pages. I can't help but wonder what we were hiding. :|\n \n One last thing, I don't think anyone was denying Saddam's links to terrorist organizations, but he was not at all religious and warned his followers about Jihadists.

   "\n \n Most importantly of all, captured al Qaeda planner Abu Zubaydah incicates that people saying bin Laden and Hussein wouldn't work together on the grounds of the latter being a secular leader are wrong. According to him, bin Laden looked at Hussein as the enemy of my enemy is my friend.\n\n \n That's hearsay and isn't supported. In fact, Bin Laden hates Saddam Hussein not only because of religion but because of the similarities the Iraqis and Americans have in some way. Saddam is more secular, while Bin Laden is an extremist. This is why there's discrepancy between the two.\n \n \nAbdul Rahman Yasin was being harbored in Iraq. Yasin was a suspect in the 1993 WTC bombing. The Saddam regime provided him with monthly payments.\n\n \n I've never heard of this and I'm very skeptical as to it's authenticity. Sounds like right-wing propaganda. If all this is true then why did even Colin Powell say there were no connections between Saddam and al-Qaeda.\n Your side claims he was provided with money, alcohol and women while the Iraqis say he was under tight house arrest. If you can prove this exchange of money, please do so. Disclose the information right here since you seem to have it.\n Again, that is totally speculation, and until they release the papers that show the transactions then I won't believe this. It was probably because he was lured in by Yousef, was scared and fled the country. He's already apologized so he was obviously influenced badly and then felt remorse. The government was probably angry about his escape and as spite they implicated him in some money crime so they could tie al-Qaeda and Iraq together. \n \n \n \nOne of the lead hijackers, Mohammed Atta met with an Iraqi Intelligence official in Prague named Ahmed al-Ani. Although attempts to discredit this have been made, Czech officials at the cabinet level have not backed away from the claim.\n\n This is entirely untrue and total malarkey. Let me locate an article that completely disproves and debunks this \"theory\", which is all it really is. Atta was in Virginia Beach at the time of this supposed \"meeting.\"\n \n \nIn October 2001, two Iraqi defectors said that a 707 fuselage was being used to train terrorists in hijacking techniques. The US military has recovered this and a terrorist training camp, along with two other camps.\n\n There are child porn rings in underground America. Doesn't mean that the U.S. supports it, does it?\n \n \nIraqi Intelligence Chief Faruk Hijazi met with bin Laden associates on multiple occasions. Hijazi is in US custody, and confirms the meetings.\n\n \n And what was the result of this meeting other than exchange of rhetoric?\n \n \n \n1,993 memos were found detailing the assistance Iraqi Intelligence gave to various terrorist groups.\n\n \n I'm not denying their ties to certain terrorist organizations but there was no link between Iraq and al-Qaeda, sorry.\n I'm also betting that most of these supposed ties were found in Kurdish Iraq and not Saddam-controlled Iraq. \n \n Here's some articles:\n \nAn Iraqi Intelligence Memo was discovered in 1998 with bin Ladens named whited out. It described a meeting between an al Qaeda representative and regime officials. Days afterward, al Qaeda issued an edict denouncing the US for crimes against Iraq. At about the same time, al Qaeda deputy Ayman Zawahiri was payed $300,000 by Iraq.\n\n I've never heard of this. Lend me a link to a credible source and maybe I'll agree. However, there are likely many loopholes in your arguments. If the intelligence agencies and Powell have said no links have been discovered, no CONCRETE links have been discovered, then why are these genuine and so reliable? If these blatant truths were, in fact, truths and not perversions then I doubt we'd have said there was no link as of yet between the two.\n Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but you say he was paid 300,000 in 1998, right? al-Qaeda is a multi-million dollar network and was thriving greatly in 1998. They were millionaires... why would a millionaire accept a scant 300k? \n That further discredits this claim. I've also done a lot of research on this guy and I still can't find anything about this link.\n http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/oct2002/atta-o23_prn.shtml",

You said no ties, I just gave you ties, and you dismiss them with conjecture.\n\n These ties can be simply refuted because they are speculative rumors and even you can't PROVE these ties. They are rumors, nothing more. It is not a proven link until there are facts to reinforce the claim.\n \n \nI'll just use the first as my example.

You're obviously very selective about which you choose to read.hav\n I'll also bet that many al-Qaeda members also speak of the hatred between the few, while a few, certainly a minority, say they befriended one another. This is simply to mislead the U.S. officials. They have no intention of giving us any real information and have no reason to. Many of the captives have committed suicide. That's obviously proof enough that they're not very reliable.\n Their hatred towards America will not dwindle simply because they are being held captive and Bush himself has said you can't trust terrorists. I thought you were such a fervent conservative?\n \n \nAs I said, people have tried to poke holes in the claim, but Czech cabinet-level officials haven't backed away and instead say there were three meetings... and the World Socialist Web Site doesn't exactly strike me as a great source...\n\n \n No, the Czechs were the ones that denied it. There was no meeting, and the CIA has even affirmed this. Who're you going to believe now? The CIA and the Czechs, or biased radicals?\n \n This is becoming redundant and very circular.
