   "There have been some recent claims by evolutionists about abiogenesis that seem to have arisen only over the last 5 or 10 years. I think it's a subject that should be explored in a structured way in this forum. I have propositions for two formal debates here, I'll argue the affirmative on the first, and the negative on the second. They can be either/or, or I'll do them both simultaneously, or one after the other. \n \n The term \"abiogenesis\" has been around for hundreds of years, its concept has been around for thousands, all the way back to Aristotle. It is a term that refers to natural processes, a spontaneous generation of life from non-life by random, unguided processes. It is a conflictive view to any kind of purposive, supernatural creation. Yet we see this at talkorigins;\n \n \n Abiogenesis is a fact. Regardless of how you imagine it happened (note that creation is a theory of abiogenesis), it is a fact that there once was no life on earth and that now there is. Thus, even if evolution needs abiogenesis, it has it. \n\n \n CB090: Evolution without abiogenesis\n \n I don't think that anyone disagrees that there once was no life on earth and now there is. I know of no worldview that disputes that. But in my view, the rest of that paragraph is completely false. So I'll take the affirmative on this one;\n \n Resolved; Supernatural creation is in no way related to abiogenesis. One has to be true and the other has to be false. \n \n I'll take suggestions on an improvement/rewording for this resolution. My point is that creation does not harmonize with abiogenesis, it conflicts with abiogenesis. Abiogenesis in not just ANY origin of life as talkorigins asserts, it is only about a NATURAL origin of life. Evolution does not automatically have it. Creation is NOT a theory of abiogenesis. \n \n Another recent assertion, that seems to be more widely claimed than the above, is that evolution and abiogenesis are not related. It's been worded like this;\n \n Abiogenesis is not evolution, and evolution is not abiogenesis. The two concepts are unrelated.\n \n I'll do the negative on the claim that the two concepts are unrelated. \n \n For either/both, I'm thinking of our usual 5/4 post structure, with something in the neighborhood of a 72 hour time limit between posts. As always, I'll be co-operative in working out these details. As a refreshing change from the past, I would like to see some pretty tight word limits this time, to make them easy to read, and bring out some skills in concise word processing.",

   "Just so we're all clear here, you're going to redefine the word abiogenesis to mean what you want it to mean, then someone is supposed to argue that the definition you made up isn't valid?\n \n And \"Abiogenesis is not evolution, and evolution is not abiogenesis.\" is not a \"recent\" claim. I would imagine you've been told this since you began claiming they were, yet every time seems to be a surprise to you. \n \n You have yet to even attempt to show how they are the same, as you claim they are. Your best buddy Archie tried, and the best he could do was list a bunch of sites that stated that they weren't the same. I have a feeling you'll do much the same.",

   "How long and drawn out should a resolution be? How many paragraphs? Do you really think I could define it in a way that T.Q would quietly accept with no ambiguity? All the previous resolutions here have only been one or two lines. There&#8217;s nothing complicated about the definition of abiogenesis, especially to anyone who takes an interest in the creation/evolution controversy, but it would take a few paragraphs to do it. I led up to its definition in the opening post &#8211; if a legitimate poster would have asked for more detail in a civilized way, of course it wouldn&#8217;t be a problem. But since it appears that talkorigins is trying to redefine it, its definition would probably end up being a large part of the debate. The word itself is the only thing that belongs in the resolution. \n \n If the scientific community is trying to re-define the word, doesn&#8217;t it make sense for them to try to confound and confuse the words current meaning? Why do it before the debate, why not do it during the debate? \n \n ...\n \n \n Again, anyone with the slightest interest in the creation/evolution controversy knows that abiogenesis is about &#8220;primordial soup&#8221;, about conditions on a young, new earth billions of years ago, about spontaneous generation of life from non life by unguided, natural processes. It&#8217;s about the concept of things like the Miller-Urey experiment &#8211; a simple-to-complex process over long periods of time. It&#8217;s about random chemical changes, with theories about random spikes from electricity etc. &#8211; perfect natural conditions that cause life to spontaneously arise from non life. It has traditionally had nothing to do with supernatural involvement of any kind. I haven't researched it yet, but I'd bet my bottom dollar that the \"spacemen drove by and dropped off life on earth long ago\" is only a recent invention, thought up only after recent naturalistic experiments have been such a predictable failure. \n \n\n If you assume that everyone is on the same page as you, then you are bound to hit the same pitfalls you are hitting now, and the actual debate hasn't even started yet. \n \n \nI think definitions should be part of the debate, because they are a large part of it. The only hope I believe this judged debate has, is to simplify it even more. Talkorigins said &#8220;Abiogenesis is a fact&#8221;. I&#8217;ll do the negative on that resolution. Or, my resolution would be &#8220;Abiogenesis is not a fact&#8221;. Wouldn&#8217;t simplification be the best solution? \n \n\n If you try to flesh out your definitions and premises during the debate, you'll spend your whole debate doing that and never get to the actual debate. in this debate you'd spend it debating what talk origins actually said, rather than debating whether what they said was true or not. Its a waste of time arguing about a definition, or trying to come up with a definition halfway through the debate.",
