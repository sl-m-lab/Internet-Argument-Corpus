   "I went to an exhibit of the Dead Seas Scrolls last night at the Science Museum of Minnesota. It was fascinating. Lots of information and artifacts. There were exhibits about ancient Jewish culture, how the scrolls were found, how they were restored and five pieces of the scrolls themselves. The final exhibit was about the St. Johns Bible - the first illuminated bible to be produced in 500 years (and it was done so here in Minnesota!). The artistry was wonderful.\n \n Super cool exhibit.",

   "The \"Son of God\" Scroll \n \n Another fascinating scroll discovered in Cave Four known as 4Q246 refers to the hope of a future Messiah figure.
