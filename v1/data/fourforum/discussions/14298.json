   "Shotgun licence / shotgun certificate application: Your shotgun licence is not that difficult to obtain\n\n \n Oh really? Did you NOT read the requirements?\n \n \nYou will also have to give details of any convictions, however trivial they may seem to you - speeding tickets, for instance. And do be honest, because the information you give will be checked against the police computer.\n \n You will also be asked a number of medical questions - to identify conditions which could render gun handling dangerous - and provide the name of your current GP, together with permission for the police to access your medical history.\n \n You will then have to give details of where your gun is to be stored.\n \n The next important bit of the form has to filled in by a counter signatory who has known you personally for at least two years. Such a person cannot be a relative, a serving policeman or police civilian employee, or a registered firearms dealer, and according to the wording should be:\n \n \"...a Member of Parliament, Justice of the Peace, minister of religion, doctor, lawyer, established civil servant, bank officer, or person of similar standing.\"\n \n Most police forces give a sensibly liberal interpretation to 'person of similar standing', and accept most people known and respected in the community. If you have any doubt about the validity of your chosen person, just ring up the firearms department at your local police headquarters and ask.\n \n With your application you must also provide four passport-sized photographs of yourself, one of which must be signed on the back by your counter signatory. You then return the form to the police, together with the fee (\u00a350 at the time of writing).\n \n Over the next few weeks you will get a visit from the police, so it's good to be prepared and buy a gun cabinet.\n \n There are many prices and specifications, but all should conform to the accepted British Standard: BS7558:1992. Your local gun shop will help you with this.\n \n The cabinet must be firmly attached to a wall within your home, and the best place is inside a built-in cupboard. The person who calls from the police may be a serving police officer or, more likely these days, a specialist civilian employee.\n \n He or she will first go through your application form with you, and you may be asked a number of questions to further explain your written answers on the form.\n \n If asked why you wish to own a shotgun, all you need say is you wish to take part in shooting sports. The examining officer may also wish to look at the general security of your home, particularly if you live in a high-crime area.\n \n Don't worry - you will not be required to turn your home into Fort Knox. Usually the officer's advice will be well worth having to safeguard other valuable property as well as your gun.\n \n After that, it should be just a matter of waiting for your certificate to arrive in the post.\n\n \n Seems pretty hard to me.

Who does that?\n\n \n Texas Tower Shootings: 1966\n \n \nEventually, the shootings caused panic as news spread and, after the situation was understood, all active police officers in Austin were ordered to the campus. Other off-duty officers, Travis County Sheriff's deputies, and Texas Department of Public Safety troopers also converged on the area to assist.\n \n Once Whitman began facing return gunfire from the authorities and civilians who had brought out their personal firearms to assist police, he used the waterspouts on each side of the tower as gun ports, allowing him to continue shooting largely protected from the gunfire below but also greatly limiting his range of targets. Ramiro Martinez, an officer who confronted Whitman, later stated in his book that the civilian shooters should be credited, as they made it difficult for Whitman to take careful aim without being hit.[20] Police lieutenant and sharpshooter Marion Lee reported from a small airplane that there was only one sniper firing from the parapet. The plane circled the tower, trying to get a shot at Whitman, but turbulence shook the plane too badly for him to get Whitman in his sight. As the airplane took fire, Lee asked the pilot, Jim Boutwell, to back away, but \"stay close enough to offer him a target and keep him worried.\" The airplane, which was hit by Whitman's rifle fire, continued to circle the tower from a safe distance until the end of the incident.\n",

   "British Leader Rejects Rush to Tighten Gun Laws After Rampage - NYTimes.com\n \n \nLONDON - Prime Minister David Cameron said Thursday that Britain \"should not leap to knee-jerk conclusions\" about the need for tougher gun laws in the wake of the shooting rampage in northwestern England on Wednesday that left 13 people dead, including the gunman. \n \n Mr. Cameron spoke at a news conference as the police released new details about how the gunman, Derrick Bird, 52, a taxi driver, left a trail of death with few precedents in Britain's modern history through the western edge of the Lake District, one of the country's most celebrated scenic spots.\n \n Mr. Cameron said the government would do everything it could to \"mend the hurt\" caused by the shootings. But while laws and practices involved in gun ownership will be reviewed, he said, there is not always \"an instant legislative or regulatory answer.\"\n \n \"Of course we should look at this issue, but we should not leap to knee-jerk conclusions on what should be done on the regulatory front,\" he said. \"We do have some of the toughest legislation in the world.\" He added, \"You can't legislate to stop a switch flicking in someone's head and this sort of dreadful action taking place.\"\n \n Police commanders in Cumbria, the county where the killings occurred, said Thursday that they had recovered two weapons used in the shootings - a shotgun and a .22-caliber rifle with a sniper scope - and that Mr. Bird had valid gun licenses for both.\n \n Friends of Mr. Bird said he had owned the weapons for at least 20 years and had inherited them from his father.\n \n Although Mr. Bird had a criminal record for theft from the 1990s, the police said, it was not considered serious enough to fall under statutory provisions that bar more serious criminal offenders from having licensed guns.\n \n For years, Britain has been keen to compare its relatively modest record of gun crime with the much higher incidence of firearms killings in United States; official figures show that guns are used in about 21,000 crimes a year here, and that, in recent years, killings with firearms each year have rarely reached 100, and often fewer than 50.\n \n Against that background, the episode on Wednesday quickly developed into a national trauma, with newspapers and broadcast airwaves filled with agonized debate about what motivated the killer and how the carnage might have been prevented.\n \n News reports that were widely circulated in Britain on Thursday, including one in The Daily Telegraph, quoted friends of Mr. Bird, a divorced father of two, as saying they thought the killings might have been set off by a family dispute over a will, possibly that of Mr. Bird's 90-year-old mother, Mary, with whom he had lived in recent years.\n \n On Thursday, police investigators would not comment on a motive for the killings, other than referring to \"a mixture of grudge, and random.\" They said the first victims, near Mr. Bird's village, Rowrah, included his twin brother, David, a mechanic; the Bird family's lawyer, Kevin Commons, 60; and two taxi drivers he knew well in Whitehaven, the seaside town where he worked.\n \n Victims who were apparently killed at random, in towns and villages to the south and east of Whitehaven, included a middle-age woman returning from shopping to the home where she cared for a severely disabled adult daughter; a man on his way to a betting shop; a former professional rugby player working on his uncle's farm; an elderly woman known with her twin as the bird ladies for their work to save pigeons endangered by a nearby nuclear plant; and a retired labor organizer from the plant who was out on a bicycle.\n \n Switching from main roads to country lanes as police helicopters tried to track him down, the killer drove nearly 40 miles before crashing his car, fleeing on foot and shooting himself in a woodland that friends said was one of his favorite places. The police said that in addition to the 12 people he killed, 11 others were wounded. Eight remained hospitalized on Thursday.\n \n After two previous mass killings - one in the southern English town of Hungerford in 1987 that killed 16 people, and another in the Scottish town of Dunblane in 1996 that killed 16 children and a teacher - Britain's gun laws were radically overhauled. Officials have claimed that Britain has some of the world's toughest legal curbs on the ownership of shotguns, rifles and handguns, with such tight restrictions that members of the Olympic pistol-shooting team have been barred from training in England, Scotland or Wales.\n \n Still, many shotguns and rifles remain licensed, mainly to people who can show that they have valid sporting or work-related reasons for owning them. Current figures show that the total number of licensed firearms includes 1.3 million shotguns and 435,000 rifles and high-powered air guns. Since 1997, handguns have been almost completely banned from private ownership.\n \n Those who argue that Britain's gun laws are already tough enough - many of them from the rural hunting communities that account for a great majority of shotgun and rifle permits - have focused on the fact that Mr. Bird had licenses for his weapons, and had passed the police and medical checks, as well as the requirement for character references, that are needed to obtain licenses. Their argument, with which Mr. Cameron appeared to signal some sympathy, has been that no system of gun licensing, however rigid, will stop an otherwise law-abiding person who experiences some kind of mental or nervous breakdown.\n\n \n Nice to see there's a little common sense happening in the UK.",

   "Top 10 Most Dangerous Jobs\n \n Although law enforcement and fireman tend to get all the love from Hollywood, these industries are not nearly as dangerous as they seem on the silver screen. In fact, many dangerous jobs belong to industries that seem - at least on the surface - tame. The following is a list of the ten most dangerous jobs based on statistics compiled by the United States Bureau of Labor. \n \n 1. Fisherman. (118 deaths per 100,000) Fishermen endure storms, fog, wind, and hazardous working conditions, which constantly put them at risk of drowning. And if fisherman suffer serious injuries while at sea - such as injury, illness, or hypothermia - medical help isn't quickly accessible. \n \n 2. Military Serviceman. (111 deaths per 100,000) Technically, the Bureau of Labor does not report statistics on military fatalities, but given the public record they are easy to deduce. And while potentially dangerous under any circumstances, military service has been especially dangerous in recent years due to rising conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq. \n \n 3. Logging and Timber Workers. (93 deaths per 100,000)The duties of logging and timber workers include cutting down and transporting trees. As such, the nature of their work puts them at constant risk of being killed by heavy, falling objects. Logging and timber workers also are at risk because they often work on steep hills and in hazardous weather. \n \n 4. Aircraft Pilots. (67 deaths per 100,000) This category includes flight engineers and pilots of both commercial and smaller aircraft including crop dusters and air taxis. Naturally, the primary dangers of flying relate to engine failure, which may lead to crashing. \n \n 5. Structural Iron and Steel Workers. (56 deaths per 100,000) These workers climb dozens of stories to lay the iron and steel beams that form buildings, bridges, and other structures. Despite strapping on harnesses and other safety gear, structural iron and steel workers face a high risk of fatal injuries from falls, not to mention the many injuries they receive from tools. \n \n 6. Refuse and Recyclable Material Collectors. (44 deaths per 100,000) Although falling into the garbage trucks may result in injury - and often does - the primary cause of death for refuse collectors is being hit by impatient motorists who try to pass garbage trucks at inopportune times. \n \n 7. Farmers and Ranchers. (41 deaths per 100,000) While often perceived as a peaceful existence, farming and ranching actually presents great danger, mostly in the form of tractors and heavy machinery. In fact, non-highway vehicle accidents account for most of the casualties among farmers and ranchers. \n \n 8. Electrical Power Installers and Repairers. (33 deaths per 100,000) Power line installers and repairers climb poles and towers to get - and keep - electricity up and running. Power lines are typically high off the ground, so workers are at high risk of injury due to falls. Plus, these workers are often at risk of electrocution from contact with the high-voltage power lines. \n \n 9. Truck Drivers. (29 deaths per 100,000) Driving is perhaps the most dangerous activity people do, and the danger is only compounded for those who do it professionally. Every day, truck drivers face collisions, overturning, and jackknifing, all of which are more likely and more frequent given their large and clumsy vehicles. \n \n 10. Construction Workers. (23 deaths per 100,000) Construction workers perform a wide range of potentially hazardous tasks. They work with heavy objects, great heights, and bad weather. Some jobs expose workers to harmful materials such as chemicals, noise, and dangerous machinery, all of which contribute to injuries and death. \n \n To conclude, it should be kept in mind that \"most dangerous\" is a relative term. Granted, the occupations above have the highest casualty rates of any occupations in the United States; still, only two - fishing and military service - are above 1 per cent, and then just barely. What this means is that the likelihood of death in even the most dangerous industries is relatively small and should be kept in perspective when making decisions about potential careers",

   "Cameron: don't &lsquo;leap to conclusions&rsquo; on firearms - Times Online\n \n \nAs he returned from Cumbria on Friday, David Cameron, the prime minister, acknowledged public concern over firearms following the shootings by Derrick Bird last week.\n \n In an interview with The Sunday Times, Cameron said: \"People will ask a lot of questions about gun control, mental health, criminal records, number of weapons. All completely appropriate questions that must be answered.\"\n \n He added, however: \"Generally we do have very strong gun control. I don't think we should leap to conclusions. Going [to Cumbria] brought home to me how you do have to wait for all the detail to emerge to fully understand what happened.\"\n \n Theresa May, the home secretary, also kept the government's options open on whether there should be a review of gun ownership rules.\n \n Although Britain's firearms laws are regarded as some of the toughest in the world, 600,000 citizens legally own a shotgun and more than 100,000 own other firearms.\n \n Gun violence, however, remains relatively rare, with 39 fatal shootings in the UK in 2008-9, compared with 9,484 in the US in 2008.\n \n Bird used two weapons in the shootings: a shotgun and a .22 rifle, both of which were legally owned. He acquired a shotgun licence in 1995 and renewed it every five years. His fitness to possess guns was last assessed in 2007 when he was granted a licence for the rifle.\n \n The licence application forms for firearms and shotguns ask for personal details and two referees, who must be people of good standing. Applicants are asked to volunteer information on whether they suffer from mental illnesses or have problems with alcohol. They have to give written permission for the police to make inquiries with their GP.\n \n The police rarely seek such information unless the applicant has mentioned something of concern on their form. The Home Office guidance says such approaches \"should not be made as a matter of routine\".\n \n If concerns are found, the law gives broad grounds for turning down a licence application: the 1968 Firearms Act prohibits people with \"intemperate habits or unsound mind\" from possessing a gun.\n \n People who have been sentenced to more than three years in prison are also prohibited from owning a gun. Those sentenced to between three months and three years have to wait for five years from the date of their release before they can apply for a licence.\n \n Bird had been given a suspended 12-month sentence in 1990 for theft and would have been obliged to disclose this in his applications for the guns.\n \n The police could have blocked his application if they believed the offence made him unsafe with a gun. However, guidelines from the Association of Chief Police Officers cite the 1989 case of Spencer-Stewart vs Chief Constable of Kent, in which a judge ruled that a man with a conviction for handling stolen goods posed no risk as an owner of a firearm.\n \n All applicants are interviewed at home by the police, partly to ensure they have a secure place to store a gun. At present officers are not obliged to interview relations, neighbours or friends, which in the case of Bird might have revealed serious concerns.\n",

   "I am neither against Our U.K. friends being partisan nor am I against us Americans being the same. As I said, I have Infinity Less than Zero to say about which laws you choose for your country. \n \n \nI don't give a XXXX about your constitution, some of the ideas in it are great, some of them are atrocious ...... it's no more valuable than any other bit of law. It's also worth noting that most of the bill of rights is lifted wholesale from the English bill of rights a century previously. Astonishingly, we decided that some of the rights weren't relevant in a modern society, and private ownership of weapons is one of them.\n\n Well! I guess we have been told off, yet again! emoticon_smile Good for you! This does not change what I have said above! emoticon_smile \n \n But here is what I object to.\n   An editorial against our ideology? \n One of the greater complaints about the left in America is that it demonizes and criminalizes values and our way of life. It insults and attacks by denigrating what we stand for as if it were wrong. It is not wrong. The very concept of being partisan for our values system is attacked.... as if socialistic liberals themselves aren't partisan against the interests of the United States. \n \n I am partisan. Lady Liberty is partisan. We are for independence from our very own public servants. How's that?\n \n ....... \n \n The consistent problem with such op-ed pieces is that they outright oppose the American ideology. \n \n Whoever said that ideology is bad was trying to disarm you in more ways than one, primarily your resolve and spirit. Ideology is not a bad thing, it is our primary values system of integrity, good faith, and fair play. Our ideology is one of independence and sovereignty, and trying to discourage these is very hard to hide. It is to say that you have the right to believe that no one else has a right to believe anything. Leftism undermines America by intimidation this way.\n\n \n Are you trying to change our laws Jo? Were you suggesting that our Rights were not given by GOD, but instead are given to us by our Government and therefore can be taken away from us when they bother your sensibilities? \n \n We have a word in our Justice system for those who do not obey the laws. They are called Criminals. If you are in our Government, or if you live in another country, and you HATE the recognized Rights that our Constitution protects, you don't have the Right to just ignore them and violate them! If you do, what is that justice word again, oh yeah. YOU ARE THE CRIMINAL! A law breaker.\n \n Our English cousins have either decided for themselves, or more likely had it decided for them, that Personal Liberty was not given by God, but was instead given to them by men. However, our whole Constitution is written by this very principle! =< This is OUR country, and those in government work for the ONLY Owners of this country. We the People! \n \n If governments can't obey the Supreme Law of the Land, our Constitution, then they are ZERO better than any other criminal, and we have anarchy! \n \n All we ask is for everyone to obey the law! Citizens, law enforcement and our governing bodies. You all work for us taking an oath to defend and preserve our Constitution and our Rule of Law. \n \n If you decide that you don't like what they currently are, you want to change them, then you can try to change them. \n   Article 5 - Amendment \n The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.\n\n But there again, the first 10 are considered Fundamental, and First Rights. Can you amend away the first Amendment? Or would one have to start the country all over, starting from fresh? \n \n Found at our National Archives.   The Bill Of Rights ~ The First Ten Amendments to the Constitution \n Alexander Hamilton 1775\n \n The Sacred Rights of Mankind are not to be rummaged for among old parchment,. or musty records. They are written with a sun beam in whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself, and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power. \n\n \n Found at the Obama Government website. Rights and Responsibilities  \n Fundamental Rights\n \n This relationship of citizen and state is fundamental to democracy. In the words of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776:\n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\n \n More specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly, and the right to equal protection before the law. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy, but it does constitute a set of the irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold. Since they exist independently of government, in Jefferson's view, these rights cannot be legislated away, nor should they be subject to the whim of an electoral majority.\n\n So the question is this. Would you like to be a Patriot, or an anarchist.",

Astonishingly, we decided that some of the rights weren't relevant in a modern society, and private ownership of weapons is one of them.\nActually the majority of the Bill of Rights were a result of what England was doing to the colonies. Some of the ones related to treatment of criminals came from English Common Law but that's about it. This is not to say the English Bill of Rights did not inspire the US Bill of Rights but a lot of things inspired the US bill of rights including, but not limited to, the Magna Carta, English Common Law, the DOI (which was influenced by many things), old Roman empire laws/text, various states \"bill of rights\"/constitutions, etc. \n \n You then mention the 3/5ths of a person...which was oddly enough put in by anti-slavery folks because the slave holders originally wanted slaves to be a full person so they get more representation in congress. The 3/5ths actually limited the power of slave holders...so basically it was better than the alternative. Moreover, this was removed! Finally, the US Constitution is by far the greatest law ever written to date and is responsible for why the US is so different from other countries today (for better or worse). Take this in contrast to the EU constitution which is absolutely worthless. Clearly a page and a half is about the limit in length for preserving freedom. \n \n Most importantly, this document is still relevant to this day including the 2nd amendment. The government is as powerful as the people let them to be and with no way to stop the government they can get rather powerful.

   "I would like to add to what Steeeeve said. \n \n Natural rights are those that come from something that can be found in Nature. In other words, God implanted. Every higher organism has implanted in them the instinct of Fight or Flight. \n \n Hence the Natural Right of Self-defense. \n \n That not only apples to personal self-defense, but also to defense against governments, remembering that Our Founding Fathers first fought the most powerful army the world had even known in order to secure those freedoms. \n \n All to often rogue governments, or oppressive government, win just because they are so much more powerful then the people, and the people cannot defend themselves from a usurping government. \n \n That was something our Founders sought thwart. They set up a system of Checks and Balances, with the three beaches of government serving as a Constitutional check against the others, with the Armed Citizen, (the only owners of this country) serving as a final check on all.\n \n   FEDERALIST No. 28 HAMILTON \n If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that \n  original right of self-defense \n which is paramount to all positive forms of government, and which against the usurpations of the national rulers, may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state. \n In a single state, if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers, the different parcels, subdivisions, or districts of which it consists, having no distinct government in each, can take no regular measures for defense.   The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, without system, without resource; except in their courage and despair.  The usurpers, clothed with the forms of legal authority, can too often crush the opposition in embryo.\n \n The obstacles to usurpation and the facilities of resistance increase with the increased extent of the state, provided the citizens understand their rights and are disposed to defend them. The natural strength of the people in a large community, in proportion to the artificial strength of the government, is greater than in a small, and of course more competent to a struggle with the attempts of the government to establish a tyranny. \n\n Now it is often said that we could not win against the U.S. Army, but that is the reason of the Posse Comitatus act. Were such a unthinkable occurrence ever the case, providing that it be a just cause, the U.S. Citizens in the Army likely would not chose to fight their very one countrymen. If it not be just, then they likely would. \n \n   What the Framers said about our Second Amendment -- Rights to Keep and Bear Arms \nThat the said Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the press or the rights of conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms ... \" -- Samuel Adams, Debates and Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, at 86-87 (Pierce & Hale, eds., Boston, 1850)\n \n \"Who are the militia? Are they not ourselves? Is it feared, then, that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom. Congress have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords, and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birthright of an American...[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments, but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people.\" --Tenche Coxe, The Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.\n \n \"Whereas, to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them; nor does it follow from this, that all promiscuously must go into actual service on every occasion. The mind that aims at a select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle; and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it, whenever they can prevail, no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it.\" --Richard Henry Lee, The Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.\n \n",

   "Why looka here, somebody else saw Jo coming:\n Gun Control: The Ultimate Human Rights Violation - HUMAN EVENTS\n \n \n\n Lucid students of the political sphere have certainly noticed that liberals are now using the phrase \"human rights\" even more than they once used their old standby, \"civil liberties.\" Of course they rarely define human rights, and even when they try, the definition varies depending on the goal of the person that's using the phrase. \n \n But this doesn't stop them from having international conferences on human rights, dumping money into organizations like Human Rights Watch, and allowing surviving members of the Woodstock crowd to charge America's military with violating human rights while simultaneously giving Iran a seat on the U.N.'s Women's Rights Commission.\n \n Perhaps the two clearest threads in all the human rights jargon are the focus on international law coupled with a potent strain of anti-Americanism. This is a combination that can be deadly when accurately aimed at national sovereignty or individual rights.\n \n The most telling aspect of the left's obsession with human rights is not so much what its proponents claim to defend but what they would be happy to sacrifice. And one thing all human rights activists are perpetually ready to jettison is the right Americans enjoy in keeping and bearing arms.\n\n \n \n\n If you ever doubt the degree to which private gun ownership and the freedom to use those guns for self-defense upholds our humanness, just head on down to El Paso, Tex., where the murder rate is around 23 victims annually. Then lock up your gun in the United States and cross the border into Juarez, Mexico, where the natural right to keep and bear arms has long been suppressed and where the murder rate, at 2,500 to 3,000 annually, is startling.\n \n Once you get to Juarez, it won't be long till you feel like the woman who sat in her apartment staring at the door, hoping the lock would hold up under pressure because it was the only line of defense she had against her assailant.\n \n Gun control could just be the ultimate human rights violation. \n \n And if we ever give up our guns in this great nation, we will ultimately give up our humanity.\n\n \n HUMAN EVENTS columnist A.W.R. Hawkins holds a Ph.D. in U.S. Military History from Texas Tech University. He will be a Visiting Fellow at the Russell Kirk Center for Cultural Renewal during the summer of 2010.",

   "Gun laws don't need reforming\n \n \nCliff Brookes, a registered firearms dealer from Ightham, explains his view on gun law in the wake of the Cumbrian tragedy\n \n The dreadful events in Cumbria last week have led to demands from some quarters for yet another tightening-up of the gun laws in this country.\n \n Fortunately the powers-that-be seem to be resisting immediate legislation, and for the time being this standpoint is holding sway.\n \n It is difficult to see what more could be done to control the possession of firearms here.\n \n Hungerford and Dunblane brought about stringent measures on gun control which appear to have achieved little more than to penalise owners of legally-held rifles and guns.\n \n The most glaring anomaly is that after Dunblane the possession of handguns was prohibited in this country at great expense to the public purse, and yet there are now many more illegally-held handguns in the land than ever there were before.\n \n There are other examples of this failure, concerning replica, deactivated and reactivated weapons. We now have arguably the strictest firearms laws in the world, with the exception of Japan.\n \n There is a relatively high number of gun-owners in our part of the world, and there are a dozen or more clay shooting grounds within a half-hour drive of Sevenoaks, plus many private clubs.\n \n Add to this a good handful of rifle clubs, and it is not difficult to see that shooting in our semi-rural area is a very popular sport indeed.\n \n Shooting is a legitimate sport and pastime, and several local schools run thriving shooting activities.\n \n Clay pigeon shooting is by far the most popular branch and is easily accessible once the formalities have been completed for the acquisition of a shotgun certificate.\n \n There are several well-known formal game shoots in our vicinity.\n \n Again, it is hard to see how the area of licensing could be made more stringent without virtually banning the sport.\n \n The police firearms departments do a good job, but are seriously under-resourced, and would struggle to implement further investigative work around applications and renewals.\n \n Firearms, as opposed to shotguns, present a different legislative problem.\n \n Apart from target shooting under the control of clubs, rifles are widely used for vermin control, and even the smallest calibres are lethal.\n \n There are specific characteristics of firearms which make it necessary for owners to submit to more rigorous examination. These include the range and accuracy of these weapons and competence in handling.\n \n My view is that the gun laws are strict enough.\n \n The previous Government did little to address the illegal possession of firearms, which is by far the biggest problem.\n \n The Controls on Firearms Consultation Paper issued by the then-Home Secretary David Blunkett in May 2004 purported to address gun crime.\n \n In fact there was no thrust at all against illegal possession, but rather a proposal to tighten further the already-satisfactory regulations regarding legitimate possession and use.\n \n Suggestions for dealing with imitation firearms were rejected as unenforceable.\n \n We were all appalled by the Cumbria shootings and feel deep sympathy to those affected. There is also a great sense of helplessness because Derrick Bird is dead and there is nobody left to punish for the crimes committed.\n \n The temptation is to turn against the shooting community in general, especially as the firearms used were legally-held, but this should be resisted.\n \n David Cameron has talked of the impossibility to legislate for the flick of a switch in somebody's mind, and this is eminently sensible.\n \n If there is a current failing it lies in the monitoring of holders of firearms.\n \n Renewal of certificates takes place every five years. During this time there is no requirement for any contact between the certificate-holder and the police firearms department, other than the reporting in writing of firearms sales and purchases.\n \n This is an area which would perhaps benefit from attention, but it will need substantial resources.\n",
