Maybe gays should make up a new word that describes loving relationships between two WHOLE PEOPLE, regardless of gender, and leave the term used to exalt the mere coming together of different sexual organs--something even lower lifeforms are capable of--to the heteros.\n\n \n Why not; every time you don't like how your community is perceived you have redefined it by creating new words to describe yourselves. Actually changing has never been a consideration for you, but your community has been very creative in finding new ways of repackaging yourselves and to market yourselves. Let's take the word \"gay\" for example. That was originally thought to have been created as a code word, but co-opted from the original usage and meaning of the word. So just redefine what marriage is and means to fit your own personal definition. It worked before, maybe it will work with marriage too. \n \n I remember in the 70s how the term pro-abortion came off as too harsh and was equated by the public to mean pro murder of babies, the pro abortion movement changed the popular term of referring to themselves as pro-choice. This had a positive conotation to it and didn't seem so harsh to the public as it didn't even focus on the act of killing babies, but focussed on the pro women issue of controlling their own bodies. Pretty slick huh?\n \n Another popular term the gay community has co-opted is this fallacious push for equality as if they are struggling for freedom as the Slaves did. What gays consider a struggle for equality is an insult to the struggles blacks suffered through at every level of rationality as slaves who were nothing more than chattle, yet you continue to insist that you are victims in spite of special hate crimes legislation that protects you from any type of physical abuse, legally speaking. Here's an exerpt from the link explaining the origins of how the word gay was co-opted by the homosexual community in order to make themselves appear more socially friendly to the Society they are attempting to remake in their image.\n According to the Dictionary of American Slang, the word gay was used as an adjective to describe homosexuals by 1920. In Noel Erskine's 1933 Dictionary of Underworld & Prison Slang, the term \"gay cat\" applied to a younger homosexual partner. Note that the word was still used in its adjective form. This is partly a conservative function of language but it's also probable that because it was only used by gays about other gays there was no need to refer to a person by a specific noun. Nouns are necessary for pejorative use (XXXXX, ###, XXXX etc.). It's far less effective to yell \"Hey, you gay man!\" out of a car window. \n \n Gay continued to be used self-referentially by homosexuals throughout most of the fifties and sixties, although the term was also used by those sympathetic to homosexuals. The reason why nobody else picked up on it was because people unsympathetic to gays (probably a majority) had other perfectly good words for them, nearly all of them pejorative. The neutral term, homosexual, used by most media, was considered too formal for casual use. \n \n Gay, as in homosexual, broke into the common vernacular in the late sixties and early seventies, driven by a shift in the social/political zeitgeist when gays and other heretofore marginalized groups discovered the power of self-identity. The gay rights movement which percolated during the sixties, was galvanized by the Stonewall rebellion of 1969 (when groups of gay men rioted after a bathhouse crackdown by New York city police). In its aftermath, gay activists sought a universal, non-pejorative word, that could serve as an identifier. \"Homosexual\" was out because it had been medicalized (homosexuality was considered a mental illness until the 1970s). For a while a there was a movement to insinuate the term \"homophile\", into the general lexicon. The term wasn't quite right, however. For one thing, it was technically wrong. It actually meant same-loving. The accurate term would have been androphile. \n \n But the biggest problem with homophile was its artifice. It just didn't catch on. This was largely because gays had a perfectly good word right under their noses. Usage of gay took off in the mainstream because it was already the default word in use in the gay community. It also took off because it fitted so well. The word in its original meaning evoked impressions of the very things we associate with homosexuals: style, wit, frivolity, good times etc. And by this time the word, in its original meaning, had fallen out of use. There was no competition. The new meaning of gay slipped in pretty much without resistance at a time when gays were coming out of the closet and making their presence felt like never before. \n \n What is interesting, is that in the 40 years since the word came into generalized use, it has never developed into a pejorative. True, it has taken on the meaning of trashy in terms of style, as in \"Oh, that handbag is so gay.\" But nobody yells \"gay\" as an epithet out of a car window the way that I've heard people use other non-pejorative inventions. \n \n Partly this is to the result of a seismic shift in attitude towards all things gay. People like gays now. There are gays in movies, on television. There are gay clubs in high school. Gays come out of the closet now and nobody cares. The word has no negative association because the association is no longer negative. But some of this has to do with the word itself. It's just so damned positive. It means happy for godsakes. \n \n It's worth noting that a new movement is brewing to embrace former pejoratives such as \"XXXXX\" and even \"XXXXXX\", the way black Americans have reclaimed \"nigga\". The use of these words is political. It's felt that they have more power. Hence XXXXX as Folk. Will the word gay end up being swept into the semantic dustbin? Possibly, but I doubt it. Now that gays have found the perfect word, they're not going to give it up, no matter how much my mother wishes they would.\n http://www.altpenis.com/penis_news/gay.shtml",

Even today, phrases like \"that's so gay\" utilize the historically derogatory use of the word \"gay\".\n Sexualization\n The word started to acquire sexual connotations in the late 17th century, being used with meaning \"addicted to pleasures and dissipations\". This was by extension from the primary meaning of \"carefree\": implying \"uninhibited by moral constraints\". By the late nineteenth century the term \"gay life\" was a well-established euphemism for prostitution and other forms of extramarital sexual behavior that were perceived as immoral.\n \n The use of gay to mean \"homosexual\" was in origin merely an extension of the word's sexualised connotation of \"carefree and uninhibited\", which implied a willingness to disregard conventional or respectable sexual mores. Such usage is documented as early as the 1920s. It was initially more commonly used to imply heterosexually unconstrained lifestyles, as for example in the once-common phrase \"gay Lothario\",[4] or in the title of the book and film The Gay Falcon (1941), which concerns a womanizing detective whose first name is \"Gay\".http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay\n \n Archie, if you truly had any interest in honesty, you wouldn't take it upon yourselves to just make up junk and pretend it's truth.\n You would LOOK for the history of things, instead of making it up.\n \n \n The other thing I can't help but note is Archie's approach.\n He doesn't even try to deny that his side is doing what was discussed in the original post.\n He doesn't even try to refute the fact that it IS a logical fallacy.\n \n Instead, he tries to obfuscate the issue by claiming gays are doing it...\n He has COMPLETELY side-stepped the point of this thread, and is now just spewing out bible quotes which have no relevance to the actual point of this thread.",

The reason for that is that you can't even see the the issue of homosexuality is a moral issue.

Can you now by some divine ability judge the depths of peoples love in their hearts for one another? \n \n How am I issuing forth some rebellion against god?

Is it strong? Does she share the same faith as you? Do you both love each other? Do you lust after her like an object?\n You see what I'm getting at? I'm questioning your relationship with someone and invading your personal life and putting some negative stigmatism on it. Some spin that it's wrong. This is the same spin that homophobes and narrow minded people choose to think and contrive.\n \n You can quote the bible all you want, you can bold scripture but once again it comes down to point of view but even deeper even deeper is that you are so blinded by religion so blinded by the trees in your life you cant see the forest. You cant see its not all about your religion your god or your way of thinking. There are others who have diffferent views and wont agree with your thinking.

The same God that created Adam, created Eve. All of the female characteristics and traits that women possess came from the same God that Created men and the characteristics and traits that we possess. So, although we have differing and unique abilities as men and women, He created us to perfectly compliment each other when we come together. Isn't it interesting that it was God who said this: Gen 2:24 For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.\n \n This explains why a well balanced relationship is equal and a wise man respects and seeks his wife's wisdom FIRST when making decisions that affect the family. The great misconception and argument made by anti-christians that christianity is chauvinistic, is because God holds the man responsible for the welfare of his family so when a final decision needs to be made, the man must make it as he will ultimately be held accountable for it by God. This is why, although you hear this complaint and accusation made by atheists on forums like this, you never hear christian women complaining about being abused by their born again husbands or being treated like so much mindless chattel with no say at all in family matters. \n \n Believing men trust and depend on their wives as living conduits to Gods will and wisdom.

   "I only have one take on it. The same God that created Adam, created Eve. \n\n As did he create all animals, which (according to you) are to be subjugated ('ruled over', to be more precise).\n \n \nAll of the female characteristics and traits that women possess came from the same God that Created men and the characteristics and traits that we possess. So, although we have differing and unique abilities as men and women,\n\n I refer you to recent studies about brain patterns of homosexuals being hugely similar to those of the opposite sex. Is homosexuality still 'unnatural'?\n Besides, where does it say 'come, we shall make woman in our image'? The Genesis you've quoted earlier states \"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.\" That seems to differentiate fairly implicitly that Woman is not made in the image of God.\n \n \n \n He created us to perfectly compliment each other when we come together. Isn't it interesting that it was God who said this: Gen 2:24 For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.\nSurely this is to do with sex? Or, as you would have it, consecration of marriage? \n \n \nThis explains why a well balanced relationship is equal and a wise man respects and seeks his wife's wisdom FIRST when making decisions that affect the family.

The man is responsible for the welfare of the family, to say \"but I listen to my wife before making the decisions that affect her\" is irrelevant. This places the male-to-female role in the same bracket as the adult-to-child role.\n \n \nBelieving men trust and depend on their wives as living conduits to Gods will and wisdom.
