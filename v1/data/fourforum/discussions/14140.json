   "For CryEye, the man is a millionaire, already. What does he pull in each year, $18 mill?\n \n He gave $23,000 to West Virginia Republicans 2002-2004. No one's going to put that guy in prison.\n \n He's got a West Virginia Supreme Court Justice bought and paid for:\n \nPhotographs of Blankenship vacationing on the French Riviera with West Virginia Supreme Court Justice Spike Maynard, while Massey had a case pending before that court, have appeared in the New York Times. On Feb. 14, 2009, Blankenship told the New York Times, \"I've been around West Virginia long enough to know that politicians don't stay bought, particularly ones that are going to be in office for 12 years...So I would never go out and spend money to try to gain favor with a politician. Eliminating a bad politician makes sense. Electing somebody hoping he's going to be in your favor doesn't make any sense at all.\"\n \n In 2004, Blankenship contributed $3 million to the \"And For The Sake of the Kids\" PAC, campaigning against the re-election of West Virginia Supreme Court Justice Warren McGraw. Brent Benjamin would go on to defeat McGraw in the general election. Speaking about the election, Blankenship said, \"I helped defeat a judge who had released a pedophile to work in a local school, who had driven doctors out of state, and who had cost workers their jobs for thirty plus years. I think this effort helped unchain West Virginia's economy and benefited working families.\" However, USA Today called Blankenship's ads \"venomous.\" According to a USA Today editorial dated March 3, 2009, Blankenship \"has vividly illustrated how big money corrupts judicial elections. It puts justice up for sale to the highest bidder.\"\n\n Don Blankenship - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Ain't nobody can touch Don Blankenship, CEO of Massey Energy! He's the Great Untouchable 'cuz he's so rich and owns so many judges.\n \n So, 29 insignificant little miners died. So, their families suffer. So what?\n \n You ain't supposed to mess with millionaires and you ain't supposed to get in the way of their making more money.",
