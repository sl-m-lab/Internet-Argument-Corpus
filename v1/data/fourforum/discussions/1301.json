   "Uhhh how politically correct does this country have to be? I mean seriously, read this article posted on CNN.com.\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/ptech/11/26/master.term.reut/index.html\n \n I am a computer geek and use the term Master and Slave everyday to discuss hard drive settings. Personally I cannot figure out in what type of mind these labels to essentially inanimate objects can be offensive. This just blows my mind. I think this is well beyond the line of where PC correctness should be. How many of you agree?",
