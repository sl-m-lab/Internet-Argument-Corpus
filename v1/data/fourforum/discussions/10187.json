   "Universities have undergone changes in the last 50 years, and not all of them have been simple updates to keep up with changing, more modern times. From being \"dedicated to the disinterested pursuit of knowledge\" in the first half of the 20th century, the past few decades have seen curriculums progressively change, modifying pursuits that are purely academic, and adopting agendas concerning ideological thinking - things like social justice, American foreign policy, religion, etc. Examples and details of this fact are well documented - that it's happening is not really up for debate, the questions concerning to what extent and does it matter are relevant to discussing the need for the Academic Bill of Rights. \n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_Bill_of_Rights\n \n \n1)All faculty shall be hired, fired, promoted and granted tenure on the basis of their competence and appropriate knowledge in the field of their expertise and, in the humanities, the social sciences, and the arts, with a view toward fostering a plurality of methodologies and perspectives. No faculty shall be hired or fired or denied promotion or tenure on the basis of his or her political or religious beliefs. \n \n 2)No faculty member will be excluded from tenure, search and hiring committees on the basis of their political or religious beliefs. \n \n 3)Students will be graded solely on the basis of their reasoned answers and appropriate knowledge of the subjects and disciplines they study, not on the basis of their political or religious beliefs. \n \n 4)Curricula and reading lists in the humanities and social sciences should reflect the uncertainty and unsettled character of all human knowledge in these areas by providing students with dissenting sources and viewpoints where appropriate. While teachers are and should be free to pursue their own findings and perspectives in presenting their views, they should consider and make their students aware of other viewpoints. Academic disciplines should welcome a diversity of approaches to unsettled questions. \n \n 5)Exposing students to the spectrum of significant scholarly viewpoints on the subjects examined in their courses is a major responsibility of faculty. Faculty will not use their courses for the purpose of political, ideological, religious or anti-religious indoctrination. \n \n 6)Selection of speakers, allocation of funds for speakers programs and other student activities will observe the principles of academic freedom and promote intellectual pluralism. \n \n 7)An environment conducive to the civil exchange of ideas being an essential component of a free university, the obstruction of invited campus speakers, destruction of campus literature or other effort to obstruct this exchange will not be tolerated. \n \n 8)Knowledge advances when individual scholars are left free to reach their own conclusions about which methods, facts, and theories have been validated by research. Academic institutions and professional societies formed to advance knowledge within an area of research, maintain the integrity of the research process, and organize the professional lives of related researchers serve as indispensable venues within which scholars circulate research findings and debate their interpretation. To perform these functions adequately, academic institutions and professional societies should maintain a posture of organizational neutrality with respect to the substantive disagreements that divide researchers on questions within, or outside, their fields of inquiry.[1] \n\n \n This neutral document is only 406 words long, and is intended to supplement and compliment existing guidelines adopted by universities over the years, much as the first 10 amendments (the Bill of Rights) compliments the U.S. Constitution. During the founding of the U.S. government, several prominent founders questioned the necessity of the Bill of Rights, claiming that those things were understood, and unnecessary to be spelled out. Todays' constant referrals to the first and second amendments alone make it clear that they were necessary, and todays complete perversion of established university principles make it clear that the proposed Academic Bill of Rights is needed today to get started down the long road to restoring the largely forgotten \"disinterested pursuit of knowledge\". \n \n The American Association of University Professors was founded in 1915, and agreed upon their \"General Declaration of Principles\" by the last day of that year. While most universities in the U.S. have established their own academic policies in their own ways - their own arrangements and their own times - they are based on that famous document. The writer of the Academic Bill of Rights also claims guidance by that document, so its contents are very relevant to this discussion. It's over 6000 words long, yet I believe the following part of it sums up the problem;\n \n \nThere is one case in which the academic teacher is under an obligation to observe certain special restraints - namely, the instruction of immature students. In many of our American colleges, and especially in the first two years of the course, the student's character is not yet fully formed, his mind is still relatively immature. In these circumstances it may reasonably be expected that the instructor will present scientific truth with discretion, that he will introduce the student to new conceptions gradually, with some consideration for the student's preconceptions and traditions, and with due regard to character-building. The teacher ought also to be especially on his guard against taking unfair advantage of the students' immaturity by indoctrinating him with the teacher's own opinions before the student has had an opportunity fairly to examine other opinions upon the matters of question, and before he has sufficient knowledge and ripeness in judgment to be entitled to form any definitive opinion of his own. It is not the least service which a college or university may render to those under its instruction, to habituate them to looking not only patiently but methodically on both sides, before adopting any conclusion upon controverted issues. By these suggestions, however, it need scarcely be said that the committee does not intend to imply that it is not the duty of an academic instructor to give to any students old enough to be in college a genuine intellectual awakening and to arouse in them a keen desire to reach personally verified conclusion upon all questions of general concernment to mankind, or of special significance for their own time. \n\n \n http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/566\n \n \n I put the last sentence in bold type to show what can happen to long documents like this, when they are written by several different people over a significant period of time. The first 5 sentences say something very clearly, then one more sentence leaves it all up to any individual interpretation, with fuzzy words like \"genuine intellectual awakening\". This is what has been progressively used since the 1960s to largely destroy what the first 5 sentences, and most of the rest of the document, actually says. It goes on;\n \n \n There is much truth in some remarks recently made in this connection by a college president:\n \n \"Certain professors have been refused re-election lately, apparently because they set their students to thinking in ways objectionable to the trustees. It would be well if more teachers were dismissed because they fail to stimulate thinking of any kind. We can afford to forgive a college professor what we regard as the occasional error of his doctrine, especially as we may be wrong, provided he is a contagious center of intellectual enthusiasm. It is better for students to think about heresies than not to think at all; better for them to climb new trails, and stumble over error if need be, than to ride forever in upholstered ease in the overcrowded highway. It is a primary duty of a teacher to make a student take an honest account of his stock of ideas, throw out the dead matter, place revised price marks on what is left, and try to fill his empty shelves with new goods.\" \n\n \n This further destroys what the 5 sentences above actually say. This college president uses the words \"fail to stimulate\" in perfect contradiction to the above words \"patiently and methodically\". He's saying that the \"intellectual enthusiasm\" of bias may be preferable to the 'failure of stimulation' of neutrality. His reference to empty shelves may very well be an outdated term, considering todays communications and international political volatility, compared with 1915. \n \n So, few will disagree that, on a case by case basis, decisions have to be made on what is indoctrination and what is not. The question is, who should make those decisions? Opponents of the Academic Bill of Rights claim that only the educated within the university, not the general public, should make those decisions. To restrict the educated in any way restricts the all American \"freedom\" of the educated. Here is the problem with that thinking; Universities in the U.S. are non-profit organizations. The terms non-profit and for-profit are somewhat unfortunate, because they often leave the impression that non-profit equals a more noble mindset than for-profit. Obviously non-profit organizations must deal in matters of money, but it's implied to be secondary, behind their mission, or institutional goals. The surface \"nobility\" of non-profit, vs the surface \"greed\" of for-profit, can quickly be brought into a more realistic perspective when they are seen as non-profit/non loss organizations, vs profit and loss businesses. For-profit businesses have pressures and incentives by dual potentialities that non-profit businesses seldom have. Todays universities seem to seek the same private, interior freedoms that for-profit businesses have, concerning their activities, growth, restructuring and problem solving. Without the pressures and incentives described above, the goals of individuals in non-profit organizations (in this case universities) can somewhat easily be substituted for the previously established goals of the entire organization. An obvious indicator of this is \"tenure\", a practically guaranteed lifetime appointment, common in non-profit universities, yet practically unheard of in for-profit business. The competition of the market place, the dual potentialities of profit and loss simply make it impossible. \n \n Very near the beginning of the 1915 Declaration of Principles, it refers to universities that are established and funded by private institutions, whether religious or for-profit business. It distinguishes between those and the more common, (then and now) public universities in the following way;\n \n \nAll of these are essentially proprietary institutions, in the moral sense. They do not, at least as regards on particular subject, accept the principles of freedom of inquiry, of opinion, and of teaching; and their purpose is not to advance knowledge by the unrestricted research and unfettered discussion of impartial investigators, but rather to subsidize the promotion of the opinions held by the persons, usually not of the scholar's calling, who provide the funds for their maintenance. Concerning the desirability of the existence of such institutions, the committee does not desire to express any opinion. But it is manifestly important that they should not be permitted to sail under false colors. Genuine boldness and thoroughness of inquiry, and freedom of speech, are scarcely reconcilable with the prescribed inculcation of a particular opinion upon a controverted question. \n\n \n Public universities in the U.S. today are sailing under false colors, they are bases for the radical left. They are NOT bound by religion or any one private business, and they should not be bound by the radical left as they obviously are. They SHOULD accept the principles of inquiry, of opinion, of teaching, and their purpose IS to advance knowledge by unrestricted research and unfettered discussion of impartial investigators, and NOT to subsidize the promotion of opinions held by a religious institution, wealthy businessmen, OR a tenured icon of a non-profit organization who does not provide funds for its maintenance. David Horowitz has clearly documented incremental increases in restrictions of conservatism in U.S. universities. \n \n Individuals on government subsidies don't get to determine how much money they receive, and in exactly the same way, institutions dependent on government money shouldn't get to determine how much freedom they receive.",

   "I personally have mixed feelings about an Academic Bill of Rights. \n \n I can sympathize with the concern that some professors may wish to use their teaching platform as a bully pulpit for pushing their own political views in a skewed fashion. The thing that most concerns me is not that they present one view as preferential to another view, but that some professors might purposely grossly distort the arguments of the opposing view and whitewash their own view in order to win the argument. Students deserve an honest presentation of both sides - at least a real attempt at honest presentations. From this point of view, I would support some procedure which would weed out those professors, and either chastise them or, if that doesn't work, eventually fire them. \n \n However, I would be VERY concerned that an Academic Bill of Rights could try to force upon professors an equal presentation of views, not based on their own merits, but because some fraction of the public considers it important. For example, I would be concerned that Intelligent Design would be forced into a classroom on Evolution, despite the fact that it has not stood up to the test of scientific method. If an Academic Bill of Rights could be established which only weeds out professors who purposely grossly distort opposing views, then I might support it. However, I'm not sure how such a bill could be worded in a way that could not be misused. \n \n University education is not obligatory, as is education up through secondary school. Students choose to come to a particular university by choice because they like the program of the university. For a degree to be recognized by the outside world, that outside world has to have some level of trust that the student has had at least a certain base exposure to the relevant topics in their field of study. Outside of that base exposure, in the form of required classes, they are free to specialize however they like. Who in the outside world matters? Students do not get degrees for recognition of the general public (though I am sure that they appreciate public recognition). From all I have seen, students generally study for two reasons - enjoyment of learning, and the practical use of a degree in progressing in their careers. From the point of view of their career, it is important that they get exposed to those views which will be relevant to their chosen career. I see no reason why outside views should be pushed into a curriculum only because they are popular with some portion of the lay public. This means that I would disagree that concepts such as Intelligent Design should be forced into Evolution classrooms. They play no role in the actual careers of students studying Evolution. As for the students enjoyment of learning, they generally pick the University because, among other things, they like the choice of classes. At least, those students who are diligent in choosing universities do make choices at least partly based on those choice of courses. If a student wants to study views out of the mainstream that a particular university does not offer, then there is no reason for them to go to that university. \n \n To summarize, though I would sympathize with the concern about the relatively small fraction of professors who are so biased in their views that they grossly distort opposing views in their teaching, I would be very weary in supporting a law that tries to control this since I would be very concerned that such a law would try to impose public whims upon University education.",

College graduates end up being teachers in obligatory, K-12 education. In some colleges, students can go through selecting courses cafeteria style, and graduate largely in ignorance of history, science, economics, and many other subjects basic in teaching K-12. In my local newspaper several years ago, third grade students were assigned by their teacher to write letters to the editor, expressing their fears, and making suggestions on how to correct, things like pollution and global warming. Even in the future, when these children get an introduction into the most basic economics, prices and costs, etc, their earlier indroctrination by that third grade teacher are likely to block much re-evaluation they desperately need to do, concerning decisions they will make as adults.

If one professor decided he wanted to take a look at it? Many do mind apparently, since that concept of thinking is being blocked by the courts. So much for academic freedom. We're told that it's blocked because it's a religion, yet if professors take jabs at religion during the teaching of evolution, the courts don't get involved.

I would be more convinced by a study that explored professors with continuing and consistent records of bias - where many students complained about them. One student could have been brash himself, could have caught the teacher on a bad day, etc. One example is not enough to show me that a professor is overly biased. I remember, during college, that students would be given Tau Beta Pi surveys to fill out for each class at the end of term which would give them an opportunity to criticize the class and the professor. If, for example, such surveys showed consistent bias by a fairly high percentage of professors, then I might start being concerned.",

My concern is that the force of law could be misused. \n\n \n It's not the same as a law, because it names no specifics. It would be exactly the same as the Bill of Rights to the U.S. Constitution, it states ways to deal with specific things, mainly to ~make no law~, or take no action that restricts certain basic freedoms. They both state ways to deal with specifics by the political process. A political process, not a law. It couldn't possibly force anything to a greater extent than the recent Dover ID case. Did that force not bother you? \n \n \n \n Even you, in later paragraphs here, suggest that it is important that the general public have a say in what is being taught at universities. That places limits on the freedom of professors in teaching subjects based on their merit alone. \n\n \n As I said in my first post, I don't think professors should have that unlimited freedom.

However, currently, it seems to go further than that, which is what concerns me. \n\n \n I dropped a hint above, and you missed it. :) (the one about \"point by point\") Care to be specific? There are eight sections to the Academic Bill of Rights. \n \n \n \nOnly a very small fraction of college graduates go on to become teachers at a K-12 level. \n\n \n So? 100% of K-12 teachers are college graduates!\n \n \n \nEven among those teachers, the great majority do not teach contravercial subjects - ex. they teach math, english, sports, etc. The only subject that seems to be contraversial is political subjects and evolution (whether one could include ID).

Even if only a tiny percentage of them are doing it, it needs to be addressed. Please describe how the Academic Bill of Rights \"changes the whole system\". Point out what is specified in the 1915 Declaration that you believe it changes. \n \n \n \nIf intelligent design wants to present itself as science, then it needs to meet the criteria of the scientific method - something which it has failed to do. \n\n \n So that means that it can never possibly do it? So it needs to be BLOCKED from the university? The place of experimentation, of new thought, unrestricted by entrenched, conservative, traditional thinking? That's what we're told everytime college professors want to give aid and comfort to our enemies, bash capitalism, bash U.S. actions throughout history etc etc. Yet when modern science constantly comes up with nothing but blanks on naturalistic origins, alternate experimentation and ideas need to be disregarded, now and in the future? Can you name anything, other than Intelligent Design, that university special interests have sought court action to rule out experimentation in the future? The double standard is amazing. \n \n \n \n \nIf a professor wanted to present intelligent design as a class on its own, not claiming that it is legitimate science, then I would not object.

If its blocked from rigourous scientific debate? New minds, new studies, future discoveries are the only way it's going to happen. Again, I'd like to see just one other example of something that any subject of study claims to be unworthy of ANY FUTURE study, and had millions of dollars spent to legally block it from further study.

If major chunks of required education in that profession are missing, then their degree will be frowned upon. \n\n \n I don't believe universities are keeping it in mind very well, with studies in \"Ideas of Human Nature\"- \"Psychology of Peace\"- \"Politics of the Middle East\"- \"Social thought\", many others. Polls seem to indicate that the general public also wonders how these will be useful in professions, professions that earn profits and sustain loses. But as I said above, we have to agree to disagree on how much the public is involved in education. (for now :)) \n \n \n \nI looked at a handful of examples, and most seemed to be based on anecdotes of one student. I would be more convinced by a study that explored professors with continuing and consistent records of bias - where many students complained about them. One student could have been brash himself, could have caught the teacher on a bad day, etc. One example is not enough to show me that a professor is overly biased. I remember, during college, that students would be given Tau Beta Pi surveys to fill out for each class at the end of term which would give them an opportunity to criticize the class and the professor. If, for example, such surveys showed consistent bias by a fairly high percentage of professors, then I might start being concerned.\n\n \n As I said in the opening post, that college bias happens is not really up for debate, the question is \"to what extent\" and \"does it matter\" are the questions. You and I have differing opinions on \"to what extent\" and have likely gone about as far as we're going to go on it. I asked a few questions above however, so I'll allow a few days for you, and others hopefully, to say more on it, then I want to get more into \"does it matter\".",

   "As a maths teacher I can concur that we are under pressure to use maths to introduce politically biased topics, at least in this country. The curriculum cements capitalist economic models of debt and repayment, and a significant proportion is given over to monetary calculations with the intent normalising the capitalist system for children from a young age. The idea of profit often forms part of questions, and if tax is mentioned it is always as a burden rather than in terms of the benefits resulting from it. I would be very surprised if the same wasn't true elsewhere.\n \n The real reason there is a perceived liberal bias in academia is that liberals tend to support policies based on evidence, hence it's conservatives trying to force ID into the science classroom and liberals who want actual, y'know, science.",

   "Another opinion", 
   "It's not the same as a law, because it names no specifics. It would be exactly the same as the Bill of Rights to the U.S. Constitution, it states ways to deal with specific things, mainly to ~make no law~, or take no action that restricts certain basic freedoms. They both state ways to deal with specifics by the political process. A political process, not a law. It couldn't possibly force anything to a greater extent than the recent Dover ID case. Did that force not bother you? \n\n I do not understand in what way you view the functioning of the Academic Bill of Rights. Could you give a few sample hypothetical cases? The Dover ID case which you mentioned seemed to suggest that, through the Academic Bill of Rights, the public would be able to force a particular curriculum into university education.\n \n I would be opposed to the public in general forcing a particular curiculum into university education. The curriculum should stand on its own merits, as determined by the general professional community of the particular profession. If a particular university's curriculum is out of touch with the professional community, then it will find its degrees being criticized and disrespected by the professional community and will lose students because of it. That is the feedback mechanism - competition for students - that keeps curricula relevant. \n \n The trouble with ID is that it does NOT follow the scientific method since it assumes something (an omnipotent designer) which shows no evidence of itself. If they were able to come up with direct demostratable evidence of a supernatural being, then they would then start crossing over into the realm of proper science. Lacking direct evidence, they currently cannot be viewed as true science. One cannot let the public redefine what science is for political purposes. \n \nAs I said in my first post, I don't think professors should have that unlimited freedom. They don't provide funds for the institutions maintanence, they pay no price if they are wrong, and too many have shown complete irresponsibility with that freedom.\n\n The students themselves provide a lot of the funding through tuition. Grants are also given by alumni, corporations, etc. For public universities, states also contribute funding but it is rarely all the funding. Even so, the responsibility of universities is to the student in order to prepare them for their chosen profession. Students take most of their courses in areas relevant to their chosen profession but they also take a smaller fraction of classes outside their profession in order to become more well rounded. So, not all classes are targeted for professional growth. However, if the university does not properly prepare them for their profession, then it will lose students and suffer, so it is in the best interest of the university to stay relevant in the courses being offered.\n \nI dropped a hint above, and you missed it. :) (the one about \"point by point\") Care to be specific? There are eight sections to the Academic Bill of Rights. \n\n I was mostly reacting to your interpretation that suggests that the public should be able to involve itself in choosing curricula. Do you or don't you think the Academic Bill of Rights would enable that?\n \nSo? 100% of K-12 teachers are college graduates!\n\n So, have THEM go through supplimentary education, if needed. Don't make the other 99% of college graduates be forced to undergo un-needed education for the sake of the 1% that may go on to be public school teachers.\n \nThere is more and more evidence, (from Horowitz' research, and from examples on noindoctrination.org.) that teachers of math, english, sports etc. are introducing into their teaching controversial matter which has no relation to their subject. Even if only a tiny percentage of them are doing it, it needs to be addressed. Please describe how the Academic Bill of Rights \"changes the whole system\". Point out what is specified in the 1915 Declaration that you believe it changes. \n\n Unless I am misinterpreting you, you are suggesting that the Academic Bill of Rights can allow the public to have a say in university education. If that is your view, then it can change the whole system. If I am mininterpreting you, then please explain in detail what relationship you think the Academic Bill of Rights has to the idea of public involvement in determining university curricula.\n \nSo that means that it can never possibly do it? So it needs to be BLOCKED from the university? The place of experimentation, of new thought, unrestricted by entrenched, conservative, traditional thinking? That's what we're told everytime college professors want to give aid and comfort to our enemies, bash capitalism, bash U.S. actions throughout history etc etc. Yet when modern science constantly comes up with nothing but blanks on naturalistic origins, alternate experimentation and ideas need to be disregarded, now and in the future? Can you name anything, other than Intelligent Design, that university special interests have sought court action to rule out experimentation in the future? The double standard is amazing. \n\n ID is not science because it does not present evidence of the designer it speaks of. It is clearly being pushed by the religious right to make creationism \"appear\" scientific. However, whenever it has been put to the test of scientific rigor, it fails since it cannot provide evidence for the designer. If it could, it might be considered science and could be included.\n \n I would compare it, in some ways, to a situation of someone trying to teach a course in the Economics department on astrological determination of when and where to invest. It just does not fit into a university curriculum. If someone did try to introduce such a course, I would be fully supportive of it being banned as well, for the same type of reasons.\n \nHow can that ever happen if its blocked from universities? If its blocked from rigourous scientific debate? New minds, new studies, future discoveries are the only way it's going to happen. Again, I'd like to see just one other example of something that any subject of study claims to be unworthy of ANY FUTURE study, and had millions of dollars spent to legally block it from further study. If you can name one, we'll look at WHY that effort may have been made, and where the money came from. \n\n ID being pushed into Evolution classrooms is the only situation I can think of where politics is trying to define curricula. As for ID not being able to be researched, the religious right certainly has funded various ID think tanks - there is no lack of money and opportunities for research, just lack of the evidence needed for real science to happen.\n \nI don't believe universities are keeping it in mind very well, with studies in \"Ideas of Human Nature\"- \"Psychology of Peace\"- \"Politics of the Middle East\"- \"Social thought\", many others. Polls seem to indicate that the general public also wonders how these will be useful in professions, professions that earn profits and sustain loses. But as I said above, we have to agree to disagree on how much the public is involved in education. (for now :)) \n\n Many of those could be useful for political scientists, psychologists, philosophers, etc. Otherwise, students in other professions could study those as an elective (a fraction of the courses taken which are not required for their profession). I studied electrical engineering and physics and was quite happy that our curriculum allowed for about 1 class a quarter that was unrelated to our field and meant to let us be more well-rounded individuals. \n \n In summary, I think the two of us agree that professors that are biased (in terms of grossly distorting opposing arguements) should be prevented from continuing such distortion, but we disagree about public involvement in university curricula. I don't know how much further we can go from here except to agree to disagree on the public involvement aspect.",

Friedman has the benefit of being sometimes right, but for the wrong reasons, and for the same wrong reasons, being often wrong.\n \n \"Dogma\" can't harm economies directly, it can only manifest itself through human action, and where that action has been to allow freedom in developing countries, off the top of my head in the US, Britain, Australia, Hong Kong, Dubai, well, pretty much any country that has actually developed, its consequences have been far better than anyone could have dreamed.\n \n Where it has been harmful has been where socialist/corporatist policy has masqueraded as being free market, where African nations have attempted to emulate the developed world by borrowing the developed worlds' penchant for enormous government programs, where the WTO has coopted the phrase \"free trade\" to mean \"trade under conditions certain other nations feel is fair\", that is to say, terms that harm consumers and harm foreign producers, with special exceptions, to protect domestic corporate interests.\n \n If you care about the people of the undeveloped world, you should be willing to tell the truth about the policies enacted there, be willing to differentiate between freedom and corporatism, instead of just using them to slur free markets by pretending that it and corporate cronyism guided by the omnipotent state are one and the same.\n \n For the life of me I cannot think of one example where a nation developed to any extent except through freeing its people. Perhaps communist china? Castro's cuba? Soviet Russia? Nazi Germany? Mugabe's zimbabwe?

   "free markets and free people are entirely unrelated.\n\n \n A market is a metaphor for the numerous free exchanges which occur between people. There can be no free market if the people are not free to trade, and people cannot be free to trade if there are not free markets.\n \n \nMost scandinavian countries have a large state and have high levels of personal liberty\n\n \n The size of a state is in a general sense a good measure of how oppressed the people are, but where the state is large solely because of positive programs, ie, the provision of welfare, rather than large because of the criminilisation of large numbers of non-violent actions, it is true that the people are relatively free. This state of affairs however, engenders cultural and economic changes that in the end result in the expansion of state power to all areas of life, regardless of the idealism with which the original programs were conceived. This effect is dampened in communities of relative homogeneity, most apparent in multicultural mixing pots where people of widely varying beliefs, values, lifestyles and income levels come together.\n \n \nTrying to conflate the two is an attempt to cover for failed free market policies, like the so-called economic restructuring that the IMF has required from poor countries that have prevented the investment in education needed to develop economically.\n\n \n I have already explained to you that the policies of the WTO or IMF are not free market policies, and I should not have to explain it to you again. They masquerade as free market policies but in fact provide finances for the expansion of state programs in exchange for the enactment of particular policies. \n \n \nEvery developed country today developed by protectionism and state intervention, not free markets of the kind favoured by Friedman. The US and UK only started peddling the free market claptrap once their economies had already developed.\n\n \n Perhaps you can tell me what the level of income tax was when the US developed most rapidly, and what proportion of the GDP was accounted for by government spending? Here's a hint - 0, and about 1%. Friedman is not in favour of free markets per se, he is in favour of markets regulated in a different kind of way than Keynes. Can you tell me how the federal reserve manipulating the money supply to create stable price levels relates to a free market? What central bank was it that regulated the money supply? How large was the american military, which nations did they have bases in? What was the minimum wage? If you invented something, how long would you be granted a patent/monopoly on it? What copyright laws were in place? Oh right, sorry, I'm just imagining all these state enterprises which don't exist in free markets, but which the WTO/IMF foists on 3rd world nations in their name.\n \n \n \nIncidentally China and Soviet Russia did develop massively under dictatorial leaders, both countries went from essentially feudal agrarian cultures to industrial ones within a half century\n\n \n Having an industrial economy does not mean you are more developed than if you have an agrarian economy, economic growth can only be guaged by the prosperity of the people, not by how many highways and hydroelectric dams a government builds with its IMF loans, not by how much soot people breathe, and certainly not by how many people were moved by the government from the country to the city to work in factories churning out goods for the benefit of the ruling elites.\n \n It is true that economic prosperity has often been associated with these things historically, but it is not these things themselves we are interested in.

   "I do not understand in what way you view the functioning of the Academic Bill of Rights. Could you give a few sample hypothetical cases? \n\n \n I'll give an actual case and then a hypothetical. From \n frontpagemag\n \n \nAn emblem of the crisis that besets our universities is provided by an episode that occurred on July 30, 2003, when the Faculty Senate of the University of California elected by a vote of 43-3 to remove the famous Sproul Clause from Berkeley's Academic Personnel Manual. The Faculty Senate took the step because this academic freedom principle came into conflict with the teaching of a specific course at the University of California, Berkeley. The course was called, \"The Politics and Poetics of Palestinian Resistance\" and earned national embarrassment for the university when its radical instructor inserted into the school catalogue a warning that conservative students would be advised not to take it, presumably because of its ideological content. This course, mind you, was not even a course in history or political science or Middle Eastern Studies. It was a course in an English writing program required for all freshmen.\n Instead of removing this blatantly political course from the university curriculum - a course that clearly violated its own academic freedom guidelines in multiple ways- the Faculty Senate removed the guideline. In its stead, it substituted a clause to the effect that whatever a teacher says in a classroom is appropriate and proper if the Faculty Senate says it is.\n This episode is but one of many manifestations of a trend in American institutions of higher learning towards the politicization of the curriculum and thus towards a university model which is more akin to the educational systems of authoritarian societies than to democratic societies like ours. This trend is a product of two major developments that have taken place in the university system over the course of the last twenty-five years. \n\n \n I think the Academic Bill of Rights would allow those three people who did not vote with the majority in this case to take it to a political process beyond only this faculty senate.\n \n As a hypothetical, Barack Obamas' position on sex education for kindergarteners is getting some attention in the news lately. His contention is that it is merely to inform small children what inappropriate touching consists of, while his opponents suggest it might be one of many parts of a new social sexual agenda. While some of the general public may not believe the part about a social sexual agenda, they still may not agree that sex education for kindergarteners is the most pressing problem in the U.S. right now. If Obama gets elected with 50.001% percent of the vote, I think it's safe to say that the majority of the American public still doesn't' favor sex education for such small children. I think the Academic Bill of Rights could make the difference whether or not President Obama and his cabinet get this instilled with such force in todays universities, so that it becomes common in kindergarten classrooms within the next decade or so. As we see in the above actual case, the \"poetics and politics of Palestinian resistance\" became a required course at the above university. I don't think most of the public thinks that a course like that is called for to seek and transmit useful knowledge, in the spirit of the 1915 Declaration. Though I doubt the ABOR could quickly or easily reverse things that happened in the past.\n \n \nThe Dover ID case which you mentioned seemed to suggest that, through the Academic Bill of Rights, the public would be able to force a particular curriculum into university education. \n\n \n It doesn't seem that way to me. From the two examples above, I think the ABOR might be able to prevent useless, unpopular subjects from being forced into curriculums by special interests, or anti-American interests. \n \n \n \nI would be opposed to the public in general forcing a particular curiculum into university education. \n\n \n To further clarify my view of the functioning of the Academic Bill of Rights, it is that it cannot force anything. It could prevent, by drawing into a political process, the force described above by the Faculty Senate of the University of California. \n \n \n \nThe curriculum should stand on its own merits, as determined by the general professional community of the particular profession. If a particular university's curriculum is out of touch with the professional community, then it will find its degrees being criticized and disrespected by the professional community and will lose students because of it. That is the feedback mechanism - competition for students - that keeps curricula relevant. \n\n \n What professional community does the \"politics and poetics of Palestinian resistance\" fall under? \n \n \nThe trouble with ID is that it does NOT follow the scientific method since it assumes something (an omnipotent designer) which shows no evidence of itself. If they were able to come up with direct demostratable evidence of a supernatural being, then they would then start crossing over into the realm of proper science. Lacking direct evidence, they currently cannot be viewed as true science. One cannot let the public redefine what science is for political purposes. \n\n \n That's only opinion, not a non-controversial fact that's been established to everyones satisfaction. It's simply too easy to re-write it another way;\n \n The trouble with evolution is that it does NOT follow the scientific method since it assumes something (life from non-life) despite new scientific discoveries showing life from non life to be more and more mathematically impossible. If they were to come up with direct demonstrable evidence of naturalistic origins, then they would start crossing over into the realm of proper science. Lacking the foundation that evolution needs, much (not all) of evolution cannot be viewed as true science. One cannot let educated atheists redefine what science is for political purposes. To block ID from science on the basis of separation of church and state, and allow atheistic evolutionary thought free reign in public schools, is a clear double standard. It's hard to find a way to say it that gets attention, maybe this way; If church and state are separated, church bashing and state must be separated. \n \n \n \nThe students themselves provide a lot of the funding through tuition. Grants are also given by alumni, corporations, etc. For public universities, states also contribute funding but it is rarely all the funding. Even so, the responsibility of universities is to the student in order to prepare them for their chosen profession. Students take most of their courses in areas relevant to their chosen profession but they also take a smaller fraction of classes outside their profession in order to become more well rounded. So, not all classes are targeted for professional growth. However, if the university does not properly prepare them for their profession, then it will lose students and suffer, so it is in the best interest of the university to stay relevant in the courses being offered.\n\n \n Do you have clear evidence that todays universities have not lost students and suffered to some degree? Even if you do, as I outlined in the first post, losing and suffering are much more associated with profit/loss business than with non-profit/non-loss universities.\n \n \nI was mostly reacting to your interpretation that suggests that the public should be able to involve itself in choosing curricula. Do you or don't you think the Academic Bill of Rights would enable that?\n\n \n I don't. I think it would be able to involve the public in a process of rejecting certain curricula, be it anti-American, immoral, etc. Curricula should be intended to understand the world, not change the world. \n \n \nSo, have THEM go through supplimentary education, if needed. Don't make the other 99% of college graduates be forced to undergo un-needed education for the sake of the 1% that may go on to be public school teachers. \n\n \n \n I'm not talking about the education of K-12 teachers, I'm talking about bias of K-12 teachers. If they are educated with bias, they are going to educate with bias. If they see professors respect the 1915 principles, they are likely to respect them also, when teaching young children. I know mine did, as I think back on them, and their personalities, during the raging Vietnam war. Students couldn't have pried their opinions out of them with a crowbar, but I guarantee many of mine had strong ones. \n \n \n \nUnless I am misinterpreting you, you are suggesting that the Academic Bill of Rights can allow the public to have a say in university education. If that is your view, then it can change the whole system. If I am mininterpreting you, then please explain in detail what relationship you think the Academic Bill of Rights has to the idea of public involvement in determining university curricula. \n\n \n The idea is to change the system BACK to the way it was, and should be. From the Horowitz webpage again;\n \n \nThis trend is a product of two major developments that have taken place in the university system over the course of the last twenty-five years.\n \n [snip]\n \n The first of these developments is the abdication by university administrators of their oversight of what faculty are saying and doing in the classroom. Administrators are increasingly so focused on financial concerns that they have turned a blind eye to radical advocacy in the classroom, and the substitution of political attitudinizing for scholarly research. Segments of the faculty have now become accustomed to the most irresponsible conduct without any consequences. \n \n [snip examples]\n \n The second development behind the present crisis of academic governance is the creation and then intrusion of entire programs into the academic curriculum that are overtly ideological in nature and whose goals are determined by political rather than scholarly or educational agendas. The driving force behind these programs, which encompass entire departments and fields, are the same radicals who have created the imperial faculty with its censorious attitudes towards intellectual freedom. \n\n \n \n \nID is not science because it does not present evidence of the designer it speaks of. It is clearly being pushed by the religious right to make creationism \"appear\" scientific. However, whenever it has been put to the test of scientific rigor, it fails since it cannot provide evidence for the designer. If it could, it might be considered science and could be included. \n\n \n \n Godless evolution is not science because it does not present evidence of the naturalistic origins it speaks of. It is clearly being pushed by the atheist left to make godless evolution appear scientific. It fails on origins, and it's entrenched in schools. It is at least partially an ideology, not science. \n \n \n \nI would compare it, in some ways, to a situation of someone trying to teach a course in the Economics department on astrological determination of when and where to invest. It just does not fit into a university curriculum. If someone did try to introduce such a course, I would be fully supportive of it being banned as well, for the same type of reasons. \n\n \n You may make that comparison because you equate religion with astrological determinations. I equate atheists constant failures at explaining naturalistic origins with astrological determination. They should be explored equally, or blocked equally. \n \n \nID being pushed into Evolution classrooms is the only situation I can think of where politics is trying to define curricula. \n\n \n Then you need to read up some at frontpagemag, starting with the page I linked above. Is the politics and poetics of Palestinian resistance as a required course not an equivalent? \n \n \nAs for ID not being able to be researched, the religious right certainly has funded various ID think tanks - there is no lack of money and opportunities for research, just lack of the evidence needed for real science to happen. \n\n \n Every view has evidence. Some profound, some vague, some non existent. Evidence is always subject to human interpretation. We've seen statistics of biologists worldviews before on these forums - atheism abounds. Privately funded ID think tanks could claim that grass was green, and tenured atheist biologists would squalk about it. \n \n \nMany of those could be useful for political scientists, psychologists, philosophers, etc. Otherwise, students in other professions could study those as an elective (a fraction of the courses taken which are not required for their profession). I studied electrical engineering and physics and was quite happy that our curriculum allowed for about 1 class a quarter that was unrelated to our field and meant to let us be more well-rounded individuals. \n\n \n \n Well rounded in understanding the world, or changing the world? \n \n \n \nIn summary, I think the two of us agree that professors that are biased (in terms of grossly distorting opposing arguements) should be prevented from continuing such distortion, but we disagree about public involvement in university curricula. I don't know how much further we can go from here except to agree to disagree on the public involvement aspect.\n\n \n I agree, but I think we've seen that only ONE THING has been blocked from open inquiry and thought of academic freedom as established in the 1915 declaration, and that's ID. Is the separation of church and state in science the only thing that's so important that we have to make an exception to traditional rules?

No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.\" \n\n \n In this day and age of terrorism, combined with instant worldwide communications, could we not find two persons to say that Ward Churchill commited treason? Did it not aid and comfort terrorists to hear him call occupants of the World Trade Center \"little Eichmanns\"? Why did he call them that, because he knew them personally, or because he has the same disdain for successful free trade as terrorists do? \n \n \nBTW, why must \"understanding the world\" and \"changing the world\" be mutually exclusive?

Could you outline an envisioned course of events? Would it involve eliminating the biased sentence? eliminating the course? firing the professor?\n \n [Added on edit]It is also interesting to note that this was a graduate student instructor teaching the class - not even an assistant professor, much less a tenured professor. As such, he would have been relatively inexperienced at teaching and is not representative at all of the wide range of experienced professors who teach the majority of courses in a much less biased manor.[/Edit]\n \nAs a hypothetical, Barack Obamas' position on sex education for kindergarteners is getting some attention in the news lately. His contention is that it is merely to inform small children what inappropriate touching consists of, while his opponents suggest it might be one of many parts of a new social sexual agenda. While some of the general public may not believe the part about a social sexual agenda, they still may not agree that sex education for kindergarteners is the most pressing problem in the U.S. right now. If Obama gets elected with 50.001% percent of the vote, I think it's safe to say that the majority of the American public still doesn't' favor sex education for such small children. I think the Academic Bill of Rights could make the difference whether or not President Obama and his cabinet get this instilled with such force in todays universities, so that it becomes common in kindergarten classrooms within the next decade or so. As we see in the above actual case, the \"poetics and politics of Palestinian resistance\" became a required course at the above university. I don't think most of the public thinks that a course like that is called for to seek and transmit useful knowledge, in the spirit of the 1915 Declaration. Though I doubt the ABOR could quickly or easily reverse things that happened in the past.\n\n You seem to be mixing arguements about public involvement in K-12 education with arguements of public involvement in university education. I agree that the public has the right to some involvement in K-12 education. Parents have a legal responsibility over their children up to the age of 18, so I support their right to get involved in issues of what the child learns in K-12 education. The school must ultimately balance the desires of the parent with the responsibility of the school to prepare students with the knowledge they might need in the outside world. Also, parents and students in a particular geographical area have no choice but to go to the public high school for that area. The only way they can protest is to fund themselves with a private school or to move out of the area - leaving most parents and students stuck with that school. Universities are another picture all together. First of all, students are 18 or over, so the parents have no legal responsibility over the student and, therefore, cannot claim legal rights. Also, parents and students clearly do have a choice about which university to attend, unlike K-12 education, so they can \"vote with their feet\". These are some of the main reasons why I view public involvement in K-12 education differently than I view public involvement in university education.\n \nIt doesn't seem that way to me. From the two examples above, I think the ABOR might be able to prevent useless, unpopular subjects from being forced into curriculums by special interests, or anti-American interests. \n\n I'm not sure if that was the case for Berkeley. Why do you think some external special interest forced that subject? Is there a \"smoking gun\"? I still have to hear Berkeley's justification for requiring that corse in their comprehension and composition requirement for English majors. Indeed, I looked at their web site and it looks like a \"requirement\" really means that it is one of a large number of courses that a student could choose to fulfill a requirement - which means that the student did not need to take that class. Here is the relevant web site for this year:\n http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/requirements/rc.html\n English is considered one of the liberal arts and Berkeley tried to have students take classes in a wide range of subjects (7 areas of study) so that they would not get too narrow a knowledge base. International studies is one of those areas, so it looked like the Palestine course might have been one that was offered under that category. The bottom line is that I can see why they had included that course as one of a number of courses that a student could take to fulfill a requirement. The only objection I personally would have with that course is that it seemed to be clearly presented in a biased manner, meant to scare away conservatives - which I do find unacceptable. So, once again, I would only support ABOR if it tried to address that bias presentation, not in its imposition of which courses are presented and which are not.\n \nTo further clarify my view of the functioning of the Academic Bill of Rights, it is that it cannot force anything. It could prevent, by drawing into a political process, the force described above by the Faculty Senate of the University of California.\n\n If it only forced elimination of bias in teaching (i.e. distorting opposing views or giving students with opposing views bad grades independent of arguement), then I would support it.\n \nWhat professional community does the \"politics and poetics of Palestinian resistance\" fall under? \n\n International studies, political science, history,... Also, it could be an elective (occasional course chosen that is not in ones field) for other majors.\n \nThat's only opinion, not a non-controversial fact that's been established to everyones satisfaction. It's simply too easy to re-write it another way;\n \n The trouble with evolution is that it does NOT follow the scientific method since it assumes something (life from non-life) despite new scientific discoveries showing life from non life to be more and more mathematically impossible. If they were to come up with direct demonstrable evidence of naturalistic origins, then they would start crossing over into the realm of proper science. Lacking the foundation that evolution needs, much (not all) of evolution cannot be viewed as true science. One cannot let educated atheists redefine what science is for political purposes. To block ID from science on the basis of separation of church and state, and allow atheistic evolutionary thought free reign in public schools, is a clear double standard. It's hard to find a way to say it that gets attention, maybe this way; If church and state are separated, church bashing and state must be separated. \n\n Here, you are talking about abiogenesis (the development of life from non-life). That is only a tiny fraction of what biologists study. The great majority of Evolutionary biologists study the Evolution from the first known life-forms (one celled organisms) to the variety of life that we see today, and all the stages in between. For that subject (by far the main subject of Evolution), there are mountains of evidence. I'm not even sure if Evolution is the right terminology for abiogenesis - by the very definition of the term Evolution itself. As for theories about abiogenesis, I agree that there isn't much evidence - at least not direct evidence. There is some indirect evidence in the form of experiments in the lab in which scientists have shown that organic compounds necessary for life could easily form in the \"primordial soup\" of early earth - they have replicated such environments in the laboratory and have found complex organic molecules forming.\n \n Anyway, I am worried that we could easily get into a long discussion on Evolution vs ID, which is better placed in the forum meant for that purpose. Suffice it to say here, where ABOR is concerned, that there is no professional need for ID to exist in universities as long as there are only a tiny portion of jobs in that field. If that becomes a profession in need of students trained in ID, then I am sure that some enterprising universities will set up and ID studies department and degree to cater to those students and to that profession. Currently, that profession does not fall under the category of \"science\" until it gains evidence for its designer. I am sure that, if solid evidence were found, then many would be excited by such a field. I, personally, would be happy to have my tax dollars help pay for research in supernatural studies that were supported by evidence. Unfortunately, that is not the state of affairs. Solid evidence has not shown itself.\n \n Do you have clear evidence that todays universities have not lost students and suffered to some degree? Even if you do, as I outlined in the first post, losing and suffering are much more associated with profit/loss business than with non-profit/non-loss universities.\n\n I only have evidence from knowing that my graduate school professors were concerned about having students choose their school, and have occasionally read sections of articles and blogs about it. Either way, it makes sense. A university, though non-profit, is not run for free. They need to pay the salaries of professors, the maintenance of buildings, roads, etc. There are many expenses for a university that have to be payed for. Students tuitions pay for much of that.\n \nI don't. I think it would be able to involve the public in a process of rejecting certain curricula, be it anti-American, immoral, etc. Curricula should be intended to understand the world, not change the world.\n\n But the world is not perfect. There are many problems that some of today's students can help solve. You need to present the contraversial problem areas as well and rarely does everyone agree on the problem areas - from Social Security, Welfare, the Arab/Palestinian conflict, Iraq, the War on Terror, Security vs Civil Rights, etc. If one does not address contraversial subjects, then one will never resolve them.\n \nI agree, but I think we've seen that only ONE THING has been blocked from open inquiry and thought of academic freedom as established in the 1915 declaration, and that's ID. Is the separation of church and state in science the only thing that's so important that we have to make an exception to traditional rules? The worst threat to America is a hint of \"endowed by their creator\" in science? How about aiding and comforting the enemy? Terror? Treason?\n\n There are many things that threaten America - terrorism and treason included. If someone were trying to teach a course on how to be a suicide bomber (as opposed to how to stop a suicide bomber), or how to be a spy against the CIA or US government secret programs, then I would also support stopping those courses - if they existed at all (which is doubtful).",

Here's the clause;\n \n \nThe function of the university is to seek and to transmit knowledge and to train students in the processes whereby truth is to be made known. To convert, or to make converts, is alien and hostile to this dispassionate duty. Where it becomes necessary in performing this function of a university, to consider political, social, or sectarian movements, they are dissected and examined, not taught, and the conclusion left, with no tipping of the scales, to the logic of the facts.... Essentially the freedom of a university is the freedom of competent persons in the classroom. In order to protect this freedom, the University assumed the right to prevent exploitation of its prestige by unqualified persons or by those who would use it as a platform for propaganda. \n\n \n This was established in 1934, and is in full keeping with the 1915 Declaration. I can't quickly find any clear information whether or not the \"vote\" taken by Berkeleys faculty has been overturned or not - I suspect it hasn't. Why they voted to remove it is clear - it \"came in conflict\" with an ideological course. Here is the 5th paragraph of the ABOR;\n \n \nExposing students to the spectrum of significant scholarly viewpoints on the subjects examined in their courses is a major responsibility of faculty. Faculty will not use their courses for the purpose of political, ideological, religious or anti-religious indoctrination. \n\n \n I think the above part of the ABOR would prevent basic, long standing academic principles from being subject to a whimsical vote of any or all current university faculties. It's like allowing Congress to vote out sections of the Constitution. So to answer your questions, the most important thing the ABOR would have done in this case would have been to block the voting out of historic academic principles. Since this course violated the Sproul clause, the course should have been eliminated. The anti-conservative sentence of course should have been eliminated. Fire the professor? No. There's nothing in the ABOR that comes close to suggesting that. Any action taken against the professor personally, would be done on an individual, case by case basis. \n \n \n \n[Added on edit]It is also interesting to note that this was a graduate student instructor teaching the class - not even an assistant professor, much less a tenured professor. As such, he would have been relatively inexperienced at teaching and is not representative at all of the wide range of experienced professors who teach the majority of courses in a much less biased manor.[/Edit]\n\n \n IMO anyone given authourity to teach should be held to the same standards as other more qualified, more experienced professors. \n \n \nYou seem to be mixing arguements about public involvement in K-12 education with arguements of public involvement in university education. I agree that the public has the right to some involvement in K-12 education. Parents have a legal responsibility over their children up to the age of 18, so I support their right to get involved in issues of what the child learns in K-12 education.

These are some of the main reasons why I view public involvement in K-12 education differently than I view public involvement in university education. \n\n \n All K-12 teachers are university graduates. They are mixed when it comes to teacher training institutions, teacher licensing agencies, state education departments, and most of all, teacher organizations. (unions) It all comes down to a respect for long established principles, like the 1915 Declaration, or the Sproul clause. If K-12 teachers don't have it, I think the lack of neutrality in teaching is going to be too widespread for parents to keep up with and police. The third grade teacher in my earlier example, assigning her students to write letters to a newspaper about pollution, is a good example. \n \n \nI'm not sure if that was the case for Berkeley. Why do you think some external special interest forced that subject? Is there a \"smoking gun\"? \n\n \n I think the Ward Churchill episode is a smoking gun. He gained a lot of notoriety of course, but he also gained strong support from many like minded university faculty and administration, along with a small but notable percentage of the American public, the radical left. There are all sorts of rewards, financial and otherwise, for undermining American Society and its values. \n \n \nI still have to hear Berkeley's justification for requiring that corse in their comprehension and composition requirement for English majors. Indeed, I looked at their web site and it looks like a \"requirement\" really means that it is one of a large number of courses that a student could choose to fulfill a requirement - which means that the student did not need to take that class.

The bottom line is that I can see why they had included that course as one of a number of courses that a student could take to fulfill a requirement. \n\n \n I have to concede that point - there is a big difference in claiming ONE course as a requirement vs. it being one of a large number of choices to fulfill a requirement. Horowitz may have been a little tricky there, and I fell for it. Darn non Christians!! emoticon_xdonno (He isn't one, you know :))\n \n \n \nThe only objection I personally would have with that course is that it seemed to be clearly presented in a biased manner, meant to scare away conservatives - which I do find unacceptable. So, once again, I would only support ABOR if it tried to address that bias presentation, not in its imposition of which courses are presented and which are not. \n\n \n How about the striking out of the Sproul clause? Don't you think traditional educational principles should be just a little bit sacred? It's one of the main functions, if not THE main function, of the ABOR. \n \n \nIf it only forced elimination of bias in teaching (i.e. distorting opposing views or giving students with opposing views bad grades independent of arguement), then I would support it. \n\n \n That's all it does. It only makes sense that todays AAUP opposes it, it holds them to standards that they'd rather not be bothered with. \n \n What makes this ABOR debate so confusing (not just this one, but the whole concept) is that both sides use the word \"politics\" - and the word can mean two entirely different things. It can mean ~one sided politics~, with no opposition, or it can mean ~political conflict~. Opposition to the ABOR doesn't want the conflict, whereas proponents of the ABOR don't want the one sidedness. If the purpose of universities are as the 1915 Declaration describes them;\n \n A)To promote inquiry and advance the sum of human knowledge. \n B)To provide general instruction to the students. \n C)To develop experts for various branches of the public service. \n \n then politics can't be kept out. The playing field is not level today. It needs to be, in this common culture of so many different backgrounds and values. \n \n \nWhat professional community does the \"politics and poetics of Palestinian resistance\" fall under?\n\n \n \n \nInternational studies, political science, history,... Also, it could be an elective (occasional course chosen that is not in ones field) for other majors. \n\n \n ???Those are professional communities?? Those are subjects, I thought the way you were using the phrase \"professional communities\" meant professional activities, jobs in the field, private higher tech business that depends on univeristies to provide it with educated people. The medical profession, electrical, mechanical, chemical, etc. What professions such as these require knowledge of the politics of Palestinian resistance? \n \n \n \nHere, you are talking about abiogenesis (the development of life from non-life). That is only a tiny fraction of what biologists study. \n\n \n Without a tiny fraction of ID to balance it, it is a tiny fraction too much. There is every bit as much atheism involved with it as there is religion in ID. \n \n \n \nThe great majority of Evolutionary biologists study the Evolution from the first known life-forms (one celled organisms) to the variety of life that we see today, and all the stages in between. For that subject (by far the main subject of Evolution), there are mountains of evidence.

Many claim to represent neutrality. It can't be maintained, we're all only human. Horowitz isn't neutral either. But he excluded his personal bias in the way he wrote the ABOR. \n \n \n \nAnyway, I am worried that we could easily get into a long discussion on Evolution vs ID, which is better placed in the forum meant for that purpose. Suffice it to say here, where ABOR is concerned, that there is no professional need for ID to exist in universities as long as there are only a tiny portion of jobs in that field. If that becomes a profession in need of students trained in ID, then I am sure that some enterprising universities will set up and ID studies department and degree to cater to those students and to that profession. \n\n \n Not a chance - the ACLU will bankrupt them if they try. They financed the Dover case, and they'll finance anything else similar that comes along. \n \n \n \nCurrently, that profession does not fall under the category of \"science\" until it gains evidence for its designer. I am sure that, if solid evidence were found, then many would be excited by such a field. I, personally, would be happy to have my tax dollars help pay for research in supernatural studies that were supported by evidence. Unfortunately, that is not the state of affairs. Solid evidence has not shown itself. \n\n \n It's the neutrality thing again. In science, neutrality stops somewhere, and ideology starts somewhere. Exactly where is what most of the disagreement is about. \n \n \nI only have evidence from knowing that my graduate school professors were concerned about having students choose their school, and have occasionally read sections of articles and blogs about it. Either way, it makes sense. A university, though non-profit, is not run for free. They need to pay the salaries of professors, the maintenance of buildings, roads, etc. There are many expenses for a university that have to be payed for. Students tuitions pay for much of that. \n\n \n That is true, that is one area where non-profit universities could \"lose\" something. But I'm not sure potential college students are always choosing their school based only on what's best for themselves or their country in the long run. Short term gratification is an unfortunate characteristic of human behavior. I just stumbled on something quite by accident that I'll get into more later - many college students today are coming up short when it comes to money management skills. 19% of all bankruptcies are filed by college students. Are colleges 100% blameless? Would a few more money management courses and a few less middle east ideology courses be a good idea? Would Berkeleys faculty and the general public have different ideas on that? \n \n \nBut the world is not perfect. There are many problems that some of today's students can help solve. You need to present the contraversial problem areas as well and rarely does everyone agree on the problem areas - from Social Security, Welfare, the Arab/Palestinian conflict, Iraq, the War on Terror, Security vs Civil Rights, etc. If one does not address contraversial subjects, then one will never resolve them. \n\n \n I agree, and opponents cries of \"keep politics out of the classroom\" is so much dishonesty. I'm not accusing you here, but others are doing just that. If politics are going to be addressed in the classroom, they need to be policed by politics. The kind of politics the ABOR will introduce. \n \n \nThere are many things that threaten America - terrorism and treason included. If someone were trying to teach a course on how to be a suicide bomber (as opposed to how to stop a suicide bomber), or how to be a spy against the CIA or US government secret programs, then I would also support stopping those courses - if they existed at all (which is doubtful).\n\n \n \n Of course they don't, there would be too much of an uproar. I think a course on how to understand a suicide bomber, or why there are spies in the U.S. can be just as bad.",

The third grade teacher in my earlier example, assigning her students to write letters to a newspaper about pollution, is a good example.\n\n Then, if that is your view and if it is the view of most parents, then schools hiring teachers should make sure that the teachers are knowledgable about a wide range of contraversial views and, if it is relevant to the subject they teach, should present relevant views fairly. If a teacher comes from a school that only presents one view, then they can take extra classes to learn about the opposing views. The bottom line is that this needs to only affect the tiny percentage of college students that DO become K-12 teachers - not ALL the college students. Where the great majority of college students are concerned, the needs of their profession should most influence their curriculum and any other education that they get should be unbiased only in the sense of not distorting any views.\n \nI think the Ward Churchill episode is a smoking gun. He gained a lot of notoriety of course, but he also gained strong support from many like minded university faculty and administration, along with a small but notable percentage of the American public, the radical left. There are all sorts of rewards, financial and otherwise, for undermining American Society and its values. \n\n Well, the university did eventually fire him after an investigation. As for the radical left and the university faculty and administration that supported him, I agree that some on the radical left can be too extreme in their thinking - as fixed and unmovable by reason as some of their counterparts on the radical right. I have no intention of defending them. I suspect that some of the university faculty and administrators might have supported him since they valued academic freedom above all else and saw only a slippery slope of rigidly controlled subjects as an alternative. As for Ward Churchill, if he had solid argueable reasons for some of his contraversial stances, then he should have had the right to state them. I suspect that was not the case (i.e. he did not have solid arguements), but haven't looked into it in any detail.\n \nHow about the striking out of the Sproul clause? Don't you think traditional educational principles should be just a little bit sacred? It's one of the main functions, if not THE main function, of the ABOR. \n\n I will continue to have to reserve judgement until I hear Berkeley's side of the story.\n \nWhat makes this ABOR debate so confusing (not just this one, but the whole concept) is that both sides use the word \"politics\" - and the word can mean two entirely different things. It can mean ~one sided politics~, with no opposition, or it can mean ~political conflict~. Opposition to the ABOR doesn't want the conflict, whereas proponents of the ABOR don't want the one sidedness. If the purpose of universities are as the 1915 Declaration describes them;\n \n A)To promote inquiry and advance the sum of human knowledge. \n B)To provide general instruction to the students. \n C)To develop experts for various branches of the public service. \n \n then politics can't be kept out. The playing field is not level today. It needs to be, in this common culture of so many different backgrounds and values. \n\n But why should people in general have a say about a particular profession? It is people of those professions that know best about the needs of that profession and the knowledge base that is relevant for it. A political process would make it possible for a large number of non-experts to be making an ill-informed decision for universities. I would much prefer that the individual professions have the great influence - not people in general. There, the universities are partly self-regulating since a degree that is irrelevant for a particular profession will make it very difficult for the student to get a job in that profession or, if he gets a job, it will be very difficult for him to succeed at that job.\n \n???Those are professional communities?? Those are subjects, I thought the way you were using the phrase \"professional communities\" meant professional activities, jobs in the field, private higher tech business that depends on univeristies to provide it with educated people. The medical profession, electrical, mechanical, chemical, etc. What professions such as these require knowledge of the politics of Palestinian resistance? \n\n People who do business with the Middle East (oil or other commodities) have to know about the culture and history that are relevant - and the Israeli/Palestinian conflict being high on the minds of those in the Middle East, it would be wise for businessmen to know something about it. The same is true for politicians and diplomats that have dealings with the Middle East. Historians who teach about that part of the world, in universities or high schools, also need to be familiar with the Israeli/Palestinian conflicts. \n \nWithout a tiny fraction of ID to balance it, it is a tiny fraction too much. There is every bit as much atheism involved with it as there is religion in ID. \n\n Science deals with understanding reality based on verifiable evidence. Since there has been no verifiable evidence about the supernatural, then there are clear reasons why Science does not address it. If there was irrefutable evidence, then I am sure that many scientists would jump on board. Unfortunately, since often enough, \"evidence\" for the supernatural was presented that was easily refutes, it would make it all the harder for any hypothetically real evidence for the supernatural to be able to be accepted. However, solid repeatable evidence would ultimately be hard to deny and would have to eventually be accepted by Science. The burden is on supporters of ID to come up with evidence for the supernatural. Until that point, it is a theory with negligible support in evidence - worth very little in the world of Science. At least abiogenesis does not assume a force or reality that shows no evidence of itself. THe theories of abiogenesis try to string together known supported science to come up with an explanation. They may or may not be right, but they base their assumptions on known rules of chemistry and physics and do not need to put in any \"fudge factors\" of an unknown force to get their ideas at least to be consistent with reality.\n \nIt's the neutrality thing again. In science, neutrality stops somewhere, and ideology starts somewhere. Exactly where is what most of the disagreement is about. \n\n Certainly, there are scientists that are very attached to their pet theories and some of those scientists can be very influencial, but, ultimately, evidence always wins the day with science. One can claim that science is biased against those things that show no evidence of themselves, but I see nothing wrong with such a bias since a neutral stance, in such a case, would undermine the scientific method itself and make it useless.\n \nThat is true, that is one area where non-profit universities could \"lose\" something. But I'm not sure potential college students are always choosing their school based only on what's best for themselves or their country in the long run. Short term gratification is an unfortunate characteristic of human behavior. I just stumbled on something quite by accident that I'll get into more later - many college students today are coming up short when it comes to money management skills. 19% of all bankruptcies are filed by college students. Are colleges 100% blameless? Would a few more money management courses and a few less middle east ideology courses be a good idea? Would Berkeleys faculty and the general public have different ideas on that?\n\n Some students may choose a school because they like the social climate (as with \"party schools\"). However, most students, especially after their Freshman years (when they are first experiencing the heady freedom from parental supervision), do think about their careers. As for bankrupcies, I think that would be a more useful course to have in high school since everyone has to deal with finances in their lives. \n \nI agree, and opponents cries of \"keep politics out of the classroom\" is so much dishonesty. I'm not accusing you here, but others are doing just that. If politics are going to be addressed in the classroom, they need to be policed by politics. The kind of politics the ABOR will introduce. \n\n I think policing by politics is dangerous since politics is, by its very nature, biased and too rarely based on rational discussion and solid arguements. I would prefer the needs of the profession to decide. I guess I am mostly afraid of the slippery slope - the idea that politics will try to force in ideas by force of numbers, not by the merit of the ideas themselves.\n \nOf course they don't, there would be too much of an uproar. I think a course on how to understand a suicide bomber, or why there are spies in the U.S. can be just as bad.\n\n Well, the best generals have always known that it is important to understand ones enemy.",

   "A couple of things:\n First, I cannot make any statement about the Sproul clause without hearing the other side of the story - Berkeley's side. Namely, what reasons did they give for voting out that clause? I tried to do a Google search but didn't come up with anything useful and do not have time for a much more rigorous search. Do you have a link about specifically why they voted out the Sproul clause?\n\n \n Why yes! frontpagemag \n \n \n.....the Faculty Senate of the University of California elected by a vote of 43-3 to remove the famous Sproul Clause from Berkeley's Academic Personnel Manual. The Faculty Senate took the step because this academic freedom principle came into conflict with the teaching of a specific course at the University of California, Berkeley. The course was called, \"The Politics and Poetics of Palestinian Resistance\"....\n\n \n Oh, you wanted a link from Berkeley? I'm afraid I don't have one, I can't get excited about looking for something that probably doesn't exist. After reading a few of Horowitz' debates with people of similar ilk of the Berkeley faculty, I can just imagine that they didn't have anything to say about it. Without the ABOR, would they be under any obligation to say anything? \n \n \n \nSecondly, I am continuing to be unclear as to the powers and limitations of the ABOR, as you understand it. Could you outline it in more detail? For example, what would be the mechanism by which the ABOR would take the anti-conservative sentence out of the class description? \n\n \n It would restore a new attention to established principles that are currently in place, but are being largely ignored today. Each case would be examined by university personel through a complaint process, much like other legal activity in the U.S. \n \n \n \n \nThen, if that is your view and if it is the view of most parents, then schools hiring teachers should make sure that the teachers are knowledgable about a wide range of contraversial views and, if it is relevant to the subject they teach, should present relevant views fairly. If a teacher comes from a school that only presents one view, then they can take extra classes to learn about the opposing views. \n\n \n And these things aren't happening, but again, I don't think it's a question of knowledge, it's a question of bias. \n \n \nThe bottom line is that this needs to only affect the tiny percentage of college students that DO become K-12 teachers - not ALL the college students. \n\n \n Why? If neutrality / non indoctrination, as outlined in the 1915 principles is good for K-12 teachers, why is it not good for all professions? The 1915 principles should be applied equally. To propose a different kind of education for future K-12 teachers only, how far do you think that would get with todays teachers unions?\n \n \n \nWhere the great majority of college students are concerned, the needs of their profession should most influence their curriculum and any other education that they get should be unbiased only in the sense of not distorting any views. \n\n \n Yet we have loads of proof that views are being distorted, because we have proof that conservative views are often not permitted to be given. There are differing opinions on just which courses are strictly professional, partly professional, political (open for all discussion), or completely ideological (not open for discussions of all views.) Any strongly pro-Israel student who enrolls in the class \"The Politics and Poetics of Palestinian Resistance\" as described at Berkeley, with the intent of discussing it politically is going to have a very hard time surviving the course or getting a grade. The one professors comment that conservative students maybe should not enroll is proof it. \n \n \nWell, the university did eventually fire him after an investigation. As for the radical left and the university faculty and administration that supported him, I agree that some on the radical left can be too extreme in their thinking - as fixed and unmovable by reason as some of their counterparts on the radical right. \n\n \n I don't think they can be too extreme in their thinking, they can be too careless in where they choose to spout off about it, in todays world. The word treason hasn't been stricken from the dictionary, and communication today is dangerously quick. \n \n \nI have no intention of defending them. I suspect that some of the university faculty and administrators might have supported him since they valued academic freedom above all else and saw only a slippery slope of rigidly controlled subjects as an alternative.\n \n \n Their own academic freedom yes. Even brutal dictators like having their own freedom. \n \n \n \nAs for Ward Churchill, if he had solid argueable reasons for some of his contraversial stances, then he should have had the right to state them. I suspect that was not the case (i.e. he did not have solid arguements), but haven't looked into it in any detail.\n\n \n I think anyone has a right to state their stances, no matter how controversial. But when one is on the public payroll, 6 figures at that, and is teaching under the guidelines of the 1915 principles, his own professionalism should have prohibited him from stating them publically. In his home, yes; in a bar, yes; maybe even in front of a few students on private time, away from the classroom, without a microphone in his face. But broadcasted publically as they were? Of course not. \n \n \nI will continue to have to reserve judgement until I hear Berkeley's side of the story.\n\n \n How about if you never hear their side of the story? Would their silence tell you anything? As I said, I have read Horowitz' debates with a few of these people. Since I'm sure you're not going to see any explanation from Berkeley faculty, how about if I do it for them? \"We're not going to explain it, because there are no rules in place that require us to explain it. We're educated, we know how to educate, and it's none of your business how we alter education guidelines.\" \n \n Is it or is it not the publics business when current facultys change traditional teaching guidelines? \n \n \n \nBut why should people in general have a say about a particular profession? It is people of those professions that know best about the needs of that profession and the knowledge base that is relevant for it. \n\n \n \n You seem to put a great distinction between professional and ordinary people. Even professionals aren't always perfect, have you never seen one who may come up just a little short in the common sense department? An educated person missing some common sense can be quite dangerous, they are often more influential, and can be the last to suspect that they don't know what they are talking about when they go outside their narrow fields. And they often must do that in routine activity in their own fields. \n \n \n \nA political process would make it possible for a large number of non-experts to be making an ill-informed decision for universities. I would much prefer that the individual professions have the great influence - not people in general. There, the universities are partly self-regulating since a degree that is irrelevant for a particular profession will make it very difficult for the student to get a job in that profession or, if he gets a job, it will be very difficult for him to succeed at that job. \n\n \n I don't think the ABOR drags the general public into it to the degree that you imply. \n \n \n \nPeople who do business with the Middle East (oil or other commodities) have to know about the culture and history that are relevant - and the Israeli/Palestinian conflict being high on the minds of those in the Middle East, it would be wise for businessmen to know something about it. The same is true for politicians and diplomats that have dealings with the Middle East. Historians who teach about that part of the world, in universities or high schools, also need to be familiar with the Israeli/Palestinian conflicts. \n\n \n \n But as we saw by the \"conservatives shouldn't take this course\", it wasn't an objective study for capitalist businessmen. It was clearly an indoctrination course, as prohibited by the Sproul clause, and of course, in violation of the 1915 principles. \n \n \n \nScience deals with understanding reality based on verifiable evidence. Since there has been no verifiable evidence about the supernatural, then there are clear reasons why Science does not address it. If there was irrefutable evidence, then I am sure that many scientists would jump on board. Unfortunately, since often enough, \"evidence\" for the supernatural was presented that was easily refutes, it would make it all the harder for any hypothetically real evidence for the supernatural to be able to be accepted. However, solid repeatable evidence would ultimately be hard to deny and would have to eventually be accepted by Science.

They may or may not be right, but they base their assumptions on known rules of chemistry and physics and do not need to put in any \"fudge factors\" of an unknown force to get their ideas at least to be consistent with reality. \n\n \n There are many different positions on what is, and is not verifiable evidence. Science seems to spend a lot of time and resources trying to string together this and string together that in search of atheistic conclusions. Don't universities exist for the benefit of society as a whole? Is society calling for this type of study? Besides the thrill of eyebrow raising suspicions that there may be no God, how does this study benefit society? \n \n \nCertainly, there are scientists that are very attached to their pet theories and some of those scientists can be very influencial, but, ultimately, evidence always wins the day with science. One can claim that science is biased against those things that show no evidence of themselves, but I see nothing wrong with such a bias since a neutral stance, in such a case, would undermine the scientific method itself and make it useless. \n\n \n I think that much of what science does is pretty useless. Suppositions about prehistoric events and searches for atheist comforts are two of them. \n \n \nSome students may choose a school because they like the social climate (as with \"party schools\"). However, most students, especially after their Freshman years (when they are first experiencing the heady freedom from parental supervision), do think about their careers. As for bankrupcies, I think that would be a more useful course to have in high school since everyone has to deal with finances in their lives. \n\n \n I agree it should be in high schools. It could probably be covered completely in high school - living within ones means isn't rocket science. But if 19% of college age students (what, 18-22, 18-26, something like that) is compared with non-college students of those age groups, it's a sure bet that the non college students bankrupcies are nowhere near those percentages. I understand of course, that the credit card sharks target college students far more than they do non-college students, and that's probably 90% of the problem, that's another debate. But my point is, why does this not bother college administration enough for them to attempt to do something pretty drastic and noticable about it? Our constitution is largely about personal liberty, is personal responsibility not a close cousin of that? Isn't that a basic of education? Or could it be that personal responsibility, our constitution, and many other traditional things aren't on the same level with college faculty as they are with the general public that supports them? \n \n \nI think policing by politics is dangerous since politics is, by its very nature, biased and too rarely based on rational discussion and solid arguements. I would prefer the needs of the profession to decide. \n\n \n Concerning the ABOR, you said earlier that you were \"on the fence\" about whether or not it should be implemented, and I'm sure you still are somewhat, you are just playing devils advocate here, to bring out my details of why I'm for it, and I appreciate it. But I just can't buy your constant implication that just about every college course is strictly tied to a profession. There are capitalist professions and social professions (teaching, social working), but there are many college courses that aren't strictly tied to either, and even the social professions can be politically controversial. \n \n \n \nI guess I am mostly afraid of the slippery slope - the idea that politics will try to force in ideas by force of numbers, not by the merit of the ideas themselves. \n\n \n But the merit has to be determined by someone. Force of numbers isn't all there is in a democracy, but usually has to be used in matters that are not basic and established. Or when merit does have to be left in the hands of a few, I'd prefer those few were elected, not tenured. Lots of difference. \n \n \nWell, the best generals have always known that it is important to understand ones enemy.\n\n \n But not when it's taught from the perspective of the enemy, as many college professors clearly are. As I said earlier, there are rewards for undermining American society and its values.",

   "This is an interesting and well presented debate.\n \n For anyone that may care, here's my take on it -\n \n I think the ideas behind the ABOR have some merit. There should be a mechanism by which academic standards are maintained. However, it would seem to me that the ABOR is just a rehash of previously existing academic regulations and guidelines that are widely accepted. The problem is in the enforcement of these guidelines, not in the guidelines themselves.\n \n If the ABOR is not meant to regulate and enforce, then what purpose does it serve, other than to add more red tape and bureaucracy to an area that is already over burdened by those very things? \n \n Even worse IMHO, is that I see the ABOR as a means of removing autonomy from the universities and replacing it with gov't enforced regulations. Those regulations will no longer be of the universities doing or control, but rather put in place by the politicians, lobbyists and bureaucrats that now control gov't, the vast majority of whom are unqualified to be enacting such regulations. Not my idea of the right move, in fact, it's the opposite.\n \n What I see in those pushing the ABOR is a back door attempt to affect the curriculum of universities according to their beliefs. To force the introduction and teaching of ideas or political views of the \"majority\" while trampling the rights of the individual. However, IMHO, in this case the \"majority\" is anything but, it's actually a rather small group individuals posing as the majority that are highly motivated to affect change to further their own agenda.\n \n In the two examples given in the debate, I see clear bias emerging. In one case by blatant omission of facts in an effort to convince those without a complete understanding of the situation or the way that university degrees work that there is wrong being done and a need for the ABOR. In the case of the Berkely decision, there is no other side being presented, and when that info is asked for, the lack of it is brushed aside by snide remarks.\n \n Universities, IMHO, are places of free and open learning. The gov't should butt out and stay out, as should the \"majority\". The only interest the gov't has in universities, and it is an indirect one, is that they continue to produce graduates that drive the economy and better our society. Obviously not all graduates are created equally, that would be an unrealistic goal. All graduates will obviously not hold the same moral, political, religious, etc... views, that also is completely unrealistic. As a result, not everyone is going to agree on a better economy and a better society, that's just reality.\n \n Academic freedom is paramount, and I for one would fight for that freedom. The freedom for professors to teach and present as they choose, and the freedom for students to choose their universities, classes and professors. That's fundamental IMHO, and protected in the Constitution.\n \n The idea that offering a course on suicide bombers or on trying to understand or even empathize with the \"enemy\" is somehow treasonous is ludicrous to me. Whether you're in favour of peace by the pen or the sword, understanding your enemy and their motivations is critical. I find it outright laughable to think that Osama bin Laden or any other terrorist or suicide bomber out there is somehow comforted or embolded by the likes of Ward Churchill. \n \n However, I do agree that with that freedom comes responsibility. That responsibility is shared among the university directors, faculty, and ultimately, the students. It is up to all of them to insure the quality and completeness of their education.\n \n Lastly, it comes down to this for me - a university education is not a right, it's a priviledge. It's a matter of choice best left to the individual. \n \n Waxy",

   "Another opinion", 
   "Why yes! frontpagemag \n \n Oh, you wanted a link from Berkeley? I'm afraid I don't have one, I can't get excited about looking for something that probably doesn't exist. After reading a few of Horowitz' debates with people of similar ilk of the Berkeley faculty, I can just imagine that they didn't have anything to say about it. Without the ABOR, would they be under any obligation to say anything?\n\n After a bit more searching, I did end up finding a relevant link from Berkeley about their decision on the Sproul clause:\n http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/assembly/jul2003/jul2003whole.pdf\n \n Excerpts from page 17 of that link, referring to that English course:\n \nIn this instance...the application of current APM 010 <they are referring also to the Sproul clause< would have disqualified the instructor from teaching by virtue of the fact that he cared passionately about the subject he was teaching. Passion links to the motivation behind actions. A common notion among the lay public or those who do not have a good understanding of academic freedom is that scholarship and teaching should be value neutral. According to this notion, a scholar is disinterested, or should not care strongly about what he/she is doing. This position is, however, not tenable in the contemporary world. Of course there are cases where faculty are passionate about their work and their passion occludes judgment. But then, it is their judgment that needs to be evaluated, not their motivation.\n \n The proposed APM 010 <which would replace the Sproul clause< -- rather than questioning the motivation behind teaching and research -- would question whether what is in a course description, or done in a classroom, or written on a page is competent and meets professional standards. Motivations and beliefs are irrelevant. The proposed new statement would allow faculty to care deeply about their work or strongly state their opinions as long as that is done in a manner consistent with the goal of instilling in students \"a mature independence of mind\" (see para.1 of proposed statement). In this example, the current statement on academic freedom and the proposed new statement lead to fundamentally different conclusions.\n \n Another case brings out further differences between the two documents. <referring to Sproul statement vs new version< The current academic freedom statement, as written by President Sproul, is a political bargain stipulating that the University stays out of politics and the state stays out of scholarship. The deal-making nature of this statement is politically pragmatic, but seriously misrepresents the fundamentals of academic freedom. What provides the basis of academic freedom is not a political bargain, but the mission of the University...During the controversy surrounding the Free Speech Movement, UC President Clarke Kerr attempted to limit speech on the Berkeley campus, reiterating the Sproul statement. According to this view, the University would uphold its part of the bargain with the state by not allowing students to speak about political events. This was, however, an untenable position that had disastrous results. Political pragmatism and accommodation are not what academic freedom rests on.\n\n It is interesting to note that the Sproul clause, being such a political bargain with the state, would have also itself prevented the introduction of the ABOR - in not allowing the state to have a say in scholarship at the university.\n \n Because of these reasons and perhaps others, they made some changes to the text. However, unlike what Horowitz suggests, it does not leave professors free to act however they want. There is a long list of responsibilities and restrictions to the behavior of professors that can lead to discipline from the university - mostly listed around page 22 of that link. Among other things listed as unacceptable behavior :\n \n2. Discrimination, including harassment, against a student on political grounds, or for reasons of race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, ...\n 4. Use of the position of powers of a faculty member to coerce the judgment or conscience of a student or to cause harm to a student for arbitrary or personal reasons.\n\n So, there are specific provisions that would have refrained the graduate school instructor of that course on Palestine to be biased against a student only due to their political beliefs. \n \nIt would restore a new attention to established principles that are currently in place, but are being largely ignored today. Each case would be examined by university personel through a complaint process, much like other legal activity in the U.S. \n\n That doesn't go into detail about how the ABOR would work. Perhaps those details don't exist, or Horowitz hasn't detailed them. In that case, I would find the ambiguity of the definition and limits of its powers frightening - injustice can hide in ambiguity. If you do know a detailed way in which it would work, please state it.\n \nWhy? If neutrality / non indoctrination, as outlined in the 1915 principles is good for K-12 teachers, why is it not good for all professions? The 1915 principles should be applied equally. To propose a different kind of education for future K-12 teachers only, how far do you think that would get with todays teachers unions?\n\n You think that it would be any easier with universities? Besides, ease of enacting a policy does not define the worth of a policy. Also, what do you mean by indoctrination? If you mean that teachers cannot intimidate students with opposing opinions, independent of those students actions or misrepresent views, then it seems like universities (Berkeley included) already hold provisions against that. I wouldn't mind having some outside provision (such as some version of the ABOR) which addresses discrimination against students or purposely distorted representations of opposing views. However, I suspect that you think that neutrality means that all views are presented as equally valid. I disagree with that. Again, I don't mind the professor having views based on his knowledge. He just shouldn't misrepresent either his view or the opposing view, or discriminate against students of the opposing view.\n \nYet we have loads of proof that views are being distorted, because we have proof that conservative views are often not permitted to be given. There are differing opinions on just which courses are strictly professional, partly professional, political (open for all discussion), or completely ideological (not open for discussions of all views.) Any strongly pro-Israel student who enrolls in the class \"The Politics and Poetics of Palestinian Resistance\" as described at Berkeley, with the intent of discussing it politically is going to have a very hard time surviving the course or getting a grade. The one professors comment that conservative students maybe should not enroll is proof it. \n\n And Berkeley changed the course description and put monitors in his classroom so that wouldn't happen. I have been in some classrooms where someone who opposes the teaching can distract the whole course for weeks because of long, drawn out comments. Perhaps that is what the Berkeley professor was trying to avoid, but he certainly did not go about it the right way. If he was planning on discriminating on pro-Israeli students independent of their behavior, then I am glad that he is being monitored. The issue ended up resolving itself even without an ABOR. \n \n However, I acknowledge that there might be some situations in schools where a biased professor gets away with discriminating against students of opposing views. Again, if the ABOR limits itself to such discrimination and to clear misrepresentation of opposing views, then I would be for it, depending on how it would plan to go about that. However, much of what I am hearing from you suggests that it can go much farther in restricting, for example, the curricula of universities.\n \nI don't think they can be too extreme in their thinking, they can be too careless in where they choose to spout off about it, in todays world. The word treason hasn't been stricken from the dictionary, and communication today is dangerously quick.\n\n If they were speaking about secret military locations, giving up nuclear secrets, disclosing names of covert CIA agents, etc, then I would also call it treasonous. However, the right to criticize the actions of our government was something that this country was built on. If you call critics of our government actions treasonous, then you would also have to call our founding fathers (Jefferson, etc.) treasonous for supporting such criticism. I love this country for its freedoms - including freedom to protest and criticize US actions. Without that, we might as well be a dictatorship.\n \nTheir own academic freedom yes. Even brutal dictators like having their own freedom. \n\n No student is forced to take a particular course. If they don't like the curriculum of a university, they can go to another one. That is voting with ones feet - unlike a dictatorship where people get no choice.\n \nI think anyone has a right to state their stances, no matter how controversial. But when one is on the public payroll, 6 figures at that, and is teaching under the guidelines of the 1915 principles, his own professionalism should have prohibited him from stating them publically. In his home, yes; in a bar, yes; maybe even in front of a few students on private time, away from the classroom, without a microphone in his face. But broadcasted publically as they were? Of course not. \n\n If he was off-the-wall with his comments, then I could understand him getting fired for unprofessional, incompetent behavior. If he had well supported reasons, then why shouldn't he state those in public? Stating his views in public is not the same thing as discriminating against students who oppose his views. I would support the former but discipline the latter.\n \nYou seem to put a great distinction between professional and ordinary people. Even professionals aren't always perfect, have you never seen one who may come up just a little short in the common sense department? An educated person missing some common sense can be quite dangerous, they are often more influential, and can be the last to suspect that they don't know what they are talking about when they go outside their narrow fields. And they often must do that in routine activity in their own fields.\n\n But at least they know their field, which is what is most important as an influence in a university. I would trust the field of professionals in influencing the relevant area of study far more than I would trust politicians (God forbid) or the general public. Decisions based on ignorance are rarely good.\n \nThere are many different positions on what is, and is not verifiable evidence. Science seems to spend a lot of time and resources trying to string together this and string together that in search of atheistic conclusions. Don't universities exist for the benefit of society as a whole? Is society calling for this type of study? Besides the thrill of eyebrow raising suspicions that there may be no God, how does this study benefit society? \n \n I think that much of what science does is pretty useless. Suppositions about prehistoric events and searches for atheist comforts are two of them. \n\n To be honest, this part of our discussion, though interesting, could divert us greatly from the main topic at hand. Lets leave it for another time since I know that it could get long.\n \nI agree it should be in high schools. It could probably be covered completely in high school - living within ones means isn't rocket science. But if 19% of college age students (what, 18-22, 18-26, something like that) is compared with non-college students of those age groups, it's a sure bet that the non college students bankrupcies are nowhere near those percentages. I understand of course, that the credit card sharks target college students far more than they do non-college students, and that's probably 90% of the problem, that's another debate. But my point is, why does this not bother college administration enough for them to attempt to do something pretty drastic and noticable about it? Our constitution is largely about personal liberty, is personal responsibility not a close cousin of that? Isn't that a basic of education? Or could it be that personal responsibility, our constitution, and many other traditional things aren't on the same level with college faculty as they are with the general public that supports them? \n\n The university is not there to teach general life skills - those are the responsibility of high schools and parents. I would think that, if there really is such a trend of college student's bankrupcies, then responsible universities might set up optional non-academic classes or short seminars for students to learn financial responsibility. I am sure that many universities do, though I do not know the statistics. It just doesn't fit in an official curriculum, as it would fit in a high school curriculum. As for college students vs students outside of college, working for a living teaches one financial responsibility very quickly. College students are in the unusual position of having money to spend and having some legal independence from parents before they have to work for a living. I agree that that can cause problems.\n \nConcerning the ABOR, you said earlier that you were \"on the fence\" about whether or not it should be implemented, and I'm sure you still are somewhat, you are just playing devils advocate here, to bring out my details of why I'm for it, and I appreciate it. But I just can't buy your constant implication that just about every college course is strictly tied to a profession. There are capitalist professions and social professions (teaching, social working), but there are many college courses that aren't strictly tied to either, and even the social professions can be politically controversial. \n\n Well, where the ABOR is concerned, as I stated a few times already, I would support it if it restricted itself to eliminating biased teaching from the point of view of teachers purposely misrepresenting opposing views or discriminating against students of opposing views, independent of the students' actions. I would not support the ABOR restricting university curricula.\n \n As for courses and curricula, as I mentioned before, the majority of courses students take are in their field of study but there is usually at least one course a semester that is taken outside of it. Having done my undergraduate studies in a polytechnic, I was certainly glad of that opportunity, since it enriched my studies. Some of those classes might be related to studies for another profession, but not always. Rarely are particular courses required for a degree that have nothing to do with the degree. Students can choose, so a student is not forced to take such an unrelated class that he might disagree with. I guess that I just don't see much of a problem. If a particular university does not appeal to someone of a particular political persuasion because of a limited curriculum in their political interest, there are other universities that would appeal to them. If there is a major change in public perceptions, then universities might ultimately start losing students and would set up departments to cater to students of other disciplines. \n \nBut the merit has to be determined by someone. Force of numbers isn't all there is in a democracy, but usually has to be used in matters that are not basic and established. Or when merit does have to be left in the hands of a few, I'd prefer those few were elected, not tenured. Lots of difference. \n\n But those who are tenured know a lot more about the subject than those who are elected. Besides, those who are tenured do have to care about whether students attend the university or not, so they do have to care what is relevant for their field - for the sake of their students and also for the sake of their own reputations. They do not have to care what the general populace think, but I don't think that they should have to. Universities do not exist for the benefit of the public at large but for the benefit of their students and for the professions that they are trying to get their students into.\n \nBut not when it's taught from the perspective of the enemy, as many college professors clearly are. As I said earlier, there are rewards for undermining American society and its values.\n\n I don't think that anyone is teaching that suicide bombing is a good tactic that should be pursued and here is how. What they might be teaching is the socio-economic-religious forces that might drive someone to be a suicide bomber to begin with. That helps understand their motivations which (1) can help stop them if you can predict what they might do, and (2) might help stop them if one alleviates the socio-economic situation that might have driven them to suicide bombing to begin with. Violence is not the only solution. Just as with crime in poor neighborhoods, one can address the causes while continuing to stop the crime. A two-pronged approach often works best.",

   "This is an interesting and well presented debate.\n \n For anyone that may care, here's my take on it -\n \n I think the ideas behind the ABOR have some merit. There should be a mechanism by which academic standards are maintained. However, it would seem to me that the ABOR is just a rehash of previously existing academic regulations and guidelines that are widely accepted. The problem is in the enforcement of these guidelines, not in the guidelines themselves. \n\n \n That's all it is - a rehash of existing regulations. But it's a very concise rehash, a really effective condensation of them. It gets attention because it's brief. Existing regulations can be detailed and boring to the point of being forgotten and ignored. That's what we're seeing in todays universities.\n \n \nIf the ABOR is not meant to regulate and enforce, then what purpose does it serve, other than to add more red tape and bureaucracy to an area that is already over burdened by those very things? \n\n \n \n It's not meant to regulate and enforce anything that's not already in place. It's not MORE red tape and bureaucracy if all it does is attempt to restore and protect existing, traditional standards. \n \n Other than funding issues of course, what red tape and bureaucracies do you see universities over burdened with? \n \n \n \nEven worse IMHO, is that I see the ABOR as a means of removing autonomy from the universities and replacing it with gov't enforced regulations. Those regulations will no longer be of the universities doing or control, but rather put in place by the politicians, lobbyists and bureaucrats that now control gov't, the vast majority of whom are unqualified to be enacting such regulations. Not my idea of the right move, in fact, it's the opposite. \n\n \n \n This goes back to my first post regarding non-profit organizations. I can think of no other organization that is so heavily dependent on government funding that seeks and receives so much independence from the political process. Can you?\n \n \n \nWhat I see in those pushing the ABOR is a back door attempt to affect the curriculum of universities according to their beliefs. \n\n \n \n I see no \"beliefs\" contained in the ABOR. Which seems more like a backdoor attempt to affect curriculums - a restoration of existing, traditional standards (the ABOR) or a current faculty vote to remove the Sproul clause? \n \n \n \n To force the introduction and teaching of ideas or political views of the \"majority\" while trampling the rights of the individual. However, IMHO, in this case the \"majority\" is anything but, it's actually a rather small group individuals posing as the majority that are highly motivated to affect change to further their own agenda. \n\n \n \n I don't see the small group of individuals \"posing\" as the majority, I see them trying to represent the majority. Public outcries whenever someone like Ward Churchills comments and actions find their way into the news are a clear indicator that the public is not completely disinterested in these things. Too bad the removal of the Sproul clause isn't considered a very newsworthy story by the U.S. media. If the ABOR was in place, maybe it would be. \n \n \n \nIn the two examples given in the debate, I see clear bias emerging. In one case by blatant omission of facts in an effort to convince those without a complete understanding of the situation or the way that university degrees work that there is wrong being done and a need for the ABOR. In the case of the Berkely decision, there is no other side being presented, and when that info is asked for, the lack of it is brushed aside by snide remarks. \n\n \n \n You're going to see \"bias\" whenever someone presents one side of a controversial subject. I've gone into pretty much detail in an understanding of the situation, have you? I've pinpointed some \"wrong being done\". In what way do university degrees work that is different from generations past? \n \n \n \nUniversities, IMHO, are places of free and open learning. The gov't should butt out and stay out, as should the \"majority\". \n\n \n If the government, and the public butt out and stay out, who will remain to be free? Faculty and students, or just faculty? If your answer is both faculty AND students, I can load you up with examples of students who don't feel very free. \n \n \n \n The only interest the gov't has in universities, and it is an indirect one, is that they continue to produce graduates that drive the economy and better our society. Obviously not all graduates are created equally, that would be an unrealistic goal. All graduates will obviously not hold the same moral, political, religious, etc... views, that also is completely unrealistic. As a result, not everyone is going to agree on a better economy and a better society, that's just reality. \n\n \n \n But just about everyone should be able to agree on neutraility, when controversial subjects are actually engaged in, or when they're suppressed. People on both sides tend to project their own opinion as fact. Reasonable people with considerably different political views should be able to basically agree where undisputed facts stop and where political opinion starts. The ABOR would encourage that. \n \n \n \nAcademic freedom is paramount, and I for one would fight for that freedom. The freedom for professors to teach and present as they choose, and the freedom for students to choose their universities, classes and professors. That's fundamental IMHO, and protected in the Constitution. \n\n \n \"Academic freedom\" - both sides use that phrase frequently. To one side, it means the freedom for one political faction to dominate and control the education establishment in a pluralistic democracy. To the other side, academic freedom doesn't exist without the neutrality in hiring, promotions, grading, and open discussion, that things like the 1915 principles, the Sproul clause, and the ABOR all promote. Telling students who are being discriminated against to get lost, move hundreds of miles away to another non-profit, government supported university and hope it doesn't discriminate, isn't realistic. \n \n \nThe idea that offering a course on suicide bombers or on trying to understand or even empathize with the \"enemy\" is somehow treasonous is ludicrous to me. Whether you're in favour of peace by the pen or the sword, understanding your enemy and their motivations is critical. I find it outright laughable to think that Osama bin Laden or any other terrorist or suicide bomber out there is somehow comforted or embolded by the likes of Ward Churchill. \n\n \n The term is propaganda - it's always been useful in past conventional wars to demoralize the enemy, but it's reached new heights with terrorism, and todays instantaneous communication. Demoralizing with propaganda from within is very important in terrorism. From the Ward Churchills and Cindy Sheehans to the CNN's and the NY Times, when all these sources are telling us through video and news columns that we are losing American lives in an unnecessary war, and that our leaders are corrupt and lying to us, then we, as a society, will tend to believe this propaganda and allow fear to cause us to do things that our enemies like for us to do. \n \n \nHowever, I do agree that with that freedom comes responsibility. That responsibility is shared among the university directors, faculty, and ultimately, the students. It is up to all of them to insure the quality and completeness of their education. \n\n \n And how many examples would it take to convince you that it's not happening well enough? Are university faculties the only ones qualified to determine what quality and completeness is? Are they fulfilling that responsibility when they strike out the Sproul Clause, ignore the 1915 principles, ignore the thousands of students who favor the ABOR? \n \n \nLastly, it comes down to this for me - a university education is not a right, it's a priviledge. It's a matter of choice best left to the individual. \n \n Waxy\n\n \n Choice in todays universities isn't the same as it was a half century ago. The ABOR restores that choice.",

   "After a bit more searching, I did end up finding a relevant link from Berkeley about their decision on the Sproul clause:\n http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/assembly/jul2003/jul2003whole.pdf \n\n \n \n That's a good link - whenever I tried to find exactly what the Sproul clause said, I was always coming up with Horowitz' abbreviated version of it. Your link appears to show all of it, and I don't see anything in what Horowitz left out that hurts his argument - he must have been editing simply to make it more readable. If you disagree, let me know. \n \n \n \nExcerpts from page 17 of that link, referring to that English course:\n \n It is interesting to note that the Sproul clause, being such a political bargain with the state, would have also itself prevented the introduction of the ABOR - in not allowing the state to have a say in scholarship at the university. \n\n \n I disagree - let's look at what they both actually say;\n \n Sproul clause;\n \nThe University of California is the creature of the State and its loyalty to the State will never waiver. It will not aid nor will it condone actions contrary to the laws of the state. Its high function - and its high privilidge, the University will steadily continue to fulfill serving the people by providing facilities for investigation and teaching free from domination by parties, sects, or selfish interests. The University expects the State, in return, and to its own great gain, to protect this indispensable freedom, a freedom like the freedom of the press, that is the heritage and the right of a free people. \n\n \n Now the relevant part of your above excerpt;\n \nThe current academic freedom statement, as written by President Sproul, is a political bargain stipulating that the University stays out of politics and the state stays out of scholarship.\n\n \n See what happens when they're laid side by side, with relevant sentences highlighted? The statement is NOT a \"political bargain\" keeping the state \"out\". It clearly says the state is \"expected\" to \"protect this freedom, freedom from selfish interests. When one current faculty is this dishonest in representing traditional principles, its clear that selfish interests are taking over. That alone is proof that the ABOR is needed. \n \n \n \nBecause of these reasons and perhaps others, they made some changes to the text. \n\n \n More of those \"reasons\" were not facts, they were merely 21st century opinion. Lets look at some more. They said;\n \n (Berkeley)\n \nIn this instance...the application of current APM 010 <they are referring also to the Sproul clause< would have disqualified the instructor from teaching by virtue of the fact that he cared passionately about the subject he was teaching. Passion links to the motivation behind actions. \n\n \n More from the Sproul clause that Horowitz left out;\n \nThe University is founded upon faith in intelligence and knowledge and it must defend their free operation. It must rely upon truth to combat error. Its obligation is to see that the conditions under which questions are examined are those which give play to intellect rather than to passion. \n\n \n It' clear that Sproul was giving intellect more merit than passion, since passion is highly emotional, likely to be driven by ideology, and \"parties, sects, and selfish interests\". Pure common sense, purely in keeping with previously established principles and guidelines. All those who overturned the Sproul clause said was that passion matters, and motivations and beliefs are irrelevant!! They aren't correcting or updating the Sproul Clause, they're simply changing it so their own selfish interests aren't blocked by it. \n \n (Berkeley)\n \nA common notion among the lay public or those who do not have a good understanding of academic freedom is that scholarship and teaching should be value neutral. \n\n \n It was a common notion of academia only a few decades ago!!\n \n (Berkeley)\n \nAccording to this notion, a scholar is disinterested, or should not care strongly about what he/she is doing. This position is, however, not tenable in the contemporary world. \n\n \n This is dishonest, pure and simple. They know there is a dividing line between the facts of a subject, vs. opinion of a subject - the unsettled character of human knowledge. Balances of intellect vs. passion have not changed one bit from a century ago to the \"contemporary world\".\n \n \n \nHowever, unlike what Horowitz suggests, it does not leave professors free to act however they want. \n\n \n Sure it does - whenever they get in trouble, they hide behind the word \"passion\", and get nothing more than a slap on the wrist, maybe an occasional firing to ward off the ABOR. How long before all universities in the U.S. destroy the entire 1915 principles with this kind of dishonesty?? \n \n \n \nThere is a long list of responsibilities and restrictions to the behavior of professors that can lead to discipline from the university - mostly listed around page 22 of that link. Among other things listed as unacceptable behavior \n \n So, there are specific provisions that would have refrained the graduate school instructor of that course on Palestine to be biased against a student only due to their political beliefs. \n\n \n But are these provisions working? The www.noindoctrination.org link from my post #3 is an indicator that they're not. Will this get better, or worse as time goes on? It will get worse without the ABOR, better with it. \n \n \n \nThat doesn't go into detail about how the ABOR would work. Perhaps those details don't exist, or Horowitz hasn't detailed them. In that case, I would find the ambiguity of the definition and limits of its powers frightening - injustice can hide in ambiguity. If you do know a detailed way in which it would work, please state it. \n\n \n I find what has been done to the Sproul clause more frightening than the ABOR without details. I certainly agree that injustice can hide in ambiguity - I find the 408 words of the ABOR far less ambiguous than the page 17 excerpts that you copy/pasted above, let alone the thousands of other similar examples of political bias in U.S. Universities today. \n \n \n \nYou think that it would be any easier with universities? Besides, ease of enacting a policy does not define the worth of a policy. Also, what do you mean by indoctrination? If you mean that teachers cannot intimidate students with opposing opinions, independent of those students actions or misrepresent views, then it seems like universities (Berkeley included) already hold provisions against that. I wouldn't mind having some outside provision (such as some version of the ABOR) which addresses discrimination against students or purposely distorted representations of opposing views. \n\n \n \n That's really about all the ABOR does in its current form. Why don't you break down the parts of it that concern you with its corresponding paragraph number? \n \n \n \nHowever, I suspect that you think that neutrality means that all views are presented as equally valid. I disagree with that. \n\n \n \n That's not what I think at all, and that's not what the ABOR says. In paragraph 4, it says; \"[teachers] should consider and make their students aware of other viewpoints.\" It doesn't say ALL viewpoints, the implication is other viewpoints that are relevant in todays U.S. society. There's nothing hidden or tricky about it. \n \n \nAgain, I don't mind the professor having views based on his knowledge. He just shouldn't misrepresent either his view or the opposing view, or discriminate against students of the opposing view. \n\n \n But should it be based on his passion, in this contemporary world? What's different today, concerning the separation of fact from opinion? Those with the responsibility of teaching, no matter what their political views, should be able to agree on where to draw the line. Sproul cared about doing it, why doesn't the current faculty at Berkeley? \n \n \nAnd Berkeley changed the course description and put monitors in his classroom so that wouldn't happen. I have been in some classrooms where someone who opposes the teaching can distract the whole course for weeks because of long, drawn out comments. Perhaps that is what the Berkeley professor was trying to avoid, but he certainly did not go about it the right way. If he was planning on discriminating on pro-Israeli students independent of their behavior, then I am glad that he is being monitored. The issue ended up resolving itself even without an ABOR. \n\n \n I think the current presence (the current threat) of the ABOR is causing a few good things like this to happen. If the ABOR is completely scrapped, do you think they will continue to happen? \n \n \nHowever, I acknowledge that there might be some situations in schools where a biased professor gets away with discriminating against students of opposing views. Again, if the ABOR limits itself to such discrimination and to clear misrepresentation of opposing views, then I would be for it, depending on how it would plan to go about that. However, much of what I am hearing from you suggests that it can go much farther in restricting, for example, the curricula of universities. \n\n \n I think it would make substantial progress in eliminating discrimination against conservatives, while only mildly affecting curricula. I see todays discrimination as a far bigger problem than curriculum issues. \n \n \nIf they were speaking about secret military locations, giving up nuclear secrets, disclosing names of covert CIA agents, etc, then I would also call it treasonous. However, the right to criticize the actions of our government was something that this country was built on. If you call critics of our government actions treasonous, then you would also have to call our founding fathers (Jefferson, etc.) treasonous for supporting such criticism. I love this country for its freedoms - including freedom to protest and criticize US actions. Without that, we might as well be a dictatorship. \n\n \n Here's what Ward Churchill said; :xcensored \n \n \nThe [Pentagon] and those inside comprised military targets, pure and simple. As to those in the World Trade Center: Well, really. Let's get a grip here, shall we? True enough, they were civilians of a sort. But innocent? Gimme a break. They formed a technocratic corps at the very heart of Americas global financial empire - the 'mighty engine of profit' to which the military dimension of U.S. policy has always been enslaved - and they did so both willingly and knowingly. If there was a better, more effective, or in fact any other way of visiting some penalty befitting their participation upon the little Eichmanns inhabiting the sterile sanctuary of the twin towers, I'd be really interested in hearing about it.\" \n\n \n That's not a criticism of current government actions, that's the hatred of a free markets system, a hatred of America. It's not comparable with anything the U.S. founders said about Great Britain, or all of Europe. Did the U.S. founders make disparaging, sarcastic remarks about the citizens of Great Britian? \n \n The gracious invitation Churchill received to speak at Hamilton College on January of 2005 was his FORTIETH speaking invitation from campuses all across the U.S. in the three years since he made the above statements. No wonder it took 2 1/2 years for him to finally be fired. It says something about this brand new passion, this new contemporary culture of U.S. universities. What says more, the 2 1/2 years, or the 40 speaking invitations? \n \n \n \nNo student is forced to take a particular course. If they don't like the curriculum of a university, they can go to another one. That is voting with ones feet - unlike a dictatorship where people get no choice. \n\n \n Finances and family ties (geography) make that a lot easier said than done. From what I'm seeing from Horowitz' research and campus visits, and links like noindoctrination.org, a student is often well commited and settled before finding out how bad it really is, and has no way of knowing if the next nearest one, often hundreds of miles away, is any different. \n \n \n \nIf he was off-the-wall with his comments, then I could understand him getting fired for unprofessional, incompetent behavior. If he had well supported reasons, then why shouldn't he state those in public? Stating his views in public is not the same thing as discriminating against students who oppose his views. I would support the former but discipline the latter. \n\n \n In many cases I agree, but some like Churchills, were beyond controversial. They weren't well supported criticism of current government action, they were America hating treason. How late is it, when unelected people on the government payroll are making public statements like this? \n \n \nBut at least they know their field, which is what is most important as an influence in a university. I would trust the field of professionals in influencing the relevant area of study far more than I would trust politicians (God forbid) or the general public. Decisions based on ignorance are rarely good. \n\n \n \n It depends on the field. I agree with you if it's business, engineering, mathematics, agriculture, etc, but I disagree if it's humanities, social sciences, law, ethnic studies, feminist studies, or peace studies and the like. Do you think its as important to draw a distinction between the two basic differences in the types of studies that the above examples show, as it is to distinguish between where facts stop and opinions start? \n \n \n \nTo be honest, this part of our discussion, though interesting, could divert us greatly from the main topic at hand. Lets leave it for another time since I know that it could get long. \n\n \n Okay, we can save it for another time. But I think the difficulty everyone has in determining where facts stop and opinion starts in the natural sciences is a root cause for far left controls on todays universities to come up with brand new ideas about the unsettled nature of human knowledge, and their personal \"passions\". \n \n \nThe university is not there to teach general life skills - those are the responsibility of high schools and parents. \n\n \n If it was all business courses, or engineering, or mathematics, I would agree. But studies in humanities, social studies, ethnic studies, etc. aren't only teaching, they're ALTERING. In some cases they are undoing, reversing general life skills previously taught by high schools and parents, especially if the professors passion overrides his knowledge, if he makes no attempt to draw a line between fact and opinion. \n \n \nI would think that, if there really is such a trend of college student's bankrupcies, then responsible universities might set up optional non-academic classes or short seminars for students to learn financial responsibility. I am sure that many universities do, though I do not know the statistics. It just doesn't fit in an official curriculum, as it would fit in a high school curriculum. As for college students vs students outside of college, working for a living teaches one financial responsibility very quickly. College students are in the unusual position of having money to spend and having some legal independence from parents before they have to work for a living. I agree that that can cause problems.\n \n Well, where the ABOR is concerned, as I stated a few times already, I would support it if it restricted itself to eliminating biased teaching from the point of view of teachers purposely misrepresenting opposing views or discriminating against students of opposing views, independent of the students' actions. I would not support the ABOR restricting university curricula. \n\n \n I don't think it does, to any drastic degree. Again, I wish you'd pinpoint the parts of it that you find troubling. \n \n \nAs for courses and curricula, as I mentioned before, the majority of courses students take are in their field of study but there is usually at least one course a semester that is taken outside of it. Having done my undergraduate studies in a polytechnic, I was certainly glad of that opportunity, since it enriched my studies. Some of those classes might be related to studies for another profession, but not always. Rarely are particular courses required for a degree that have nothing to do with the degree. Students can choose, so a student is not forced to take such an unrelated class that he might disagree with. I guess that I just don't see much of a problem. If a particular university does not appeal to someone of a particular political persuasion because of a limited curriculum in their political interest, there are other universities that would appeal to them. If there is a major change in public perceptions, then universities might ultimately start losing students and would set up departments to cater to students of other disciplines. \n\n \n \n I agree, I'll take your word for it since I don't have the experiences that you have. But I don't think the ABOR threatens it. The ABOR is mostly about personal discrimination. \n \n \n \nBut those who are tenured know a lot more about the subject than those who are elected. Besides, those who are tenured do have to care about whether students attend the university or not, so they do have to care what is relevant for their field - for the sake of their students and also for the sake of their own reputations. They do not have to care what the general populace think, but I don't think that they should have to. Universities do not exist for the benefit of the public at large but for the benefit of their students and for the professions that they are trying to get their students into. \n\n \n \n The faculty of Berkeley agree with you. From the Sproul clause that they destroyed;\n \n \nThe University of California is the creature of the State, and its loyalty to the State will never waiver. It will not aid nor will it condone actions contrary to the laws of the State. Its high function, and its high privilege, the University will continue to fulfill, serving the people by providing facilities for investigation and teaching free from domination by parties, sects, or selfish interests. \n\n \n When did universities cease to recognize their privilege, their service to the people? \n \n \nI don't think that anyone is teaching that suicide bombing is a good tactic that should be pursued and here is how. What they might be teaching is the socio-economic-religious forces that might drive someone to be a suicide bomber to begin with. That helps understand their motivations which (1) can help stop them if you can predict what they might do, and (2) might help stop them if one alleviates the socio-economic situation that might have driven them to suicide bombing to begin with. Violence is not the only solution. Just as with crime in poor neighborhoods, one can address the causes while continuing to stop the crime. A two-pronged approach often works best.\n\n \n Ward Churchill stated that he couldn't think of a better way than suicide bombing, and that largely got him invitations to speak at 40 universities. \n \n If we have courses that try to teach and understand the motivations of suicide bombers, and are no longer concerned with keeping out domination by parties, sects, or selfish interests, we no longer have academic freedom.",

   "That's all it is - a rehash of existing regulations. But it's a very concise rehash, a really effective condensation of them. It gets attention because it's brief. Existing regulations can be detailed and boring to the point of being forgotten and ignored. That's what we're seeing in todays universities.\n\n \n So you're in favour then of taking the 1915 legislation, or all existing legislation for that matter, and replacing them with the \"dumbed down\" for convenience ABOR?\n \n If not, then what's the reason behind it? Style points? Catering to today's shorter attention spans and making academia more MTV friendly? This sounds like the argument of a teenager that doesn't want to actually read the book, but get the Cole's notes or watch the movie instead. My answer - TOUGH.\n \n I don't get it Marc, many things, perhaps most things of importance, when examined in the detail required to truly understand and benefit from them, are quite boring at times. That does NOT make them less valuable or effective.\n \n \nIt's not meant to regulate and enforce anything that's not already in place. It's not MORE red tape and bureaucracy if all it does is attempt to restore and protect existing, traditional standards.\n \n \n Then what's the point. Really?\n \n It is more red tape, plain and simple. You're adding legislation to legislation simply to \"restore and protect\" an already existing mechanism. A mechanism I might add, that you have no issue with, only seek to see it be enforced. The ABOR does not accomplish that goal.\n \n \nOther than funding issues of course, what red tape and bureaucracies do you see universities over burdened with? \n\n \n Funding, and more specifically, financial stability and security and major issues for many universities.\n \n I don't see them as currently being overly burdensome. Universities face all kinds of outside pressures regarding curriculum, scholarships, athletics, etc...\n \n \nThis goes back to my first post regarding non-profit organizations. I can think of no other organization that is so heavily dependent on government funding that seeks and receives so much independence from the political process. Can you?\n\n \n Universities must operate entirely differently in the USA than they do here. To the best of my knowledge, universities in Canada receive very little gov't funding. There are of course tax breaks, construction grants and the like that they receive, but those are extended to many corporate enterprises as well as other non-profits. Universities receive very little direct gov't funding.\n \n The single greatest contribution that gov't makes is in the sponsoring of scholarships and the support of new grads entering the work force in the form of taxation incentives.\n \n Anyhoo, to the point. Why should the universities be subject to more politics? I don't really understand where you're going with this line of thought. Is it beneficial in your mind to politicize universities?\n \n How about churches? Charity organizations? \n \n \nI see no \"beliefs\" contained in the ABOR. Which seems more like a backdoor attempt to affect curriculums - a restoration of existing, traditional standards (the ABOR) or a current faculty vote to remove the Sproul clause? \n\n \n Of course you don't.\n \n \nI don't see the small group of individuals \"posing\" as the majority, I see them trying to represent the majority. Public outcries whenever someone like Ward Churchills comments and actions find their way into the news are a clear indicator that the public is not completely disinterested in these things. Too bad the removal of the Sproul clause isn't considered a very newsworthy story by the U.S. media. If the ABOR was in place, maybe it would be. \n\n \n Trying to represent, and actually representing are very different things.\n \n It most likely wouldn't be front page news regardless of the ABOR. IMHO, to believe otherwise shows naivety of the US public in general.\n \n \nYou're going to see \"bias\" whenever someone presents one side of a controversial subject. I've gone into pretty much detail in an understanding of the situation, have you? I've pinpointed some \"wrong being done\". In what way do university degrees work that is different from generations past? \n\n \n As I stated in an exchange with JPSartre, it's relatively easy to dredge up the odd case of \"wrong\" being done. That doesn't impress me. There are 10's of thousands of university faculty members out there and thousands of universities. Finding a dozen, or even 50 instances that you can parade as abuse represents such a small minority as to be essentially insignificant. No matter what the case, or what the profession, there will be abuse and bad seeds. No legislation or rehash of existing regulation is going to prevent that.\n \n I'm not sure there are any significant differences. Technology and a \"global\" information system have certainly affected courses and how students learn, but IMHO, the fundamentals of university educations are largely unchanged.\n \n \nIf the government, and the public butt out and stay out, who will remain to be free? Faculty and students, or just faculty? If your answer is both faculty AND students, I can load you up with examples of students who don't feel very free. \n\n \n Both.\n \n Please do. \n \n Same as above, for every student you parade, there are likely 1000 other university graduates that are satisfied with their education and the freedom they had in choosing it.\n \n \nBut just about everyone should be able to agree on neutraility, when controversial subjects are actually engaged in, or when they're suppressed. People on both sides tend to project their own opinion as fact. Reasonable people with considerably different political views should be able to basically agree where undisputed facts stop and where political opinion starts. The ABOR would encourage that. \n\n \n Maybe, but doesn't existing legislation already cover it?\n \n Is \"encouragement\" enough to solve the perceived problem?\n \n \n\"Academic freedom\" - both sides use that phrase frequently. To one side, it means the freedom for one political faction to dominate and control the education establishment in a pluralistic democracy. To the other side, academic freedom doesn't exist without the neutrality in hiring, promotions, grading, and open discussion, that things like the 1915 principles, the Sproul clause, and the ABOR all promote. Telling students who are being discriminated against to get lost, move hundreds of miles away to another non-profit, government supported university and hope it doesn't discriminate, isn't realistic. \n\n \n What isn't realistic is your final sentence.\n \n \nThe term is propaganda - it's always been useful in past conventional wars to demoralize the enemy, but it's reached new heights with terrorism, and todays instantaneous communication. Demoralizing with propaganda from within is very important in terrorism. From the Ward Churchills and Cindy Sheehans to the CNN's and the NY Times, when all these sources are telling us through video and news columns that we are losing American lives in an unnecessary war, and that our leaders are corrupt and lying to us, then we, as a society, will tend to believe this propaganda and allow fear to cause us to do things that our enemies like for us to do. \n\n \n Wow. I don't even know where to start with this one. It's a whole new debate. \n \n I think the thecap0 pretty much summed up my opinion.\n \n Unquestioning loyalty to the existing administration and \" blind patriotism\" are every bit as treasonous to your country.\n \n \nAnd how many examples would it take to convince you that it's not happening well enough? Are university faculties the only ones qualified to determine what quality and completeness is? Are they fulfilling that responsibility when they strike out the Sproul Clause, ignore the 1915 principles, ignore the thousands of students who favor the ABOR? \n\n \n They might not be the only ones, but they certainly are the most qualified. Far more qualified than gov't bureaucrats or Joe Public.\n \n If you can find me, say 100 instances, such as your centerpiece \"Sproul Clause\" case from around the country, I'll start listening. At that point, it would move from the expected rare case of abuse to a potential problem. \n \n When the majority of students and faculty, or at least a large minority, support legislation such as the ABOR, I'll pay attention. From what I've seen, that's not the case.\n \n \nChoice in todays universities isn't the same as it was a half century ago. The ABOR restores that choice.\n\n \n How so? What's your proof for this statement? \n \n I think you're completely wrong. The diversity of courses offered and technology available today is astounding. From personal experience at my alma mater, I can state that students today have far more choices, and better facilities, at their disposal than I had a mere 5-10 years ago.\n \n The ABOR doesn't restore that choice, it merely attempts to \"reinforce\" it. Your words.\n \n Waxy",

   "So you're in favour then of taking the 1915 legislation, or all existing legislation for that matter, and replacing them with the \"dumbed down\" for convenience ABOR? \n\n \n \n There is a big difference between \"dumbed down\" and \"concise\". Do you consider the Bill of Rights to the U.S. Constitution \"dumbed down\"? \n \n \n \nIf not, then what's the reason behind it? \n\n \n \n You're calling the 1915 Declaration of Principles \"legislation\" and that's not what it is. It's not government law, it's principles within the university, written by the AAUP of 1915. Today's AAUP seems to consider it their own to ignore or refer to in any way they see fit. And it is. It has no public foundation. The ABOR would. \n \n \n \nI don't get it Marc, many things, perhaps most things of importance, when examined in the detail required to truly understand and benefit from them, are quite boring at times. That does NOT make them less valuable or effective. \n\n \n \n I'm afraid it does, because it's often impatient humans that are examining them. If it weren't for the Bill of Rights to the U.S. Constitution, there would be NO private gun ownership, and very little free speech. I come to that conclusion because every time they are defended, it's the concise Bill of Rights, not the more detailed Constitution, that is cited as reasons to not change them. \n \n You don't get because you don't want to get it. Ward Churchill's comments that I quoted in an earlier post offended much of the mainstream U.S., and he was subsequently invited to speak at FORTY universities within a few years afterwards. That would get the attention of anyone with an open mind. \n \n \n \nThen what's the point. Really? \n\n \n The 1915 Principles were written by the AAUP of that era, but I believe they had the good of the U.S. as a whole in mind when they wrote them - they weren't writing them merely for their own benefit. Today's AAUP has its own benefit in mind much more, since they consist largely of one political faction. They believe the 1915 Principles are their own to eliminate or ignore. The ABOR would not belong to them exclusively. It would belong to the people, or to the \"State\" as Robert Sproul put it, to protect the indespensible freedom, of teaching free from domination by parties, sects, or selfish interests. \n \n \nIt is more red tape, plain and simple. You're adding legislation to legislation simply to \"restore and protect\" an already existing mechanism. A mechanism I might add, that you have no issue with, only seek to see it be enforced. The ABOR does not accomplish that goal. \n\n \n \n To see it enforced is a pretty big issue, when contrasted with it not being enforced, as much of it is clearly not today. Properly applied, the ABOR would come closer than anything else being proposed to enforce it. \n \n \n \nFunding, and more specifically, financial stability and security and major issues for many universities. \n\n \n As government continues to grow in the U.S., public money is getting harder and harder to come by, be it from states or the federal government. Suppose in the near future, after the ABOR is officially killed off, the Democratic party stepped forward and volunteered to completely fund all public universities. Would you object? \n \n \nI don't see them as currently being overly burdensome. Universities face all kinds of outside pressures regarding curriculum, scholarships, athletics, etc...\n\n \n Any links detailing these outside pressures and where they're from? I would be most interested in those pressures regarding curriculums. \n \n \n \nUniversities must operate entirely differently in the USA than they do here. To the best of my knowledge, universities in Canada receive very little gov't funding. There are of course tax breaks, construction grants and the like that they receive, but those are extended to many corporate enterprises as well as other non-profits. Universities receive very little direct gov't funding. \n\n \n Chances are they are quite different from Canada, but chances are also that you're out of touch with what's going on in Canada. \n \n \n Canadian funding\n \n \n \nThe single greatest contribution that gov't makes is in the sponsoring of scholarships and the support of new grads entering the work force in the form of taxation incentives. \n\n \n \n And how much money is involved in THAT? emoticon_frazzled \n \n \n \nAnyhoo, to the point. Why should the universities be subject to more politics? I don't really understand where you're going with this line of thought. Is it beneficial in your mind to politicize universities? \n\n \n You're not making the slightest effort to understand. It's beneficial to get one sided politics OUT. U.S. Universities are loaded with one sided politics. \n \n \nHow about churches? Charity organizations? \n\n \n They don't get government grants for research, politically charged research. \n \n \n \nI see no \"beliefs\" contained in the ABOR. \n\n \n \nOf course you don't.\n\n \n Well if you do, why don't you show them to me? \n \n \nWhich seems more like a backdoor attempt to affect curriculums - a restoration of existing, traditional standards (the ABOR) or a current faculty vote to remove the Sproul clause? \n\n \n You forgot to answer this question. It's a simple, either/or question. \n \n \n \nTrying to represent, and actually representing are very different things.\n \n It most likely wouldn't be front page news regardless of the ABOR. IMHO, to believe otherwise shows naivety of the US public in general. \n\n \n I'm sure you and I have very different ideas on just how naive the U.S. public is. \n \n \n \nAs I stated in an exchange with JPSartre, it's relatively easy to dredge up the odd case of \"wrong\" being done. That doesn't impress me. There are 10's of thousands of university faculty members out there and thousands of universities. Finding a dozen, or even 50 instances that you can parade as abuse represents such a small minority as to be essentially insignificant. No matter what the case, or what the profession, there will be abuse and bad seeds. No legislation or rehash of existing regulation is going to prevent that. \n\n \n But the ratios are so lopsided, when universities are compared to anything else. Where else do you find ratios of 30 liberals to 1 conservative? Funny how far left college professors become tenured, and do such a better job of meeting professional standards than those careless conservatives. Doesn't seem to be that way in the private sector. \n \n \n \nI'm not sure there are any significant differences. Technology and a \"global\" information system have certainly affected courses and how students learn, but IMHO, the fundamentals of university educations are largely unchanged. \n\n \n David Horowitz is sure. He's visited over 300 universities, and interviewed thousands of students recently, after being a college student himself in the 50's - 60's. He makes a compelling case, and less-than-mature attempts to confront and silence him are coming up short. \n \n \nBoth.\n \n Please do. \n \n \n http://www.cnsnews.com/Culture/Archive/200212/CUL20021218d.html\n \n http://www.noindoctrination.org/cgibin/view_listings.cgi?status=recent\n \n \nSame as above, for every student you parade, there are likely 1000 other university graduates that are satisfied with their education and the freedom they had in choosing it. \n\n \n That's also very unlikely, but it's not easy to get clear proof or statistics on it. Complete transparency in students beliefs and motives would be possible to contemplate in a perfect world. Just think, if we lived in a perfect world, everyone in the workforce would place the highest priority on doing their absolute best at their job, with their pay being only a distant secondary thought. In the real world, we see all too many workers with only one goal - scampering home every Friday with that paycheck, and doing not one thing more than they absolutely have to do to get it. College students are paying a lot of money to get a degree, with the best grades possible, with the idea of getting a good paying job. That doesn't necessarily go hand in hand with learning all they can, or making public a clear bias they see from someone who is determining what their grades will be. \n \n \n \nMaybe, but doesn't existing legislation already cover it? \n\n \n No, since there is none. \n \n \nIs \"encouragement\" enough to solve the perceived problem? \n\n \n If it didn't, what would be the harm for trying?\n \n \n \nWhat isn't realistic is your final sentence. \n\n \n I know - that's what opponents of the ABOR endorse. \"TOUGH\", I believe that was your exact word. \n \n \n \nWow. I don't even know where to start with this one. It's a whole new debate. \n\n \n I know - it arises from your complete inability to identify with those Americans who get angry with hundreds of U.S. hating professors like Ward Churchill. \n \n \nI think the thecap0 pretty much summed up my opinion. \n\n \n Are you and your helper 100% sure that the 40 other invitations he got were in a context where people were \"free to attend or not\"? \n \n \nUnquestioning loyalty to the existing administration and \" blind patriotism\" are every bit as treasonous to your country. \n\n \n Treason is about foreign enemies, not ones own government. That may very well be one reason why treason and the problems it causes aren't addressed and debated enough - many people don't know the definition of the word. \n \n \nThey might not be the only ones, but they certainly are the most qualified. Far more qualified than gov't bureaucrats or Joe Public.\n\n \n \n That's a worldview difference that you and I have. I think they are the least qualified, because they almost never have to pay a price if they are wrong, unlike politicians and Joe Public\n \n \n \nIf you can find me, say 100 instances, such as your centerpiece \"Sproul Clause\" case from around the country, I'll start listening. At that point, it would move from the expected rare case of abuse to a potential problem. \n\n \n That's largely what's done to Horowitz. No matter how much evidence he gives, his angry opponents hold their ears, close their eyes, and continue to demand more and more proof. 100 instances - hmmm - how about 101 instances of radical professors who are ex-terrorists, racists, murderers, sexual deviants, anti Semites and al-Queda supporters? \n \n The Professors\n \n A review;\n \nWe all know that left-wing radicals from the 1960s have hung around academia and hired people like themselves. But if you thought they were all harmless, antiquated hippies, you'd be wrong. Today's radical academics aren't the exception-they're legion. And far from being harmless, they spew violent anti-Americanism, preach anti-Semitism, and cheer on the killing of American soldiers and civilians-all the while collecting tax dollars and tuition fees to indoctrinate our children. Remember Ward Churchill, the University of Colorado professor who compared the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks to Nazis who deserved what they got? You thought he was bad? In this shocking new book, New York Times bestselling author David Horowitz has news for you: American universities are full of radical academics like Ward Churchill-and worse. \n \n Horowitz exposes 101 academics-representative of thousands of radicals who teach our young people-who also happen to be alleged ex-terrorists, racists, murderers, sexual deviants, anti-Semites, and al-Qaeda supporters. Horowitz blows the cover on academics who: - Say they want to kill white people. - Promote the views of the Iranian mullahs. - Support Osama bin Laden. - Lament the demise of the Soviet Union. - Defend pedophilia. - Advocate the killing of ordinary Americans. \n \n David Horowitz's riveting expos\u00e9 is essential reading for parents, students, college alums, taxpayers, and patriotic Americans who don't think college students should be indoctrinated by sympathizers of Joseph Stalin and Osama bin Laden. \n \n The Professors is truly frightening-and an intellectual call to arms from a courageous author who knows the radicals all too well. \n\n \n \n If this book is all simply right wing propaganda, how come we're not seeing news about David Horowitz being sued for slander, or defamation of character? Maybe because everything in the book is true? \n \n \n \nWhen the majority of students and faculty, or at least a large minority, support legislation such as the ABOR, I'll pay attention. From what I've seen, that's not the case. \n\n \n Faculty has a special interest in opposing it. Most students fear repercussions from faculty if they make waves. \n \n \nHow so? What's your proof for this statement? \n\n \n R.J. Rummel\n \n After almost forty years of being in a university as a student and teaching, I have seen the campus go from the existence of a wide range of extensive academic freedom to a narrow band in the social sciences and humanities. I'm retired now, but if I were teaching, I know many things I believe related to my field that I could not say on campus or while teaching. What we have now is a leftist enforced control of speech such that every academic has academic freedom as long as they stick close to the liberal-leftist line. \n\n \n Democratic peace\n \n \nI think you're completely wrong. The diversity of courses offered and technology available today is astounding. From personal experience at my alma mater, I can state that students today have far more choices, and better facilities, at their disposal than I had a mere 5-10 years ago. \n\n \n If you're right, what threat do you see from the ABOR? Specific details about what it actually says would be nice. \n \n \nThe ABOR doesn't restore that choice, it merely attempts to \"reinforce\" it. Your words.\n \n Waxy\n\n \n I know - so where is the threat from the ABOR? There is none, unless you have an interest in protecting the \"leftist enforced control of speech such that every academic has academic freedom as long as they stick close to the liberal-leftist line.\"",

   "There is a big difference between \"dumbed down\" and \"concise\". Do you consider the Bill of Rights to the U.S. Constitution \"dumbed down\"? \n \n \n You're calling the 1915 Declaration of Principles \"legislation\" and that's not what it is. It's not government law, it's principles within the university, written by the AAUP of 1915. Today's AAUP seems to consider it their own to ignore or refer to in any way they see fit. And it is. It has no public foundation. The ABOR would. \n \n I'm afraid it does, because it's often impatient humans that are examining them. If it weren't for the Bill of Rights to the U.S. Constitution, there would be NO private gun ownership, and very little free speech. I come to that conclusion because every time they are defended, it's the concise Bill of Rights, not the more detailed Constitution, that is cited as reasons to not change them. \n \n You don't get because you don't want to get it. Ward Churchill's comments that I quoted in an earlier post offended much of the mainstream U.S., and he was subsequently invited to speak at FORTY universities within a few years afterwards. That would get the attention of anyone with an open mind. \n \n Or perhaps you just haven't presented a convincing arument.\n \n The 1915 Principles were written by the AAUP of that era, but I believe they had the good of the U.S. as a whole in mind when they wrote them - they weren't writing them merely for their own benefit. Today's AAUP has its own benefit in mind much more, since they consist largely of one political faction. They believe the 1915 Principles are their own to eliminate or ignore. The ABOR would not belong to them exclusively. It would belong to the people, or to the \"State\" as Robert Sproul put it, to protect the indespensible freedom, of teaching free from domination by parties, sects, or selfish interests. \n \n To see it enforced is a pretty big issue, when contrasted with it not being enforced, as much of it is clearly not today. Properly applied, the ABOR would come closer than anything else being proposed to enforce it. \n \n Does the ABOR include the power to enforce or not?\n \n Close only counts in horsehoes and handgrenades.\n \n As government continues to grow in the U.S., public money is getting harder and harder to come by, be it from states or the federal government. Suppose in the near future, after the ABOR is officially killed off, the Democratic party stepped forward and volunteered to completely fund all public universities. Would you object? \n \n Yes.\n \n Any links detailing these outside pressures and where they're from? I would be most interested in those pressures regarding curriculums. \n \n Chances are they are quite different from Canada, but chances are also that you're out of touch with what's going on in Canada. \n \n Canadian funding\n \n What percentage of the total research budget, let alone the entire university operating budget, of Canadian universities do you think that 86 million represents?\n \n See the link at the bottom as well.\n \n One should be a little careful not to become too full of himself in such debates.\n \n And how much money is involved in THAT? emoticon_frazzled \n \n You're not making the slightest effort to understand. It's beneficial to get one sided politics OUT. U.S. Universities are loaded with one sided politics. \n \n Ohhh but I am.\n \n They don't get government grants for research, politically charged research. \n \n No they just build tax free \"reation museums\" and involve themselves directly in just about every politically charged issue there is.\n \n I don't see the difference.\n \n Well if you do, why don't you show them to me? \n \n You forgot to answer this question. It's a simple, either/or question. \n \n I'm sure you and I have very different ideas on just how naive the U.S. public is. \n \n I don't think we're as far apart on that issue as you may think, especially based on your comments above regarding the \"impatient humans\".\n \n But the ratios are so lopsided, when universities are compared to anything else. Where else do you find ratios of 30 liberals to 1 conservative? Funny how far left college professors become tenured, and do such a better job of meeting professional standards than those careless conservatives. Doesn't seem to be that way in the private sector. \n \n David Horowitz is sure. He's visited over 300 universities, and interviewed thousands of students recently, after being a college student himself in the 50's - 60's. He makes a compelling case, and less-than-mature attempts to confront and silence him are coming up short. \n \n \n http://www.cnsnews.com/Culture/Archive/200212/CUL20021218d.html\n \n Did you even read this link? Completely useless.\n \n http://www.noindoctrination.org/cgibin/view_listings.cgi?status=recent\n \n Ever been to Fordtrucks.com? Lots of people there with problems looking for help too. No doubt there are some issues, F Series trucks are still the #1 selling trucks though...\n \n That's also very unlikely, but it's not easy to get clear proof or statistics on it. Complete transparency in students beliefs and motives would be possible to contemplate in a perfect world. Just think, if we lived in a perfect world, everyone in the workforce would place the highest priority on doing their absolute best at their job, with their pay being only a distant secondary thought. In the real world, we see all too many workers with only one goal - scampering home every Friday with that paycheck, and doing not one thing more than they absolutely have to do to get it. College students are paying a lot of money to get a degree, with the best grades possible, with the idea of getting a good paying job. That doesn't necessarily go hand in hand with learning all they can, or making public a clear bias they see from someone who is determining what their grades will be. \n \n This I have to comment on. \n \n Your perfect world is one hell of a far cry from my perfect world. In my world, your pay is commensurate with the quantity and quality of your work. It is after all called work, not happy fun time.\n \n Perhaps not, perhaps it's not as big a deal then as some would make it out to be?\n \n No, since there is none. \n \n If it didn't, what would be the harm for trying?\n \n I know - that's what opponents of the ABOR endorse. \"TOUGH\", I believe that was your exact word. \n \n I know - it arises from your complete inability to identify with those Americans who get angry with hundreds of U.S. hating professors like Ward Churchill. \n \n Really? How would you know that? Mind reader are we?\n \n Have I publicly endorsed Churchill or his thoughts? Please show me where. I have endorsed his right to free speech. Not the same thing. I endorse your right to free speech too.\n \n \nAre you and your helper 100% sure that the 40 other invitations he got were in a context where people were \"free to attend or not\"? \n\n \n Nope, are you?\n \n Treason is about foreign enemies, not ones own government. That may very well be one reason why treason and the problems it causes aren't addressed and debated enough - many people don't know the definition of the word. \n \n I disagree. On more than one level.\n \n \n That's a worldview difference that you and I have. I think they are the least qualified, because they almost never have to pay a price if they are wrong, unlike politicians and Joe Public\n \n \nI prefer those that are knowledgable to make decisions for me regarding areas of expertise. The mass electorate is certainly not.\n \n Polticians held responsible - thanks, that's my laugh of the day.\n\n \n That's largely what's done to Horowitz. No matter how much evidence he gives, his angry opponents hold their ears, close their eyes, and continue to demand more and more proof. 100 instances - hmmm - how about 101 instances of radical professors who are ex-terrorists, racists, murderers, sexual deviants, anti Semites and al-Queda supporters? \n \n The Professors\n \n A review;\n \n why didn't you cut and paste the second review? You know, the one right above that one?\n \n Do you honestly believe that Horowitz couldn't find the same skeletons in people's closets regardless of the profession he chose to investigate? How naieve would you have to be to actually believe that?\n \n If this book is all simply right wing propaganda, how come we're not seeing news about David Horowitz being sued for slander, or defamation of character? Maybe because everything in the book is true? \n \n This is some of the most pathetic \"logic\" I've seen in a long time.\n \n Faculty has a special interest in opposing it. Most students fear repercussions from faculty if they make waves. \n \n R.J. Rummel\n \n Democratic peace\n \n If you're right, what threat do you see from the ABOR?

Ford trucks are a FOR-PROFIT business, with market forces guiding them, profit and loss. That means they don't need public guidelines like the 1915 principles, that the threat of LOSS keeps them responsible. They don't have tenured executives. The noindoctrination link that I provided shows how different the attitude is among those who aren't concerned with LOSS. If you bothered to read any of it, you would have seen very few rebuttals from professors, and the ones you do see are filled with \"tough\" arrogance. Almost no indication that they even recognize a problem, let alone an attempt to fix it. Not that way with profit and loss. If Ford was responding to complaints the way those professors were, you'd see a major difference. \n \n \nThis I have to comment on. \n \n Your perfect world is one hell of a far cry from my perfect world.

The point was, when you claim everything is all right in universities because a small percentage of students are all that are doing the complaining, it may be because others fear retaliation if they complain, and are too focused on themselves than the overall good of education, or the good of the country that funds it. \n \n \nReally? How would you know that? Mind reader are we? \n\n \n No, I simply read your posts.

Please show me where. I have endorsed his right to free speech. Not the same thing. \n\n \n No but they are very close.

Ford trucks are a FOR-PROFIT business, with market forces guiding them, profit and loss. That means they don't need public guidelines like the 1915 principles, that the threat of LOSS keeps them responsible. They don't have tenured executives. The noindoctrination link that I provided shows how different the attitude is among those who aren't concerned with LOSS. If you bothered to read any of it, you would have seen very few rebuttals from professors, and the ones you do see are filled with \"tough\" arrogance. Almost no indication that they even recognize a problem, let alone an attempt to fix it. Not that way with profit and loss. If Ford was responding to complaints the way those professors were, you'd see a major difference. \n\n \n You missed the point. \n \n The website noindoctrination.com is analogous to fordtrucks.com. It's a place where people go to complain and look for help.\n \n I read several of the complaints and rebuttals, no question some of those profs, according at least to the one sided post presented, were out of line. \n \n \nYou completely missed the point, but you're so angry I'm not surprised. I can't believe you've never seen or heard of anyone goofing off on the job and not having to answer for it. The point was, when you claim everything is all right in universities because a small percentage of students are all that are doing the complaining, it may be because others fear retaliation if they complain, and are too focused on themselves than the overall good of education, or the good of the country that funds it. \n\n \n emoticon_mad emoticon_mad emoticon_mad emoticon_mad\n \n Lol, I'm no fan of unions or other lazy workers. I still don't share your vision of the perfect world.\n \n Your claim of the opposite is no more valid.\n \n \nNo, I simply read your posts. A substanceless opposition of the ABOR largely indicates a cluelessness of just how serious many people are in opposing what's going on in academia today. \n\n \n emoticon_mad emoticon_mad :xcensored :xcensored emoticon_mad \n \n Maybe! emoticon_xangel \n \n \nNo but they are very close. One of the main things going on in academia that opposes the ABOR, is opposing free speech of conservative speakers. See the above post to thecap0. \n\n \n Then oppose it on those grounds. The legislation to enforce free speech is solidly in place.\n \n \nNo I'm not. You said thecap0 \"summed up your position\" by indicating that anyone was free to attend or not attend Churchills speeches. Now you're not sure, that thecap0 was right? \n\n \n Actually I stated this -\n \n \nI think the thecap0 pretty much summed up my opinion.\n\n \n Can you see the difference (hint, it's highlighted for you).\n \n \nThen let's go to dictionary.com\n \n Please explain how that tells you that alliance to ones own government consists of treason. \n\n \n Your gov't is not your country. Last I checked, you pledge allegiance to the country, not to George Bush.\n \n \nBecause of this one line\n \n Horowitz's political opinions don't appear in the book. That makes his review useless. ;\n\n \n How convenient lol!\n \n \nI honestly don't believe that anyone could find that widespread hate for the U.S. in any other organization. If you don't' agree, why don't you show me what they would be? \n\n \n Garbagemen, computer scientists, abstract artists? Who knows. There's some off the wall characters out there wherever you look.\n \n What did Timothy McVeigh do for a living?\n \n \nAnother broad brush - another point that you can't address. \n\n \n Correction - another point not worth addressing. Logic 101, do a search.\n \n \nWell you're not the only one that happens to - it happened to me on the longest post of my formal debate last March!! Not only about 3 hours down the drain, but it was late and I simply couldn't remember everything that I had written. Had to start again and do the best I could. I remembered most of it as I recall, but it was WORK to make myself do it all again. \n \n I'm sure I'm not the only one who can't get that link.\n \n Keep the \"jibes\" coming if that's all you've got. They only help make my points. That's just about all anyone has who attempts to debate Horowitz.\n\n \n Yep, that sucked, it really sucked the life out of me in terms of any desire to respond to this post any further, especially at length.\n \n It's really all I care to do. If it helps stroke your ego a little, then I'm glad to help.\n \n I didn't realize I was debating Horowitz. Nice to meet you Mr. Horowitz, put Marc9000 back on when you're done.\n \n Waxy",

   "You stated this - \"the Democratic party stepped forward and volunteered to completely fund all public universities\"\n \n I disagree with the segment bolded and underlined. \n \n Complete funding of universities is not acceptable to me. They should be capable of being essentially self sufficient, with public money for support and research funding where that money in turn benefits the public. \n\n \n I suppose you're considering student tuitions as self sufficiency, which they are. Students are free to spend their tuition dollars with other universities, or with private ones. I wasn't really considering the scenario of the Democrats funding it with no student tuition, students need the incentive of that investment. I was really comparing the difference between taxpayers funding what they do now, as opposed to that part being taken over by the Democratic party. \n \n \nUnlike yourself, I don't have an issue with some public funding of universities, for them to do with it as they see fit, provided that money is benefitting society. Investing in our youth is the best investment we can make \n\n \n \n \"As they see fit, provided that money is benefiting society\". I don't have an issue with it either, if the guidelines like the Sproul clause or the 1915 principles are being followed. If they are, society will benefit. If they aren't, there's no assurance that society will benefit. We're seeing alarming evidence that society may not benefit, if established principles and guidelines are ignored or forgotten. \n \n \n \nI'm amused, not angered or frustrated in any way, by your arrogance on the subject, this post of yours is filled with it. You're pretty proud of yourself for parroting Horowitz. \n\n \n I know of no instance where Horowitz has taken a look at for-profit vs. non-profit as I have. That comes from other sources, my basic knowledge of economics, and my life experiences with organizations that have competition, and those that do not. Horowitz is a good source of information for me however. I know of no one else with anywhere near his experiences and qualifications, who takes an interest in this subject, and has researched and studied it free from any corruption from within the university. I make use of his information, and try not to claim exact wordings of his as my own. \n \n If you want to call that \"parroting\" that's fine, but it really is a far cry from the broken record quote of the AAUP; \"There is no problem!\" You parrot them quite well. \n \n \n \nI've never met Churchill and read much of his work, so I can't really comment other than to surmise that he's likely quite full of himself as well. \n\n \n I agree, and the problem is largely solved, since he was fired. He wasn't fired for being full of himself or spouting America hate however. They probably contributed slightly, but he was mainly fired for having phony credentials. He survived a long time as a phony however. Is he the only one, or does it say anything about academic corruption? \n \n \n \nOr it may be that you just care about internet debate a little more than I do, and are willing to dedicate far more of your free time to it than I am. \n\n \n \n It's not really a question of time, my posts are always in the evenings or on weekends, I don't have time to post throughout the day as your post times show that you do. Whether it's just this thread or our entire posting histories, your common, short, substanceless taunts and jibes out number anything similar by me, by a huge percentage. \n \n \n \nI don't think I've ever denied that some people notice the onesidedness, or even that it exists in some instances, what I don't acknowledge is that it's a widespread problem, or a major issue with most university students, let alone Joe Public. \n\n \n If it's not a problem now, do you think it could be a problem if it increases? Evidence clearly shows that it has arisen in only the last few decades, do you think it will somehow remain unchanged, and not increase, as more and more things similar to the Sproul clause are eliminated? \n \n There is no claim being made that the ABOR is going to be an overnight fix for all the problems I've pointed out in this thread. If it were implemented into law tomorrow, chances are there would never be any drastic changes. It's a neutral bill, a restoration of existing standards. Universities are never going to be answerable to free markets any more than they are now, and would remain largely liberal even with the ABOR in place. The main thing the ABOR would do is not allow things to get worse. To give conservative students some peace of mind to know that discrimination against them doesn't have to go completely unchecked. That a little more of their time can go towards their education, and a little less towards defending themselves politically - a little less time focusing on preserving their established worldview from challanges and attacks. \n \n \n \nIntersesting take on it. What influence do you feel the church has on young children, age K-12? On their education? \n\n \n Nothing that the free will of themselves and their parents don't allow. Free choices, no public funding involved. \n \n \nI'm not prepared to blackball all teachers in K-12 education because they may have been influenced by their university education. It's rather ridiculous. \n\n \n Could you show where the word \"blackball\" appears in the ABOR? Or where I used it? It's ridiculous all right. \n \n \nIt contained 10 short anecdotes about political correctness gone ridiculously wrong. None directly related to the ABOR. \n\n \n Some WERE directly related, some were indirectly related. They all show what can happen when one-sidedness gains a firm foothold in universities. Again, do you think that amount of political correctness gone ridiculously wrong will stay exactly the same, get better, or get worse and worse? \n \n \n \nA crusade against \"liberalism\" does not equal validity for the ABOR. \n\n \n I believe it does, if liberalism has its BASE in universities. \n \n \nI read several of the complaints and rebuttals, no question some of those profs, according at least to the one sided post presented, were out of line. \n\n \n Do you think the number of professors who are out of line will stay exactly the same, or increase over time? At what point does it suddenly become a problem? \n \n \nThen oppose it on those grounds. The legislation to enforce free speech is solidly in place. \n\n \n So you've never heard of \"speech codes\"? Never heard of violence perpetrated on conservative speakers while university administration looked the other way? Examples related to that were in the \"10 short anecdotes\" that I linked. \n \n \n \nGarbagemen, computer scientists, abstract artists? Who knows. There's some off the wall characters out there wherever you look. \n \n What did Timothy McVeigh do for a living? \n\n \n \n The word was \"widespread\" and \"organization\", (as in non-profit organization) An individual here and there aren't comparable. Isolated personal actions aren't comparable to corruption in an organization. \n \n \n \nCorrection - another point not worth addressing.

I don't have the time to do any type of extensive searching or typing. I have zero time on evenings and weekends, and even if I did have some free time, posting on 4Forums would be WAY down on my list of things to do with that time.\n \n Besides, I'm guilty as charged to some extent, I do enjoy pushing your buttons now and then...look at the results I get.\n \n \nIf it's not a problem now, do you think it could be a problem if it increases? Evidence clearly shows that it has arisen in only the last few decades, do you think it will somehow remain unchanged, and not increase, as more and more things similar to the Sproul clause are eliminated? \n\n \n Of course, anything taken to an extreme will become a problem.\n \n I believe it will remain largely unchanged. IMHO, like most things, \"liberal vs. conservative\" if you will, ebbs and flows. It's a constant balancing act, much like a predator/prey scenario, the balance is ultimately maintained, even if the ratios do get out of whack for periods of time.\n \n \nThere is no claim being made that the ABOR is going to be an overnight fix for all the problems I've pointed out in this thread.

If you claim that makes Ithaca College complicit, then I suppose every city that allows a parade or demonstration is complicit in the action of those protestors.\n \n Stike one.\n \n \n9)An American University student was pinned down and handcuffed outside a Tipper Gore speech by plainclothes campus police  who refused to identify themselves. The student was charged with stealing Gore's intellectual property by videotaping her speech, which was open to the public. The school claims that it made an announcement barring videotape recording of the event even though no such prohibition was on the flyers advertising the speech and print reporters covered the speech. The student had been critical of the university's president in the past and voiced concern over the $31,000 lecture fee the university was paying Gore. As a result of the event, the student was placed on probation and threatened with expulsion.\n\n \n I added the rest of the point so as to make it very clear as to why the individual was arrested and punished. \n \n Videotaping a public performance is theft Marc. Example - any concert you attend, videotaping that concert and bootlegging the tape is completely illegal, however, print reporters are free to attend and write an article for the paper the next day. \n \n I find it really hard to feel sorry for a guy that was breaking the law.\n \n Strike two.\n \n \n8)Vanderbilt University renamed its Confederate Memorial Hall dormitory \n\n \n This one I can take or leave.
