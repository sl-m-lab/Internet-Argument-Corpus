   "\"Heller has been hailed as a 'triumph of originalism,' but the decision really hinges on a modern understanding of the right to keep and bear arms&#8212;that is, it relies on the 'living' Constitution... \n \n \"Consider how Justice Scalia&#8217;s opinion addresses D.C.&#8217;s ban on handguns. An originalist would look to historical sources to determine whether those who \n ratified the Constitution thought a ban on a particular type of weapon was contrary to the right to keep and bear arms. But Scalia&#8217;s opinion doesn&#8217;t do \n this. Handguns are protected, according to the opinion, because they are '\"the most preferred firearm in the nation\"' to keep for self-defense....\n \n \"In contrast to handguns, the Court suggests that machine guns might be banned because they are 'dangerous and unusual weapons' that are not in \n 'common use.' But why are machine guns so rare? Because federal law has effectively prevented civilians from purchasing them for the past seventy-five \n years. Federal gun control in the twentieth century made machine guns unusual and uncommon. So here, rather than defer to the original understanding, the majority opinion looks to contemporary government regulation. This sounds a lot like a right evolving with the times&#8212;that is, a living Constitution....\n \n \"Heller also strays from originalism in what is, for practical purposes, the most important part of the opinion. In a paragraph near the end of the opinion, the Court lists a number of 'longstanding prohibitions' on guns that remain good law: bans on possession by ex-felons and the mentally ill; bans on guns in sensitive places like schools and government buildings; and restrictions on the commercial sales of firearms. The vast majority of gun control laws fits within these categories... The dilemma for the originalist is that none of these broad exceptions are grounded in the original meaning of the Second Amendment....\n \n \"Gun controls existed in the Founders&#8217; day, so there is historical precedent to which Justice Scalia could have looked to determine what types of gun \n restrictions the Founding generation thought were consistent with the right to keep and bear arms. For example, the armed citizenry was required to \n report with their guns to militia 'musters,' where the weapons would be inspected and the citizens trained. Authorities often required that militia \n guns be registered; in some instances, colonists conducted door-to-door surveys of gun ownership. There were laws requiring gun powder to be \n stored safely, even though the rules (like maintaining the powder on the top floor of a building) made it more difficult for people to load their guns quickly \n to defend themselves against attack. The Founders also had more severe limitations, including complete bans on gun ownership by free blacks, slaves, \n Native Americans, and those of mixed race. Whites who refused to swear loyalty oaths&#8212;first to the Crown and then, when times changed, to the \n Revolution&#8212;were also disarmed....\n \n \"One thing the Founders did not do was impose any gun control laws obviously equivalent to those on the laundry list.They had no restrictions on \n the commercial sales of firearms as such.

   "Alright lets bring some of this into the light.\n \n\"Gun controls existed in the Founders&#8217; day, so there is historical precedent to which Justice Scalia could have looked to determine what types of gun restrictions the Founding generation thought were consistent with the right to keep and bear arms. For example, the armed citizenry was required to report with their guns to militia 'musters,' where the weapons would be inspected and the citizens trained. Authorities often required that militia guns be registered; in some instances, colonists conducted door-to-door surveys of gun ownership.\n\n Mandated ownership. The Militia commander checked to see if the minimum requirements listed in the Militia act were met! :) \n \n Personally, if the government wants to mandate gun ownership again, we would most happily comply and show them the minimum requirements they demand! :) Are you willing to comply with mandated gun ownership Galileo? :) What firearms would you guys like to see mandated, for every citizen own as a minimum? Be specific please, as this would be an interesting topic on gun ownership. Hey, then you guys could claim once again that you got more common sense gun control laws passed, that even gun owners want! emoticon_xhoho\n \n This is what the anti-gun people call gun control! \n   Militia Act of 1792, \n IV. And be it further enacted, &#8230;\n The officers to be armed with a sword or hanger, a fusee, bayonet and belt, with a cartridge box to contain twelve cartridges; and each private of matoss shall furnish themselves&#8230;. , and to be armed with a sword and pair of pistols, the holsters of which to be covered with bearskin caps.\n \n Oh my, those were mandated handguns! 2 of them!\n \nThe Militia act There were laws requiring gun powder to be stored safely, even though the rules (like maintaining the powder on the top floor of a building) made it more difficult for people to load their guns quickly to defend themselves against attack. \n\n Unlike the smoakless powder used today, Black Powder was an explosive. Back then, they had no alternatives to Black Powder. The requirements against keeping large quantities of Black Powder in one's home were in case of fire. Black Powder would not just be consumed and give off gas, like today's smoakless powder would, it would instead EXPLODE! Possibly even taking down homes next to it. That is why it was mandated that what they did kept, was on the top floor. Because things blow UP!\n \n However they were allowed to keep this explosive in their home. In fact it was even mandated to have a certain amount of this explosive kept handy! :)",

   "In kalifornia, Roberti-Roos passed an AWB and lost their next elections...then tried to sue the voters :)\n \n The 1980s were still not the good ol days of the gun grabbers. They tried a suit against Navgar over the tech-9 and D.C.-9 that lasted through several courts for 7 years and met it's match short of the SCOTUS but was ended in the State Supreme Court.\n \n \nOne month later, the court issued its opinion.\n \n It was somewhat anti-climatic. \n \n In a five to one decision, with only Justice Werdegar dissenting, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Navegar's appeal. Their reasoning, or somewhat more appropriate, reason was not necessarily what either party expected. In brief, the court, with Justice Chin writing for the majority, held that the plaintiffs' suit, though worded in a manner to attempt to make it seem otherwise, was, in essence, nothing more than a product liability case involving a risk/benefit analysis and, as a result, was barred by section 1714.4. \n \n Navegar had made the claim all along. California's Supreme Court justices, however, were the first ones to listen. \n \n Justice Kline, in the section of his opinion regarding section 1714.4, focuses on Barker. According to Kline, while Assembly Bill 75 initially had a \"grander purpose,\" as it was amended, it simply dealt with the \"risk/benefit analysis\" prong of Barker's two tests. As Barker dealt with strict liability product design defect, common law negligence suits such as the plaintiffs' were not affected. This also seemed to be the Warren's opinion on the issue when he dismissed Navegar's demurrer. As Haerle does not mention section 1714.4 in his dissent, it might well have been his interpretation as well \n \n Justice Chin and the rest of the Supreme Court, with the exception of Justice Werdegar, did not abide by Justice Kline's limited reading of the statute. \n \n The main thrust of Chin's opinion is that \"products liability action\" does not simply mean the two tests articulated in Barker. About a page into his discussion, Chin states: \"A plaintiff may seek recovery in a 'products liability case' either 'on the theory of strict liability in tort or on the theory negligence.'\" According to Chin, the plaintiffs' having argued negligence does not move them out of the ambit of section 1714.4. In relation to the history of section 1714.4, Chin states: \"the revisions that occurred during section 1714.4's enactment process do not persuade us the Legislature either intended to exclude or in fact excluded plaintiffs' negligence claim from the statute's reach.\" And, according to Chin, neither does the wording of the plaintiffs' complaint. \n \n According to Chin, in their repeated pointings to the TEC-9/TEC-DC9's lack of civilian use and extreme potential danger, the plaintiffs were essentially asking the court to do exactly what section 1714.4 bars: a risk/benefit analysis. Moreover, Chin notes, \"even were plaintiffs correct that section 1714.4 applies by its term only to the strict liability theory of products liability, we would find that the policy the statute establishes bars plaintiffs' claim.\" \n \n The plaintiffs' case was over.\n \n For good measure, Chin dismisses the idea-first introduced by Judge Warren-that the AWCA changes things-\"We would read too much into the AWCA if we found in it the expression of a state policy that manufacturers of specified assault weapons may be civilly liable based on an assessment of the risks and benefits of making their product available to the general public, at least when they comply with the AWCA.\" In Chin's opinion, it simply was not what the plaintiffs' pled and, in fact, the plaintiffs' repeatedly dissuaded the court from regarding Navegar's advertising as separate from its production and distribution. \n \n In conclusion, Chin holds that even if the case were not barred by section 1714.4, no triable issues of fact regarding causation were present to begin with. Chin distinguishes Parke, Davis, from the situation at hand, as a case dealing with a professional product distributor, not a mere consumer like Ferri. There, according to Chin, the physician had prescribed the product by name and the only sources of information regarding the drug available to him were the manufacturer's advertising and visits from sales representatives. Thus, in Chin's opinion, despite the physicians' lack of memory regarding ever actually viewing promotional materials, it was entirely possible (and probable) to infer the necessary level of influence from the circumstantial evidence. In regards to Navegar, however, Chin cites the lack of any evidence \"direct or circumstantial\" that Ferri ever encountered Navegar's advertisements or promotional materials, and thus finds the circumstantial evidence clearly insufficient. \n \n Thus ended Merrill v. Navegar. \n \n The NRA's fax alert the next morning was titled \"California Supreme Court Rejects Brady Bunch's Reckless Suit.\" The subheading read: \"The suit against Navegar may have been the crown jewel in the gun-ban movement's ongoing attempt to bankrupt the lawful firearm industry.\"\n \n \n \n\n \n Perhaps you should have been there to set 'em straight star gazer? emoticon_cry\n \n It is not illegal to own a machine gun nor a silencer today. In fact, I think I am going to get a few silencers to save what is left of my hearing :) I don't need the sheriff's blessing either nor anyone else...$200 one time tax, that is it.",

What these rights were is unknown but the court decided it would be those deeply rooted in our nations history. Later that requirement was taken away. From there this standard of hidden meanings in amendments was applied to other amendments and thus the living constitution. So basically the idea is that you are assuming meaning that was never adopted by the people who enacted the provision. Now, turning back to Heller we can see what Scalia did. He basically broke down the amendment into little parts and defined them using dictionaries at the time. He furthermore stated laws at the time to give context for how the law applied before, during, and after adoption. All of this was to show that \"right to keep and bear arms\" really means \"right to keep and bear arms\".\n\n I think the list of exceptions was intended to do more than merely prevent confusion about what the decision was about. It was a preemptive strike against future challenges to gun laws. Jonesy keeps predicting a massive repeal of gun laws in the US. What Jonesy doesn't realize is that situation is the very thing the list was intended to prevent. In the endnotes, the Supreme Court comments on that list, \"We identify these presumptively lawful regulatory measures only as examples; our list does not purport to be exhaustive.\"",

   "More reason for doubting the \"originalism\" of Heller:\n \n Heller's claim that the Second Amendment protects a preexisting, individual right unconnected to service in the militia that goes back to England has been criticized by several British historians as pointed out by the Sotomayor/Breyer/Ginsburg dissent in McDonald:\n \n \"Heller&#8217;s conclusion that 'individual self-defense' was 'the central component' of the Second Amendment&#8217;s right 'to keep and bear Arms' rested upon its view that the Amendment 'codified a pre-existing right' that had 'nothing whatever to do with service in a militia'... The historians now tell us, however, that the right to which Blackstone referred had, not nothing, but everything, to do with the militia.

Orwellian doublethink if you ask me.\n\n Well don't go off and declare a false victory just yet. Heller mentioned Ohio's Klein v. Leis\n   Klein v. Leis, 99 Ohio St.3d 537, 2003-Ohio-4779.\n {10} In State v. Nieto ... The court stated, \"The statute does not operate as a prohibition against carrying weapons, but as a \n regulation of the manner of carrying them\" and found the concealed-weapons statute to be a \"proper exercise of the police power of the state.\n \n {15} The General Assembly has determined that prohibiting the carrying\n of concealed weapons helps maintain an orderly and safe society. We conclude that that goal and the means used to attain it are reasonable. We hold that R.C 2923.12 does not unconstitutionally infringe the right to bear arms; there is no constitutional right to bear concealed weapons. \n \n {23} However, as the majority articulates, R.C. 2923.12 regulates only the manner in which a firearm may be carried. Accord State v. Nieto (1920), 101 Ohio St. 409, 413, 130 N.E. 663. Because a restriction on the manner of exercising a right necessarily leaves open other means of exercising the right, the lesser standard of intermediate scrutiny is applicable\n \n {24} Under intermediate scrutiny, a regulation will be upheld only if the \n regulation is narrowly tailored to serve an important government interest and \n leaves open other means of exercising the right ..... Further, the state correctly asserts that the statute leaves open the ability to bear arms by openly carrying a firearm, satisfying the third prong of the test. \n\n Hence the Right to Bear Arms!

Travis had a land grant from Spain which had claim on both Texas and Mexico. We helped Mexico win their independence from Spain in the Spainish and American War. Santa Anna was a dictator and started disarming Mexico first then moved on to Texas to do the same. Texas was in yet another war where a dictator wanted to disarm all colonists and citizens. Of course you know nothing about this history but are a friggin expert :xcensored The Mexicans resented this action also and were part and parcel to the Independence war with Mexico.\n \n \n \n Because that is what it was and Texas became it's own Republic.\n \n \n \n Which would be the same as frenchmen entering Louisiana which \"was stolen from their nation...} What Mexico is doing is an act of war and a violation of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Those are acts of aggression and in themselves an act of war which will come soon enough. All the land from the Gulf to kalifornia was aquired through 'Manifest Destiny' as Alaska was acquired by 'Sewards' Purchase'. Mexico has no claims on this land period. Their intent is for fools like yourself to believe and their illegal attack and war of Atzlan. The duty of the federal government is to protect each State from invasion, they are not following our law and doing their duty.\n \n I believe each Texan has their Bowie knives ready. You applaud their killing of cops, elected officials and human and drug smuggling?\n \n Any that infringe on the civil rights or infringe on that right.\n\n The US obtained Louisiana through a treaty. In contrast, Texas was obtained through \"one of the most unjust [wars] ever waged on a weaker country by a stronger\" according to Ulysses S. Grant, 18th President of the United States.

   "I think the list of exceptions was intended to do more than merely prevent confusion about what the decision was about. It was a preemptive strike against future challenges to gun laws. Jonesy keeps predicting a massive repeal of gun laws in the US. What Jonesy doesn't realize is that situation is the very thing the list was intended to prevent. In the endnotes, the Supreme Court comments on that list, \"We identify these presumptively lawful regulatory measures only as examples; our list does not purport to be exhaustive.\"\n\n \n Interesting little debate you got going on there. Look, I think Heller was exactly right with their conclusion. You could probably argue about the history before the 2nd amendment until you are blue in the face but at the end of the day it is more than obvious that the 2nd amendment gives folks the right to have a gun. I think the point that gets confusing is why they granted that right. This is really where the militia idea comes in. Back then it was one of the best reasons to own a gun. Nevertheless, this doesn't restrict it for that use only. It would be like saying \"we need to give 16 yr olds driving licenses so they can go to work\". It doesn't mean they should only get one if they work. Beyond that the really old English history is just academic debate with no consequence. \n \n In short, Heller, in its main points, is dead on originalism. To think otherwise, in my opinion, is silly but not as silly as thinking you can't repeal the 2nd amendment :)\n \n Good luck dealing with our Mensa \"gun control\" members (who probably just looked up what that is).",

The president of the $2.8 billion enterprise is an oilman who once was the GOP's pick for governor. And the nine-member board of regents has five Republicans - three of whom tilt pretty far right.\n \n \"Since politics cannot be eliminated from education, the real question is not whether education will be influenced by politics, but rather by what kind of politics,\" wrote one of them, Steve Bosley.\n \n Bosley's spot is one of three up for grabs, and the only one serving the state at-large. The direction of the board pivots on whether he's re-elected in November or ousted by Denver Democrat Melissa Hart.\n \n Regents have spent a lot of time over the past year dithering on how to phrase \"guiding principles\" and a mission statement that I doubt anyone will ever read. They've talked ad nauseam about CU's seal, its logo and other branding minutiae in attempts to unify its disparate campuses. And they've waged political spats that have little to do with running a university that's hemorrhaging $50 million a year.\n \n Take their gun debate.\n \n In April, an appeals court ruled that regents didn't have authority to ban concealed weapons on campus. The decision was a challenge to their power. Any regent concerned at least with board control would have voted to appeal. But four conservative gun-rights supporters voted no on the item titled \"Preserving the Independence of the Board of Regents.\"\n \n\n \n Now, who got it backward?

And be it further enacted, &#8230;\n The officers to be armed with a sword or hanger, a fusee, bayonet and belt, with a cartridge box to contain twelve cartridges; and each private of matoss shall furnish themselves&#8230;. , and to be armed with a sword and pair of pistols, the holsters of which to be covered with bearskin caps.\n\n Oh my! Pistols! emoticon_ic And 2 of them! A DEMAND TOO! emoticon_smile\n \n We ARE the Militia! \n  Who are the Militia today Link \n United States Code, Title 10 Chapter 13.\n \n (a) The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard. \n \n (b) The classes of the militia are &#8211; Organized and unorganized\n \n (1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard \n and the Naval Militia; and \n \n (2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia. \n\n   Tench Coxe Quotes \nIs it feared, then, that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom. Congress have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords, and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birth-right of an American ... the unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments, but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people.\n",

   "Still trying to scam the Constitution I see.\n \n How many times have you tried to make a Well Regulated Militia mean that the Congress had the Right to regulate firearms using today's meaning of regulation? Heller said:  Finally, the adjective \"well-regulated\" \n \n   The meaning of the phrase \"well regulated\" in the 2nd amendment\n \n Meaning of Well Regulated from Alexander Hamilton, himself! \n   FEDERALIST No. 29 -- HAMILTON \n\n \n Once it is incorporated AGAINST THE STATES, they have no more right to control firearms than does the feds ala Heller\n \n They can't pass laws to infringe on it period.\n \n Let Congress control interstate commerce, they never had the power to make laws on the 2A if anyone will reference my reply to steeeve on the other board I believe; now the 2A is incorporated against the States and they are prevented from infringing on fundamental and incorporated rights in the XIVth Amendment.\n \n Let them eat cake :)\n \n Scotus has ruled against the fed claim to commerce power in Lopez, Morrison, Reynolds tobacco and the attempt to use that power imposing sentences on the Branch Davidians.;;I will think of the case name, it hasn't come to me just yet.\n \n I think because all the food found in stores is in interstate commerce we can prevent star gazer from eating.",

   "I read the article ,being a guy maybe I'm bias but sounnds the other way around to me and to have 2A rights taken and over domestic violence to boot\n is a crock of B.S\n \n Or having a gun in the home could be a god send if the victim is in mortal danger or just real danger ie.broken bones, bashed up,beat up real good.\n \n \n Well for that matter so's a knife or baseball bat.\n \n \n So because someone may have slapped their wife or husband you wouldn't want them behind you in a firefight?emoticon_xdonno\n\n \n Pretty soon you can forget about the ATF; they are on the way out with their \"rules and regulations\" posted in the Federal Register.\n They were sent to the Border, the Southern Border, amid a lot of spending for office space, equiptment and increased manpower to stop massive gun running which was a fiction. The only ones caught have been corrupt cops and their own as well as other organizations including their own in sting operations. They cut no fat hog in the rump but they did commit political suicide. Since incorporation, they will again become a tax organization if they survive at all but they are still useless collecting taxes on alcohol, tobacco and firearms. Most onerous habits have already been altered by congress and after November 2nd, we will clean congress up after we poll the 'resurrection of the dead' still being used on the voter rolls to boost democrats, not the good ones, the liberals and corrupt ones. A few of the better ones might make the FBI rolls in explosives but any soldier who has worked in demolition can do the same job and probably just as well if not better.\n \n CAN YOU HEAR US NOW DIANE FIENSTIEN? With any opportunity we can clean out the royal reign of Barbara Boxer too. :) Chuckie should not be too far behind. The onerous act to stifle free speech, especially free political speech was narrowly defeated in the DISCLOSE ACT. Stick a fork in 'em, they are done.",

   "More as a point of government, under what power delegated to Congress, did Congress use to make this gun law? Or can you show us where We the People used Article 5 to grant them this ability.\n \n Perhaps this actually a usurped power?\n \n Anyone?\nI'll answer. This is actually a good question. Clearly everyone agrees that under the 1st amendment you can limit some forms of speech like the classic yelling a crowded theater. Now the question becomes WHO can make that limitation after incorporation to the states via the 14th amendment. Can both the federal government AND states? Naturally you would think the 1st amendment meaning would apply both equally to the states and federal government. I tend to think only the states can make limitations because nothing explicitly says Congress can do it. \n \n Let us not pretend the term \"general welfare\" gives unlimited power to congress. By the way, that section of the constitution gives the power to tax, NOT the power to \"provide for the general welfare\" as a blanket right. That entire section could be rewritten as \"congress has the power to tax so they can do the below things\".
