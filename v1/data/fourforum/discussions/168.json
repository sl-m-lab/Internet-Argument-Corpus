   "It is my assessment that we should run a bombing mission over N. Korea for the purpose of destroying the materials and machinery necessary for creating nuclear weapons. Furthermore this will truly show the world what is meant by the new policy of preemption. Take out only those targets deemed necessary for accomplishing the said mission. Then, wait and see how the N. Koreans wish to proceed. \n \n Thoughts and comments welcome. Why or why not?",

Once they see that we are not as weak as we appear to be, and are willing to make bold moves, they may rethink their actions. However, there are no guarantees, as war is a ricky business. Perhaps you are right.\n \n If we wish to take out their installations, our window is closing; because as their nuclear wepaons program proceeds, the chances that bombing such installations will result in environmental devastation increases. Whatever, we are going to do, we had better do it quick.",

   "Insanity. Have you noticed that since NK tested its first nuke all the military posturing the US was doing settled down to a 'let's talk' attitude?\n \n Let's think about why that might have happened.\n \n 1) Do you think that if 'we' (ie the West) starting transferring the forces necessary for such a campaign towards the NK region, that they would\n a) do nothing?\n b) ramp up their weapons production?\n \n 2) Do you think that if such a bombing campaign began, North Korea would\n a) sit there and take it?\n b) retaliate against South Korea and US bases there with their nukes?\n \n 3) Do you think that such a move on 'our' part would\n a) Increase global confidence in the West's good intentions?\n b) Further polarise global opinion and create a climate of fear?\n \n 4) Do you think that other countries with aspirations of nuclear power would react to such a move by\n a) Deciding 'oh, it's not worth the hassle, let's stop our nuclear program'?\n b) Accelerating their nuclear program in order to become a true nuclear power which guarantees freedom from attack?\n \n Face it, nuclear weapons are the trump card in international politics. Obviously the extent of NK's nuclear capability is unknown to me and you, but the very fact that the US has shown no fear in attacking defenceless Iraq and threatening non-nuclear Iran, but opened diplomatic relations with NK through Chinese mediation, shows that not even a superpower is willing to attack even a nascent nuclear nation. One nuke is all it would take to wipe out the carrier battle group that took the bombers over there. Why would anyone risk that?\n \n Why do you even think NK and other countries want nukes in the first place? It's obvious they will always be behind the US in terms of strategic nuclear capability. The point is that they know, and the NK case proved it unambiguously to the world, that if you have nukes you are free from the threat of invasion, a freedom which seems to have a high price in the modern world.",

   "I agree with Liminus. I was actually a fan of the Iraq war when it started but I've learned my lesson. This is not to say that having Iraq be free is a bad goal but the real problem is no one supported us and we had no real solid way of doing that. In other words it is like saying \"we want to repaint the house\" which is a good idea but the means in which you did it was to level the neighborhood and rebuild everything...just makes no sense.\n \n Anyway, back to NK. We don't need to be the only ones saying NK shouldn't have nukes. I think any reasonable person would say NK shouldn't have nukes. The real question is who is gonna stop them and does that person have the power to do so? Why not get China to lead the charge or Germany or Russia. The US is a great country but we aren't gonna make many friends if we are always the ones trying to clean up the messes.\n \n I'll admit that sometimes if feels like we get a bunch of countries saying \"lets go fight\" and then we say \"go\" we are the only ones that start running and we get left with the ####. In the end, we need someone else to take charge for once and if no one does then they reap what they sow. We can worry about ourselves in the mean time though :)",
