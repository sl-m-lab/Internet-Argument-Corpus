   "How do you like that! US State Department conducts closed investigation of nuclear technologies' outflow. It's considered that scientific workers of Livermore National Laboratory, California, have turned out to be art and part in such actions. It has been found particularly that some of them assisted in creation of South Korean nuclear weapons for great money reward. They did it indirectly through shell companies or paper corporations. It's interesting that due to some data precisely Seoul's control of own nuclear weapons was forced Pyongyang to begin researches in nuclear field, too. I hear, the State Department has already sent down inquiry about exact list of companies, involved in this affaire, to US Ministry of Economic Development and Trade. But I'm sure that it's only the beginning. The worst is still to come.",
