   "The recent George W. Bush drug leak brought these thoughts to mind. Let me first state that I have not used any drugs for several years and don't care to again. However, if someone else wants to use drugs, that's their business, not mine. (It's their bodies, who am I or the government to tell them what they can do with their bodies?) I consider myself an undecided voter meaning that the niether political parties platform appeals to me entirely. I very rarely come across a politician that I find genuine and worthy of the position they seek. In many cases I do not support George W. Bush and many of his policies. However, I can not understand how the marijuana and cocaine that he took years ago is going to affect his leadership abilities today. When a law is unjust or not socially accepted in many circles many people disregard it. Citing the fact that the last two presidents used illicit drugs as evidence, perhaps our country should decriminalize many drugs that are currently illegal. Perhaps this shows that regular citizens even upstanding citizens partake in substances which our culture and government have demonized. The violence associated with these drugs are generally not a result of the physical chemicals themselves but due to the fact that they are illegal and therefore their distribution is controlled by an unregulated criminal element. Perhaps it would be better if these substances where legal, but regulated (similar to alcohol). When was the last time you heard of a beer distributor shooting a rival beer distributor over turf? Furthermore, I think this would relieve a great strain on our criminal justice system, decreasing our prison populations and allowing law enforcement to concentrate on more serious threats (terrorism, etc). Generally, I think the current drug policy is stupid because I think most people are smart enough to know what's good for them and what's bad for them. If crack were legal tommorrow I certainly would not be signing up to use it because I know it has no benefit to me and is not something I care to experience. And for those that would want to do such things.... hey it's suppossed to be a free country, who is the government to tell them what they can and can't do to their body as long as they don't threaten others. In summary, in the big scheme of things this drug war just seems pointless and unjust when there are much more important things to deal with. Thank you.",

People get them anyway, and if we have declared them illegal, ther eis no way to recoup the costs associated witht he problems they create.\n \n On the question of the addictive qualities of different substances, I think this goes beyond a one isze fits all classification.

Some people are just like that, they have addictive personalities and (IMO) are predisposed to use of certain addictive substances. \n \n Personally, I drink and have no problem with it.

   "I don't think any realistic legalization would bear the intent to reduce consumption, but to reduce profit and therefore violence factors at consumer levels. Legalized, suppliers would fall under open trade supply and demand markets; it's a lot easier and far less expensive to protect and encourage poppy fields than destroy them. Foreign drug cartels should not be a US concern unless bribery of US officials is involved.\n\n \n I`m also quite sceptic to the actions of pursuing a \"war against drugs\" through international intervention (ecpessially since the Afghani poppy fields are in full production with the good memory of the US administration). But this does not invalidate the attempts to \"minimize\" consumtion through increasing the costs for domestic producers, sellers and smugllers (which will be passed on to the consumers). \n \n \nDue to declining US economic opportunities and increased federal government social engineering, social costs are going to escalate and a lack of popularly accepted morality will spread among the lower classes with or without legalized drugs. We're in the same problem area we were with prohibition of alcohol during that experiment, also during an economic decline, a corrupt public, corrupt public officials and widespread violence solely attributed to legislation of morality.\n\n \n I would argue that there is a distinct difference between alcohol conbsumption and drug consumtion (I am aware of the fact that alcohol is a drug, but I think you see what I mean ;) ). Alcohol consumtion was far more socially accepted than drugs have ever been in the western world (the possible exeption being cannabis) and is therefor much harder to reduce consumtion off. Now, don`t get me wrong though, alcohol is a serious problem as well and should IMO be highly restricted. but sadly, the increasing internationalisation of trade has eroded the national ability to regulate the price on alcohol through taxation.",

   "I`m very sceptic to any intitiative to legalize drugs. The idea that drug consumption could be reduced through any such initiative seems highly implausible. Even if you should choose to \"tax it to death\", you will soon find out that the same infrastructure built to circumvent anti-drug legislation will be put to good use in order to avoid paying taxes (and VAT) on drug sales. You will only pressure the drug cartells to lower the black market price (and possibly go to further violent extremes to retain control of the markets). And while this would certainly raise consumer surplus and lower producer surplus, it will also lead to higher drug consumtion (and all the social problems and societal and personal costs it brings).\n\n \n I don't think so.

Other than moral grounds determined by belief systems driving an ignorant society responding to fear of the unknown, they're all consumed for the same purpose, escape. Chronic alcoholics commit just as many acts of personal violence as druggies and present the same social problems, which means demand is there and supply will follow regardless of legislation prohibiting any of them. Since drugs in various forms have always been a part of all societies throughout history, who is capable of prohibiting them other than the potential or actual consumer?

By any definition that's an increase in federal government size and influence, complete with moral definitions and compliance as control measures. As an example relating to this thread, any student applicant convicted of any drug offense, including possession of marijuana, is disqualified from receiving federal aid or loans for purposes of higher education. How's that for draconian policy guaranteed to provide distinct social class separation on a moral basis by a system claiming to strive for equality? \n \n A major cause of our social ills is rooted in moral judgment derived from mythical belief systems, as testified to by our prison population, the highest per-capita in the developed world. 60% of incarcerated individuals at all facilities are convicted of drug related charges, further empathizing the fruitlessness of enforcement derived from legislation attempting to regulate public morality. \n \n It doesn't take expanded mental ability to determine a separation of moral values enforced by legislation will create class distinctions. A large contribution to our problems is that we're also burdened with a greater part of the population desiring status quo and a return to 'the good old days' of prosperity to 'solve' our social ills, impossible by any rational means. A normal desire for the vanishing middle class, they fail to recognize or accept that their idealistic mindsets, reinforced by belief system leaders and used by politicians as control measures, actually expand the very ills that threaten their complacency. Due to the abnormal profits in any illicit trade, they're actually providing the operating capital for those markets to expand into schools and juvenile peer groups they formerly considered 'safe' in their pursuit of the ever-elusive American Dream.\n \n Like the politicians who now manage them using fear as motivation for support, moral judgment advocates most often lack the intellectual capability to concede acceptance and modification as a superior solution for coping with changing social and economic conditions. The traditional conservative approach of calculated change to ensure positive results throws them into regression. \n \n Date rape drugs I'm aware of. I didn't reconize the street name.",
