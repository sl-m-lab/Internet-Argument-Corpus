My opinion: Here we have (or had) a savage dictator who kills people on a whim, who much of the world despises, and who coincidentally controls a very large amount of crude oil. On the other side of the world there is a super power who's economy depends on oil. So, it makes sense to me to get rid of this dictator and secure a stable source of oil. As long as we continue to buy the oil and not just take it. The fact that the Fed trumped up some terrorist link between Osama and Saddam does bother me. However I would have had no problem if Bush said: \"We're tired of this tyrant, we need oil, let's get rid of 'im, y'all!\" Now, had he said the same about Switzerland, for example, now we have a problem.\n \n \nWhen the USA was attacked none of us complained when you found out who it was and then went to take care of them. That was justifed. The invasion of Iraq wasn't justified since it wasn't connected to the terrorists.\n\n \n \n My whole problem with the \"justification\" question is that several of the countries that are complaining and asking where the proof of WMD is, are the same countries that stand to lose a great deal of money by not being able to sell weapons to Saddam, or trade them for oil. These countries claim that they are looking out for \"justice\", when in fact they are simply looking out for their own monetary interests. So, THEY are misleading their people (and everyone else) as well. So they can stop with the self-righteous rhetoric.",

Personally, I would like to know which country supplied him with the poisons to kill the Kurds. I hope the trial is in the open and International in jurisdiction.\n\n \n Perhaps you'd like a little history lesson. Iraq was once a series of scattered tribes. The Kurds bullied most of these tribes around, visciously slaughtering them, raping their women, and all that XXXX. With the help of British and Russian weapons caches, which include Kalisnikov rifles that apparently grow on trees, Saddam Hussein drove the savage Kurds back and created a society, which, he in turn, ruled sadistically. the Kurds have since reformed themselves under Saddam's reign and were violently hunted.\n \n The U.S. under the Reagan Administration set up an alliance with Saddam for trading oil and keeping peace, particularily against Iran. We sent him weapons. When we could no longer control Saddam, we went to war with him under the Bush Administration. Saddam has not cooperated with the US or the UN for many years now, however, France supplied Saddam with nuclear power in return for 'under the table' oil discounts. I am not making excuses for Americas actions, we certainly have no right being there, but you have no right to speak on issues that you are COMPLETELY ignorant of. \n \n America does not just send weapons to terrorists. We send weapons in good faith of cooperation to people who can potentially help us in situations. Unfortunately, some of these prospects turned out to be terrorists and evil tyrants.

   "Fist off: Who says that we're done? Who says that we won't go after Kim? This whole thing seems to be having a snowball effect, imo, and doesn't seem to be slowing down.\n\n \n A truce which has lasted over 50 years says so. \n \n \nSecond: I feel that you're right if you're insinuating that the whole thing was about oil. My opinion: Here we have (or had) a savage dictator who kills people on a whim, who much of the world despises, and who coincidentally controls a very large amount of crude oil. On the other side of the world there is a super power who's economy depends on oil. So, it makes sense to me to get rid of this dictator and secure a stable source of oil.\n\n \n The thing about that is if Saddam had remained \"pro-American\" he would still be in power. It seems that the American government will overlook much as long as they get what they want.\n \n \nMy whole problem with the \"justification\" question is that several of the countries that are complaining and asking where the proof of WMD is, are the same countries that stand to lose a great deal of money by not being able to sell weapons to Saddam, or trade them for oil. These countries claim that they are looking out for \"justice\", when in fact they are simply looking out for their own monetary interests. So, THEY are misleading their people (and everyone else) as well. So they can stop with the self-righteous rhetoric.\n\n \n The difference is thatthey hadn't invaded another country claiming that it was a threat to them or part of a real threat that did attack them. Remember. Just after the invasion 51% of Americans believed that Saddam was directly responsible for 9/11. Not too long ago it was up to 69%.",

The Kurds bullied most of these tribes around, visciously slaughtering them, raping their women, and all that XXXX. With the help of British and Russian weapons caches, which include Kalisnikov rifles that apparently grow on trees, Saddam Hussein drove the savage Kurds back and created a society, which, he in turn, ruled sadistically. the Kurds have since reformed themselves under Saddam's reign and were violently hunted.

Personally, I don't like looking at the world as if the US were some collective.\n \n \n I would submit that a president that supported no intervention in this day and age would never be elected in the first place. People want their country to be top dog. Doesn't matter what country. There is not a single country on the planet that has not engaged in similar behavior. Not even Switzerland. There neutrality is carefully regulated and planned to achieve their own security. Not that they don't intervene, they just disguise it. \n\n \n China did not invade the Middle East. China basically concerns itself with its locale. They supported the North Vietnamese when we sent troops to the South. Vietnam is on their border. They have also been concerned with Korea. \n \n My point is: Not every country does what we do. Just because we have the power does not mean we should extend it. The jest of my point is: When we exercise our power it can come back to bite us.\n \n \n Now given all of the idea that the US formally supported Saddam, does that necessarily mean that we should not have invaded? Nope. Only that we probably should not have supported him in the first place. \n \n \n I agree. These are two separate issues. Epaphra, I am more concerned with meddling than I am with this war. It seems like a cycle. This is not the first dictator we supported, where later we had to take out. Panama comes to mind also.\n \n Also our support of the Shah in Iran led to resentment that has hindered Americans relations with that country. We do not, as a country, have to determine another country an enemy or friend. People should be able trade freely with whomever they wish (other than sensitive defense secrets).\n \n \n The capture of this person is likely to result, in the long run, in more security and stability for the region. It is not for oil as some would conjecture. It is for national security. That region is a hotbed of terrorist activity. With US presence in Afganistan and Iraq, we are more strategically located to deal with the terrorist targets. Saddam was always a puppet, he just outlived his usefulness in that position. \n\n \n Epaphras, IMHO, we (as a collective) do not have to use people. \n \n \n Cold and calculating I agree. But nonetheless essential. A person would be hardput to show that any other country would do differently under the same or similar circumstances.\n\n \n That does not matter to me actually. I just want a limited government that stays out of my business and does not screw things up while \"trying\" to fix things.",

The US that is. Is it morally correct? I honestly cannot say. On one had I would say that using people for any purpose is wrong. My belief in God tells me that. On the other had, for one country to protect itself over another is quite logical. No other nation on the planet has the standard of living than the US does. Our poor are better off than most other nation's rich. Terrorists have existed in the region we are talking about for several presidents. Saddam is undoubtedly a brutal dictator that brutalized his own people to a grave degree. We set him in there. Just like the Shah, just like panama. Still, I thnk that does not mean we should not have gone into that country for security reasons. \n \n Regardless of politics and the past, that country had become dangerous to The security of the US. The government has the duty and obligation to protect that security and not necessarily the interests of other countries.\n \n There may come a time when world government will be more important.
