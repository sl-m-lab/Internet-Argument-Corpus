   "I wonder who Americans are trying to deceive by declaration of destruction of chemical weapons. May be they published it for their own XXXXXX. Eh, Americans are XXXXXX and believing that the moon is made of green cheese!\n Well, just one idea that 'liquidated' weapons could tall into the wrong hands! Look, you should understand that Americans are businessmen first of all and money is most important for them! I think that under the mask of destruction of weapons they simply take 'em out of country!\n In fact most part of weapons place at the territories of countries what has close collaboration with USA (Georgia, Poland, Romania and other) in the likeness of some agents for laboratories! By this way Americans are trying to discharge their own international liabilities in the framework of reduction of weapons of mass destruction and keep their own strategic potential at that time! Do you understand where they try to place those chemical weapons? Who can guarantee that weapons will never fall into terrorists' hands from Georgia? Everybody know that Saakashvili has too close ties with terrorists! Oy, don't try to make us XXXXXX; Americans need business prosperity than tranquility and stability in the World!",
