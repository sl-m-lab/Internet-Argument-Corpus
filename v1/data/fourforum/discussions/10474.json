Since you didn't specify who gets which side, or what version of either doctrine is to be discussed, it is the choice of the challenged. I'll take the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and you can explain how your God managed to kill Cain's descendants so dead during the Flood that they were still around when the Bible was written. (Genesis 4:17-22) Presumably they evolved gills, and then de-evolved them afterwards. In a suitably miraculous manner. And you can't prove they didn't. Oh, wait, it says in Genesis 7:21 that every man on earth died. But, aha! It doesn't say anything about the women! So the pregnant women turned into mermaids during the flood, and back into women later, and had their children several months after that. But only among Cain's descendants, because we know that all the other nations are descended from Noah's sons. See how easy I'm making this for you?\n \n Or you can explain the evolution of Adam's descendants to shorter and shorter lifetimes. \n \n Or how the animals that fit into on the ark evolved into the tens of millions of species we have today in only 3,500 years or so, and got from the Middle East to Australia, the Americas, and Antarctica (penguins, anyway). Given that the Flood occurred in the year 2,500 or so in the Jewish calendar. Let's see, 300 cubits by 50 cubits by 30 cubits, if a cubit is about half a meter, comes to 55,000 cubic meters or so, of which most is occupied by food for 40 days of rain, and another 150 days of floating around before they came aground on the mountain. Well, seven pairs of elephants would take up at least 300 cubic meters, and then a half year of elephant fodder would take up a few thousand cubic meters, so I don't see how to fit in all the mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, freshwater shellfish, Komodo dragons...Wait a minute. Noah, his wife, his three sons, and his sons' wives, that's only eight people. Who mucked out the stalls and cages and fed the beasties? Particularly the obligate carnivores that can't live on grass or grain? What about the pandas that can only live on bamboo from China? What about the koalas that can only live on eucalyptus leaves? OK, so the bamboo and the eucalyptus were growing in the Middle East back then, along with the pandas and the koalas and the wallabies and the platypi, and they all went away all over the earth in clades so that marsupials only live in Australia and America and like that, and there are no lions in Asia or tigers in Africa, and no monkeys in Africa but lots of apes and people. And the pandas went where the bamboo migrated, and the koalas went with the eucalyptus, and so on, even across oceans, like all the different species of Galapagos finches or the dodo. And none of them left any bones along the way.\n \n I nominate chemist99 and Wascally Wabbit as judges. emoticon_xangel What do you say, fellows?\n \n BTW, Feindslayer, what's a feind?
