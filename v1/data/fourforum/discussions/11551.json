   "Let me just start with a disclaimer: Id very much like to get back into the 4forums fold; as many of you may know, I only left because of boredom with the evo/creo situation. As things stand, without any judgment (ie it's not you, it's me) I couldn't be bothered with the repetitiousness of certain argumentative fields. However I would still like to participate when world events take a world-shaping turn; so here we are. in my humble opinion.\n \n *ahem*\n \n So, that said, I'm very interested in understanding the american ubermind so close to an election, and I'd love to hear your thoughts, ultra-conservative through to ultra-radical purely to know what is going on in the american psyche (if a small, 4forums-biased sample can ever mean anything).\n \n With that in mind, I've tried to distill my views on certain pivotal issues down to a few sentences and would like to compare them with yours; if for nothing but the ideal that we can all discourse rationally without allowing partisanship to muddy the waters; as a citizen of the UK I am all too well aware of the impact upon my country of the election of the POTUS and all that entails; essentially I would like to hear from each of you, your ideal motivations and dedications of your ideal POTUS, regardless of partisan tradition. Cheers.\n \n Example issues (not an exhauistive list by any means) would be as follows:\n \n 1) Banking regulation (given the ultimate potential option of nationalisation) \n 2( Oil dependency (as above and below)\n 3) Aggressive vs passive foreign policy (neither option in my view necessitates isolationism. Think outside the box!)\n 4) Macroeconomics (supply-side vs demand-side; business vs labour union; minimum wage; welfare)\n 5) Civil liberty vs personal security (includes gun control, GLBT issues; drug control; welfare again)\n 6) Personal responsibility vs social security (risk assessment, really)\n 7) Free science vs religious limits (eg stem cells; abortion; cretoscholastics)\n 8) Private/public education (meritocracy vs plutocracy)\n 9) Free/fair trade (please check established definitions before you answer) \n 10) Centralisation of power (includes taxation and size of government)\n 110 Environmental issues (Regardless of the hype, there are certain things which are unavoidable in terms of consequences)\n 12) Healthcare (like banking, nationalisation is the extreme option)\n \n Hokay, as a non-citizen of the USA, I would personally prefer the following policies (and I have some fairly crazy views, I'll admit):\n \n 1) Not nationalisation, but major publicisation of credit unions, who differ from banks in that the only shareholders are the depositors; ie everyone who has an account, is a shareholder; no one else. This removes shareholder power from the one institution that should be owned by depositors: banks. The money industry combined with shareholder values has in my opinion contributed hugely to the corruption and \"old-boy-networking\" that we see today.\n \n 2) God knows. I don't even know where to start on this one; but if we change our buying habits we will be less endebted to crazy monarchies. That's all I have to say on that one.\n \n 3) Stop starting wars; trade instead. Simple.\n \n 4) More regulation (as if there could be less!) based on protecting the buyer as well asthe seller. This is a concept that we did away with in the 80s. This gives legal rights to the common man as well as  the Corporation. Crazy, isn't it?\n \n 5) Plea to emotion: Seriously though, I'd rather run the risk of terrorists and keep all my freedoms, than sacrifice my freedoms for nebulous security. 100%. I will run the risk. It's a risk more than worth taking.\n \n ...\n \n More later. Thanks for reading.",

   "I did a bit of research on this current U.S. economic meltdown and the names of Phil and Wendy Gramm kept creeping in.\n \n Seems that Phil Gramm wrote a bit of legislation that created the present meltdown, like oh:\n \n The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act, (November 12, 1999), which set aside the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933.\n \n Then, he went on to sneak in:\n \n a 262-page amendment into the omnibus appropriations bill titled: Commodity Futures Modernization Act\n \n in between the time Bush was selected as president by the U.S. Supreme Court and the time of Bush's taking office.\n \n Frankly, I'd just like to pile up a whole bunch of worthless stock certificates, legacies of Phil and Wendy Gramm, frogmarch Phil and Wendy to the stake, and put a torch to the pile.\n \n Just to get things started.",
