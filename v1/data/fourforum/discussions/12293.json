   "Roe v Wade\n \n Why don't people quote the scriptures correctly instead of making it up as they go?\n \n What the Bible says about Abortion\n [*]Abortion is not murder. A fetus is not considered a human life. \n \n [*]If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life. -- Exodus 21:22-23 \n \n [*]The Bible places no value on fetuses or infants less than one month old. \n \n [*]And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. -- Leviticus 27:6 \n \n [*]Fetuses and infants less than one month old are not considered persons. \n \n [*]Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them. And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD. -- Numbers 3:15-16 \n \n [*]God sometimes approves of killing fetuses. \n \n [*]And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? ... Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. -- Numbers 31:15-17 [*](Some of the non-virgin women must have been pregnant. They would have been killed along with their unborn fetuses.) \n \n [*]Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. -- Hosea 9:14 \n \n [*]Yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb. -- Hosea 9:16 \n \n [*]Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up. -- Hosea 13:16 \n \n [*]God sometimes kills newborn babies to punish their parents. \n \n [*]Because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die. -- 2 Samuel 12:14 \n \n [*]God sometimes causes abortions by cursing unfaithful wives. \n \n [*]The priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell. And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen. ... \n \n [*]And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people. And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed. -- Numbers 5:21-21, 27-28 \n \n [*]God's law sometimes requires the execution (by burning to death) of pregnant women. \n \n [*]Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. -- Genesis 38:24\n If you find conflicting ideas in the bible, which do you believe and why?\n \n Tough to have it both ways AND the bible doesn't pretend to have it both ways.

It is just nice to see so many of the issues surrounding \"personhood\" put into one site. The negatives of the site are that there are no external links to support the scientists views (so the reader would have to look those up themselves) and that the scientists do use those facts to come to their own conclusions/opinions about the beginning of personhood. \n \n So, the site is more useful for those willing to check out facts on their own and for those willing to hear facts without automatically accepting the presenter's conclusions from those facts but making conclusions based on their own reasoning - as I would do if given the link to a pro-life side that had supporting facts. The site is less useful for those who do not think for themselves and for those unwilling to look into facts since I personally think that people need to hear out all sides before deciding and this site only presents the pro-choice side. I think that, at this point, the topic of this web site is getting pretty much exhausted.

   "Which is, of course, an absolute non-answer.\n\n It most certainly was an answer. It addressed your premise that by prohibiting the government from restricting a person from having an abortion, we are denying them the power to force a person to obtain an abortion. That is not true, primarily due to the constitutional theory that you adhere to.\n \n \nNow, since you feel that the role of government in stopping women from choosing to terminate their pregnancies, you must also complete the theory.\n\n Government should stop any human being from unjustifiably killing another human being. Government should never force any human being to unjustifiably kill another human being. It is perfectly consistent to adhere to both of these propositions.\n \n \nWhat punishment do you propose for the supposed \"crime\" of abortion?\n\n How about the same punishment we would apply to any other instance where one person intentionally kills another person?\n \n \nUpon whom will the punishment be applied? The woman only? Her doctor only? Both? Anyone else?\n\n How about we apply it to the same people who would be liable in any other instance where one person intentionally kills another person, or who aids another person in doing so?\n \n \nWhy do you presume that juries will convict?\n\n I do not presume that they will. Sometimes they will; sometimes they will not. Just like any other criminal violation.\n \n \nHow will you deal with the fact that juries must represent a cross-section of the community?\n\n The same way juries are presently selected.\n \n \nWould you exclude people who are pro-choice from the jury? On what Constitutional basis?\n\n Of course, this is somewhat of a simplistic view of criminal procedure. In general, I would not. The state in most jurisdictions, however, may in accordance with criminal procedure strike a certain number of jurors for any or no reason at all, including their pro-choice views.\n \n In short, I see no reason that a pro-choice individual could not set aside their personal views to perform their duty to decide cases according to the law, just as pro-life appellate judges are often called upon to set aside their personal views to apply the law as it presently stands: abortion on demand.\n \n \nWill you include only profetallifers on the jury? On what Constitutional basis?\n\n You are a real case.\n \n \nWill the alleged violations of \"law\" be state or Federal crimes?\n\n I see no basis for federal jurisdiction regarding abortion, save perhaps for the limited areas set forth in the Constitution. \n \n \nDo you propose that YOUR preference be written as a statute or a Constitutional amendment? State or Federal?\n\n Because I respect the law, I prefer that my view be enacted by a Constitutional amendment. That is obviously contrary to many pro-choice advocates, whose disrespect for the law is evidenced by the fact that they would rather pursue their policy by judicial fiat.\n \n \nWhen you finish with those questions, I have about 50 more.\n\n I could never imagine that.\n \n \nI also predict you will try to talk around them instead of responding as a logical person would.\n\n You are one bona fide Nostradamus.\n \n \nBottom line, do you not see the legal morass your absurd proposition will create?emoticon_idea\n\n The problem with this ultimate conclusion is simply that it is baseless.

I have not given sufficient thought to the issue to formulate a meaningful response.\n\n I have obviously given a lot of thought to my views, which is why they are not only so impeccably grounded in reason, logic, and truth, but they are also flawlessly consistent.\n \n \nThey all increased individual freedom. Never has there been an Amendment passed which sought to limit freedom. \n \n\n This has already been proved false.\n \n Moreover, protecting all human beings' right to life notwithstanding their location or stage of development would certainly be enhancing individual freedom on an unprecedented level.\n \n \nSorry, but as the right wingnuts constantly remind us, this is a Constitutional Republic. there are ways that our elected representatives, should they choose, may remove certain topics from the Courts' jurisdiction.\n\n Isn't this a slight of hand, as nobody has ever questioned the court's jurisdiction to hear a case challenging state statutes which regulate abortion.\n \n \nIn the interim, you simply have to accept that the SCOTUS is the final authority on what the Constitution means.\n\n And here I thought it was we the people who had final authority on what the Constitution means. This is not only evident from the structure of the document, but also from its provision for Constitutional amendment, which clearly gives the people final authority on what the Constitution means.\n \n It is refreshing, however, to see that you have dropped your claim that interstate travel is a right protected by the Constitution. I assume that you have come to see this view as error, and congratulate you on revising your view accordingly.",

However, by your remarks, it's clear that YOU do need to read it again.\n \n \n It clearly states that the \"privileges and immunities\" and all the other protections written into it appertain only to born persons.\n\n \n The 14th. Amendment says no such thing. \n \n \n It is impossible to apply the Constitution to anyone other than born persons.\n\n \n Completely disproven by the reality that the Constitution is already being applied to \"persons\" other than those who are \"born\" human beings.\n \n See HERE;\n \n \n \n Check this citation from Find Law. That's the source most used by attorneys when researching cases, not some propaganda website: FindLaw: U.S. Constitution: Fourteenth Amendment: Annotations pg. 3 of 40\n \n As you will se the only REAL controversy is whether or not the 14th Amendment applied to corporate \"persons\" as well as natural, i.e., BORN persons.\n\n \n Actually, Chester,... had you taken the time to read your own citation, you would have found otherwise. \n \n Quote;\"Persons Defined- ... \"As to the natural persons protected by the due process clause, these include all human beings regardless of race, color, or citizenship.\"\n \n A human fetus is a \"human\" being. It is the \"young child\" of other human beings. \n \n Now we both agree that ourcurrent laws do not recognize the personhood or basic human rights of prebirth children. But that doesn't mean that the 14th Amendment excludes them from Constitutional protections (as you are claiming it does.)\n \n To the contrary, I would take the statement [B]\"As to the natural persons protected by the due process clause, these include all human beings regardless of race, color, or citizenship.\"[/B] to be all inclusive, and not exclusive as you are suggesting it is.\n \n Also, by your reading of the 14th Amendment,... and your contention that the 14th Amendment only protects \"born\" persons? How do you reconcile the fact that Roe v. Wade allows the states to regulate abortion (denying it to women in the 3rd trimester) and forbidding a woman to kill her \"fetus?\"\n \n Using your interpretation of the 14th, Roe v. Wade is Un-Constitutional law.",
