   "A study has found no evidence that male homosexuality is influenced by a gene passed from mother to son. \n \n The study, reported in an edition of the journal Science, does little to settle the issue of whether there is a gene on the X chromosome that predisposes men to homosexuality. Men inherit their single X chromosome from their mothers. \n \n The gene was first predicted in 1993 based on studies of families with two gay brothers. \n \n \"The initial finding hasn't been disproven, but it probably hasn't been replicated to most people's satisfaction,\" said Alan Sanders, a psychiatrist and geneticist at the University of Chicago. \"Maybe it will be, and maybe it won't be.\" \n \n Dean Hamer, the scientist who first reported the connection, criticized the new study for not using families where homosexuality predominated on the mother's side. The researchers, argued Hamer, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., were making it harder on themselves to find the gene. \n \n Several studies have supported the idea that genetics plays a role in homosexuality. But scientists say genetics cannot be the whole story. \n \n For example, some gay men have an identical twin who is gay, and other gay men have an identical twin who is not gay. The term \"gay gene\" is misleading, scientists say, because there are likely to be many subtle genetic influences on sexual orientation. \n \n In the 1993 research, Hamer and his colleagues studied the genetic makeup of 40 families. As the researchers reported then in Science, genetic features on a region of the X chromosome tended to correlate with homosexual orientation. A 1995 study by the same researchers also suggested the link. An actual predisposing gene in the region has not been reported. \n \n The result was intriguing to many people. Some thought the study supported the notion that homosexuality is not a choice. \n \n But many scientists were cautious about saying Hamer's findings meant the \"gay gene\" really existed. While geneticists are adept at finding genes that cause clear-cut conditions, such as sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis, it has been much harder to pin down genes that underlie more complex traits. \n \n For instance, scientists know that certain disorders, such as schizophrenia and manic depression, have a genetic component. But they have not been able to pin down the culprit genes. That's probably because many genes, as well as other influences, contribute to the disorders. \n \n Scientists don't put much stock in any one study unless other studies find the same result. \n \n \"The replication of a genetic finding in these behavioral (traits) is very difficult,\" said Melvin McInnis, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. \n \n Sexual orientation is likely to be just as complicated, he said. The result of the new study - by George Rice, George Ebers and Carol Anderson at the University of Western Ontario and Neil Risch at Stanford Medical School in California - doesn't mean the first study was incorrect. Although the new study examined the same spot on the X chromosome in 104 gay men, it was done on different people. It could be, McInnis said, that an X chromosome gene is at work in the first group of people but not the second. \n \n Sanders has also tried to replicate the findings of Hamer, although his results have not appeared in a scientific journal. He said his study was more in the middle - it didn't replicate Hamer's findings, but it didn't exclude the possibility as strongly as the new study did. \n \n The only way to solve the problem is to study more people, the scientists said. Even then, if there is an effect of a gene on the X chromosome, scientists may never be able to pinpoint it if the effect is very small, Sanders said. \n \n \n http://www.gaytostraight.org/downloads/chapter2.pdf",

   "PFOX's Richard \"Quack\" Cohen Lies in the Washington Blade \n \n \n Monday, March 21, 2005 \n \n Richard Cohen, President of Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays, blatantly lied in last week's Washington Blade, 'Ex-gay' group wants respect  ,\n by denying the political and mean spirited mission of his organization. While there are simply too many mistruths to counter, I would like to set the record straight on a few key points:\n \n Myth: Cohen said, \"PFOX is not in the changing business\".\n \n Fact: Cohen's farcical statement is betrayed by their expensive advertising campaign that focuses exclusively on \"change\". Take a look at the PFOX billboard with the huge headline \"Ex-Gays Prove that Change Is Possible\" and judge for yourself.\n \n Myth: Cohen said, \"As a professional psychotherapist, I have helped hundreds change from gay to straight.\"\n \n Fact: Cohen conveniently fails to mention that he was permanently expelled from the American Counseling Association in 2002. Manager of Ethics & Professional Standards Larry Freeman, told the Blade that, \"If a person is sanctioned by the ACA code of ethics, it indicates that there's been a practice of malpractice.\"\n \n It is interesting that if one reads his book, not one of the people featured has actually gone from gay to straight. Cohen steadfastly refuses to keep real statistics so the public can have a true idea of his failure rate.\n \n Finally, Cohen failed to inform Blade readers that he once belonged to the Wesleyan Christian Community Church, a cult that was infamous for practicing nude therapy. Today, Cohen practices the very controversial method of \"touch therapy\" that has led to many abuses across the nation.\n \n Myth: Cohen says, \"I lived a gay life for many years. Today I am happily married with three kids.\"\n \n Fact: Based on his own life story, Cohen's testimony of change is highly suspect. For more than two years, Cohen left his wife and cruised New York City looking for men.\n \n \"It was a very bizarre time. I was out running around New York City with my boyfriend, and she was at home alone taking care of our son, knowing her husband was out with a man,\" Cohen wrote in his book, Coming Out Straight.\n Cohen readily admits that he once lied to the public and even his own family. So, why should we believe him today?\n \n Myth: Cohen said, \"We are in the loving business.\"\n \n Fact: If one looks at the history of PFOX, it is very difficult to find even a hint of love. Roy Cohn's former houseboy, Anthony Falzarano, who once called Matthew Shepard \"a predator to heterosexual men\", founded the group in the late 1990's. Falzarano also once told CBS that Satan \"uses homosexuals as pawns and then he kills them.\" With this type of rhetoric, it is no surprise that the political right wing organization, The Family Research Council, helped launch the group with an $80,000 grant.\n \n Richard Cohen, Falzarano's replacement, also comes up a little short in the love department. While he claimed in the Blade that ex-gay therapy is a \"civil right\", Cohen has regularly lobbied legislators in Annapolis to ensure that people in Maryland can be fired from their jobs just because they are gay or lesbian.\n \n Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the controversial talk radio host who once referred to gay people as \"biological errors\", wrote the forward for Cohen's book. Cohen also says that gay people can't be happy and believes that they are mentally ill, coining a phony diagnosis with a derisive acronym, Same-Sex Attachment Disorder (SSAD).\n \n Finally, Cohen admits that he was once fired from the Red Cross and \"their reason was that I was homophobic and spreading hate.\" There are a lot of words to describe Cohen and PFOX's work, but love is not one of them.\n \n Myth: Cohen said, \"We are in the education business.\"\n \n Fact: Cohen and PFOX exist to spread outdated myths about gay life. Their work is rejected by every respected medical and mental health organization in America.\n \n Cohen's favorite media sound bite is, \"born gay, no way\", although he offers no credible evidence to back up his assertion. Despite the incontrovertible fact that countless gay men are close to their fathers, in an interview I did with Cohen for my book Anything But Straight, he said:\n \n \"I don't believe that you or anyone else can have same sex attractions and have successfully attached to both Mom and Dad. It's an impossibility and I do not believe it can be true.\"\n \n Another educational gem from Cohen is, \"The penis and the vagina fit together. Two penises and two vaginas, they don't work.\"\n \n PFOX offers false hope and traffics in broken families. It should do its members a favor by disbanding and sending these misguided people to PFLAG where they can learn the true meaning of love and acceptance.\n \n Richard Cohen has made a career out of degrading the lives of gay and lesbian people. While he and his clientele might not have changed into heterosexuals, we can certainly set the record straight. If Cohen is up to the challenge, I am interested in a public debate on this issue. Of course, he may feel it is in his best interest to continue letting his distortions and falsehoods go uncontested. \n \n Tom Musbach, PlanetOut Network\n Wednesday, January 26, 2005 \n \nRichard Cohen, an influential figure in the \"ex-gay\" movement, has been permanently expelled from the American Counseling Association (ACA) because of ethics violations, according to an ACA document.\n\n 'Ex-gay' therapist cited for ethics breaches \n \n \nWhen teachthefacts.org contacted the ACA to confirm the story, we received the following letter:\n \n Your inquiry regarding Richard Cohen of Bowie, MD and his status with the American Counseling Association was forwarded to me for a response. The ACA Ethics Committee at their most recent adjudication meeting, 3/23/02, discussed in detail the ethics complaint filed against Mr. Richard Cohen. The decision of the committee was to accept all charges (A.1.a; A.1.b.; A.5.a.; A.6.a; C.3.b; and C.3.f) against him and to render the sanction of ACA Membership expulsion.This case was officially closed 5/28/02, 30 business days after the committee sanction, Mr. Richard Cohen elected not to appeal.Respectfully,Larry T. Freeman, MA, LPCManager, Ethics and Professional StandardsStaff LiaisonAmerican Counseling Association\n\n \n P-FOX President Expelled for Life from the American Counseling Association ",

I knew it all along. Why do you think my marriage did break up? hmmm...\n \n Why, if God did not make me this way, have I been so blessed since my having accepted His Gift? \n Why do I have a loving and supportive family, a happy and well adjusted teenager who doesn't lie, cheet or steal, doesn't do drugs, is a good student, liked by nearly everyone who ever meets him ...and why has my relationship with my partner has outlasted not only my original marriage, but my ex's subsequent marriages, and many others of friends and family? \n Why do I have more friends and more meaningful friendships? \n Why has my brother, of which I had previously been astranged, become the brother I always wanted?

   "So you were a 'lesbian' the whole time? You had same sex attractions while married to your husband? And yet you had sexual relations with him and even bore a child from this. \n\n \n Yup, pretty much sums it up. \n \n \n I'm sorry, but many women that say they are lesbians speak of those kind of things to try to make everyone believe that 'this was really the way they were the whole time'. I just don't believe it.\n\n \n Your loss, bucko. \n Because that is they way it is. Like it or not, take it or leave it. \n Honestly, I don't care what you believe, but don't for a second attempt to assume you know me at all.\n \n \n \n I know of a lesbian woman that recently broke up with her 'girlfriend' and has since been seeing a man and 'having the time of her life' in her own words. She was married at one time also but had a bad relationship and problems with her ex. She was seeking a mate that would be understanding of her needs and to be gentle to her. Well, it turns out this woman she was with was not that at all. This man she is seeing now is everything she was looking for in the first place.\n\n \n Either she's actually bi-sexual, or maybe indeed she did have an emotional problem with men, but got over it. It's not unheard of. I won't deny there are some women who do \"choose\" to pretent to be lesbian out of some emotional problem. But it's usually temporary and they almost always return to doing what comes naturally to them. \n \n I, on the other hand, am not one of those types of women. \n \n Just as there are left handed and right handed women. Even a right handed woman who injures her right hand will, until the right hand heels, use their left hand. \n \n But, there are those who are naturally left handed who were taught that using the left hand was evil or bad, or just plain wrong in some way. So, they never develope the use of their left hand and actually always have perceptive problems because of the mixed handed nature.\n \n Then there are those who are taught the left hand is wrong, but later one get over it. They begin using and strengthening their left hand, they stop using the right hand and everything finally feels right.\n \n \n The thing is, there is no right way or wrong way with sexuality. As long as it's not hurting anyone and it's between concenting adults, it's really none of anyone's business. \n \n What bothers me, and always will, are those who think that because they are uncomfortable with their own sexuality and were taught that sex and the body are inherently shameful that they must then inturn pass that self-hate onto subsequent generations.\n Just because you are uncomfortable with my sexuality doesn't give you the right to tell me I'm wrong. Because I'm not. \n It's wrong FOR you, but it's not FOR me. \n Your sexuality is wrong for me, but I don't dislike you for it. I wouldn't dream of taking away or barring you from certain rights because of it. \n \n But you can't be happy with what you have, you have to deny it to those whom confuse you, frighten you because it's different than you. \n That's not being Christian, darling, that's being a hypocrit and a bigot. \n \n No two ways around it.",

   "A study has found no evidence that male homosexuality is influenced by a gene passed from mother to son. \n \n The study, reported in an edition of the journal Science, does little to settle the issue of whether there is a gene on the X chromosome that predisposes men to homosexuality. Men inherit their single X chromosome from their mothers. \n \n The gene was first predicted in 1993 based on studies of families with two gay brothers. \n \n \"The initial finding hasn't been disproven, but it probably hasn't been replicated to most people's satisfaction,\" said Alan Sanders, a psychiatrist and geneticist at the University of Chicago. \"Maybe it will be, and maybe it won't be.\" \n \n Dean Hamer, the scientist who first reported the connection, criticized the new study for not using families where homosexuality predominated on the mother's side. The researchers, argued Hamer, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., were making it harder on themselves to find the gene. \n \n Several studies have supported the idea that genetics plays a role in homosexuality. But scientists say genetics cannot be the whole story. \n \n For example, some gay men have an identical twin who is gay, and other gay men have an identical twin who is not gay. The term \"gay gene\" is misleading, scientists say, because there are likely to be many subtle genetic influences on sexual orientation. \n \n In the 1993 research, Hamer and his colleagues studied the genetic makeup of 40 families. As the researchers reported then in Science, genetic features on a region of the X chromosome tended to correlate with homosexual orientation. A 1995 study by the same researchers also suggested the link. An actual predisposing gene in the region has not been reported. \n \n The result was intriguing to many people. Some thought the study supported the notion that homosexuality is not a choice. \n \n But many scientists were cautious about saying Hamer's findings meant the \"gay gene\" really existed. While geneticists are adept at finding genes that cause clear-cut conditions, such as sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis, it has been much harder to pin down genes that underlie more complex traits. \n \n For instance, scientists know that certain disorders, such as schizophrenia and manic depression, have a genetic component. But they have not been able to pin down the culprit genes. That's probably because many genes, as well as other influences, contribute to the disorders. \n \n Scientists don't put much stock in any one study unless other studies find the same result. \n \n \"The replication of a genetic finding in these behavioral (traits) is very difficult,\" said Melvin McInnis, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. \n \n Sexual orientation is likely to be just as complicated, he said. The result of the new study - by George Rice, George Ebers and Carol Anderson at the University of Western Ontario and Neil Risch at Stanford Medical School in California - doesn't mean the first study was incorrect. Although the new study examined the same spot on the X chromosome in 104 gay men, it was done on different people. It could be, McInnis said, that an X chromosome gene is at work in the first group of people but not the second. \n \n Sanders has also tried to replicate the findings of Hamer, although his results have not appeared in a scientific journal. He said his study was more in the middle - it didn't replicate Hamer's findings, but it didn't exclude the possibility as strongly as the new study did. \n \n The only way to solve the problem is to study more people, the scientists said. Even then, if there is an effect of a gene on the X chromosome, scientists may never be able to pinpoint it if the effect is very small, Sanders said. \n \n \n http://www.gaytostraight.org/downloads/chapter2.pdf\n\n \n Note (from above):\n \n \n\"does little to settle the issue..................The initial finding hasn't been disproven\n",
