   "The first comprehensive head-to-head analysis of the leading Presidential candidates' expressed plans for funding government programs that have helped millions of Americans get ahead has found major differences in how they would approach set-asides for grants, loans, free services and other federal opportunities. The exhaustive review, compiled by researchers at Information USA from public and published statements, shows Barack Obama would provide more than two times the support for such services than contender John McCain.\n \n \"The best place to look for the future in America is in the promises offered by elected officials running for office,\" according to Information USA founder Matthew Lesko, the popular television icon in the question mark suit and author of more than 100 books on finding such services.\n \n \"America may be facing what will probably be the biggest turning point in recent history, and both candidates are pitching their view of how to help this country. The devil might be in the details, but so are the facts. What we've done here is look at each of their track records, their stated proposed policies and programs. You be the judge.\"\n \n Below is a website with a comparative listing culled from the both candidates' proposed new programs. The first group is a one line description of each new benefit program. And the second grouping is a more detailed description of each. The chart shows Obama has pledged his support for 212 of these vital programs and services, compared to137 that have been endorsed by McCain.\n \n To view the complete detailed description of the Presidential Campaign New Programs go to: myamericanbenefitsplan (dot) com/president (dot) php",
