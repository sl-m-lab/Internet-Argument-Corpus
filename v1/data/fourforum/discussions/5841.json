Now imagine that this gun could fire .308 caliber and .50 caliber metal projectiles accurately at up to 8,000 fps (feet-per-second), featured an infinitely variable/programmable cyclic rate-of-fire (as high as 120,000 rounds-per-minute), and were capable of laying down a 360-degree field of fire. What if you could mount this weapon on any military Humvee (HMMWV), any helicopter/gunship, any armored personnel carrier (APC), and any other vehicle for which the technology were applicable?\n \n That would really be something, wouldn't it? Some of you might be wondering, \"how big would it be\", or \"how much would it weigh\"? Others might want to know what it's ammunition capacity would be. These are all good questions, assuming of course that a weapon like this were actually possible.\n \n According to its inventor, not only is it possible, it's already happened. An updated version of the weapon will be available soon. It will arrive in the form of a...\n \n \n \n tactically-configured pre-production anti-personnel weapon firing .308 caliber projectiles (accurately) at 2,500-3000 fps, at a variable/programmable cyclic rate of 5,000-120,000 rpm (rounds-per-minute). The weapon's designer/inventor has informed DefRev that future versions of the weapon will be capable of achieving projectile velocities in the 5,000-8,000 fps range with no difficulty. The technology already exists.\n The weapon itself is called the DREAD, or Multiple Projectile Delivery System (MPDS), and it may just be the most revolutionary infantry weapon system concept that DefenseReview has EVER come across.\n \n The DREAD Weapon System is the brainchild of weapons designer/inventor Charles St. George. It will be 40 inches long, 32 inches wide, and 3 inches high (20 inches high with the pintel swivel mount). It will be comprised of only 30 component parts, and will have an empty weight of only 28 pounds. That's right, 28 pounds. The weapon will be capable of rotating 360 degrees and enjoy the same elevation and declination capabilities of any conventional vehicle-mounted gun/weapon.\n \n The first generation DREAD (production version), derived from the tactically-configured pre-production weapon, will most likely be a ground vehicle-mounted anti-personnel weapon. Military Humvees (HMMWV's) and other ground vehicles (including Chevy Suburbans) equipped with the DREAD will enjoy magazine capacities of at least 50,000 rounds of .308 Cal., or 10,000 rounds of .50 Cal. ammo.",

   "It looks impressive, but I'm wondering about the whole 'no recoil' thing. Laws of physics dictate that every action has an equal opposite reaction, so if a projectile leaves the DREAD with a force that's powerful enough to accelerate a projectile to 8000 fps it should create an equally powerful opposite force (i.e. recoil).",

   "there is something off in that weapon system, what would a centrafuge spinning that fast do the the handling of Humvees? also why would it only be able to carry 10,000 .50 cal, but 50,000 .308? things dont add up right.",

Laws of physics dictate that every action has an equal opposite reaction, so if a projectile leaves the DREAD with a force that's powerful enough to accelerate a projectile to 8000 fps it should create an equally powerful opposite force (i.e. recoil).\nSince it is relying upon \"centrafugal\" force to launch the missile, the opposite force will be upon the central axis and the joint between that axis and the centrafuge. It would have to be bloody strong, but would still vibrate like mad at the fire rates suggested. The thing would be impossible to aim (a 360 deg arc of fire really would be your only option) and the gyroscopic affect would pull any aircraft it were attached to out of the sky and likely flip any ground based vehicle that tried to turn whilst it were firing.\n \n I'd put it in the same league of insane weapon idea as the great British cold war invention of the \"chicken nuke\" (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3588465.stm)",
