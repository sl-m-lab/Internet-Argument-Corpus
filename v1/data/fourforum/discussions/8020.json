If we were to go overboard with it *and I daresay this shouldn't happen with what it costs!* but if for some reason we went overboard it could be for the worse. At this moment I think it is a GREAT discovery and could be a huge assest to science. Everyone's opinions? :)",

   "Cloning sort of makes sense when it comes to generating heirs, depending on whether you are willing to throw yourself on the machine of evolution - technically if you are rich enough to have a clone inherit your wealth and maitain it and do the same then you will be propogating the information that created you.

By the time you know you have a problem, your herd would be gone.\n\n \n I believe that if you are going to use cloning to do so on a prized cow, dog, horse, cat..whatever - you shouldn't create a whole group. I would think the only reason to clone an animal such as a dog or horse or cow or cat should be for example: the animal is infertile and a champion. There would be no reason for cloning just to make the animal live longer. I think it should only be done for breeding purposes - to get champion progeny from the champion animal. This would stop the worries of a whole group catching a disease so quickly, and you wouldn't have a whole herd or whatever of the exact same animal. \n \n \nTo some it may not seem silly.

I see your point of the inheritance but why not give the money to a realative or such? Cloning, in my opinion is not something just anyone should be able to do on themselves, or there best pet friend. It should be used for scientific purposes or purposes that are not just for inheritance or fun. I think it should be used for such things as helping scientists study a specific animal - example a bear dies mysteriously of an unknown disease. Scientists cant find the disease in any way. Create a clone and study it from birth. Find out what disease it is and find oyut if it something humans and other animals can catch.\n \n Theres my opinion on going out and cloning people for inheritance. I'm sorry but I don't think cloning is something that should be avalible to the public at such an early stage. Atleast not to clone humans. What if the person trying to clone himself/herself were to die trying to make a clone for inheritance? Now its all over before they could even see there amazing copy.",

Bananas are, as you say, basically clones. There are a handful of strains out there. The bananas we eat today are not the bananas our parents ate. 30 some years ago there was one popular strain, and everyone grew that one. Then some blight showed up, and before anyone could do anything about it pretty much the entire banana crop was gone. The blight was particularly effective against that one strain, and wiped it out. The bananas we have today are from a different strain, one that wasn't as susceptible to that one disease.",
