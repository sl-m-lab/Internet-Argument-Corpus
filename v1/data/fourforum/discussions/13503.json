The best thing is that if some day I just can't spare $7.99, I can always play the trial version for an unlimited amount of time. \n \n I also did the ten day trial on World of Warcraft as an undead mage. It was ten times better than RuneScape, but it just wasn't worth $30 a month, and there is no trial version, so if you don't pay, you don't play. For the Horde!\n \n This is kind of childish, but I also played Pirates of the Caribbean online for a period of time, gradually losing interest.",

   "I played world of warcraft quite a bit in university, it is (or at least was, I don't have much of an opinion on its current iteration) one of the best games ever made - IF you have the time for it. \n \n If your lifestyle doesn't suit the time commitment, it probably isn't worthwhile, the real fun is in the endgame teamwork that needs that commitment.\n \n I will say that one of the great things about the original pre-expansion WoW was its measured pace of progression. Most bosses were an achievement to kill for the first time, particularly the first and last in a given dungeon, but an achievement that could eventually be accomplished by almost any guild given the gradual buildup of equipment and experience. You could bring along a core of 10 really dedicated players and 30 more casual ones and still get through almost anything, it just took longer.\n \n From the release of the Naxx dungeon at the end of original WoW's lifespan, the game had more of a treadmill feel to it, where you either kept up with fast paced progression or fell off the back. If you tried to \"gradually\" progress, by the time you got to bosses they had often been so trivialised any genuine sense of accomplishment was gone, while the fast release of higher raid dungeons meant that anything you gained in equipment was obsolete anyway.\n \n Not just that but you couldn't bring along the \"noobs\" anymore either, you needed 25 highly committed players (and 10 - 15 almost-equally-committed reserves) to get much of anywhere.\n \n I think in the original we got through 3 and a bit raid dungeons in 18 mths+ and were doing pretty well, in Burning Crusade we cleared 6.5 in 12 mths and were falling behind the progression curve, with bosses starting to be \"nerfed\" just after we'd dropped them.\n \n I'll probably go back to it when the final expansion is out to revisit it in its ultimate form and somehow find the time, but for now there are other priorities.",

   "Ok! I figured out how to respond to someone!!! My brother, who's computer I'm on LOVED World of Warcraft. In fact, having these discussions and WoW were his favorite pastimes. I'd never played warcraft, but when I moved down here to help his wife keep the businesses going (and not lose the house), I decided to give it a shot. I needed to tell his friends (called guild members) that he wouldn't be coming back. Having met his friends online, I was invited to join them and play on my brother's account. Let me tell ya, I had no idea that video games had come so far. I can totally see why people get so into WoW. The people in the guild are always joking about who's wife will be leaving first because of the time they spend! I think there are certainly worse things that you could spend your money on (and I'm pretty sure its only $10 or 12/ month if you buy 6 months at a time and only $15 if you pay per month)",

I put up some questions about starting an account and finding my brother's old comments...If someone has the time to respond it would be very helpful. \n \n Looking forward to meeting my brothers old companions!\n Matt S.\n\n \n Creating an account is simple. You need to buy the game from a retail store and I suggest it since you have an official CD key and proof of purchase in case your account gets hacked or stolen.\n \n Sadly I am still trying to get my account back for the second time and Blizzard is still verifying all of my information to make sure it's me. What a pain. Oh and a tip do not give ANYONE and I mean ANYONE your info. Make a separate email address specifically for your WoW account and make sure you use a separate username and password from other programs.\n \n Essentially, they have the WoW battle chest which includes vanilla WoW (levels 1-60) and Burning Crusades (60-70). The newest content is Wrath Of The Lich King which is endgame content for characters 68-80. \n \n You register an email and a new account to the cd keys provided when you buy the game, and set up a payment plan with the new account. pretty simple. \n \n As far as class/race/faction it's up to you. I've only ever played alliance personally and I've only stuck to one level 80 which is my Fury Warrior. I tend to only stick with one character or main compared to other WoW players in order to gear him out and make him the best in his class.\n \n And I've only found personally a real satisfaction from playing a warrior even though we're a dying breed. Many warriors rolled death knights due to the many nerfs of our class in earlier patches and other rolled paladins. However warrior is the one class that is dependent solely upon gear.\n \n Fury warrior especially scales in major way with gear. Thus near endgame content when many other classes are crying that warriors are overpowered, they refuse to acknowledge that first we're a middle of the road class, and that our particular mechanics revolve around gear.\n \n Enough of the ranting though. If you want PM me on the forums and I'll tell you my character name and server so you can make a toon and contact me with any questions.\n \n May be a few more days though as I'm still waiting for blizzard to unlock my account once they verify it is me.",
