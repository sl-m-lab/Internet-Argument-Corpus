   "Cooperate Welfare: Where do you stand?\n Do we need more corporate welfare, of should we expect them to support themselves?\n \n The USA today has many forms of corporate welfare enjoyed by Big Business.\n \n Some of the more obvious would include:\n Local and federal tax forgiveness for doing business as usual.\n \n Being provided an educated workforce that is primarily educated at the expense of the taxpayers.\n \n Social services benefits such as Food Stamps, Medical Assistance, Rental Assistance, Energy Assistance, Child Care subsidies, subsidize substandard wages so that BB gets cheap labor, all at the expense of the taxpayers. \n Additionally, the cash payout of these benefits go directly to businesses, large and small. Many supermarkets are in business primarily because of Food Stamps, most hospitals are in business primarily because of Medicaid and Medicare payments.\n Social Services benefits greatly increases the consumer base that all businesses are dependent on.\n Medicaid and Medicare allow many businesses to maintain a workforce without providing sufficient wages to purchase health insurance. \n \n BB is provided, by the taxpayers, many forms of transportation not only for mobility of their employees, but distribution of their products as well.\n \n Ther are other forms of corporate welfare.\n \n Because with unlimited wealth comes unlimited power, the citizens need protection from the mega corporations. There needs to be a court system so there is recourse against an unjust employer or manufacturer. The expense of this protection is left to the taxpayers.\n \n \n Citizens can survive with no corporations. \n Most corporations provide goods and services which improve the lifestyle and technological advances of the citizens. Corporations make life \"better\", but are certainly not indispensible to the citizens.\n \n On the other hand, corporations are totally dependent on the citizens, for both a workforce and as consumers.\n \n When considering whether the citizens owe much to the corporations, or the corporations owe more to the citizens, I would say it is quite clear that corporations owe their very life to the citizens, and will always be in debt to the citizens.\n \n They are a tool of society.\n They exist by the will of the people, and they should expect to be held accountable for their stewardship of natural and manmade resources, by their benefactors, the citizens.\n \n Others may disagree.",

   "Symbiote I'm even against the existence of corporations, which aren't a natural business entity developing from the free market, but an artifice constructed by legislation.\nYes, \"corporation\" is a legal term. You may have noticed I used the term \"Big Business\" interchangeably.\n \n \n The reason we can \"survive without corporations\" isn't because their goods are unecessary, but because businesses don't need to be corporations to create those goods.\nOh, but the goods are unnecessary, and this is one reason we can survive without them. We can discuss the Amish if you choose.\n Again you draw a distinction between Big Business and corporations. Certainly the are two different terms and different groups, so you are within your rights to make this distinction. I will change my comment to \"we can survive without big business\", and my meaning does not change.\n Businesses do not have to be corporations to create the goods, but we do not require the goods they produce regardless.\n Businesses do not have to be corporations to benefit from \"business service benefits\" (see next comment).\n \n \n Tax forgiveness/cuts/low rates isn't a form of \"welfare\", anymore than atheism is a form of religion.\nFrom my usage I used \"welfare\", and \"social services benefits\" interchangeable. Strictly speaking rent and energy are not \"welfare\", but rather \"social services benefits\". \n We are not in the habit of hearing the term \"business service benefits\", but I would agree with you that tax forgiveness is not (Corporate) Welfare any more than rent subsidizes are Welfare, but they are business services benefits.\n \n \n Corporate welfare doesn't in the long run favour business over consumers, anymore than private welfare favours consumers over businesses, its primary result is to favour some corporations over other businesses, businesses which may not even at present exist.\nCertainly true points. I suggested as much (I believe) when I pointed out that social service benefits ultimately go to businesses. \n \n Again, you are using corporation in the legal sense, which is certainly justifiable. It is just that I meant it in the broader sense \"a group of people acting as a single entity\".\n \n \n Wealth isn't inherently power, wealth only becomes power when there is power to be bought, and there is only power to be bought when the public accepts the police apparatus being used aggressively.\nWell, I would say power exists even in the absence of a police apparatus. Also that there is ALWAYS power to be bought, no exceptions. The public needs to accept nothing, for the power brokers to be at work.\n \n \nSo the solution of giving the police apparatus more power so that corporations can be kept under control is counterproductive. Inevitably wealth will take control of this new power and use it, perhaps to crush corporations, but only those corporations it competes with, to ensure itself some kind of monopoly or quasi-monopoly status, or at the least, favourable conditions\nDynamics. Checks and balances.\n I hardly think corporations need protection from consumers.\n Consumers (citizens) do need protection from big business (corporations or otherwise). It is this \"police apparatus\" which gives the protection. You may say it is counterproductive to expect the police apparatus to offer this protection, but you suggest no other source.\n \n ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n \n On this distinction between big business and corporations, corporations are the legal tool for the police apparatus to control big business. Corporations are a necessary evil to put some control on big business. \n Simply eliminating the legal standing of \"corporation\" does not eliminate the negative effects big business might cause to consumers. Monopolies will not be prevented by eliminating corporations. If anything, there would be more monopolies. It is the same with other ills big business might bring on the consumers. \n There is no area of law (police apparatus) that is not in need of improvement, and corporate law is no exception. This is not a reason to suggest no corporate law is needed.",

Not to mention the innumerable specific products millions of people rely on survive, medicines, pacemakers, air conditioning.\n \n 2) \"Big business\" is a meaningless term, and there is no categorical distinction between big bussiness, small business, and an individual contracting to perform some service or sell some good.

Wal-mart, as we all know, is an \"evil\" corporation. Wal-Mart is lobbying to raise the minimum wage.

I don't know what you mean when you say consumers need the government to \"protect\" them from monopolies, when a monopoly can only exist because of said \"protection\".\nYou use the term monopoly in a very specific sense, and is the fourth usage according to my Encarta. I use it in the more common usage of simply one company controlling an entire industry. In such cases there is no privilege given. There are anti-monopoly laws and these do offer some (incomplete) protection.\n \n \n \nIn sum, when you write, I believe you're acting as an unwitting tool for the various corporations who have their finger in the pie.

It is protecting consumers. Certainly not as much as you or I may chose, but it does provide protection nonetheless.\n \n \nIf you want protection from businesses like Wal-Mart, don't give them more power.\nGive them more power? What have I written that gives you the opinion that I would choose to do that?\n \n \n Legal changes like raising the minimum wage aren't checks and balances, they're the destruction of the checks and balances which would otherwise naturally exist.\nNow this is really interesting. It sure sounds to me like you are endorsing lassez-faire capitalism.\n I do believe there is something to be said for such economics in a closed system, however in a global economy, multinational corporations would certainly run rampant (more than they do now). For a company in Arkansas, the cost of labor is not the prevailing wage rate for Arkansas, or even the United States. When they consider the cost of labor, they look worldwide. When Mexican factory workers will work for $2 per day, businesses quickly go there rather than pay the $8 to $10 per hour Arkansas workers are used to.\n \n Supply and demand sounds good, until you are one semiskilled worker competing against millions of workers worldwide. \n \n Henry Ford paid his workers enough so that they could afford to buy one of the automobiles they were making. He knew his market would come from the common, local labor force. Today's CEOs do not have to worry if their employees can afford to buy the $10 toaster they are making, as long as there are consumer somewhere in the world that can. Build it here, sell it there. Sounds like a plan.\n \n So if I follow you correctly, I must conclude:\n You think my well being as a worker and consumer lies in trusting the corporations (or more accurately, the market forces which are directed by corporations). I shouldn't trust the government representatives to act in my best interest, not when walfart is in my corner. Let the corporations do whatever they want and we will experience economic bliss.\n Don 't impose cumbersome health and safety regulations, after all, workers are expendable, just another commodity.\n Let businesses on their own to clean up environmental messes they create.\n Consumer heaven would be allowing the petroleum companies to set their own prices, without government interference. No accountability for pricing, just trust them.\n Employee heaven would be elimination of minimum wage so the fast food industry could start hiring at $1 per hour.\n \n Now I know you would not agree with many of these hypotheticals, and yet they are logical outcomes of the position you have presented.\n \n You truly believe market forces will do a better job controling businesses for the best interest of citizens, compared to citizen represeentatives in the form of government?",

Or is McDonald's guilty of monopoly because it controls the happy meal industry? Are you guilty of monopoly because you are the sole purveyor of your personal services and talents?\n \n \nExcuse me?!?!?\n Where have I suggested special immunities for the actions of corporations?\n\n \n You have argued for the existence of corporations. A corporation is essentially a business whose owners are not liable for it, if it falls into debt, commits some crime, etc. So you are essentially saying that the owners of \"big business\" should have special legal privileges that protect them from the consequences of their actions.\n \n \nI have not stepped foot into a walfart for over 17 months.

He paid his workers as much as he did so he could attract the best employees away from his competitors, reduce absenteeism and staff turnover. To quote ford directly, \"The payment of five dollars a day for an eight-hour day was one of the finest cost-cutting moves we ever made\". Determing wages by some vague standard of whether your employees can afford your products is idiotic, should the workers manufacturering aircraft earn tens of millions of dollars a year?\n \n Wal-Mart is not in your corner. You are unwittingly in its' corner. What you propose serves the interests of the most powerful corporations of today exactly as they would like it. Dominant businesses love the extension of government power into the business world, because they know they cannot guarantee their competitiveness will last forever. Most businesses don't stay at the top for more than 10 years. Unless, the public lets politicians intervene and keep them there. To protect consumers of course.\n \n \n It's difficult to respond to all of your points, because you're essentially repeating every marxist / state-socialist myth you've ever heard, all crammed together into the one post. \"Corporations dictate market forces\", \"Without government intervention, monopolies occur\", \"Henry Ford raised wages so that his employees could purchase his cars\", \"globalisation harms regular people\", \"without the minimum wage, wages would drop to $1 an hour\", \"Without government intereference, petroleum prices would be obscenely high\", \"without health and safety regulations, employees would work in unsafe conditions\", \"the government acts in the interest of the people, it is not beholden to corporate interests\".\n \n There are dozens of things wrong with each of these statements, and I can write pages on each of them, but perhaps you could stick to a single topic with a logical argument instead of simply alluding to dozens of poor arguments?\n \n \nI hate to state the obvious...\n \n But isn't it clear that we need a combination of the two?

Until recently, a combination of strong sunshine and low humidity or an extension of peat marshes was necessary for winning salt from the sea, the most plentiful source. Changing sea levels periodically caused salt \"famines\" and communities were forced to depend upon those who controlled the scarce inland mines and salt springs, which were often in hostile areas (the Dead Sea, the Sahara desert) requiring well-organized security for transport, storage, and distribution.\"\n \n And this (from Econ 101 at Iowa State): Examples of monopolies include: \n o Local telephone service \n o Water service \n o Cable television \n o The U.S. Postal Service \n \n This: Even today, most important enduring monopolies or near monopolies in the United States rest upon government policies. The government's support is responsible for fixing agricultural prices above competitive levels, for the exclusive ownership of cable television operating systems in any market, for the limit of two cellular telephone services in each market, for the exclusive franchises of public utilities and radio and TV channels, for the single postal service-the list goes on and on. Monopolies that exist independent of government support are likely to be due to smallness of markets (the only druggist in town) or to rest upon temporary leadership in innovation (the Aluminum Company of America until World War II).\n \n This (from Ohio State): \n A monopoly is a firm who is the sole seller of its product, and where there are no close substitutes. An unregulated monopoly has market power and can influence prices.\n Examples: Microsoft and Windows, DeBeers\n and diamonds, your local natural gas company.\n \n ~ ~ ~ ~\n \n \n By your chosen use of the word monopoly, we can show no example. By the use of the word in universities, we can show examples.\n \n DeBeers is an example of a near monopoly having exactly the effects feared by some of us.

   "I am using the word shortage in its economic meaning.\n \n ===============\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortage\n \n Economic shortage is a term describing a disparity between the amount demanded for a product or service and the amount supplied in a market. Specifically, a shortage occurs when there is excess demand; therefore, it is the opposite of a surplus.\n \n Economic shortages are related to price-when the price of an item is \"too low,\" there will be a shortage. In most cases, a shortage will compel firms to increase the price of a product until it reaches market equilibrium. Sometimes, however, external forces cause more permanent shortages-in other words, there is something preventing prices from rising or otherwise keeping supply and demand unbalanced.\n \n In common use, the term \"shortage\" may refer to a situation where most people are unable to find a desired good at an affordable price. In the economic use of \"shortage\", however, the affordability of a good for the majority of people is not an issue: If people wish to have a certain good but cannot afford to pay the market price, their wish is not counted as part of demand.\n =====================\n \n How does it treat \"all consumers fairly\" to enforce prices so low that only the first ones to get to the sellers get to buy the products and everyone else can go shove it?\n \n \nIt is supposed to mean that it does not matter. Of course there is a limit. Of course at $1 Million per gallon milk or gas will not sell.\n\n \n Of course there is, but up until now you have denied that prices could affect the purchase of a product.\n \n Previously you have denied price changes can significantly alter the rate at which a product sells.\n So there is a price where gas won't sell at all, there's a price where it will all sell out, and presumably, in between, there is a price where gas will still sell, but it won't all sell out, or it will just sell out before new supplies arrive.\n \n \n \nI agree that it will sell out at 10 times but not 11 times.\n\n \n So you agree if prices had been increased to what the market would bear, the stations would not have run out of gas to sell.\n \n The specific figures don't matter, you don't know, and neither do I, that's a matter for profit-seeking gas station owners to determine what price to charge. If it looks like their supplies will run out, they can raise prices, if it looks like they won't clear enough, they can lower prices.\n \n \n \n So I hope the myth has been exposed that \"price gouging harms consumers\", in fact it protects them from arriving at gas stations with no gas left. Regardless of how \"fair\" you think that is.",

   "Force prices so low? No one is forcing them to be low.\n\n \n Well that's what you're advocating, having the government force prices to remain low even when market forces determine they should be higher, and consequently causing shortages.\n \n \nI see nothing in the wikipedia article that says shortage mean zero supply. If it is there, you will have to point it out. \n\n \n That's true, it's a shortage not only when there is no product left, but also when at the price there are more people wanting to buy then there is product available, so it will run out before all are served, but it doesn't necessarily have to have already sold out to be considered a shortage.\n \n If that's your position, I agree.\n \n \nYou have problem with first come, first served?

   "What both of you seem to be either missing or avoiding is that when you are talking about gas in the use, you are not talking an openly traded optional good. We have rail and mass transit systems that Bulgaria would be embaressed to claim. Urban sprawl over the last several decades has put us in a position that for the VAST majority of americans, gasoline is not an option it is a requirement.\n \n The concept of lifeboat economics is typically used to explain situations where there strict limits on the supply side of the curve. There is another component there, which is an assured demand for your goods. \n \n History shows us that in such situations, price controls CAN be effective, but ONLY if they are based on a reasonable pre-set profit margin. Several states have such price controls on their gas. For example, in a couple of states here in the US gasoline retailers are required to sell their gas at 9.5% over their cost. This has not led to shortages in any state that I am aware of.\n \n In the past we haev seen arbitrary prices set on certain goods as part of price control schemes. This opbviously is not going to work, since if production costs rise above those arbitrary prices nobody can afford to supply the goods in question.\n \n In the real world, in order to have any hope at all of controlling our gas prices, we would have to do some old school trust busting and it would take several years of wild market action before things settled down. The problem comes from the fact that our \"free oil market\" is a farce. The only places that actually have any use for crude oil are the refiners, and they are all owned by the oil producers. This takes any competition at all out of the equation and actually puts you in a position where the purchaser (the refiner) is better served by higher crude prices because they are owned by the oil company, and the refiners just pass the costs on to the consumers.\n \n This is why a working price control system (one based on profit margin) will not work. If you look at oil company profits from refining, they only run around 8% and have for a lot of years. Where they are making a killing is on the crude production side where their profits are currently running south of 350%. It does not matter to the refiners that the oil is running them $60-$60 per barrel. They jsut pass that on to the consumer. And since our crude prices are based wholly on a speculative single table market with NO COMPETITION at all, the only challenge for the oil companies is to find the highest price that the consumer will bear.\n \n Imagine, for jsut a second, that we do some old school trust busting. Go in and force the oil companies to sell off their refining and marketing (local stations) branches. Suddenly, in theory, you have a situation where refiners all work to provide the lowest cost product while the oil companies are forced to actually COMPETE with each other to provide their product at the most competitive cost possible. \n \n Now, if youa re completely clueless and actually \\believe that Saudi Arabia can throw out an extra 2 or 3 million barrels per day at will, or that biofuels will someday play a majority role in our needs in the US, this would be an ideal scenario. We break up the bastards and make them do business like everybody else. \n \n Unfortunatly, there is no way the saudis can crank out that extra oil and biofuels will nver play a major role in the US. That puts us in a true lifeboat scenartio where there are ACTUAL supply constraints and demand. That pretty much shoots that whole plan right in the butt. Back in the real world the supply/demand curve on oil is so tight that 500,000 barrels a day off the market makes a major difference. 1 million barrels per day off the market leads to a cross in the supply/demand curve and there simply is not enough to go around. To put it in perspective consider the fact that our reserve capacity is less than 2% of the market. That is enough to make any market go nuts. \n \n With that being the case, the only real solution to our oil price problems, and even it would be temporary would be nationalization of our oil supply with oil being sold for internal use (non export oil) sold at cost. This is the logic behind the wave of oil resource nationalization we have seen lately. \n \n When you hear about subsidized gasoline in oil producing nations, typically the subsidies are not \"real\" (the government is not actually paying anybody anything). Instead the subsidies are based on the fact that oil for internal use is sold at cost and refined by state run refineries and resold at cost. This is what Saddam did in Iraq which is why their gas was running 50 cents or less per gallon prior to the invasion. If your crude costs you $2 per barrel and you refine it at cost, you end up with cheap gas.\n \n This can lead to real problems for the US because when a nation nationalizes and their energy suddenly becomes dirt cheap, usage DOES pick up in that country, leaving less oil for export, which hurts countries like the US that rely heavily on oil imports. For example, since Chavez started \"subsidizing\" (by selling oil for internal use at production cost) venezuelan energy, usage has gone up 10-14%. That means less oil available to export to the US and other oil poor nations. It has also resulted in accelerated development in venezuela.",

Specifically, if employers in a certain region required workers to work 16 hour days for wages that buy a pound of hamburger/day, would we allow that since in our world, the market will correct itself.\n \n \n BHN: I believe you said something about corporations shielding owners/CEOs from financial liability. Does this disappear with the demise of corporations? I would think that the enormously wealthy will always remain immune from financial responsibility (from a class action suit, for example). The wealthy are virtually always able to protect their resources. There is always a way, and they have the money to find the way. How would we really make them any more financially responsible than they are with corporations?\n How far would you want our laissez-faire capitalism to extend? \n \n BHN: (a reply is needed for the last question, in bold) BHN: Your claim that everyone has a choice is false. This money you think they choose to keep does not exist.\n It is a figment of your overactive imagination.\n The Waitress and the Hummer can only spend so much money on goods. \n When the money runs out, the choosing stops. This is true for both of them.\n It is simple math to see that the Hummer can make choices long after the Waitress.\n To say that when she is not able to buy gas when the money runs out is her choice, is ridicules. She has no choice. There is nothing to choose because there is no money. Why is that so hard for you to see?\n \n Please respond to: BHN: You want 90% of us to eat potatoes while the top 10% eat steak. Because they have the money to alter market forces, that's fine with you.\n \n ~ ~ ~ ~\n New business: \n \n symbiote: Previously you have denied price changes can significantly alter the rate at which a product sells.\n BHN Did not.\n\n Symbiote replies by quoting BHN, but make no comment of his own:\n BHN: \"If there is an emergency, and the available supply of new milk is reduced to zero, price controls will have no effect on the supply of milk. Charge a dime a gallon, or $10 a gallon, stores will be sold out regardless.\"\n This is a true statement. \n It says nothing about the rate of selling, simply that stores will be sold out.\n I later say that possibly the milk will last an hour longer, so what. This is not a significant change.\n \n I also later say that of course if milk is $1 mil per gallon it will never sell out. Any reasonable person would recognize that somewhere between $10 and $1M, the rate slows down. I have quite clearly indicated that a price change can significantly alter the rate at which a produce sells. That should be obvious. If you don't see it, I will try to explain it better.\n ~ ~ ~\n \n BHN: \"Makes it last longer? When you have people standing in line to buy something, from vendor open to vendor close, it doesn't last any longer just because it is more expensive. \"\n Another true statement.\n When people are standing in line to buy something, and continue to do this until the product is gone or the store closes, it is being sold as fast as it can. It cannot last any longer. The rate of sales is constant. With modest (such as government imposed) price controls (increases), the rate will remain the same. As previously noted, with extreme gouging ($1M per gallon), sales will stop, which is certainly a change in the rate.\n ~ ~ ~\n \n BHN: \"Price is not directly related to sales, especially in times of potential or real gouging. \"\n The full quote: [i]\"Price is not directly related to sales, especially in times of potential or real gouging. (There are of course many other reasons why price is not directly related to sales.) When there is the threat of a storm, bread and milk are sold out long before the store closes. So if the price were greatly increased (gouging), the milk would last another hour. I fail to see this as significant.\n \n Naturally under normal circumstances, if an item is \"overpriced\", it will not sell as fast as the same item priced normally. It will \"last longer\". If you want to keep a lot of Ford Mustangs in the showroom, price them at $100,000.00 and your wish will be granted. Gouging occurs in times of need. If everyone looking for a new car perceived they needed]/i] a Ford Mustang, they'll sell like hotcakes at $100,000.00.\n It is perceived need that determines how many will be sold. Price is secondary. Just ask any marketing director.\"\n \n Did you read \"if an item is \"overpriced\", it will not sell as fast as the same item priced normally.\"\n Clearly this statement of mine contradicts your assertion that I \"denied price changes can significantly alter the rate at which a product sells\".\n \n Within the context of my paragraph I explain what I mean. My opening statement could have been stated better. Perhaps: \"Price is not the determining factor related to sales.\" I explain that it is perceived need that is the ultimate determination. If the perceived need is great enough, people who lack the money will steal it to be able to purchase. By the way, this is another argument against (extreme) gouging. Desperate people do desperate things. Especially when they think they are being gouged.\n \n Or I could have said: \"Price is not necessarily directly related to sales...\"\n Within context my meaning is consistent with my other comments which quite clearly show I recognize that extreme prices can alter sales rates.\n Any variable can affect the rate of sales of some items. Item color, flavor or grade; time of the year; price or a different but related product. Any variable can affect sales, as any reasonable person will know. I am no exception.\n \n ~ ~ ~ \n \n BHN: \"So if the price were greatly increased (gouging), the milk would last another hour. I fail to see this as significant. \"\n Another true statement. If people are standing in line to buy something, and it is sold out before the close of business, what does it matter if it lasted another hour.\n ~ ~ ~ \n \n BHN: \"It is perceived need that determines how many will be sold. Price is secondary\"\n You question this statement but claim to understand market forces.\n Amazing. \n I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you had a momentary lapse of sanity.\n If this is not the case, please try to explain to me how this is not a true statement.\n If you fail to respond, I will not put it under old business, I'll just assume I was correct about the lapse of sanity.\n ~ ~ ~\n \n \n BHN: \"You now say that if anti-gouging measure are enforced in a time when gouging might occur, this will create a shortage. Hogwash!\"\n I gave explanation and you made no reply.\n The shortage existed before the gouging. You have the cart before the horse.\n ~ ~ ~ \n \n BHN: \"The vendor is going to sell out regardless, fair prices or ten times fair prices, all will be sold.\"\n Yes, another true statement. In time of shortages of necessities consumers will pay ten times fair (read \"normal\") prices and the vendors will sell out.",

   "I don't see that claim as substantive, because economic decisions are made on the margin, not in holistic terms.\n \n For example, a consumer may consider a price \"secondary\" when choosing between a $5 product and an $8 product, but price becomes \"primary\" when choosing between a $1 product and a $1 million product.\n \n Whether a given factor is \"primary\" or \"secondary\" depends on the particular size of that factor, it is never universally true.\n \n I took that claim to mean the universal, ie price is always secondary, a claim which is demonstrably untrue when considering extreme price levels, if you meant only that price is sometimes, usually, or often secondary, then that is an empirical matter that can only be resolved historically with regards to specific products at specific prices at specific times, it isn't a universal truth regarding purchasing decisions in general.\n \n There was a similar confusion historically with regards to the pricing of gold and water, that the classical economists were unable to solve. They believed goods had inherent value, that gold was inherently more valuable than water. To take the version of classical economic theory that Marx seized upon, gold is more valuable than water because more labour goes into producing gold than water. But this did not explain why, in a desert, or to a dehydrated man more generally, the price of water may well be higher than that of gold. This conflict is resolved by the recognition of value as subjective rather than fixed. Replace \"gold\" with \"dollars\" and we can see that X amount of $$$ may be trivial in some circumstances to some people, and important in other circumstances to other people, the same with Y quantity of a particular good.\n \n The refutation of the labour theory of value is perhaps important to the refutation of part of clasical economic theory, and part of Marxist economic theory, but it isn't a central controversy in modern economic discussions, the subjectivity of value is broadly accepted.\n \n \nBTW, I am in favor of a free market, just not as free as your propose.\n\n \n So was I, perhaps two or three years ago, but the more I read the more I became convinced that the reasons I had previously held for supporting particular interventions were unjustified, particularly when I came across the austrian school of economics and read 20th century economics books like Human Action; Man, Economy and State, Omnipotent Government: The Total State and Total War, The Road to Serfdom, Economics in One Lesson, Hoppe's more recent contributions and classical liberal texts by the likes of Alexis de Tocqueville, Frederic Bastiat, the reasons I had held for my previous viewpoints seemed poorly informed to me.\n \n I certainly don't think that you're an idiot, or that you desire people to be poor and are masking it behind some kind of false ideology, I accept that your intentions are quite noble, I just don't think many people have been exposed to rigorous reasoning in economics, that I came across it was quite by accident.\n \n I consider myself now a market anarchist, I believe every service the state provides could be provided better by the free market, including the service of defence, this view I myself would have considered absurd a few years ago, I would have thought \"But whoever controls the military will become a de facto government, and likely an extremely horrible and oppressive government\", and yet here we are. I'm surprised myself at the extremity of my own views, but I cannot think of logical objections to them.\n \n I read dozens of books arguing for alternate viewpoints, the objections you put forward I have considered time and time again and usually at one time are views I have held myself.\n \n If anything I would ask you to read Hazlitt's \"Economics in one Lesson\" concerning a broad array of specific economic fallacies and Rothbard's \"Man, Economy and State\" or Mises' \"Human Action\" concerning a complete exposition of economic theory. These are, at least I found, eminently readable books that outlay a near complete exposition of economic theory and set solid foundations for the consideration of any question of economics.

When considering a purchase many factors come into play, certainly. Grade school children know this.\n \n When a purchase is refused, it is because considering all of those relevant factors, the need is not great enough. Perceived need is the deciding factor in every case. Change any of the variables and relative to the perceived need, the purchase may occur (I need a blue one more than I need a yellow one, so I will pay more).\n \n Before every purchase the consumer must decide how great their need is, considering price, color, condition, and any number of factors.\n There is no need for empirical or historical considerations from us to know that ultimately, perceived need will decide what factors are relevant or overriding.\n \n I had a relative who was a very vain woman. She needed a fur coat very badly. Her husband cashed in a whole life insurance policy, and borrowed a little money, to buy it for her. A very unsound financial transaction, which was based on perceived need. The price of that coat (relative to household income, resources, and the price of coats appropriate for her income level) was very high, and most of us would say the need was not very great, however perceived need tipped the scales. Just an interesting anecdote, certainly not typically representative of consumers, or it would not be interesting.\n \n Available resources can be a limiting factor for what perceived needs can be filled.\n \n The waitress may have a great need, and may be willing to pay $25 for a gallon of gas, but if she does not have the money (or credit), she will not purchase. If she is able to borrow the money, she will (her need is that great). She is willing, but unable. If the need is great enough, she may be willing to commit immoral acts to get the money. I'm sure you would agree this is quite common during times of rationing or a situation ripe for price gouging.\n \n The Hummer may have very little need for gas, but knowing it is in short supply, and having $1000 in his pocket, decides to fill up. \n \n Available resources decided the selling rate, not price. \n But perhaps you want me to know that these are extreme cases, and not typical. \n I say that does not matter.\n \n Let us say the need is exactly the same for both. Now money becomes a limiting factor.\n When consumers stop at a petrol station, typically they want to fill up the tank if they have enough money, and if there is enough gas. Those who stop for gas, know they have a need for more gas, and will fill up, if their budget allows it (and even rich folks have budgets). In times when gouging might be lucrative, this would be especially true. When you wait in line to buy expendables, you tend to buy enough to reduce your time in future lines (resources permitting). If you realize the next time there may be no product, you will probably even bring containers to fill.\n It seems to me to be expected that consumers will want to buy as much gas \"as they are able\", the limiting factors being price and space.\n If you disagree, please say so and explain.\n \n If anti gouging measures are enforced, the wealthy will be able to buy containers, get in line, and when it is their turn (if there is still petrol), fill up to the max.\n The \"unwealthy\", will mostly be able to wait in line, many with containers, and when it is their turn (if there is still petrol), fill up (some to the max, some not). \n If I am leading us astray from reality, please explain.\n \n If gouging is permitted, and I take it you would not only permit, but encourage as well, the scenario has got to be different.\n \n Here is my version.\n If the gouging is modest, the wealthy will still fill up to the max. The \"unwealthy\" will get less overall, in declining amounts, by that limiting factor wealth, or money. The poor for the most part will not bother to get in line. They will be looking for food.\n As the gouging increases, the wealthy continue to fill to the max, and more and more at the lower income levels will not bother to get in line. \n By the time a certain amount of potential consumers have decided their need is not great enough to pay the inflated prices, the wealthy will start getting less than the max, again, because their need is not great enough. They will have the resources to buy more, but refuse to do so. \n You see this as primarily a decision based on price, but I say perceived need comes first, price secondary.\n \n If the station owner has the fire power to protect his investment and product, he would be a wise Anarcho-capitalist, or simply a greedy capitalist allowed to act out, if he held back, and waited until the other stations were sold out before he opened for business. That is when the real premium prices will be in effect. \n We can easily imagine that in a sympathetic state (remember, the state has been encouraging him to take advantage of the free market, and gouge as well as able with the help of the invisible hand), he can get the military to help guard. \n If that is out of the question, certainly we can suppose that he will be vindicated for using his own weaponry against the unruly, disgruntled, consumers who think he cannot choose when to sell his petrol, and for his what price. That takes no imagination at all.\n \n I say it is unlikely the wealthy will need to resort to immoral acts to get the petrol they need at the station. \n By that time the stations will be sold out and only black market gas will available. \n \n I would appreciate your scenario, of both anti-gouging Katrina-ish, and free market, gouging encouraged (or unrestricted).\n \n ~ ~ ~ ~\n \n Do you identify yourself with the Anarcho-capitalist position? That is to say, is there any difference between a market anarchist and a anarcho-capitalist.\n \n It is probably no surprise to you that I agree with philosopher Noam Chomsky who says, \"Anarcho-capitalism, in my opinion, is a doctrinal system which, if ever implemented, would lead to forms of tyranny and oppression that have few counterparts in human history.\"",

   "My point is that the history of capitalism is that if left unregulated then those who cut corners will make a quick buck and move on, or simply no-one notices for a long time. This is the history of Britain in the 19th Century, and I suspect the US was as bad. Low price on apparently the same product wins out for most people most of the time. This is why a washing machine bought today will cost GBP169.99 and last about 3 years and will have to be thrown away because it can't be repaired, and most people will buy that rather than one that will last 20 years but cost GBP500. Most people don't have the facilities to check the quality of the products they are being sold.\n \n Yes companies reflect those woh run them, but my point is that companies allow people to operate without restraint. They can engage in corporate practises that they would never dream of engaging in in their private lives. Examples include the Nestle baby milk scandal and the problems with Coca Cola in India to name a couple of the most high profile. In both these instances there were hundreds of employees of these companies who went ahead and took actions in the certain knowledge that those actions would result in serious harm or death to hundreds if not hundreds of thousands of people (estimates for Nestle put the death toll in the 500 000 region). Yet people don't question what they are doing because they assume that if they are being told to do it then it must be ok, much like soldiers. The drive to make money subverts every good human impulse, and because of the corporate structure those at the top have to be ruthless because their legal responsibility is to make money for shareholders, and those at the bottom have to do the dirty work for fear of their livelihoods. Nobody in the system at any point makes a decision that they will do this evil thing with an obvious direct profit to them and this, like an army, is what makes it so dangerous. By decoupling profit and action, you allow a decoupling of the natural revulsion of harming others for your own profit.\n \n Now, I'm sorry if that's not too coherent but a lot of things clicked into place as I was writing so I hope I've conveyed that.",

I'd rather put up with longer waiting times based on clinical priorities than queue jumping based on ability to pay.

There is no calculation of worth in a capitalist system, particularly when there is no alternative employment, companies will pay as little as they can get away with.

Under President Eisenhower (R), the marginal tax rate on those folks was 70%. A return to those days would be desirable.\n\n \n Who determines what is a \"fair share\" in taxes? If the country gave them the opportunity to get rich, wouldn't that mean that every citizen in the country has equal opportunity? Why should those who are able to take that opportunity and create wealth pay more than those who can't or won't?

November 4 will show that the party is over as the buccaneers get placed on VERY short leashes.\n \n The present mess cannot be blamed on a party which has not controlled the Congress for 12 of the past 16 years; neither could it have caused the economy to get to the brink of Depression in the short period it has been in power.\n\n \n \n Christ, the loan debacle was caused by regs. aimed at getting poor people into homes.

   "\n \n No, you silly thing you, deregulation worked well for the Pubbies, except, of course, when it didn't.\n\n \n I gotta disagree with this. The problem wasn't deregulation. It was the use of mortgages as social policy. The GOP pushed two main initiatives during 2002 and 2004 which essentially made Fannie and Freddie into tools of the Republican party. The initiatives sought primarily to eliminate or reduce the down payment, something Bush railed against as a primary barrier to American home ownership. While there was a whole slew of foundational problems leading up to this, from the repeal of the GSE to amending the CRA, the primarily attacks on the down payment by the GOP and the low interest rates are key problems. Frankly, by the time Hagel tried to fix things, it was way too late.",
