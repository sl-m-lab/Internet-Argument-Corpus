However, that tolerance has never been extended to the millions of Democrats who hold the pro-life position on abortion.\"\n \n \"Intolerant liberals must reject the widely held prejudice of pro-life voters as narrow-minded, gun-loving, sex-obsessed anti-intellectuals.\"\n \n Editorial can be read here:\n http://www.cnn.com/2005/ALLPOLITICS/01/31/intolerant.democrats/index.html\n \n This is an editorial by a well-known Democrat who is liberal on most issues, but happens to be pro-life. The article caught my attention because if it weren't for the fact that the Democratic party takes such a stance against pro-lifers, I might very well be a Democrat today.",

Whatever view I take, whatever legal status I favor meets with somebody's disapproval, even outrage. I cannot escape the fact that abortion kills the unborn. This is most certainly an imposition. So does it come down to a choice between imposing on the unborn and imposing on pregnant women? No matter which side I take, the other side could easily say \"who are you to impose your will on the pregnant?\" or \"who are you to impose death on the unborn?\". It is not a simple choice between freedom and force. It is a choice between two opposing types of force, each with it's own unique targets. Am I the only one on both sides of the issue that appreciates this?",
