That is a cultural issue. The early church established the traditions as they evangelized pagans. It was an attempt to bring pagans into the church. Actually, Maximus would have more historical info than that.\n \n 2) as for doing what the bible says, there is one context that must be absolutely considered when considering what the bible says. That is that it is not \"lifes instruction book.\" It is, instead, the revelation of God. It is a communication from God to man about God's nature. This considered then the verses you quote are a consideration that concerns, not behavior, but rather pagan god worship. That was what jeremiah propohesied against for the most part. The jews of the time were worshipping other gods in the very temple of God. It was and is their heart that God is concerned with, not really their behavior, although behavior essentially comes from the heart.\n \n Today, Christmas celebrations maintain the same traditions but they have lost that meaning (to most christians) that was of pagan gods. Most christians believe that Christmas is a celebration of the birth of the Savior of all mankind. God enjoys that Christians celebrate him. The methods are really unimportant. \"God does not see as man sees. Man looks on the outward appearance but God sees the heart.\" I think that is in 1st Samuel, when God is choosing David to be King of Israel.",

   "I cannot address the Christmas tree specifically but this is what I know about Christmas and paganism:\n \n The Christian celebration of Christmas does not go against Jeremiah 10. It is true that many Christians opposed (and some still do) the celebration of Christmas and of birthdays in general. They favored celebrating one's baptism or death (the birth into eternal life). The adopted day to celebrate this was on the pagan holiday of the Sun God but pagan practices were never followed. The day was not picked to embrace pagans for their paganism but to draw them out of their paganism to the true Sun, the light of the world, as John says. And Christianity prevailed for Christmas is still celebrated but you rarely hear of any of the pagan holidays. Christmas grew out of a sincere and pious desire to celebrate the nativity of the Lord. Christians merely celebrate the events described IN SCRIPTURE in the Gospel of Luke. These are not trivial events and they are worthy of commemoration.\n \n I agree with Epaphras that much of the Christmas celebration is cultural. I also found the following article by doing a simple web search on the origin of the Christmas tree. Since I could not specifically address the tree, this article does (and it does in relation to Jeremiah 10):\n \n http://users.rcn.com/tlclcms/jer10.html",

Not everyone agreed it was good. The 'goodness' of it might have been given a veneer of respectability, but deep down people knew it was wrong.\n \n Romans 2 says that God will judge those, who do not know of 'the law' by the law in their own hearts, because at our core, we know murder is wrong... it is univrsally condemned... but still it goes on. (a paradox).\n \n Christians believe that their (or our - as I'm one) beliefs are the closest to that core of human nature... that 'universal' goodness.\n \n We must act accordingly.\n \n I either believe God is the God of all, or I don't. I believe in the former, and must act accordingly. I can't say \"I believe God is the God of all, the creator of all, but...\" There are no buts.\n \n How we 'meddle' though, is a point for debate.\n \n Some Christians enter a country as a missionary, and just live there. People are drawn to them by their exemplary behaviour.\n \n Others are more active (which I'm not saying is good). They've entered a nation, torn down the idols and said \"This is what's going to happen from now on...\"",
