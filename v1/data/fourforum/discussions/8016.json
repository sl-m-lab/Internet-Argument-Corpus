   "Pentagon admits sending openly gay soldiers to war \n they're kicked out when (if) they make it home\n by Susan Jordan \n \n SANTA BARBARA, CA, September 23, 2005 - An official military spokesperson has acknowledged that the Pentagon is sending openly gay service members into combat in Iraq.\n \n Kim Waldron, of the U.S. Army Forces Command at Fort McPherson, said that, \"The bottom line is some people are using sexual orientation to avoid deployment. So in this case, with the Reserve and Guard forces, if a soldier 'tells,' they still have to go to war and the homosexual issue is postponed until they return to the U.S. and the unit is demobilized.\" Waldron's statements were reported in today's edition of the Washington Blade.\n \n Waldron's comments follow the discovery of a controversial regulation halting the discharge of gay soldiers in units that are about to be mobilized. That regulation, contained in a 1999 \"Reserve Component Unit Commander's Handbook\" and still in effect, states that if a discharge for homosexual conduct is requested \"prior to the unit's receipt of alert notification, discharge isn't authorized. Member will enter AD [active duty] with the unit.\" The 1999 document was obtained by researchers at the Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military (CSSMM), a think tank at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n \n Although the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy remains in effect, Waldron's acknowledgment appears to confirm that in some cases, the Pentagon ignores the law by retaining service members who say that they are gay. Statistics confirm that during the present war, as has been the case in every war since World War II, gay discharges have fallen during the conflict and then increased during peacetime. However, prior to Waldron's acknowledgment, official spokespersons often denied that the military intentionally sends gays to fight despite the existence of a gay ban.\n \n According to Aaron Belkin, Director of the CSSMM, \"The military has claimed for years that allowing openly gay and lesbian service members to serve in uniform would undermine unit cohesion. During wartime, however, when cohesion is most important, the Pentagon retains gays and lesbians.\"\n \n The Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military is an official research unit of the University of California, Santa Barbara. The Center is governed by a distinguished board of advisors including the Honorable Lawrence J. Korb of the Center for American Progress, Honorable Coit Blacker of Stanford University and Professor Janet Halley of Harvard Law School. Its mission is to promote the study of gays, lesbians, and other sexual minorities in the armed forces.

   "I should have put this on earlier, regarding the situation...\n The government's OWN RESEARCH supports the fact that gays should be included in the military, and that including them is not disruptive to \"morale\", as the opponents of gays in the military claim...\n \n ========================================================\n WASHINGTON (AP) -- A $1.3 million study on homosexuals in the\n military, commissioned by the Pentagon last spring, supported President\n Clinton's view that acknowledged gays should be allowed to serve. But\n its conclusion was rejected.\n \n The 407-page study by Rand Corp. was made public Thursday. Its\n central theme -- that lifting the ban on gays could be made to work\n without hurting the nation's defenses -- had been leaked weeks ago, but\n the Pentagon had refused to discuss it.\n \n Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the report is how neatly its\n conclusions fit Clinton's view that sexual orientation should not be\n germane to the question of who is fit to serve in the military. And yet\n Clinton's gay policy was based on a separate study by senior officers\n who oppose letting gays in the military.\n http://qrd.org/qrd/usa/military/1993/rand.study.publicly.released-8.26.93\n ========================================================\n \n And it should be noted that the \"morale\" excuse was one of the excuses used to try and justify black exclusion from military service...",
