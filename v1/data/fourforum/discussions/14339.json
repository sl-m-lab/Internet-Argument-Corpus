   "As an anti-theist and collector of apocalyptic fiction (hobby), I saw both sides of the coin.\n \n The story of 'Eli' was one of the power of faith and it's (supposed) triumph over evil.\n \n Oldman wanted to use the power of the bible to control and sway the masses.\n Yet, through the mystical power of god, he was denied.\n A blind messenger repeatedly defeated Oldmans forces up until the end when, in an act to life the message of the bible, he turns the book over to the enemy to do as he pleased. But, the enemy was foiled as the book was writen in brail...and the only person who had any chance of reading it for him was the woman he mistreated. A woman who left him to die in a fevor brought about by his wounds suffered from his own diabolical manipulations.\n In the end, Oldman's reign of evil was brought down by his own hand.\n \n The blind messenger continued with his trek and delivered the word to the place he was instructed to do so...by faith.\n \n What I disliked was the ending...after ALL of that trouble, the people at the prison merely copied the book...and placed it on a shelf alongside other holy works.\n IF this was a story about faith and the power of religion to do good...it would have been in the hands of a reader reciting its passages to a congregation as they communally sought to rebuild the shattered world.\n A book on the shelf...useless.\n But, I guess that's the role the girl will take as she treks back out into the wilderness.\n \n \n As for the Road. The book was far more terrifying. And, I think they omitted a key line. After the black traveler stole their belongings at the beach, the father was walking off with his clothing after recovering their belongings and took revenge on the thief. At that point, the boy pleaded to show mercy to the thief and commented; 'If we're the good guys, how come we never do anything good?'\n\n \n emoticon_xgood \n Question: Why do you say Eli was blind?...just because he could read a braille book?\n \n I agree, they should have left that line in The Road.",
