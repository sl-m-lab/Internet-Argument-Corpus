   "Anyone see a trend here? Perhaps the masses are wrong? Gasp! Banning same-sex marriage is WRONG!\n \n \n \nThe Iowa Supreme Court unamimously struck down the state's gay marriage ban Friday, ruling that it violates the constitutional rights of gay and lesbian couples.\n \n In 2005, Lambda Legal, a New York-based gay rights organization, sued on behalf of six gay and lesbian Iowa couples in Polk County who were denied marriage licenses. Some of their children are also listed as plaintiffs.\n \n The case was appealed to the state Supreme Court in 2007, after Polk County District Court Judge Robert Hanson agreed with the plaintiffs and ruled that the ban was unconstitutional.\n \n Hanson's ruling prompted nearly two dozen people to apply for marriage licenses in the county, Iowa's most populous and home to Des Moines. Only one couple, Sean and Tim McQuillan of Ames, managed to get married before Hanson stayed his decision the next day. \n \n During oral arguments before the state Supreme Court in December, Des Moines lawyer Dennis Johnson argued that the ban violated his clients' due process and equal protection rights.\n \n \"We are suggesting that everybody be able to participate equally in an institution that has existed since the beginning of this state,\" Johnson said during arguments.\n \n Roger Kuhle, an assistant Polk County attorney, argued that the lower court's ruling for the plaintiffs violates the separation of powers and that the issue should be left to the Legislature.\n \n \"We are not here opposing the individual plaintiffs' sincerity. We are here because, in our view, the issue is one for the Legislature to decide as a matter of social policy,\" he told the seven-member court.\n \n During oral arguments, Chief Justice Marsha Ternus explained that the high court would determine whether the district court erred by finding that the same-sex marriage ban violated the state constitution, and whether it erred by not allowing the county's expert witness testimony.\n \n The timing of the ruling's release could be awkward for state lawmakers, who are on track to end the legislative session in coming weeks.\n \n Before the ruling, Senate Majority Leader Mike Gronstal told reporters that it's \"exceedingly unlikely\" that the Legislature would deal with the gay marriage issue this year, regardless of the court's ruling.\n \n \"This is the final step in a lengthy legal proceedings,\" the Democrat said. \"We're going to wait and see that decision and review it before we take any action.\"\n \n Around the nation, only Massachusetts and Connecticut permit same-sex marriage. California, which briefly allowed gay marriage before a voter initiative in November repealed it, allows domestic partnerships.\n \n New Jersey and New Hampshire also offer civil unions, which provide many of the same rights that come with marriage. New York recognizes same-sex marriages performed elsewhere, and legislators there and in New Jersey are weighing whether to offer marriage. A bill that would legalize same-sex marriage in Vermont is before the state House.\n \n Iowa High Court Strikes Down Gay Marriage Ban : NPR\n \n",

   "From the ruling:\n \n It is quite understandable that religiously motivated opposition to same-sex civil marriage shapes the basis for legal opposition to same-sex marriage, even if only indirectly. Religious objections to same-sex marriage are supported by thousands of years of tradition and biblical interpretation. The belief that the \"sanctity of marriage\" would be undermined by the inclusion of gay and lesbian couples bears a striking conceptual resemblance to the expressed secular rationale for maintaining the tradition of marriage as a union between dual-gender couples, but better identifies the source of the opposition. Whether expressly or impliedly, much of society rejects same-sex marriage due to sincere, deeply ingrained- even fundamental-religious belief.\n \n Yet, such views are not the only religious views of marriage. As demonstrated by amicus groups, other equally sincere groups and people in Iowa and around the nation have strong religious views that yield the opposite conclusion.31\n \n This contrast of opinions in our society largely explains the absence of any religion-based rationale to test the constitutionality of Iowa's same-sex marriage ban. Our constitution does not permit any branch of government to resolve these types of religious debates and entrusts to courts the task of ensuring government avoids them. See Iowa Const. art. I, \u00a7 3 (\"The general assembly shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . . . .\"). The statute at issue in this case does not prescribe a definition of marriage for religious institutions. Instead, the statute declares, \"Marriage is a civil contract\" and then regulates that civil contract. Iowa Code \u00a7 595A.1. Thus, in pursuing our task in this case, we proceed as civil judges, far removed from the theological debate of religious clerics, and focus only on the concept of civil marriage and the state licensing system that identifies a limited class of persons entitled to secular rights and benefits associated with civil marriage.\n _____\n 31\n Many religions recognize same-sex marriage, such as Buddhists, Quakers, Unitarians, and Reform and Reconstructionist Jews. Schuman, 96 Geo. L.J. at 2108. Amicus curiae Iowa and National Faith Leaders, Communities, and Scholars point out the United Church of Christ encourages, but does not require, its local congregations to adopt wedding policies that do not discriminate between heterosexual, gay, and lesbian couples, while the Episcopal Church permits priests to perform liturgies and blessings at same-sex weddings as a matter of pastoral care. Additionally, many groups and clergy within various religions are working to achieve inclusion of same-sex marriage. Id. at 2108-09. \n\n \n Wise words!",

It is a tough question to answer because treating everyone fairly is really a matter of Iowa common sense and Iowa common decency.\n \n \"Today, the Iowa Supreme Court has reaffirmed those Iowa values by ruling that gay and lesbian Iowans have all the same rights and responsibilities of citizenship as any other Iowan.\n \n \"Iowa has always been a leader in the area of civil rights.\n \n \"In 1839, the Iowa Supreme Court rejected slavery in a decision that found that a slave named Ralph became free when he stepped on Iowa soil, 26 years before the end of the Civil War decided the issue.\n \n \"In 1868, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that racially segregated \"separate but equal\" schools had no place in Iowa, 85 years before the U.S. Supreme Court reached the same decision.\n \n \"In 1873, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled against racial discrimination in public accommodations, 91 years before the U.S. Supreme Court reached the same decision.\n \n \"In 1869, Iowa became the first state in the union to admit women to the practice of law.\n \n \"In the case of recognizing loving relationships between two adults, the Iowa Supreme Court is once again taking a leadership position on civil rights.\n \n \"Today, we congratulate the thousands of Iowans who now can express their love for each other and have it recognized by our laws.\"\n \n Pretty amazing statement from Iowa House & Senate leaders | Gay News Blog | 365gay.com",

   " I am a gay Christian woman, live in Northern CA, and am VERY happily MARRIED to my wife as of June of 2008. It is NOT a sin to be GLBT...\n\n \n The Word of God says otherwise. \n \n Romans 1:25-27 - They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator-who is forever praised... \n \n Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. \n \n You've rewritten Biblical Christianity. 2 Timothy 4:3-4 (New International Version) - For the time will come when they will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.",

   "Hopefully, the other states of the union will soon follow suit. I am a conservative, and I don't understand how people who consider themselves to be conservative can also be against gay marriage. That's a pretty big limit on personal freedom, don't ya think? I guess that's why I'm agnostic.\n \n If you look at this as a civil issue, there's really no contest; gay marriage should certainly be legal. If you look at it as a religious issue, there's still no contest; we are guaranteed freedom FROM religion in this country. You can think gay marriage is a sin as much as you want, but you don't have the right to make other people live by your beliefs.\n\n \n I have always wondered why conservatives think that marriage of any kind is a threat to marriage.\n \n Marriage in itself is a conservative institution.

He healed a Roman centurion's servant which history points out that most were homosexuals and would take their lovers with them wherever they were deployed. And Jesus healed him.\n \n Point being is that I am Gay, I am Christian and Jesus loves me for who I am. You know it's funny to point out that 1/3 of teen suicides is either a Gay or Lesbian teen who has undergone such horrible abandonment from their church, their family, friends, peers and such that they despair of all life and die!\n \n Do you wish this on them? Your method of \"preaching\" is twisted! You point to a holiness code for the priests of Israel! You forget further into Leviticus about selling your daughter into slavery for a good price. All you do is take from column A and insert into column B to make your claim against gays with the Bible.\n \n Your \"message\" or proof if you can even call it that is the same ignorant blind thinking that is subjugated and placed upon the minds of families that go into right churches and gobble it up. So then when their gay or lesbian son or daughter comes out breaking free of their chains and binds, and trying to finally be free and be who they are and whom God loves and embraces, your so called mind set is what drives those families away from them and shuns them like lepers.\n \n How many more have to die? How many more have to shoot themselves after being teased at school for over a years in Ohio? How many more have to step into Mel Whites church shaking and crying saying I cant make the \"feelings\" go away. Only to find to the clergy's shock and horror that that person has mutilated their genitals. \n \n How many more need to be found dead on the streets of New York, San Fransisco, and LA. Who have died from starvation, sickness, and such because they come from the Midwest or the bible belt trying to start a new life where they think it's a haven for gays. \n \n How many more have to be infected with HIV from heroin use and from unprotected sex to try to make some money and whoring themselves because they were shunned by their family. Is this the message to the church from christ? Shun those and do not love them. Only love them in your own confused misguided way of thinking? No! You must love all peoples.\n \n This is why the church is so fragmented and so far off base. Next time you post negativity about gays and lesbians just think about who may be reading your words. \n \n Think about the boy sitting at home in his bathroom crying and slitting his wrists because he thinks hes \"sick\". Think about a young man like myself who put a pellet gun into my mouth quite often with tears streaming down my face begging god to make me normal. Begging and pleading to make me strait. \n \n I know the pain and despair these people go through because I have gone through it myself. So before you post your bigoted and misguided views, think of whom you hurt.... But of course that does not matter because your a perfect \"religious\" christian and can do no wrong and look down upon others only to make yourself look better in the eyes of your god...",
