   "The CDC has updated it's information this last September, and the finding don't look good for homosexual relationships. * A recent CDC study found that in 2008 one in five (19%) MSM in 21 major US cities were infected with HIV, and nearly half (44%) were unaware of their infection. In this study, 28% of black MSM were HIV-infected, compared to 18% of Hispanic/Latino MSM and 16% of white MSM. Other racial/ethnic groups of MSM also have high numbers of HIV infections, including American Indian/Alaska Native MSM (20%) and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander MSM (18%).\n * In 2007, MSM were 44 to 86 times as likely to be diagnosed with HIV compared with other men, and 40 to 77 times as likely as women.\n * From 2005&#8211;2008, estimated diagnoses of HIV infection increased approximately 17% among MSM. This increase was likely due to a combination of factors: increases in new infections, increased testing, and diagnosis earlier in the course of infection; it may also have been due to uncertainty in statistical models.\n * In 2008, an estimated 17,940 MSM were diagnosed with AIDS in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the US dependent areas&#8212;an increase of 6% since 2005.\n * By the end of 2007, an estimated 282,542 MSM with an AIDS diagnosis had died in the United States and 5 dependent areas.\n \n The high prevalence of HIV infection among MSM means they face a greater risk of being exposed to infection with each sexual encounter&#8212;especially as they get older\n\n http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/msm/\n \n The fact sheet (PDF) can be found here.",

   "The question becomes, at what point do you bite the bullet and start admitting that a given behavior is high risk?\n\n \n Jyoshu any behavior has risk. Straight sex is just as risky as gay sex and in some regards even more dangerous by being able to bring a unwanted child into the world. \n \n \n \n \n It's not like gay men can't use protection just like anyone else, but they don't nearly as much. \n\n \n Or rather those who do not take responsibility for their own actions.\n \n \n Or, the protection just doesn't work as well. \n No the protection works well. it is a choice or rather lack thereof that leads to risky behavior in both gays and straights.\n \n \n It has to be one or the other. Either a.) there's something more risky about MSM or they are just flat out refusing to use protection to a large degree. Neither bodes well.\n\n \n I rather think the latter. Myself I personally always use protection just for good habits and personal responsibility. Growing up in the Bush era of Abstinence ignorance, I took it upon myself to self educate and realize early on the risks of any sexual behavior and the steps needed to be taken to safeguard myself and those whom I engage relations with.\n \n \nI would add that there are those here who would jump to point a finger at a large group (religion) more readily over LESS quantifiable evidence of harm than what we see here. It just so happens that the issue of MSM has political correctness to hide behind.\n\n \n Yet Jyoshu this is a double edged sword. Look at the Catholic church and their stand upon Condoms or Contraceptives. The ignorance and the blatant endorsement of lacking in responsibility in sexual actions no matter what shows the potentially damning effects religion can have on blinding people to the true risks.\n \n Education is what is needed. Enlightenment. Telling Johnny and Susy to not do it won't guarantee anything, and guilting them into submission will only increase the odds they will rebel.\n \n What we can do however is educate young people to make good choices. And if they do decide to engage in sex, will be well prepared to take the necessary steps of being responsible with their own bodies.",

   "THANK YOU!\n That's is exactly the point that jyoshu seems to be missing. We don't moralize about cigarette smokers.\n \n There is nothing wrong with walking, breathing or having sex.\n Generally speaking.\n Walking across 6 lanes of an expressway is risky however.\n Breathing in the smoke of 2 packs of cigs per day puts you at a much higher risk of many diseases.\n Having sex with someone infected with an STD, puts you at risk for contracting that STD. Men who have sex with a whole lot of men very frequently greatly increase their risk of getting infected with HIV. It's in the numbers. Not rocket science.\n \n AND this says nothing about homosexual relationships at all. Or homosexuality for that matter.\n \n I asked jyoshu what the point of his opening post was and he declined to respond, preferring to bicker away as he does.\n \n Many people are getting sick and dying unnecessarily. We know how this happens. It is not at all helpful (nor does it require any brains at all) to declare that \"they should know better and should just stop\", as joshy seems to suggest.\n \n I can't fathom what he was trying to say by posting these statistics. And he still can't understand why others think he is prejudiced. Then, maybe he wanted to point out that risky sexual behavior is risky.\n\n \n I don't see anyone posting the Aids Statistics from Africa, where the numbers are at least ten times of those here in the states, and guess what, most of the Aids victims in Africa are Women and Children. The Pope told them not to practice safe sex, Hows that for religion?...\n \n Trying to tie Aids to Homosexuals is like trying to say pigs can fly.. People with brains know it's not true and no CDC report can convince anyone it's a Gay Disease. Like Has been said, Safe sex is Safe sex, Taking Risks doesn't just apply to Homosexuals.",

Until then, I don't see why they would want to argue 'harm' as a standard. \n \n One argument often made in response to this point is that in other countries, the incidence of HIV is higher among heterosexuals than gays. But there are clear outside factors at work there that would skew those stats, such as a less robust reporting system and in many countries less likelihood of anyone reporting gay activity at ALL (such as African countries where the incidence of HIV cases would probably be almost always reported as heterosexual even if, in actuality, it was homosexual). \n \n The other argument often made to this is that MSM only applies to, well, men. IOW, lesbians don't have the HIV stats issue, for obvious reasons. That is a good point, and one could argue that the same STD harm factor does not seem to apply in the same significance when it comes to lesbianism. Of course my view is that harm should be the only factor for determining morality, but since the gay movement argues harm as the main factor, the issue of MSM stats presents major problems to their view.\n \n \ni say \"anti-gayers\" because i suck in terms of making up words for things, and i know homophobic doesnt apply to everyone who's against homosexuality, and people dont like that word. by \"anti-gayers\" i mean the opposition to \"pro-gayers\".\n\n \n Well the problem with a term like 'anti-gayer' is that it implies automatically being against gay people when that's often not the case.

   "Again, I don't think the subject of 'outlawing' and that of 'objection' are the same thing here. No one is here calling for anyone to outlaw gay sex or pomiscuity. I have yet to hear anyone here even admit promiscuity is a bad thing!\n \n you guys act as there is not a single example of sexual behavior society frowns upon. Do you also think no one should ever take a stand on adultery and come out to say it's a bad thing???\n\n \n Adultery/cheating is a completely different thing. It is dishonesty and the breaking of a commitment. \n \n Sexual behavior that is immoral and unacceptable would be cheating, rape, and sex with any person (or animal) that isn't capable of giving consent (children, etc...

You can use the same reasoning for drinking/smoking/driving/owning a firearm, etc. (Actually I do think it's unreasonable that a person can be old enough to be drafted into the military, but not old enough to drink a beer).
