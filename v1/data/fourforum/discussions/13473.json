   "Oh, the pond scum that was once America, but reduced to pond scum by George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and other Republicans:\n \nMan Joins Army to Help Ailing Wife\n Tuesday, October 20, 2009\n filed under: moms are talking about\n AOL: Two of the nation's most pressing issues -- unemployment and health care -- have come together in a personal perfect storm for one Wisconsin family.\n \n Bill Caudle of Watertown was laid off in March from the plastics company where he'd worked for 20 years. Unable to find another job, Caudle -- on his 39th birthday -- enlisted in the U.S. Army to get the health insurance his wife needs to continue her battle against ovarian cancer. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel told the family's story Sunday.\n \n Bill Caudle was laid off from his job in March. Unable to find a new one, the 39-year-old Wisconsin man decided to join the Army. He has signed up for a four-year hitch. He told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel he doesn't want to be away from his family, but he needs health insurance so his wife can continue her battle with cancer.\n \n Michelle Caudle, 40, discovered she had cancer in 2006 and underwent surgery, followed by two rounds of chemotherapy. In May, her doctor told her there were signs the cancer was back and she would need to endure more chemo.\n \n The $136 monthly cost of insurance for the family rose to $497 when Bill's severance package ran out last month and was due to jump to $1,370 in January. Michelle worked part-time at a restaurant to help pay the bills, but the job did not provide insurance.\n\n \n Read more: Man Joins Army to Help Ailing Wife | momlogic.com\n \n Shame! Shame! On You! America!\n \n And the people who voted in the America-wreckers, the Republicans!",
