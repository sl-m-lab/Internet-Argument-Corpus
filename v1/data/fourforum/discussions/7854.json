   "I think making abortions illegal would reduce abortions in the states/ countries in which they were illegal.\n\n \n This well may be true. I don't happen to agree (prohibition, without reducing the demand, of anything is rarely successful), but suffice it to say some abortions, now illegal, would continue. Illegal abortions have the potential to be less safe, so preventing them would still be important, perhaps moreso. You would not want to endanger the mother as well.\n \n \n \n I don't know if sex education helps with unwanted pregnancies. Probably depends on the program.\n\n \n It actually does, but even so, contraception and abstinence clearly do. So back to the original queston of this thread: What steps do you think should be undertaken to prevent unwanted pregnancies? Depending upon the program, you say. Would you be in favor of a program that has demonstrated success in pregnancy prevention?\n \n \n \nThen why so many unwanted pregnancies?\n\n You tell me. You said, \"As for trying to prevent unwanted pregnancy....that it beyond anyones scope at this point\" Are you saying this is an unsolvable problem?\n \n My gist is this. Rather than spouting platitudes, I am trying to be pragmatic and constructive and come from a point both sides can agree on.\n \n Those who think abortion should be illegal, must think they are a bad idea and would want them not to happen.\n \n Those who think abortion should be legal think they are necessary sometimes, but still would like them not to be.\n \n If they are legal or illegal they are still going to occur. Making them illegal doesn't make abortions anymore desirable, so one still would rather they not have to occur.\n \n So both sides want fewer or no abortions, irrespective of the legality. I submit that the one way to do that is to prevent unwanted pregnancies. So I really want to hear something from the antiabortionists about what they think about the idea of prevention of unwanted pregnancies, the root cause of abortion. Doesn't it make sense to prevent the cause of a problem?",

If you want to pluck out some irrevelant point rather than addressing the issue, I refuse to go along with your less than intellectually honest games. \n \n I should not be surprised. The prolifers are big in rhetoric and moralizing but short on trying to solve real-life problems. These problems are complex, nuanced and highly dependent upon underlying context. That's how life is - really tricky.
