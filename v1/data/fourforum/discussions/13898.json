   "Seeing as how my personal beliefs are always coming under fire due to my sexuality, I felt inclined to elate on them.\n \n For one, I believe in Christ. I believe in His saving Grace from His sacrifice on the cross. I believe He died and rose again on the third day after, and that through simple faith we are all saved by Him.\n \n My personal account is well my own. I feel that in my teenage years I was seeking faith for all the wrong reasons. I was in the literal term a zealot. I would always carry around a bible at school, lecture others especially non believers, and refused to stop or heed any other form of opinion beside my own....\n \n Yet deep down I was lacking. I hated, and loathed myself because I would often have feelings of attraction toward other members of the same sex. Ever since 13 I felt miserable, and that I was some sort of sick twisted person.\n \n I soon became suicidal, attempted once, and spun in a vicious cycle. I was praying to God to make me \"normal\" make me right, and to cure me of my \"disease\". I often would have tears streaming down my face attempting to reconcile with a God I felt distant, and with a being I felt could never possibly love me.\n \n God's hand was on me one day when I had the barrel of a gun in my mouth... I had become so desperate at the age of 17 and hated everything about myself due to my sexuality that I literally wanted to end it that day....\n \n It was but for the saving grace of God that I didn't pull the trigger. Now years later with many emotional scars, and some physical that many of you know why I have come to a point of peace in my life through faith.\n \n \n I now realize I was seeking God for the wrong reasons, and that he loved me just the way I am. I am by no means a theologian. I cannot pin point exact scripture to counter peoples challenges to my belief, nor would I try. I find it futile.\n \n I find that faith is only relevant to you and your heart. Believe what you wish I can't change that. Only your own heart can make such a decision. A small one in courage, but a huge one perhaps for the better.\n \n \n This is my simple testament to faith in Jesus Christ. No I am not perfect. No I am not an expert. I just believe by simple pure ignorant faith. If any have reason to continue to belittle my beliefs and my feelings, and my heart then find something else better to do with your time.\n \n \n Don't try to tear away my beliefs just because you are unsure of yours. And don't try to score punches when you cry that your very beliefs are being attacked when you snipe others.\n \n That's all I have to say. I expect very soon for some very nasty responses but I've become used to it. After all I'm not really a Christian to some. Just some homosexual deviant who has nothing but his sexuality on his mind even though I have not had sex in months.....\n \n But just continue to snipe and slander. And for any of you considering maybe seeking a personal relationship with Jesus. It's not fake. I don't get a response back except when I least expect it. And it's for the better. If your so inclined go for it. Because Jesus does not discriminate. And Jesus loves you without condition.\n \n And unlike people, Jesus won't forsake you. That's all.",

I am by no means a theologian. I cannot pin point exact scripture to counter peoples challenges to my belief, nor would I try. I find it futile.\n\n \n I believe also that God intervened to prevent you from suicide, and only because of how much he loves you. But you shouldn't take that intervention as a pass to continue on in sin which He clearly condemns in His word. Here's a chapter which you should take to heart, just as I do since it speaks to believers who think they can continue on in sin without answering to the Holy One in the end.\n 2Pe 2:1 But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves.\n 2Pe 2:2 Many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of the truth will be maligned;\n 2Pe 2:3 and in {their} greed they will exploit you with false words; their judgment from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.\n 2Pe 2:4 For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, reserved for judgment;\n 2Pe 2:5 and did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven others, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;\n 2Pe 2:6 and {if} He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing {them} to ashes, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly {lives} thereafter;\n 2Pe 2:7 and {if} He rescued righteous Lot, oppressed by the sensual conduct of unprincipled men\n 2Pe 2:8 (for by what he saw and heard {that} righteous man, while living among them, felt {his} righteous soul tormented day after day by {their} lawless deeds),\n 2Pe 2:9 {then} the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment,\n 2Pe 2:10 and especially those who indulge the flesh in {its} corrupt desires and despise authority. Daring, self-willed, they do not tremble when they revile angelic majesties,\n 2Pe 2:11 whereas angels who are greater in might and power do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord.\n 2Pe 2:12 But these, like unreasoning animals, born as creatures of instinct to be captured and killed, reviling where they have no knowledge, will in the destruction of those creatures also be destroyed,\n 2Pe 2:13 suffering wrong as the wages of doing wrong. They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are stains and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions, as they carouse with you,\n 2Pe 2:14 having eyes full of adultery that never cease from sin, enticing unstable souls, having a heart trained in greed, accursed children;\n 2Pe 2:15 forsaking the right way, they have gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam, the {son} of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;\n 2Pe 2:16 but he received a rebuke for his own transgression, {for} a mute donkey, speaking with a voice of a man, restrained the madness of the prophet.\n 2Pe 2:17 These are springs without water and mists driven by a storm, for whom the black darkness has been reserved.\n 2Pe 2:18 For speaking out arrogant {words} of vanity they entice by fleshly desires, by sensuality, those who barely escape from the ones who live in error,\n 2Pe 2:19 promising them freedom while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by what a man is overcome, by this he is enslaved.\n 2Pe 2:20 For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and are overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.\n 2Pe 2:21 For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn away from the holy commandment handed on to them.\n 2Pe 2:22 It has happened to them according to the true proverb, \"A DOG RETURNS TO ITS OWN VOMIT,\" and, \"A sow, after washing, {returns} to wallowing in the mire.\"\n \nI find that faith is only relevant to you and your heart. Believe what you wish I can't change that. Only your own heart can make such a decision. A small one in courage, but a huge one perhaps for the better.\n\n \n I agree with this also.\n \n \nThis is my simple testament to faith in Jesus Christ. No I am not perfect. No I am not an expert. I just believe by simple pure ignorant faith. If any have reason to continue to belittle my beliefs and my feelings, and my heart then find something else better to do with your time.\n \n Don't try to tear away my beliefs just because you are unsure of yours. And don't try to score punches when you cry that your very beliefs are being attacked when you snipe others.\n \n That's all I have to say. I expect very soon for some very nasty responses but I've become used to it. After all I'm not really a Christian to some.

If your so inclined go for it. Because Jesus does not discriminate. And Jesus loves you without condition.\n \n And unlike people, Jesus won't forsake you. That's all.\n\n \n I have no desire to tear you down or to condemn you or your faith in Christ. All I and the other believers here have ever done is try to get you to realize that to continue to sin is to continue to crucify Christ, fulfilling 2Pe 2:19 which says, promising them freedom while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by what a man is overcome, by this he is enslaved. And this passage also which speaks directly to our dilemma as believers. And believe me Jason, I apply these truths to my own walk as well in judging whether or not I am walking sincerely and honestly in Gods will for my life. Not in regards to homosexuality, but in other sins of the flesh which pertain specifically to my weaknesses as a human being and which can separate me from His love if I continue to use my liberty in Christ as a license to sin against Him. \n Rom 6:16 Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone {as} slaves for obedience, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin resulting in death, or of obedience resulting in righteousness?\n Rom 6:17 But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were committed,\n Rom 6:18 and having been freed from sin, you became slaves of righteousness.\n Rom 6:19 I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, resulting in {further} lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness, resulting in sanctification.\n Rom 6:20 For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.\n Rom 6:21 Therefore what benefit were you then deriving from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the outcome of those things is death.\n Rom 6:22 But now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you derive your benefit, resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal life.\n So stop defending homosexuality as if God condones it when you know that His word condemns it. You make yourself His enemy Jason, it isn't me who is making you His enemy because I have no power to do that at all since I am no different than you as one child who is struggling with my own salvation and spiritual walk as the bible says to.\n Phl 2:12 So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling;",
