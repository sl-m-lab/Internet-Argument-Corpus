   "It is 2008, for Pete's sake.\n Why do we even have discussions on whether homosexual behavior is OK or not?\n Of course, it is OK.\n Anyone with a brain should know that. \n It is OK because it is consensual behavior between two adults that harms no one. More than that, it is expression of a desire that it innate and natural to all human beings. It is absurd that anyone even has any feelings about it at all, let alone wants to make rules about it. \n \n The only* reason anyone cares is based on some archaic mores derived from some Old Book. This book says (in no more than a few words, a miniscule proportion) that behaving that way will displease a deity. It says a lot of other crazy things that are rightly and conveniently ignored. \n \n (*make that only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only...)\n \n This is 2008.\n We understand human sexuality, psychology, physiology and sociology. Believing that homosexual behavior displeases some deity is exactly the same as believing that a person with seizures is possessed by a demon. It is equally absurd. We know better. We know that bad weather isn't because Zeus is displeased. We know that we don't get cancer because somebody sinned. C'mon, seriously!! We have altered all sorts of ideas that we once held true because the book said so, and seem to have no problem. You know, stoning adulterers, exorcising the epileptic mentioned earlier, that sort of stuff. We continue to hold on to only those ideas that hurt the other guy, the ones not in the club.\n \n It is even more absurd in this behavior has been sanctioned as perfectly hunky-dory by many societies over time and distance. \n \n Now if you want to have a club and say it is not OK to eat bacon or wear skimpy clothes or have boys kissing boys, that is your business. If you want to believe the deity you created to head the club actually cares about this, go for it. Make that your club rules. Have a secret handshake. Wear a funny hat.\n \n But why this should have any relevance to those who don't want to be in your club is mystifying to me. Why you folks in your club might even suggest, let alone hope to enforce that your perverse rules should place any constraints on someone who doesn't want to be in your club, seems utterly irrational. Mostly, why don't you just shut up and keep those goofy ideas within the confines of your clubhouse and stop bothering others?\n \n We who live in 2008 don't believe these things any more because we know better.",

The problem is that people are not, by nature, rational. We can act rationally when we want to, but our default mode is to act out of habit or instinct or whatever our subconscious is tossing up at the moment. A few decades of facts isn't going to make centuries of conditioning simply disappear. The fact that so much progress has been made in just my life time is astounding, and it's partly due to just these sorts of discussions. The sort where people act like bigots or try to protect bigotry and get called on it. Every time a homophobe gets told \"hey, that's not ok\" the conditioning gets a little weaker, it breaks down the idea that relegating gays to second class status or worse is acceptable. Of course, there are those who try to reinforce the conditioning, but they generally try to do so using fear or lies, and these tactics can be exposed for what they are. The fact that gay rights supporters have morality and justice on their side doesn't give them a win right out of the gate, but it makes me confidant that they will get the win eventually.",

Today, the most common perception is that present-day Christianity is \"anti-homosexual.\" Overall, 91% of young non-Christians and 80% of young churchgoers say this phrase describes Christianity. As the research probed this perception, non-Christians and Christians explained that beyond their recognition that Christians oppose homosexuality, they believe that Christians show excessive contempt and unloving attitudes towards gays and lesbians. One of the most frequent criticisms of young Christians was that they believe the church has made homosexuality a \"bigger sin\" than anything else. Moreover, they claim that the church has not helped them apply the biblical teaching on homosexuality to their friendships with gays and lesbians.\n But while people like Jyoshu cannot comprehend what Thelmoose is getting at, the youth do.\n And I can't help but think in the long run it will only damage the church.\n But of course, they'll just blame it on those %@#$-ing gays... emoticon_ic",

The religious-belief issue of whether or not homosexual relations are ok doesn't necessarily have anything to do with that. In cases where people would say something like what you're claiming they say, then of course, I'd agree with you. No one should say one person is \"inferior\" to another.

This is still in our public discourse despite what is known about it and I am amazed.\n\n \n IMO that's because the issue isn't really settled--moralistically speaking.

But this isn't always like discussing black people or something along those lines--the controversy often has to do with religious beliefs over given romance/sexual behaviors--not BEING gay, as in, a state of being. (In cases where it DOES involve the innateness issue and therefore says gays are inferior, then I agree with you of course, and I suspect many people would. I don't think anyone would say the innateness of being gay is addressed in scripture at all. But some of our society will NEVER be completely past it--just like there are elements of our society still using horse and buggy to get around. That's their choice.",

   "In all fairness thought, K, this whole thread is about the 'shock' of even needing to discuss something. I mean, I've seen the Gay rights threads and it is patently obvious that there are at least two well defined sides to the debate.\n Well, one side is well-defined perhaps. The other side seems to avoid answering specific questions a lot and relies heavily on fallacy (argument from tradition, strawman, proving a negative, etc.), diversion, and the 2000-year-old interpreted instructions of a supernatural uber-being written in often untranslatable ancient languages... which doesn't exactly bode well for having a rational debate, whatever the topic.\n \n The original point, though, is valid. I've been debating these issues, in some cases with the same opponents, since Matt Shepard's murder, and have watched the anti-gay opposition dwindle in both numbers and ferocity. Old-timers will remember the deluge of troglodytes that used to descend on the old CNN and NYT gay rights fora whenever some pro-gay piece of legislation passed, and the extreme sockpuppet antics of paid Southern Baptist shills who would attempt to dominate all discussion in the hope of driving us all away and closing down the boards forever. (The boards closed, but not because of them.)\n \n Now they're reduced to a few shadows of their former selves, who bend over backwards not to be called \"homophobes\" (at least one poster on the old forums used to revel in the label) and who seem to be most afraid that if gay rights become a non-issue they won't have anything to do with their days. They even try to disguise themselves as being pro-gay so as not to be publicly castigated by what has become an overwhelming majority--comprised of gays and straights alike--and have to defend an increasingly socially unacceptable view with their hoary, outdated tactics, which may have found purchase once upon a time, but don't any more.\n \n The point for me is not that it's ridiculous that we're still arguing these arguments, but that we EVER had to argue them. You would think that in the modern world, scientific truth and rationality would have at last put the kaibosh on arguments of people whose core philosophy is based on the wording \"thou shalt not\" (and whose selective following of which they themselves would rather you didn't mention). I can understand people being unenlightened enough to exalt Bronze Age myth over scientific reality in the time in which the Bible was written, or the Middle Ages, or even up to the early 20th century.

His spend on domestic policies is way up. Some of the spending has been needed to stave off recession, but he could have done much better at cutting spending...\n \n But the real truth is that national defense is far from being responsible for all of the spending increases. According to the new numbers, defense spending will have risen by about 34 percent since Bush came into office. But, at the same time, non-defense discretionary spending will have skyrocketed by almost 28 percent. Government agencies that Republicans were calling to be abolished less than 10 years ago, such as education and labor, have enjoyed jaw-dropping spending increases under Bush of 70 percent and 65 percent respectively. \n\n \n http://www.cato.org/dailys/07-31-03.html\n \n \n \n Also, much of the credit for the balanced budget durring Clinton must go to the Pubs who were able to torpedo many of Clinton's policies (not the least of which would be Hillary's healthcare).",

We should NEVER start ANY war on that ideal.\n That's just pure arrogance.\n \n \n \nThe Dems fell all over themselves to get in there just like the Pubs- that is not deniable.\n\n Many of them did.\n As one explained it (exemplifying a weak Dem back-bone), there was a recognition of the pro-President support after 9/11.\n If you look at the polls over time, Bush got a HUGE surge in popularity out of 9/11. (Just a fact)\n \n The explanation I heard was that the Dems had to jump on the band-wagon, cause if it was a Republican success it would blow up HUGE in the democrats face.\n Did I mention this explanation exemplified a weak back-bone?\n \n The Dems did agree \"to get in there\", but let's not forget that the DRIVING force was on the \"Pubs\" side.\n \n But back to the point, The PUBS driving this issue and the Dems along for the ride is not an intelligent example of \"acting more like Dems\".\n \n \n \nThe last president was riding the dotcom boom, didn't have 9/11, didn't have a war, and we WERE going into a recession as he was leaving office. Bush has done a great job of keeping the economy going for almost 7 years.\n\n 1) The \"dotcom boom\" BUSTED under Clinton.\n 2) 9/11 had a temporary effect. Invoking it now is unreasonable.\n 3) War is an issue that INCREASES the economic drive. More money gets pumped into the economy via the weapons sector. That's a way that Bush has been able to pump up the economy, but it's a \"pump up the economy\" that consists of buying products on credit. He has driven up our deficit to unheard of levels, sacrificing the soldier's lives while realizing that if AMERICANS were ask to \"sacrifice\" for this \"war\", they would quickly come to bite him.\n So he rings up the credit cards, and our kids have to foot the bill.\n And now we're entering ANOTHER recessions \"as he is leaving office\"...\n \n \n \nHe SPENDS like a liberal and TAXES like a conservative. His spend on domestic policies is way up. Some of the spending has been needed to stave off recession, but he could have done much better at cutting spending...\n\n I would disagree that his \"spending\" had any purpose of \"staving off recession\", with the exception of the recent antics with the IRS checks in the mail.\n He \"spends\" for the most part to fund his war.\n \n If you actually look at the \"deficit\" over the years, Bush is spending LIKE A REPUBLICAN.\n http://www.cedarcomm.com/~stevelm1/usdebt.png\n What do you see there?\n Deficit spending increases sharply under Reagan, increases MORE under Bush Sr, Clinton actually levels it off, and then Bush Jr resumes spending like crazy.\n The whole idea of your spending that isn't matched in government revenue has REPUBLICAN precedent, with Bush Sr and Reagan.\n \n If anything, liberals are about FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY, whereas Repubs are about cutting taxes because it's popular, but ignoring the fact that you're racking up MASSIVE amounts of debt for our kids.\n And oh yeah. WHO is holding that debt?\n The list includes COMMUNIST countries like CHINA!\n \n Assigning this to \"liberals\" is missing the boat...\n \n [indent]But the real truth is that national defense is far from being responsible for all of the spending increases. According to the new numbers, defense spending will have risen by about 34 percent since Bush came into office. But, at the same time, non-defense discretionary spending will have skyrocketed by almost 28 percent. Government agencies that Republicans were calling to be abolished less than 10 years ago, such as education and labor, have enjoyed jaw-dropping spending increases under Bush of 70 percent and 65 percent respectively. \n \n http://www.cato.org/dailys/07-31-03.html\n Such a simplistic analysis is glossing over a LOT.\n Suppose I spend $2,000 per month on hookers.\n I then up that to $2,500, a 25% increase.\n \n Suppose I also spend $10 on donating to the poor.\n During the same time-period, I increase to $12.50, also a 25% increase.\n \n Would it make sense to casually state that I increased BOTH my hooker alottment and my poor donation alottment at the same time?\n No.\n \n The military budget (past and present) makes up well over half of our federal budget.\n http://www.warresisters.org/piechart.htm\n It would be really interesting to ELIMINATE the military increase, and compare the impact upon the deficit to eliminating the \"non-defense discretionary spending\" and monitoring the impact.\n \n And for the record, \"non-defense DISCRETIONARY spending\"?\n Funny how I don't see that label on the pie chart.\n Is that because the author made up a term, allowing him to include and exclude what was convenient to create the \"percentage increase\" statistic?\n \n How much of that is made up because of the Social Security payouts because of the POPULATION SHIFT, which has NOTHING to do with Bush deciding to increase spending to \"non-defense\" spending...\n \n \n \nAlso, much of the credit for the balanced budget durring Clinton must go to the Pubs who were able to torpedo many of Clinton's policies (not the least of which would be Hillary's healthcare).\n\n Now that claim is just plain hilarious.\n Hillary's healthcare plan had significant DEMOCRAT opposition as well, but of course in THIS case it's convenient to give sole credit to the Pubs, isn't it.\n \n Over-spending, creating a deficit, thoroughly consistent with REPUBLICAN action, but of course let's give blame to the Dems.\n Hillary's healthcare plan had significant democrat opposition as well, but of course credit for blocking that goes to the Repubs.\n \n I wonder if we should give Repubs credit for blocking spending on military head trauma research, or will THAT depend upon whether or not we want to give the Repubs credit, or the Dems blame for the action...",

   "First of all, I personally wasn't 'using it as a tool against Dems'. You all know I disagree with many of the Dem. policies/philosophies, but in that case I was disagreeing with Pub spending! Period! What was I trying to do get you to vote Republican? LOL.\n \n \n Again, Bush has been a big disappointment inasmuch as many of his spending policies. Conservatives want smaller govt. That is a conservative philosophy and that's what I consider my self first and foremost. The Pubs have not lived up to my conservative beliefs in the last few years.\n \n As far as the war is concerned, we went in because our intelligence (which Clinton decimated during his presidency) said he was trying to manufacture WMDs. Most people, both citizens and politicians, both Dem and Pub wanted to go in there. \n Now that we are there, what would you have us do? \n I understand why the Dems have shirked responsibility for their votes and made this 'Bush's war' but why haven't they cut off funding? \n Why haven't they (the dems) brought the boys home? \n Should we leave today and leave Iraq to fend for itself?",
