   "I voted for Ronald Reagan twice but was bothered about how he railed against abortion until he took office. I do not recall him mentioning it after that. I grew disgusted and sat out in 1988. I am a baby boomer and naturally went with Bill Clinton and Al Gore. I stayed with the Democrats out of disgust for the Republicans. I voted for Al Gore and John Kerry. But I have seen the light. George W. Bush has been a GIANT since 9/11. He took the fight to the desert. Fanatic Muslims have been attracted there as if by a magnet. America has not experienced a second terrorist attack. Saddam Hussein was captured and is on trial. The hunt for Bin Laden will continue until he is caught. Bush has appointed two justices to the Supreme Court who will overturn Roe v. Wade. They are John Roberts and Sam Alito. 46 million babies have been aborted since 1973 in an American Holocaust. It staggers the imagination. Bush has now turned to the problem of illegal immigration. He wants a guest worker program. Bill Frist, Senate majority leader, favors tough legislation. I think Frist is right. Immigrants recently marched in New York and waved flags from their countries of origin. I have never been big on flags, but there is only one flag to be flown in the United States, and it is red, white and blue. If these immigrants want other flags, let them go back where they came from.",

This isn't a 'honorable' fight where you meet up on the field and square off. This is a fight where you utilize your strengths. War is about winning, whether bleeding the enemy dry or killing him with one blow. The US perpetually floats the message that the shock and awe strategy would scare it's enemies away which is a ridiculous notion. The enemy is amorphous and does everything in it's power to bring the fight to it's own terms. As in lacking a conventional army worthy of challenging the US juggernaut it levels the ground as much as possible through controlling the type of engagement and it's cost. Currently the US stands on the top of a beehive and pays through the nose at a time where it should restructure it's whole economy to survive into the changing times. What does the opposition care about the collateral damage? Diddley squat. The crushing majority of the ME and muslims considers the terrorists loons just like we westerners do. What they do resent is the constant meddling. So meanwhile the US loses through slow hemoragghing finacially and is cemented as a bully and pariah politically, the fanatics is winning and by far.",

Even after being elected it still took Kissinger and public clamor to get him to ignore special interests who were coining money and like a profitable war. I think the capital hill gang will take the country to financial ruin before anyone admits they messed up, and we'll probably end up with few civil liberties and a police state before that transpires. \n \n Too many countries are already dumping USD as a sole reserve, which means they know something the general public doesn't suspect, especially with Russia, who has oil reserves now calculated right behind those of Saudi Arabia, already accepting petroeuros.

   "The only reason that France and Germany tried to ban UN actions in Iraq is because their pocketbooks would have suffered as a result. SH bribed France and Germany to prevent te UN from taking military actions to force SH into compliance with UN Resolutions. There was no \"moral\" reason for their actions, just self-serving illegal greed. :xcensored \n\n \n If that was true, why did Germany and France both offer to back us, including footing part of the bill, if we could produce credible evidence of WMDs or ties to Al queda. Both of those coutries were unwilling to go to war becuase they thought we were WRONG. This could not have been more clear. Every time either country released statements regarding their decision they said \"we don't think that Iraq is in violation\". THEY WERE RIGHT WE WERE WRONG.\n \n \n \nRight. If we had lifted sanctions, SH would have reconstituted his WMD programs (as he said he would) using boatloads of newly acquired Western money. No thanks. It's bad enough that we waited 10 years longer than we should have to take the genocidal maniac out, waiting until he had an arsenal of WMDs would have been pennywise and pound foolish.\n\n \n Excpet that after the sanctions were lifte the UN plan called for 10-15 years of monitoring to ensure that he did not reconstitute his programs...and the fact that they would have take 10-15 years to reconsitute IF they had existed. icne we now know that the last time they existed was prior to the FIRST gulf war, it would probably have taken him even longer.

   "JP, you often use the word moral when discussing economics and politics. Historically, I'm unaware of any type of morality ever influencing economics or politics other than in the form of red herring rationalizations to spin a citizenry. What gives with moral when discussing war in Iraq? Do you honestly believe any country or business is stupid enough to mix that emotion into pragmatic decisions?\n\n \n There are no morals involved here. France and Russia both have massive investments in Iraq and have expended substantial capital there. After gulf I we imposed sanctions pending weapons inspections. Iraq was first declared WMD free 8 months later, and has been declared WMD free 4 times since then. WE (the US) were so certain that they still had weapons that we kept expanding inspections. Then we started planting CIA agents on the inspection teams at such a rate that there were no longer weapons inspections going on, just a bunch of spying. \n \n So, both countries have billion dollar + investments rotting away in the desert in Iraq while the US screws around and tries to prove that we were right when we were clearly wrong. They would have been stupid not to try to get SOME return from those investments.",

Every time either country released statements regarding their decision they said \"we don't think that Iraq is in violation\". THEY WERE RIGHT WE WERE WRONG.]\n\n Even the UN said that Iraq was in material violation of the ceasefire.\n \n\n Resolution 1441 specifically stated:\n 1) That Iraq was in material breach of the ceasefire terms presented under the terms of Resolution 687. Iraq's breaches related not only to WMDs, but also the known construction of prohibited types of missiles, the purchase and import of prohibited armaments, and the continuing refusal of Iraq to compensate Kuwait for the widespread looting conducted by its troops in 1991.\n 2) That the ceasefire granted under Resolution 687 was binding only insofar as Iraq was willing to hew to the terms of that ceasefire.\n 3) That 1441, and its deadline, represented Iraq's final opportunity to comply with disarmament requirements. In accordance with the previous Resolutions, this meant Iraq not only had to verify the existence or destruction of its remaining unaccounted-for WMD stockpiles, but also had to ensure that all equipment, plans, and materials useful for the resumption of WMD programs was likewise turned over or verified as destroyed.\n 4) That \"...false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq pursuant to this resolution and failure by Iraq at any time to comply with, and cooperate fully in the implementation of, this resolution shall constitute a further material breach of Iraq's obligations\".\n ......\n Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei presented several reports to the UN detailing Iraq's level of compliance with Resolution 1441.[1] [2]. On January 30, 2003 Blix said that Iraq had not fully accepted its obligation to disarm, and by mid-February the issues of anthrax, the nerve agent VX and long-range missiles remained unresolved. Blix's March 7 report stated \"Iraq, with a highly developed administrative system, should be able to provide more documentary evidence about its proscribed weapons programmes. Only a few new such documents have come to light so far and been handed over since we began inspections.\"\n At this point, the US Administration asserted that Iraq remained in material breach of the UN Resolutions, and that, under 1441, this meant the Security Council had to convene immediately \"in order to consider the situation and the need for full compliance with all of the relevant Council resolutions in order to secure international peace and security\".\n \n Before the meeting took place, French president Jacques Chirac declared on March 10 that France would veto any resolution which would automatically lead to war. This caused open displays of dismay by the US and British governments. The drive by Britain for unanimity and a \"second resolution\" was effectively abandoned at that point.\n \n In the leadup to the meeting, it became apparent that a majority of UNSC members would oppose any resolution leading to war. As a result, no such resolution was put to the Council.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council_Resolution_1441\n \n\n The fact is Iraq was in violation of UN 1441 and France announced its intentions to block any further resolutions a priori. So much for your statement about France's willingness to join us. \n \n\n Excpet that after the sanctions were lifte the UN plan called for 10-15 years of monitoring to ensure that he did not reconstitute his programs...and the fact that they would have take 10-15 years to reconsitute IF they had existed. icne we now know that the last time they existed was prior to the FIRST gulf war, it would probably have taken him even longer.

At first, the issue was rising college tuition costs. But before long, thousands in Tehran and elsewhere were shouting for democratic reforms. Some clashed with riot police. Some called for the death of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme religious leader. Still others denounced Iran's elected president, Mohammad Khatami. On Sunday, President Bush, who once identified Iran as part of the axis of evil, endorsed the students' protests.\n http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/jan-june03/iran_6-18.html \n \n\n http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3879535.stm\n http://www.iranmania.com/News/ArticleView/?NewsCode=11062&NewsKind=CurrentAffairs\n \n\n ...Student activists have frequently resorted to strikes, sit-ins and demonstrations, and the violent response of the regime and repeated attacks of the paramilitaries have not succeeded in silencing them.

   "I'd like to start by saying that Rumsfeld was correct. We need to change the army into a quick reaction force. The army we had in the late 1980s that both Bush Sr and Clinton hacked down to size were designed to a fight a enemy that no longer existed. What we failed to do is prepare to fight a war aganist a elusive enemy that has no base of locations and operates in many ways similar to a mafia. That said, Rumsfeld is a incompetent hack who not only hates accountability but conservative personal responsibility and shouldn't be allowed to resign, he should be fired and thrown out the front door of the whitehouse by the seat of his britches.\n \n I do not believe Bush is a idiot. He is far from one of the worst US presidents (Harding anyone?). He is however, incompetent in virtually everything and should not be leading the nation, much less the 5 companies he ran into the ground. \n \n As for abortion, I don't have a problem. I'd rather have abortions then the crime rates we saw during the 70s and 80s and rising welfare needs paided for by taxes. Don't believe me? Read Freakonomics. The states who had liberal abortion policies saw their crime and welfare costs drop significently 15-20 years after liberalization. Many crime experts were predicting massive crime waves in the 70s and 80s, by the time the 90s came around, children who would have gone into crime, didn't exist, thanks to Roe vs. Wade. Other examples exist as well, Romania had years of liberal abortion. After a new dictator took over, he banned abortion and crime rates 15 years later were astronomically higher then the were before abortion was banned. Like Crime and Welfare? Ban Abortion. The wonderful thing about this view is you can't be a conservative and attack it due to its consequences. Untouchable. \n \n As for illegal immigration, Bush can shove his policies. Strict border regulation before any new reforms, with one exception, streamline legal immigration. People are lazy SOBs. Make legal easier then illegal and your problem is solved. \n \n Btw, you people remember that Reagan was a terrorist appeaser? Cut and run from Beruit!",

   "Hmmm...somebody back there (georged? I think....anyway nice to meetcha georged, nice to meet all 'o ya) wrote: \nI was under the impression the topic was Iraq.\n\n And here I was under the impression that the topic was that George Bush is a giant, since 9/11 specifically. Sure, Iraq falls under that banner I suppose. But there's oh-so-much more isn't there?\n Let's play it like those old MadLibs. For those of you too young to remember 'em just follow along and you'll pick it up soon enough.\n George Bush is a giant _________________. (or ! or ? or @#$#%!!!!!, take your pick)\n 1. ...jackass for trying to distract the public by shouting \"Gay Marriage!!\" from the roof of the White House. Last I checked, it wasn't the Velvet Mafia who were \"ruining the sanctity of marriage\"; it was drugs, alcohol, infidelity, and physical abuse, among others. Sometimes all four. So sad... :(\n \n 2. ...bonehead for listening to whatever jackass told him we would be \"greeted as liberators\" in Iraq.\n \n 3. ...traitor to his country for sending upwards of 100,000 troops into the desert w/out sufficient gear to do the job. Never mind that the job's likely un-doable, we should've been oversupplied.\n \n 4. ...hypocrite for telling the public that the \"terrorists\" \"hate our freedoms\", and that we needed to invade Iraqistan to \"spread freedom and democracy\"; then suggesting via others in his administration that torture is only torture when it's done to inflict pain, but not when it's done to extract information. \n It seems to me that if you're trying to set an example of just what freedom and democracy and \"civilization\" do for a country you'd start by \"doing good unto them that hate you.\" \n Oh, wait...that was Jesus who said that, not Moses. I forgot it's only the Ten Commandments we're supposed to revere, not the Beatitudes. Who needs all that \"blessed are the peacemakers\", \"turn the other cheek\", \"sell all that you own and give it to the poor\" b.s. We've got Patriot missiles, dammit!\n \n 5. ...even gianter (forgive the grammar) hypocrite for opposing the 9/11 commission, then acting as if it were his idea; opposing a Homeland Security Department, then doing same.\n \n 6. ...liar, for lying, when he claimed that he'd never said he wasn't \"worried about Osama\". Cuz, um, he did. So he lied.\n Or, to be fair, maybe he forgot. But probably he just lied.\n \n 7. ...toady of the ultra-rich, for offering up an abso-freakin'-lutely Ginormous tax-break to all those ExxonMobils and DOW Chemicals and Boeings and, yes, Halliburtons who put him in office. And don't forget our friends at Diebold.\n All this while more than 10% of the country lives below the gov'ts. stated \"poverty level.\" (The fact that that \"poverty level\" is so ######n low that not a single human being could survive on it in anything approaching comfort, not here where I live in Maryland, is another topic all by itself. And I'm not talking about driving a Beamer or owning a nice HDTV, I'm talking about eating something other than Ramen noodles 6 days a week, with maybe a \"treat\" at McDonalds on Friday night. Try living at that poverty level for a year. It's a great way to lose weight, and maybe some hair and a few teeth and the proper functioning of an organ or two....)\n ...and while energy companies were writing our Energy Policy, and fighting tooth-and-nail to prevent solar technology from becoming one cent cheaper or 1% more available than it already is.\n ...and while there are more cops in New York City than there are troops on patrol in Iraq at any given time.\n ...and while the price, and size, of new homes was skyrocketing. (Down the road from me a sign boasts new homes \"from the $660's!!! Granted, I'm one of those folks who abhors credit, and doesn't buy what he can't pay for with the cash he makes. So for me, a 660,000 home is forever and always gonna be out of the question. I have bought an automobile on credit, and I guess I house is more important. But, assuming an avg. mortgage of 1000$ for every 100,000$ financed... $6K per month?!? I don't make even half that before taxes. And before you say I need to lower my standards, and perhaps forego that dream of living in a McMansion, let me say that the average new home price in the county I live in is currently $364K. So, like, wow, I can have one for only 3500$/mo.)\n \n So there's a list of 7 MadLibs, kids. And I better quit there cuz my oxygen tanks gettin' low, I've been huffin' on it so much writing this.",

   "Before I criticize my active president (George Bush), and out of respect for the office and the government of the people for which I am a member, I will list the things I agree with. \n \n 1: I think the \"No Call List\" was for the people of the United States and it's clearly a benefit to us all.\n \n 2: I think tax brakes do indeed stimulate the economy and clearly lowers the burden on our fellow countrymen. It can be argued; the tax brakes are unbalanced surely, but we all received some measure of benefit.\n \n 3: I think removing the marriage penalty was righteous on all counts and a direct benefit on those we will leave a country behind too in the future. Clearly the move can only be seen as honorable on all counts.\n \n 4: I totally agree and support the Presidents move to normalize relations with India even to the point of aiding in their nuclear civil programs. They did not sign the non-proliferation treaty and have been honorable in their dealings with the world for the most part. I am with the President on this mater.\n \n Now I'll share my feelings on what I believe to be failures with the current administration.\n \n 1: I believe to move to cut communications with North Korea and simply watch them turn off the U.N. cameras to their Platinum reactors was the most foolish thing a sitting president has even done. Understand that when a country signs the non-proliferation treaty they are given a civilian reactor for the sacrifice in arms on their part. The NK reactor was there due to our treaty obligations. The Platinum the North Koreans obtained came from this reactor and they would have had a tough time getting any of this rare earth material with the plant. The President had to have known when the camera's where turned off that the North Koreans where building an atomic Bomb. We would have been better off simply giving them a couple atomic weapons than having them gain the capabilities to produce the weapons themselves. \n \n 2: The war in Iraq will be devastating to the stability of the Middle Eastern area for next 100 years in my opinion. We are now forced to arm one family in the Middle East because of this miss-judgment. We have to arm the Saudi Royal family and hope they can retain power. We can't ask ourselves if the Saudis want democracy and we have to accept what little freedoms those people will enjoy while we are faced with the realization their hardship is held in check by U.S. arms. It's a complete falsehood that we are worried Al Qeada will take over in Iraq. We are not fools, we know the Shia Militias are much larger and if we where not there, they could mobilize and crush Al Qeada in less than 30 days (in my opinion). The problem is the Royals in Saudi Arabia could fall if this happens. Now...like it or not. This is why we fight.",
