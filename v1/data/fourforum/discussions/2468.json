   "How many of these claims are true?\n \n \n \n Subject: Fw: Iraq-intresting stuff\n \n \n \n Just in case you might think of Iraq as \"only\" an oil-rich nation, ruled by an evil dictator for 30 years, whether it has been supporting terrorists or may not be very important, here are a few important facts regarding the important history and roles that this nation has played down through history. \n \n \n \n IRAQ -- VERY INTERESTING -- DID YOU KNOW? \n \n 1. The garden of Eden was in Iraq. (It sure doesn't look much like Paradise on earth today thanks to Saddam) \n \n 2. Mesopotamia which is now Iraq was the cradle of civilization! \n \n 3. Noah built the ark in Iraq. \n \n 4. The Tower of Babel was in Iraq. \n \n 5. Abraham was from Ur, which is in Southern Iraq! \n \n 6. Isaac's wife Rebekah is from Nahor which is in Iraq. \n \n 7. Jacob met Rachel in Iraq. \n \n 8. Jonah preached in Nineveh - which is in Iraq. \n \n 9. Assyria which is in Iraq conquered the ten tribes of Israel. \n \n 10. Amos cried out in Iraq! \n \n 11. Babylon which is in Iraq destroyed Jerusalem. \n \n 12. Daniel was in the lion's den in Iraq! \n \n 13. The 3 Hebrew children were in the fire in Iraq (That's good news to know that JESUS has been in Iraq too as the 4th person in the fiery \n \n furnace!) \n \n 14. Belshazzar, the King of Babylon saw the \"writing on the wall\" in Iraq. \n \n 15. Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, carried the Jews captive into Iraq. \n \n 16. Ezekiel preached in Iraq. \n \n 17. The wise men were from Iraq. (where are the \"wise\" men today?) \n \n 18. Peter preached in Iraq. \n \n 19. The \"Empire of Man\" described in Revelation is called Babylon which was a city in Iraq! \n \n And you have probably seen this one. Israel is the nation most often mentioned in the Bible. But do you know which nation is second? It is Iraq! However, that is not the name that is used in the Bible. The names used in the Bible are Babylon, Land of Shinar, and Mesopotamia. The word Mesopotamia means between the two rivers, more exactly between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. The name Iraq, means country with deep roots. Indeed Iraq is a country with deep roots and is a very significant country in the Bible. Here's why \n \n * Eden was in Iraq--Genesis 2:10-14 \n * Adam &Eve were created in Iraq--Genesis 2:7-8 \n * Satan made his first recorded appearance in Iraq--Genesis 3:1-6 \n * Nimrod established Babylon &Tower of Babel was built in Iraq-- Genesis \n 10:8-97; 11:1-4 \n * The confusion of the languages took place in Iraq--Genesis 11:5-11 \n * Abraham came from a city in Iraq--Genesis 11:31; Acts 7:2-4 \n * Isaac's bride came from Iraq--Genesis 24:3-4; 10 \n * Jacob spent 20 years in Iraq--Genesis 27:42-45; 31:38 \n * The first world Empire was in Iraq--Daniel 1:1-2;2:36-38 \n * The greatest revival in history was in a city in Iraq--Jonah 3 \n * The events of the book of Esther took place in Iraq--Esther \n * The book of Nahum was a prophecy against a city in Iraq--Nahum \n * The book or Revelation has prophecies against Babylon, which was the old name for the nation of Iraq--Revelation 17 &18 \n \n No other nation, except Israel, has more history and prophecy associated it than Iraq. \n \n And also... \n \n This is something to think about! Since America is typically represented by an eagle. Saddam should have read up on his Muslim passages... The following verse is from the Quran, (the Islamic Bible) \n \n Quran (9:11) -- For it is written that a son of Arabia would awaken a fearsome Eagle. The wrath of the Eagle would be felt throughout the lands of Allah and lo, while some of the people trembled in despair still more rejoiced; for the wrath of the Eagle cleansed the lands of Allah; and there was peace. \n (Note the verse number..)",

   "How many of these claims are true? \n\n \n Slow political day today jim? \n \n It looks as though only number 2 and perhaps 15 are correct as far as archeologists have been able to determine. \n \n \n \n\n And you have probably seen this one.

Here's the verse: \n \n (9:11) But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then are they your brethren in religion. We detail Our revelations for a people who have knowledge. \n \n I wish you would research a little before posting these types of forwarded anonymous e-mails. Our fundamentalist Christian brothers are edgy enough without adding patently false and absurd tracts to the mix.",
