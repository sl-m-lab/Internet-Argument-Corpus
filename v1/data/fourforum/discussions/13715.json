   "I decided to start this thread so that \"The Cake Lady\" could see for herself that the chances of Democrats gaining more support prior to the 2010 elections is just wishful thinking on her part. \n Obama's approval rating is lower than Bush's 1 year into his term and it doesn't look good for the Democrats in 2010 in general. If the economy's still in the tank, the party in power loses bigtime. That's the way it's always been. \n One interesting strategy being talked about by Republicans is their post-healthcare strategy in case it actually passes. They will run on an \"Undo Obamacare\" platform. emoticon_xgood\n \n \n\n DECEMBER 17, 2009 \n Democrats' Blues Grow Deeper in New Poll \n By PETER WALLSTEN \n WASHINGTON -- Less than a year after Inauguration Day, support for the Democratic Party continues to slump, amid a difficult economy and a wave of public discontent, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.\n The findings underscored how dramatically the political landscape has changed during the Obama administration's first year. In January, despite the recession and financial crisis, voters expressed optimism about the future, the new president enjoyed soaring approval ratings, and congressional leaders promised to swiftly pass his ambitious agenda.\n In December's survey, for the first time, less than half of Americans approved of the job President Barack Obama was doing, marking a steeper first-year fall for this president than his recent predecessors.\n Also for the first time this year, the electorate was split when asked which party it wanted to see in charge after the 2010 elections. For months, a clear plurality favored Democratic control.\n The survey suggests that public discontent with Mr. Obama and his party is being driven by an unusually grim view of the country's status and future prospects.\n Democrats' Blues Grow Deeper in New Poll - WSJ.com \n",
