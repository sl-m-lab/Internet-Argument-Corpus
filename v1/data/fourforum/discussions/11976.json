   "To quote David Brooks:\n \nBut this, apparently, is about to change. Democrats from Barack Obama to Nancy Pelosi want to grant immortality to General Motors, Chrysler and Ford. They have decided to follow an earlier $25 billion loan with a $50 billion bailout, which would inevitably be followed by more billions later, because if these companies are not permitted to go bankrupt now, they never will be.\n \n This is a different sort of endeavor than the $750 billion bailout of Wall Street. That money was used to save the financial system itself. It was used to save the capital markets on which the process of creative destruction\n depends.\n \n Granting immortality to Detroit's Big Three does not enhance creative destruction. It retards it. It crosses a line, a bright line. It is not about saving a system; there will still be cars made and sold in America. It is about saving politically powerful corporations. A Detroit bailout would set a precedent for every single politically connected corporation in America. There already is a long line of lobbyists bidding for federal money. If Detroit gets money, then everyone would have a case. After all, are the employees of Circuit City or the newspaper industry inferior to the employees of Chrysler?\n \n\n Pelosi, et al, are interested in keeping millions of Americans from becoming jobless. \n \n This fanatical love of \"creative destruction\" does not bode well for working people.\n \n Another factor is that one of General Motors' major obligations is maintaining the health care of millions of its ex-employees.\n \n Unfortunately, the corporate welfare state of America refused to sign on to single-payer provided health care and health care became a burden to employers. This class warfare against single-payer health care also made America a third-world nation in world competition for manufacturing startups.",
