   "It is stunning that 30 Republican members of the United States Senate would vote to protect a corporation, in this case Halliburton/KBR, over a woman who was gang raped. The details from Think Progress:\n \n In 2005, Jamie Leigh Jones was gang-raped by her co-workers while she was working for Halliburton/KBR in Baghdad. She was detained in a shipping container for at least 24 hours without food, water, or a bed, and \"warned her that if she left Iraq for medical treatment, she'd be out of a job.\" (Jones was not an isolated case.) Jones was prevented from bringing charges in court against KBR because her employment contract stipulated that sexual assault allegations would only be heard in private arbitration.\n\n \n Offering Ms. Jones legal relief was Senator Al Franken of Minnesota who offered an amendment to the 2010 Defense Appropriations bill that would withhold defense contracts from companies like KBR \"if they restrict their employees from taking workplace sexual assault, battery and discrimination cases to court.\"\n \n Seems simple enough. And yet, to GOP Senator Jefferson Beauregard Sessions of Alabama allowing victims of sexual assault a day in court is tantamount to a \"political attack\" at Halliburton. That 29 others, all men, chose to join him in opposing the Franken amendment is simply mind-boggling.\n \n Here are those who vote to protect a corporation over a victim of rape:\n \n Alexander (R-TN)\n Barrasso (R-WY)\n Bond (R-MO)\n Brownback (R-KS)\n Bunning (R-KY)\n Burr (R-NC)\n Chambliss (R-GA)\n Coburn (R-OK)\n Cochran (R-MS)\n Corker (R-TN)\n Cornyn (R-TX)\n Crapo (R-ID)\n DeMint (R-SC)\n Ensign (R-NV)\n Enzi (R-WY)\n Graham (R-SC)\n Gregg (R-NH)\n Inhofe (R-OK)\n Isakson (R-GA)\n Johanns (R-NE)\n Kyl (R-AZ)\n McCain (R-AZ)\n McConnell (R-KY)\n Risch (R-ID)\n Roberts (R-KS)\n Sessions (R-AL)\n Shelby (R-AL)\n Thune (R-SD)\n Vitter (R-LA)\n Wicker (R-MS)\n \n In the debate, Senator Sessions maintained that Franken's amendment overreached into the private sector and suggested that it violated the due process clause of the Constitution.\n \n To which, Senator Franken fired back quoting the Constitution. \"Article 1 Section 8 of our Constitution gives Congress the right to spend money for the welfare of our citizens. Because of this, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote, 'Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds and has repeatedly employed that power to further broad policy objectives,'\" Franken said. \"That is why Congress could pass laws cutting off highway funds to states that didn't raise their drinking age to 21. That's why this whole bill [the Defense Appropriations bill] is full of limitations on contractors -- what bonuses they can give and what kind of health care they can offer. The spending power is a broad power and my amendment is well within it.\"\n\n 30 GOP Senators Vote to Defend Gang Rape | Health and Wellness | AlterNet\n emoticon_frazzled\n Wow.\n Just wow.\n \n This is grotesquely inexcusable.\n If I had any doubt as to how some Republicans can side with big business at the EXPENSE of the common man, THIS is it...",

   "Naked, Sore, Bruised and Bleeding: Alleged U.S. Contractor Rape Victim Fights for Day in Court\n Senate Passes Amendment to Stop Contractors From Forcing Employees into Arbitration\n By JOHN R. PARKINSON\n Oct. 7, 2009 \n Jamie Leigh Jones was a 20-year-old young woman working her fourth day on the job in Baghdad for contractor Halliburton/KBR in 2005, when she says she was drugged and gang-raped by seven U.S contractors and held captive by two KBR guards in a shipping container. But more than four years after the alleged crimes occurred, Jones is still waiting for her day in court because when she signed her employment contract, she lost her rights to a jury trial and, instead, was forced into having her claims decided through secret, binding arbitration. \n \n Today, the Senate listened to her story before approving an amendment by a vote of 68-30 that would prohibit \"the Defense Department from contracting with companies that require employees to resolve sexual assault allegations and other claims through arbitration.\"\n \n \"I didn't even know that I had signed such a clause, but even if I had known, I would never have guessed that it would prevent me from bringing my claims to court after being brutally sexually harassed and assaulted,\" Jones, who told her story to ABC News' Chief Investigative Correspondent Brian Ross in an award-winning 20/20 story, testified at the Senate committee meeting on the issue. \"I had no idea that the clause was part of the contract, what the clause actually meant, or that I would eventually end up in this horrible situation.\" \n\n ABC News - ABC News\n \n Of course, it is possible that the specter of an innocent 20-year-old girl so victimized is a bit of a turn-on for certain men. Likewise, the vision of a naked, sore, bruised and bleeding 20-year-old girl.\n \n Then, there's the very important matter of protecting the corporate interests of KBR. After all, this is corporate American and mere human beings no longer have any rights.",

He is an Adjunct scholar with the Cato Institute and a correspondent for Asia Times.\n Added to cato.org on April 21, 2008\n This article appeared in United Press International on April 18, 2008. \n Since the very first conflicts, until it was made illegal under international law, rape was a part of warfare. But a series of recent allegations against Private Military Contractors suggests that it is not just a historical phenomenon.\n \n Earlier this month the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations held a hearing on the issue. The title, \"Closing legal Loopholes: Prosecuting Sexual Assaults and Other Violent Crimes Committed Overseas by American Civilians in a Combat Environment,\" said it all.\n \n Consider Dawn Leamon's story, which is chronicled in detail in the April 3 issue of The Nation. She says that while working for the U.S. contractor Kellogg Brown Root she was raped in Iraq earlier this year by a U.S. soldier and a KBR colleague.\n \n She says that following her rape, she spoke with a woman at the KBR Employee Assistance Program. \"She discouraged me from reporting, saying, 'You know what will happen if you do,'\" Leamon said.\n\n No Justice on Contractor Rape | David Isenberg | Cato Institute: Commentary\n \n KBR again.

The camp's military liaison officer also told her not to speak about what had happened, she says. And she would follow these instructions. \"Because then, all of a sudden, if you've done exactly what you've been instructed not to do--tell somebody--then you're in danger,\" Smith says. \n\n Another military contractor rape - Feministing\n \n Just another single incident.\n \n \"Sartre,\" don't get too turned on by the details of the crime...",

   "I disagree that it is not automatically unacceptable.\n We are talking about VIOLATIONS OF UNITED STATES LAW here.\n\n I'm not a lawyer of US law, I cannot judge whether it's acceptable. But be honest - are you a lawyer or otherwise actually versed in US law? If not, your opinion is just as unfounded as mine.\n \n \n \nIf it were a violation of internal company rules, then obviously an arbitrator would be reasonable.\n But we're talking about companies being accused of violating the law, and then being held to a binding SECRET arbitration paid for by ...\n ... the company itself.\n\n Company internal rules are subject of the employment contract and arbitration applied to it is not problematic. However, the contract can only apply to company internal rules. It cannot (well, unless you have a really weird concept of ius cogens over there, you might) override actual law. You can sign as many contracts as you want, but the police won't care.\n \n \nIn the big picture, requiring the arbitration to be secret and unappealable are both unacceptable.\n\n By nature, arbitration is an agreed upon judge. They are by nature unappealable - there is no appelate arbitrator. However, it is likely that one could sue, in court, to declare the arbitration unlawful. At least, you could over here.\n \n \nWhen the contract specifies that the arbitration is both final (unapealable) and secret, how the heck do you fix that?\n\n See above - by taking the arbitration itself to court.\n \n \nYou question whether it is \"legal and therefore binding\" if the arbitrator is not neutral.\n HOW can you get any legal ruling on that when you are forbidden from getting a legal ruling on that? \n\n Ask a US lawyer about how to deal with an arbitration. I'm sure there will be a legal remedy for a corrupt arbitrator. Possibly the legal institute of fraud and similar. I don't know your law, but ours has remedies.\n \n \nCan you nullify a \"clause\" that binds people from seeking a court ruling to nullify said clause?\n And part of the inherent \"immunity\" prevents the person from seeking redress of discussed problems.\n Part of the inherent \"immunity\" prevents the person from seeking an appeal.\n\n You don't nullify it. You go directly to court, and there the opponent will have to convince the judge that the clause is valid and actually stops the law suit.\n \n \nAgain, this fails to acknowledge the fact that the rape was obviously SYSTEMIC to the company.\n It was a GANG-RAPE which was instituted by MULTIPLE MEN, who USED company equipment to hold her hostage.\n And it's NOT THE ONLY rape...\n\n Again, I do not know how the US handles it. However, from comparative law, I assume a comparable remedy will exist. Therefore, I expect:\n -if rape were company policy, then company activity would be itself a form of organized crime (I doubt it)\n -if company policy prohibits such acts (it most likely does), but the policy itself is not enforced, there may be laws that make enforcing them an obligation. Possibly worker protection legislation? Gender equality legislation? Similar? Modern workplace sexual harassment prevention acts? Ask your local US lawyer. I'm quite sure something should be there.\n -an arbitration clause can only apply to this. It cannot go beyond and prevent \"state\" legal action.\n \n \nI understand the justice against the individuals perpetuating the rape.\n The problem is, and has been from the start of this thread, the fact that the company can violate a FEDERAL LAW and the violation will be held secret and reviewed NOT by federal judges, but rather by a company paid arbitrator WITHOUT APPEAL CAPABILITY.\n\n Company policy violation, yes. But not criminal activity, which is ius cogens and cannot be evaded by contractual law.",

   "Some more info about the deplorable actions of Haliburton in this case, and the under-handed \"before\" tactics that helped get them there...\n \n \nBinding arbitration agreements deprive consumers of the choice to go to court. That's precisely what they're designed to do, and that's why big corporations, car dealers, etc. hide them in small print in the midst of the multi-page consumer contracts that they force people to sign.\n \n Some of my clients, however, have posed the question to me: what is unfair about binding arbitration? The arbitrator is supposed to be fair, right? Well, the answer is no. Corporations usually use captive arbitration providers, such as JAMS, NAF (National Arbitration Forum) or AAA (American Arbitration Association), where the corporation, NOT the consumer, is the repeat customer. The judges know that their paychecks and their repeat business comes from the corporations, not from the consumers, so these forums are hardly impartial.\n \n If you have any remaining doubts about whether these forums are impartial, consider one of their biggest proponents: Dick Cheney. Our venerable Vice President has done pretty much everything within his power, and quite a few things very much outside of his power, to make a mockery of our system of justice. His recent refusal to comply with legal and congressional subpoenas is but a \"tip of the Cheney iceberg,\" towards which our ship of state is sadly headed.\n \n Cheney's distaste for pesky little things like constitutional guarantees, the Bill of Rights and due process of law date back to his Halliburton days, if not before. In the 1990's, when Cheney was CEO of Halliburton, he tricked all of the employees of Halliburton and its subsidiaries into \"signing\" binding arbitration agreements simply by showing up to work. In other words, the company sent out a fine-print notice indicating that by the simple act of showing up to work, you had consented to waive your right to trial by jury and consented to having any disputes against Halliburton decided by in a binding arbitration. Halliburton has a long history of terminating workers who have filed worker's comp claims and has a reputation of firing or laying off \"the old, the sick and the halt,\" so it's little wonder Halliburton decided that none of its employees deserved any right to a jury trial.\n \n Fast forward to 2005, and Jamie Leigh Jones, an employee of Halliburton subsidiary KBR, goes to Iraq and encounters a slightly upsetting employment situation: she is drugged and gang-raped by her fellow employees, who then lock her in a shipping container and warn her that if she tries to go for medical treatment, she'd be fired. The US Embassy eventually had to free her from the shipping container. Jamie had evidently managed to contact her father, who, after having no luck pursuing her daughter's protection or safety with KBR or Halliburton, called his US Representative, Ted Poe. Representative Poe similarly had no luck with calling the company, so Rep. Poe had to involve the US Embassy. Obviously, there are embassy witnesses to the allegations.\n \n When Ms. Jones tried to sue in court...SURPRISE!!! Halliburton invoked its binding arbitration clause, and Ms. Jones cannot pursue her claims against her employer in a court of law.\n \n All thanks to Dick Cheney.\n \n So, if you ever ask me in the future why I oppose involuntary binding arbitration, or if I detect that you might be buying the corporate PR messages about how wonderful it is, I'll simply respond: would you want your consumer dispute against a corporation decided by Dick Cheney?\n\n Halliburton Proves For You That Binding Arbitration is Unfair, Corrupt and One-sided\n \n Considering the egregious actions of Halliburton in this case, where OUTSIDE HELP had to be invoked in order to get this woman freed, does ANYBODY think that Halliburton should have ANY part in deciding ANYTHING about the judge to decide the case???",

(KBR was sold off earlier this year.) So Jones is covered by the Halliburton dispute-resolution program, which was implemented when Cheney was Halliburton's CEO. The system bears the markings of Cheney's obsession with secrecy and executive power. On his watch, Halliburton, in late 1997, made it more difficult for its employees to sue the company for discrimination, sexual harassment, and other workplace-related issues.\n \n One day, Halliburton sent all its employees a brochure explaining that the company was implementing a new dispute resolution system. The company sold the new program as an employee perk that would create an \"open door\" policy for bringing grievances to management and as a forum for resolving disputes without expensive and lengthy litigation. In practice, it meant that anyone who had a legitimate civil-rights or personal-injury claim signed away his or her constitutional right to a jury trial. Anyone who showed up for work after getting the brochure was considered to have agreed to give up his or her rights, regardless of whether the employees had actually read it.Cheney Justice? | Mother Jones\n \n She never signed anything to force her to arbitration.\n Quite frankly, I think YOU should be required to show her signature on the contract if you want to continue this b.s. emoticon_xagree",

On Tuesday, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in her favor, arguing that Jones' alleged rape did not fall under the auspices of the employee contract because \"her alleged injuries were not, in fact, in any way related to her employment and thus, not covered by the contract,\" Mother Jones reports.\n The Raw Story Report: KBR employee raped by co-workers wins right to sue \n\n \n Now, why do you suppose she went through all that trouble to challenge an employee contract that she didn't sign?

Here's an article on the topic.\n\n Earth to JPSartre12.\n That proves nothing.\n Halliburton was declaring it a \"contract\" EVEN WHEN NOTHING WAS SIGNED and the only semblance of \"acceptance\" was that people showed up for work.\n When you're dealing with a company that pretends that showing up for work constitutes agreement to a contract, you NEED TO SHOW the actual contract.\n \n \n \nNow, why do you suppose she went through all that trouble to challenge an employee contract that she didn't sign? I'm smelling BS, aren't you?\n\n Yeah.\n And it's coming from you.\n \n Here is the real sequence of events.\n 1) SHE WENT TO COURT TO FILE A COMPLAINT regarding Halliburton's role in her rape. THAT is what she initially went to do.\n 2) Halliburton responded claiming that she signed a contract demanding arbitration and excluding courts from resolving the issue. THAT is why she had to address Halliburton's claim.\n 3) She DID NOT initially go to court to \"challenge an employee contract\".\n \n \n \nAmerican citizens committing a crime against another American citizen are still subjected to American law, aren't they? Otherwise, you could murder someone on the high seas, return to the USA and never have to worry about being incarcerated.\n\n So?\n My point is that in addition to Halliburton's attempts to ensure the rape victim did not report her rape, how well did Halliburton cooperate with the investigation?\n Did they fire the rapist and bring him home immediately? Have they been cooperative in all avenues of investigation, including allowing access to the Halliburton employees in another country.\n Cause obviously American police have no jurisdiction to go over there and arrest the guy in Bagdad.\n \n \n \nThere's no doubt that INDIVIDUALS botched her handling, but I've seen no evidence that it was due to corporate policy. You make a huge assumption thinking it was.\n\n \"INDIVIDUALS botched her handling\"???\n emoticon_xdonno\n She talked to a REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMPANY who told her to not report it. You can't just pretend this person is a \"representative\" when they do something you like, but insist they are just an \"individual\" when they do something you don't like.\n And moreover, there are MANY supposed \"individuals\" involved here. Collaboration in committing rape and covering it up, over a PROLONGED period of time.\n If a man were to try to rape a woman at an office, the expected response would be to immediately call the police and get the woman to a hospital for medical care.\n But when you have several of the crew participating in the rape, confining her for over a day, and then the company's rep tries to persuade the person not to sue, it's no longer an \"individual\" problem.\n They're acting in a group.\n \n \n \nMaybe, maybe not. If the guards were amongst those that raped her, they may have been acting on their own. If that's the case, the company can't be held responsible for employees' criminal activities unless they knew and ignored the fact.\n\n Ignoring the BS you're spewing to help cover up for the company, what you just said should be decided in a court of law...\n \n Addressing the BS you're spewing, your responses are downright pathetic.\n You present NO evidence, but just insist on saying \"probably\" and \"maybe\" and \"possibly\" in response ...\n \n You're living on doubt.\n \n \n \nYou need to stop arguing with your emotions and start looking at the issue logically.\n\n You need to stop pretending this is about \"emotions\".\n All my arguments are logical.\n You're trying to dismiss them as \"emotional\" when the truth is that all these things would be entirely relevant in a court of law.\n \n \n \nYou immediately assumed that the company was responsible for criminal actions committed by their employees. That's a bad assumption, IMO.\n\n I am stating that these things need to be evaluated in a court of law.\n NOT in arbitration.\n \n \n \nIf a Burger King employee goes off the deep end and rapes a patron, does that make BK automatically responsible for rape?\n\n :xbanghead\n There you go again. Trying to pretend this is just about ONE person.\n You said \"employee\". Singular.\n \n NOTHING ABOUT this case is singular.\n She was GANG-raped. She was kept captive which involved more people.\n And then a company rep told her she shouldn't report it or get fired.\n \n If ALL that happened at a Burger King, then YES.

   "There have been a couple of people commenting on \"criminal vs civil\" charges.\n \n Up until now, I hadn't really looked into the \"criminal\" aspect although I had suspected the worst regarding the situation.\n \n Unfortunately, my hunch was right...\n \n First of all, there is more evidence that either KBR as a conspiracy or a KBR employee went further to cover up the crime than just trying to silence the victim. They \"lost\" evidence which should have helped in prosecution of the crime.\n \nJones told ABCNews.com that an examination by Army doctors showed she had been raped \"both vaginally and anally,\" but that the rape kit disappeared after it was handed over to KBR security officers. \n\n \n Secondly, and more heinously, there is an issue of whether Ms Jones can ever see prosecution of a criminal case...\n \nA spokesperson for the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security told ABCNews.com he could not comment on the matter.\n \n Over two years later, the Justice Department has brought no criminal charges in the matter. In fact, ABC News could not confirm any federal agency was investigating the case.\n \n Legal experts say Jones' alleged assailants will likely never face a judge and jury, due to an enormous loophole that has effectively left contractors in Iraq beyond the reach of United States law.\n \n \"It's very troubling,\" said Dean John Hutson of the Franklin Pierce Law Center. \"The way the law presently stands, I would say that they don't have, at least in the criminal system, the opportunity for justice.\" \n\n Victim: Gang-Rape Cover-Up by U.S., Halliburton/KBR - ABC News\n emoticon_angry\n \n \n As previous articles noted, there have been OTHER WOMEN raped in Iraq.\n Interestingly enough, JPSartre12 talked about how these women went to a zone and they should have known the risks...\n But one has to question how any woman could assess a risk of being gang-raped by a co-worker under circumstances where the law has such a huge loop-hole, and the company would be allowed to SECRETLY arbitrate several situations similar to Ms Jones situation... emoticon_frazzled\n \n Going a step further, the prosecution of these OTHER rape cases are now in question.\n It looks like some progress has been made though in one case. Ms Jones situation being brought to light (despite the demand for secret arbitration) has subsequently resulted in one individual man getting arrested. From the case description, his rape situation is different because he raped a woman on an airbase, which would presumably allow more federal jurisdiction into the issue than a company property issue.\n \n \nProsecutors say Breda jumped and fondled the woman in October 2008 at Camp Al Asad, Iraq, where he worked for a subsidiary of Houston-based KBR Inc.\n \n The 34-year-old's guilty plea could mean up to two years in prison and lifetime status as a registered sexual offender.\n\n The Associated Press: Ex-contractor pleads guilty to sex assault in Iraq\n \n On multiple levels, this whole situation is screwed up.\n I think Franken's amendment should just be the tip of an iceberg of change.",

   "To sum up your argument:\n \n Rape occured. When the woman raped tried to press charges, the company tried to hide behind the arbitration agreement. US legislative apparatus is trying to pass a bill that would only allow giving contracts to companies who\n insist upon arbitration clauses. You characterized representatives who oppose the amendment as \"defending gang rape\".\n \n And to sum up mine:\n 1: re: company hides behind arbitration agreement: concept of ius cogens states that the arbitration agreement can only apply to civil matters, not criminal charges. Therefore, the problem that the legislature adresses is much lesser (or rather lies elsewhere, see below) than stated by you, meaning the need for proposed legislation is lesser than implied.\n 2: the court verdict that \"threw out\" the arbitration clause directly confirms this position.\n 3: re: opponents to the amendment supporting rape: the title accusation is an exaggeration. The amendment does not even adress rape, for starters. It's about arbitration clauses, which have only a fringe relation with rape cases and even then have already been found not to apply.\n 4: the claim above is sensationalist in nature. If I were looking for an example of a sensationalist claim, I'd have one above.\n 5: having skimmed the wiki page and the article, why are you worried about the arbitration clauses? The problem is that the US apparently is not prosecuting criminal charges, and the criminal charges are not helb back by the arbitration - they are held back by things like CPA Order 17. Now THAT is an issue. But why are you ignoring that? Where are the calls for supreme court review of the constitutionality of that? And if found constitutional, where are the calls to change that in the constitution?\n \n There's my argument. None of it changed, only 5: has been added due to subsequent brief skim of the issue.",

US legislative apparatus is trying to pass a bill that would only allow giving contracts to companies who\n insist upon arbitration clauses. You characterized representatives who oppose the amendment as \"defending gang rape\".\n\n 1) US legislative apparatus is trying to pass a bill that would only allow giving contracts to companies who exempt arbitration clauses from covering \"sexual assault or harassment, including assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, false imprisonment\".\n 2) I have a habit of repeating an article title as the thread title, as part of quoting the exact article.\n Doesn't mean I agree with every facet of the original article.\n I have repeated the article title, but my own position on what these 30 Republican \"representatives\" are saying would not be accurately summed up with \"defending gang rape\".\n \n I would say that these 30 Republican \"representatives\" are complacent in allowing justice to continue to be restricted, and to allow companies to continue practices which continue to put women at risk.\n \n \n \nAnd to sum up mine:\n 1: re: company hides behind arbitration agreement: concept of ius cogens states that the arbitration agreement can only apply to civil matters, not criminal charges. Therefore, the problem that the legislature adresses is much lesser (or rather lies elsewhere, see below) than stated by you, meaning the need for proposed legislation is lesser than implied.\n\n You are wrong regarding trying to talk about my position in your \"summary\"...\n I have never implied that this woman cannot seek criminal charges because of arbitration.\n \n I HAVE (however) demonstrated that this woman is prevented from seeking criminal justice for other reasons.\n I have stated that justice is more than just criminal charges.\n \n \n \n2: the court verdict that \"threw out\" the arbitration clause directly confirms this position.\n\n Can you please elaborate on what Jamie Leigh Jones' current legal case (as entered into court) is actually about, and the actual classification of that case?\n \n \n \n3: re: opponents to the amendment supporting rape: the title accusation is an exaggeration. The amendment does not even adress rape, for starters. It's about arbitration clauses, which have only a fringe relation with rape cases and even then have already been found not to apply.\n\n You are putting too much emphasis on one phrase, while the meat of the issue is left standing.\n It's times like this where I typically just change the one phrase, and it does nothing to affect the actual meat of the issue.\n Here, it's not even my phrase to begin with... emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \n4: the claim above is sensationalist in nature. If I were looking for an example of a sensationalist claim, I'd have one above.\n\n And now you're wasting two of your points to complain about a phrase I didn't even create...\n \n \n \n5: having skimmed the wiki page and the article, why are you worried about the arbitration clauses? The problem is that the US apparently is not prosecuting criminal charges, and the criminal charges are not helb back by the arbitration - they are held back by things like CPA Order 17. Now THAT is an issue. But why are you ignoring that? Where are the calls for supreme court review of the constitutionality of that? And if found constitutional, where are the calls to change that in the constitution?\n\n There are multiple issues here.\n I only recently realized the issue regarding the rapists and criminal charges.\n And since I don't see anybody arguing that the rapists should NOT be tried criminally, it's hardly an issue that should thrive on this thread...\n \n To pretend I am \"ignoring\" it is unfounded.\n I could just as easily raise that question towards you... emoticon_emb\n \n \n \nThere's my argument. None of it changed, only 5: has been added due to subsequent brief skim of the issue.\n\n That is your argument.\n As in, that is ALL of your argument?

   "1) US legislative apparatus is trying to pass a bill that would only allow giving contracts to companies who exempt arbitration clauses from covering \"sexual assault or harassment, including assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, false imprisonment\".\n\n So even the scope of arbitration that is considered is limited. I really don't get it why do it this way. What is this doing in governement funding bills? If the courts cannot be expected to declare such clauses null and void on their own, why is this not a part of a worker protection law that would directly declare them void? Why LIMIT YOURSELF TO ONLY NOT HIRING THEM when the ATTEMPT ITSELF SHOULD BE ILLEGAL. I'm ASKING FOR MORE, but also more to the point. Really, it sounds like using a spanner to screw in a screw - you have much better tools to work with.\n \n \n2) I have a habit of repeating an article title as the thread title, as part of quoting the exact article.\n Doesn't mean I agree with every facet of the original article.\n I have repeated the article title, but my own position on what these 30 Republican \"representatives\" are saying would not be accurately summed up with \"defending gang rape\".\n\n I stand corrected then and was misled by your choice to keep article title as an endorsement. Especially with your own comment reproduced below:\n \nWow.\n Just wow.\n \n This is grotesquely inexcusable.\n If I had any doubt as to how some Republicans can side with big business at the EXPENSE of the common man, THIS is it...\n\n The above by me was sarcastic. Come on, are you kidding here? \"I just reproduced the title and don't necessarily agree with it! I think something else!\" Pull the other one, it's got bells on. I didn't misinterpret your point - you misstated it.\n \n \nI would say that these 30 Republican \"representatives\" are complacent in allowing justice to continue to be restricted, and to allow companies to continue practices which continue to put women at risk.\n\n Yeah right, see above. I'll accept this as your current standpoint, but it's NOT what your original post was.\n \n \n \nYou are wrong regarding trying to talk about my position in your \"summary\"...\n I have never implied that this woman cannot seek criminal charges because of arbitration.\n\n Fine. So you just pointed us to an article about an amendment that is aimed at these arbitration clauses but didn't consider it problematic.\n \n \n \nI HAVE (however) demonstrated that this woman is prevented from seeking criminal justice for other reasons.\n I have stated that justice is more than just criminal charges.\n\n Well, what is justice then? You think justice is money? A public trial? What is?\n \n \n \nCan you please elaborate on what Jamie Leigh Jones' current legal case (as entered into court) is actually about, and the actual classification of that case?\n\n Well, we're going by newspaper articles here, so we can hardly make an accurate analysis (when it comes to newspaper accuracy in matters of law, I assume out of experience that they're wrong or at least inaccurate :) ). But going by Court Okays Halliburton Rape Trial | Mother Jones (your article)\n \nAfter 15 months in arbitration, Jones and her lawyer realized the same thing and went to court to fight the arbitration agreement in the hopes of bringing her case before a jury. Jones argued that the alleged gang rape was not related to her employment and thus, wasn't covered by the arbitration agreement. Finally, two years later, a federal court has sensibly agreed with her. Tuesday, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2 to 1 ruling, found her alleged injuries were not, in fact, in any way related to her employment and thus, not covered by the contract.\n So apparently now she can sue Haliburton, and we can wait for a verdict to see how the court system handles it. And it's obviously a civil law trial.\n \n \n \nYou are putting too much emphasis on one phrase, while the meat of the issue is left standing.\n It's times like this where I typically just change the one phrase, and it does nothing to affect the actual meat of the issue.\n Here, it's not even my phrase to begin with... \n\n \nAnd now you're wasting two of your points to complain about a phrase I didn't even create...\n\n But you cited it and went on to express incredulity that such a thing could happen, \"wow-just-wow\" style. Sorry, but if it wasn't yours, you sure look like you adopted it, and it now looks like you are backing away from your early comments. I'll accept your clarification that your position may not be that, but I will not accept your claim that I uderstood what you wrote incorrectly. To be clear: I understood what it meant, if it didn't mean what you wanted, you wrote badly.\n \n \n \n#1 relies on a false representation of my position. \n\n I don't think I falsely represent it. If YOU misrepresented it and are backing away, fine. But sorry, \"Wow. Just wow. This is grotesquely inexcusable.\" is quite clear.\n \n#2 requires expounding to cover the precise nature of the situation.\n\n We don't have enough to work with to do an analysis of the specific case. We can only do our best with what we have available - and while I don't doubt the gist was caught, the sources are rather biased.\n \n#3 and #4 are simply repeating a complaint about the original article's title...\n\n I'll stand by my asessment of your posting style. Otherwise maybe we should make a rule like the election ads: I'm Iuris and I endorse this message type.\n \nAnd #5 is new but more of a stretched misrepresentation rather than an accurate understanding of another person's priorities.\n\n The issues under #5 were not brought up in the discussion yet. I have stated, and I believe explained, why I believe they are more to the point and apply to the real life issue more closely. Those are MY priorities, not anyone elses, I just ask why people have other priorities.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs in, that is ALL of your argument? Not missing any issues you previously complained about but have since dropped?\n\n I'll reviev all my complaints after lunch and see whether I dropped any.",

   "OK, my posts, all here in one place. Read in red for what I see as a separate point and my opinion of it.\n \n Post 1:\n \nI lack the understanding of the US legal system but...\n \n -as I understand this, the contract under which the woman in question worked just stipulates that direct access to court is replaced by an obligatory arbitration. Now, the admissibility of this under the US law I cannot evaluate, but it is not automatically unacceptable. Usually, arbitrators are chosen in a way that makes them neutral in the matter. Were this an inherently biased arbitrator, we'd get into the issue whether the clause is legal and therefore binding.\n Admissibility of the arbitration agreement.\n \n -for some reason, this is taken as granting the company some form of immunity, which I can't really see. The arbitration may only apply to the contractual obligations between the parties. Matters of ius cogens can not be covered by it and the clause would simply be null in such a case. Or can they?\n Ius cogens issue, and found to be not related to the arbitration agreement but to the order.\n \n -the bill does not grant any actual immunities or anything, it simply applies criteria for selection of government contract recipients. So, the bill would have no effect on the case at all, only that the company would be forced to meet the criteria of the bill to qualify for government work.\n Aim of the amendment. By its nature, it certainly does not apply to the case - at best, it will in future force companies to abandon arbitration clauses if they want government jobs. Nothing forces them to abandon them if they don't want government work.\n \n Now, I fail to see why this would be condoning rape or similar. The rape must be a violation of employment contracts or company policy, and grounds for disciplinary action (dismissal from the job at worst - as far as the company is concerned. Once he's out, the cops and the victim's lawyers should be waiting right in front of the door with subpoenas and similar).\n Applies to Foundit66's implie opinion in the first posts. I'll stand by the claim that foundit's posts did imply what I adress.\n \n\n \n \n Post 2:\n \nI disagree that it is not automatically unacceptable.\n We are talking about VIOLATIONS OF UNITED STATES LAW here. \n \n I'm not a lawyer of US law, I cannot judge whether it's acceptable. But be honest - are you a lawyer or otherwise actually versed in US law? If not, your opinion is just as unfounded as mine.\n Foundit claims a violation of US law. I state I don't know, but that I doubt foundit actually knows rather than estimates himself. Ie. I'm no expert but neither is he, so we can argue and can't just accept his opinion as right.\n \n \n Quote:\n If it were a violation of internal company rules, then obviously an arbitrator would be reasonable.\n But we're talking about companies being accused of violating the law, and then being held to a binding SECRET arbitration paid for by ...\n ... the company itself. \n \n Company internal rules are subject of the employment contract and arbitration applied to it is not problematic. However, the contract can only apply to company internal rules. It cannot (well, unless you have a really weird concept of ius cogens over there, you might) override actual law. You can sign as many contracts as you want, but the police won't care.\n Ius cogens repeated.\n \n Quote:\n In the big picture, requiring the arbitration to be secret and unappealable are both unacceptable. \n \n By nature, arbitration is an agreed upon judge. They are by nature unappealable - there is no appelate arbitrator. However, it is likely that one could sue, in court, to declare the arbitration unlawful. At least, you could over here.\n Definition of arbitration, really. Arbitration is chosen when neither party wants a regular court procedure (for example, because it takes too long, costs too much, want to apply special rules,...). If there is no consensus to arbitration or arbitration procedure is suspect, that's a separate issue. (one party is forced into signing the agreement -< agreement can be sued to be found invalid, arbitrator is biased -< arbitration decision is sued to be found invalid)\n \n Quote:\n When the contract specifies that the arbitration is both final (unapealable) and secret, how the heck do you fix that? \n \n See above - by taking the arbitration itself to court.\n Repeats and applies to above.\n \n Quote:\n You question whether it is \"legal and therefore binding\" if the arbitrator is not neutral.\n HOW can you get any legal ruling on that when you are forbidden from getting a legal ruling on that? \n \n Ask a US lawyer about how to deal with an arbitration. I'm sure there will be a legal remedy for a corrupt arbitrator. Possibly the legal institute of fraud and similar. I don't know your law, but ours has remedies.\n Repeats and applies to above. If you know a lawyer, ask him.\n \n Quote:\n Can you nullify a \"clause\" that binds people from seeking a court ruling to nullify said clause?\n And part of the inherent \"immunity\" prevents the person from seeking redress of discussed problems.\n Part of the inherent \"immunity\" prevents the person from seeking an appeal. \n \n You don't nullify it. You go directly to court, and there the opponent will have to convince the judge that the clause is valid and actually stops the law suit.\n Nature of an arbitration agreement is such. The arbitrator provides the decision, and if they honour the decision, it stands. If one does not honour the decision, he has to go to court and the other party has to argue to the court that the arbitrator has decided. The court then decides whether the arbitrator's decision can apply.\n \n Quote:\n Again, this fails to acknowledge the fact that the rape was obviously SYSTEMIC to the company.\n It was a GANG-RAPE which was instituted by MULTIPLE MEN, who USED company equipment to hold her hostage.\n And it's NOT THE ONLY rape... \n \n Again, I do not know how the US handles it. However, from comparative law, I assume a comparable remedy will exist. Therefore, I expect:\n -if rape were company policy, then company activity would be itself a form of organized crime (I doubt it)\n -if company policy prohibits such acts (it most likely does), but the policy itself is not enforced, there may be laws that make enforcing them an obligation. Possibly worker protection legislation? Gender equality legislation? Similar? Modern workplace sexual harassment prevention acts? Ask your local US lawyer. I'm quite sure something should be there.\n -an arbitration clause can only apply to this. It cannot go beyond and prevent \"state\" legal action.\n \n \n Quote:\n I understand the justice against the individuals perpetuating the rape.\n The problem is, and has been from the start of this thread, the fact that the company can violate a FEDERAL LAW and the violation will be held secret and reviewed NOT by federal judges, but rather by a company paid arbitrator WITHOUT APPEAL CAPABILITY. \n \n Company policy violation, yes. But not criminal activity, which is ius cogens and cannot be evaded by contractual law.\n Criminal vs. civil law, why the US prosecution apparatus does not act is a separate issue to arbitration\n\n \n Post 3:\n \nFoundit66, do you realize that you have just proven what I've been saying all along? That the arbitration clause could only apply to the contractual law, not the criminal charges?\n\n Restates and applies to above.\n \n Post 4:\n \nDo you even know the difference between criminal/penal and civil/contract law?\n \n Criminal law is the law of the state. It regulates what is permitted and what is forbidden to the point where it assigns a punishment for the forbidden. No arbitration here, no private contracts, apart when the court allows it (plea bargaining for example). The arbitration clause would be completely worthless here, and the case against the rapists is completely immune to it.\n \n The relation between the employer and employee is different. Arbitration is likely possible, but what the arbitration clause would cover would be limited - as the court apparently found. It does not cover criminal issues, civil right violations and similar.\n \n There are also likely to be many limits imposed on the company to \"even up the odds\" in legislation. They sure would be over here, but you US capitalist extremists may have forgotten to do so.\n \n \n Quote:\n If the company violates a FEDERAL LAW with an employee, then that should be heard in a court of law. \n \n And I keep saying that whatever a contract stipulates cannot override law, at all. It can only work WITHIN THE SCOPE THE LAW ALLOWS. That's why your claims are overly sensationalist.\n Applies to arbitration admissibility.\n \n And last, a company's employee relation is a relatively minor part of things to consider whether a company is suited to engage in business. Not supporting an amendment as proposed is not actually condoning rape - it's merely choosing what matters when choosing a contractor. Yes, I claimed this. And you'll notice it was hardly ever addressed later.\n Applies to Amendment aims.\n\n Post 5 (damn, it's hard to keep track, I hope I didn't miss any...\n \nQuote:\n Sooo, what is the focus of your practice? \n \n Well, I'm a lawyer, not an attorney. I work in our capital's public housing fund. So I get A LOT of contact with serious social cases, in case you wondered. So, I work primarily within the scope of our administrative law. USA is kinda far and not even from the continental legal system group, so I can't really make any definitive statements regarding the applicative law.\n \n But I do know enough about comparative law that I know legal systems generally take elements one from another. And Ius cogens vs. Ius dispositivum is an issue I'm certain the US law will know about.\n My education. Repeats my caveat that the US MAY be doing things differently, but I have yet to see anyone actually KNOW the law instead of basic principle familiarity\n \n Quote:\n Um, rape is a crime and CEO thieving is a corporate virtue? \n \n Theft is also a crime. Abuse of executive position may also be, but I expect you are not actually talking about a CEO embezzling money and similar but simply profiting from his position.\n \n And don't take me as some wild rightist here. I'm a damn leftist by this board criteria, and no friend to great companies, who I feel need a lot of watching over.\n \n I see this issue similar to, for example, myself hiring craftsman X over craftsman Y because craftsman X is better at the job I want done, even though I may be aware that craftsman X beats his wife and craftsman Y is a nice guy. Would that make me a supporter of domestic violence, misogynist and similar? Hardly.\n Applies to amendment aims. \n\n \n Post 6:\n \nFoundit starts to annoy me.Foundit, you have no idea what you're talking about. If ius cogens voids a contract clause, and you harp for pages how horrible it is, it's far from \"clear from the start\". \n Based upon what has been demonstrated, I have yet to be convinced foundit knows any legal theory.\n \n Half your argument (the part that connects the rape case to the proposed legislation) is based upon the assumption that the rape case is problematic. That's not iron or aluminium weatherwanes.\n Why my arguments apply to the issue.\n \n But if you see it as obfuscating, then I'm sorry you couldn't comprehend my arguments. I've twice already made my position clear. I'll not obfuscate further by stating it for the third time.\n I think my position has been quite clear by the posts above.\n \n P.S. your whole damn posting style is sensationalist. Take a minor problem and present it as an almost end of the world matter. Not seeing it is like not seeing Archie's worldview - all of his posts illustrate it.\n See my next to last post for explanation why I see foundit's post as sensationalist.\n \n\n \n \nQuote:\n Yyyyeeeaaahhhh.....\n \n A peremptory norm (also called jus cogens or ius cogens, Latin for \"compelling law\") is a fundamental principle of international law which is accepted by the international community of states as a norm from which no derogation is ever permitted.\n \n There is no clear agreement regarding precisely which norms are jus cogens nor how a norm reaches that status, but it is generally accepted that jus cogens includes the prohibition of genocide, maritime piracy, slaving in general (to include slavery as well as the slave trade), torture, and wars of aggression and territorial aggrandizement.\n \n Peremptory norm - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Can you give a little more on how you are applying what you just said to the issue of Halliburton's demand for arbitration?\n I'm just trying to be crystal clear on what you're saying, cause I don't want to assume your position and what you said is very vague regarding application to this case. \n \n Thank you for demonstrating you have no idea. Ius cogens vs. ius dispositivum is a broad concept, and you only found it in international law, the ONE place where it's not clear. Guess what, it's damn clear in all other fields of law, you just don't know them.\n Why wiki focuses on lack of clear ius cogens in international law (a specific point) without first explaining the core concept, which applies to most law, I don't know. I'll have to review the article.\n \n Quote:\n I am basing my discussion on the issue that Halliburton's contribution, negligence, and attempted coverup of the rape case BELONGS IN A U.S. COURT and not in secret, unappealable binding arbitration against the will of the victim.\n \n The fact that Halliburton's case is not \"criminal\" as in rape charges are not being levelled against Halliburton is IRRELEVANT.\n \n But you keep trying to frame the issue in a way to ignore the actual circumstances... \n \n As accessories to the crime, they of course belong in a court of law, and no arbitration clause would help with it. You get a criminal procedure started, you accuse Haliburton's employees of something specific, they try to claim immunity due to arbitration, and the judge throws the defense out as it cannot override the law.\n The posts above have well stated why I think my issue apply to the case.\n \n \n Quote:\n No, no, no...\n I am saying it is obfuscational because you are failing to recognize MY arguments.\n Because you are failing to address the REAL HEART of the issue.\n \n Just because you declare something as \"civil case\" does not mean squat. \n \n I bloody well recognize your arguments. \n Not so sure any more, though, since foudit's first post apparently doesn't represent his actual views, but that's up to him to post his opinions more clearly...\n \n \n Quote:\n Funny how you've made your position clear, but I've got a long list of questions you're still refusing to answer... \n Waiting for a list.\n What's to say?\n -arbitration clause as an attempt to resolve civil law issues may be admissible, as far as worker protection legislature allows\n -if arbitration is unfair, a court remedy should be available, and I'm sure there is\n -criminal aspects and acts cannot be covered by an arbitration clause, and should proceed per regular criminal procedure, with the rapists being accuses as the perpetrators and people attempting a cover up and similar being accomplices. Unless Haliburton is actually a rape organization the whole of it won't be subject to charges\n -a bill limiting who is eligible for government work is of course permissible, and it would be nice to consider more than just the direct capability for the job, but it's not a means to combat crime\n -opposing the proposed bill does not make one support rape\n -claiming those opposed to the bill support rape, in bold, is sensationalist\n -the state should have an army to do military work, not private contractors. Haliburton should be out of a job for centuries.\n \n \n Quote:\n Quite frankly, discussing the FACTS of this case are obviously \"sensationalist\".\n You keep trying to discuss the issue by stripping it of the facts.\n That's the nature of talking about a general issue. Without access to actual court and prosecution files we don't have the data to go into actual details.\n You don't want to talk about Halliburton's role in the rape.\n Employer of alleged rapists. - possibly responsible due to some obective resopnsibility introdced by employment related law. Possible accessory to crime - subject to ndividual criminal charges. Neither is adresed by the bill directly\n You don't want to talk about Halliburton's actions in acquiring this alleged \"arbitration contract\".\n Arbitration admissibility issue has already been adressed.\n \n My position is already clear. \n Upon review, I still say so.\n \n Quote:\n Your posts are routinely devoid of specific mention of the facts of the case, cause you know that is the only way you can persuade somebody to pretend that Halliburton's position makes sense.\n I refuse to ignore the facts of the case. \n \n But you do ignore the law of the case. In the original sense of the word - ignoro: I do not know. At least I admit I don't know all the law applicable, just general legal principles universal to legal systems worldwide. YOU don't even show that intellectual honesty.\n I have yet to hear about the extent of foudit's knowledge of the law. I assume regular citizen's familiarity with his local law.\n \n Quote:\n Furthermore, if you REALLY want to see sensationalism, you should check out the right-wing's fervor regarding Obama being a \"socialist\"...\n Now THAT is \"sensationalism\"! \n Exactly. He may not deserve a nobel prize (yet, since he hasn't done anything), but labeling him socialist is ridiculous to anyone who knows socialism. I haven't seen anyone contest this here. \n\n \n All right, that should be all. If I missed anything, correct me - it was an hour's work. Sure hope it fits in one post... EDIT: HEY, it DID fit :)",

   "So even the scope of arbitration that is considered is limited. I really don't get it why do it this way. What is this doing in governement funding bills? If the courts cannot be expected to declare such clauses null and void on their own, why is this not a part of a worker protection law that would directly declare them void? Why LIMIT YOURSELF TO ONLY NOT HIRING THEM when the ATTEMPT ITSELF SHOULD BE ILLEGAL. I'm ASKING FOR MORE, but also more to the point. Really, it sounds like using a spanner to screw in a screw - you have much better tools to work with.\n\n I am bold-facing this not for your benefit, but for the benefit of those people \"clapping you on the back\" on the issue.\n I really don't think they've taken the time to read your statements and grasp your direction, because I see at least JPSartre12 is trying to beat a drum that is definitely NOT in this favor... emoticon_emb\n \n Quite frankly, I'll settle with what I can get right now.\n I would love to make the legislation wider reaching in scope (as I have already commented), but I am not holding my breath because WAYYY too often our legal system and legislature work to help business at the expense of the consumer / employee.\n \n \n \nI stand corrected then and was misled by your choice to keep article title as an endorsement. Especially with your own comment reproduced below:\n \n The above by me was sarcastic. Come on, are you kidding here? \"I just reproduced the title and don't necessarily agree with it! I think something else!\" Pull the other one, it's got bells on. I didn't misinterpret your point - you misstated it.\n\n 1) I moderate on another board that requires the article title to be copied as the thread title. It's used to help prevent misrepresentation of the article.\n \n 2) I really don't care how skeptical you are. You can look through my comments and check to see that I didn't repeat the title...\n Regarding what you quoted, emoticon_frazzled .\n You can't seriously pretend that the only interpretation of that is to support the article title unequivocably... emoticon_xdonno\n \n I have repeatedly held that such cases should be tried in a court of law. The Republicans are allowing companies to strong-arm employees, allowing them to keep these matters secret so employees don't know the real risk.\n That is inexcusable.\n \n \n \nFine. So you just pointed us to an article about an amendment that is aimed at these arbitration clauses but didn't consider it problematic.\n\n \"didn't consider it problematic\"?\n Which article are you referencing?\n \n \n \nWell, what is justice then? You think justice is money? A public trial? What is?\n\n Justice is a public trial, with appeal options available regardless of being able to prove EXTREME allegations like \"fraud\", with an impartial jury.\n Not a jury that is routinely picked by the defendant, which can blacklist other juries if they think they are decided against too often.\n \n Both the criminal issue and the civil issues are part of justice.\n \n \n \nWell, we're going by newspaper articles here, so we can hardly make an accurate analysis (when it comes to newspaper accuracy in matters of law, I assume out of experience that they're wrong or at least inaccurate :) ). But going by Court Okays Halliburton Rape Trial | Mother Jones (your article)\n So apparently now she can sue Haliburton, and we can wait for a verdict to see how the court system handles it. And it's obviously a civil law trial.\n\n And this court case will likely be the only court trial this woman will be able to get. As I pointed out, there will likely be no criminal charges on this gang-rape.\n \n \n \nBut you cited it ...\n\n No.\n I REPEATED the article title as the title of the thread.\n Like I stated, it's a simple acknowledgment of ACCURATE CITATION.\n \n Furthermore, just because I repeated it as part of a CITATION doesn't mean I automatically agree with it.\n I hit \"quote\" to reply to your stuff, but that doesn't mean you assume I agree with that, do you?\n \n \n \n...and went on to express incredulity that such a thing could happen, \"wow-just-wow\" style.\n\n \"such a thing\"???\n By \"such a thing\" are you automatically assuming that I have to be, with absolutely no margin of misinterpretation on your part, thinking that \"30 GOP Senators Vote to Defend Gang Rape\" has to be what I am incredulous about?\n \n You are refusing to admit how big of a leap that truly is... emoticon_emb\n I am talking about being incredulous that they would vote against this amendment.\n I have REPEATEDLY EXPLAINED MY STANDARDS as to why I am incredulous, and not once have I ever invoked \"defending gang-rape\" as my justification.\n \n You're trying a strawman argument here...\n \n \n \nSorry, but if it wasn't yours, you sure look like you adopted it, and it now looks like you are backing away from your early comments.\n\n The \"30 GOP Senators Vote to Defend Gang Rape\" was not my comment.\n The comment you want to quote was not being made in reference to that, although you keep pretending it was.\n \n \n \nI don't think I falsely represent it. If YOU misrepresented it and are backing away, fine. But sorry, \"Wow. Just wow. This is grotesquely inexcusable.\" is quite clear.\n\n Yeah.\n It's clear that I think something is \"grotesquely inexcusable\".\n REPEATEDLY now I have explained PRECISELY what I think is grotesquely inexcusable.\n \n \n \nWe don't have enough to work with to do an analysis of the specific case. We can only do our best with what we have available - and while I don't doubt the gist was caught, the sources are rather biased.\n\n When unable to prove speculation, some people often go with \"not enough information\" and accusations of \"bias\" to try and ignore what is actually available...\n \n \n \nI'll stand by my asessment of your posting style. Otherwise maybe we should make a rule like the election ads: I'm Iuris and I endorse this message type.\n\n People quote articles all the time.\n I often quote articles from the religious right in order to pick them apart.\n Doesn't mean I support the article I quoted.\n You obviously assume that quoting an article means unquestionable support of the claims therein. \n \n \n \nThe issues under #5 were not brought up in the discussion yet. I have stated, and I believe explained, why I believe they are more to the point and apply to the real life issue more closely. Those are MY priorities, not anyone elses, I just ask why people have other priorities.\n\n emoticon_emb\n And again, you are assuming the priorities that other people supposedly have...\n I honestly didn't know that there had been no, and could be no criminal charges in this case.\n That's why I hadn't posted info on criminal charges earlier.\n \n It's interesting how YOU claim it a priority, but you didn't even bother to comment on it before I posted.\n Which tells me one of two things.\n 1) You possibly didn't know about the criminal charge situation, which would leave your \"priority\" in a situation where it wasn't a priority until somebody else clued you in on the real situation.\n Which is funny that you would question MY prioritization when I was the one who cared enough to investigate and inform you... emoticon_emb\n \n 2) You possibly did know about the criminal charge situation, but never bothered to comment about how it needed to be fixed. Which would bring up a direct question as to how you can claim it as a priority of yours...\n \n \n \nI'll reviev all my complaints after lunch and see whether I dropped any.\n\n Obviously I was referencing your claim: \"There's my argument. None of it changed, only 5: has been added due to subsequent brief skim of the issue.\"\n \n For you to claim that you had just summarized your arguments when it was glaringly incomplete was problematic...\n \n \n \nI'll stand by the claim that foundit's posts did imply what I adress.\n\n Oh that's funny.\n Now I am just IMPLYING that I agree with the article's headline...\n I guess when you have such a weak claim in the first place, but you're obviously trying to put so much effort into trying to make this one aspect stick to me, it demonstrates where YOUR \"priorities\" truly lie... emoticon_emb",

   "In fairness to me, it is only one personal attack.\n\n So you admit it is a personal attack, and still you continue...\n At least recognizing the situation is the first step in addressing your problem.\n Now if you could just admit it is a problem... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nActually, I'm saying you think you are right you are obviously not.\n\n And I am saying that your \"obviously not (right)\" situation is simply you thinking I am wrong and insisting that I have to agree to your opinion.\n \n Like I said, if you want to revive that other thread and continue, we can.\n But as it was, it was a situation where you didn't believe the statements on what they alleged they saw, and I did.\n Not an \"obviously right\" or \"obviously wrong\" situation in the first place, although you insist on treating it like it is... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nNow you know why I cut my losses and stopped replying to him. \n\n Like I pointed out earlier, there were a variety of questions I was asking Iuris that the other poster was refusing to address...\n So stopping the reply would just formally be doing what was already in motion in the first place.\n \n And the same could be said of you, but at this stage I think it's just generally recognized that you're tossing out attacks and allegations that you can in no way substantiate...\n Just a demonstration of your frustration at getting your behind handed to you on multiple occasions... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n One could question why you don't follow your own advice.\n But it's a hypocrisy I've come to recognize in a variety of right-wing posters.\n Trying to advise other posters that they should stop talking to me, while at the same time those people giving the advice refuse to follow their own advice... emoticon_emb",
