All you have to do is point out that the ark itself could not have survived any sort of water. I'll post what I said in another thread for everyone here:\n \nA large wooden ship (as large as the ark) would break up. It is not due to the design. \n \n The basic limiting factor is the Modulus of Elasticity (stress/strain). Wood's limit tops out around 2,000,000 pounds per square inch. Steel is nearly 15 to 16 times that. With the weight of the cargo pushing down, and the water pressure pushing up, the wooden structure flexes 15 times as much as steel. The gaps between the planks would become huge, causing leaking and failure.\n \n Wood also absorbs water and loses strength. The nails fastening it together would undergo the flexing, creating holes that become wider and wider until they fall out. It might technically be possible to build a wooden ship as large as the ark, however, it would be filled entirely with internal structure to support it, and there would be no cargo space whatsoever.\n\n \n It might be possible to have a wooden ship the size of the ark, but you wouldn't be able to do anything with it.",

And what we say is that evolution is due to variation selection; we don't say any longer that it is due to mutation selection like we used to.\n \n Let's say you could stop the mutation process today. We could still have, potentially, evolution for 100s if not thousands of years because there's all the genetic variation in all the gene pools. You see, we've got 5 billion human individuals and, except for identical twins, they're all uniquely different. Through the recombination of existing gene pools, selection could go on 100s if not thousands of years even if you have no mutation. That's why it is important to distinguish between genetic variation and mutation. Thinking in terms of mutation is still a hangover of the old essentialist way of thinking: we had the previous essence, then we had the mutation, then there's the new essence. Since we had no previous essence, instead we had a variable population; it's completely misleading to talk so much about mutation.\n \n So do you like misleading people, electro-loser?

Merely saying that I'm wrong is what you always do, and you never back it up in any sense of sufficiency.\n \n \nSo do you like misleading people... ?\n\n Me? Let's take a look at what he says, in light of his views:\n \n \"... most genetic variation is produced by recombination and not by mutations.\"\n Here Mayr was talking about \"variation\" as different combinations of genes existing in the same individual, not new (i.e. previously nonexistent) or altered genes. He made this clear when he said, that \"[w]e could still have, potentially, evolution for 100s if not thousands of years because there's all the genetic variation in all the gene pools\" even if mutations were stopped. Mayr emphasized this more than most people probably would because of his profound appreciation for epistatic effects. \n \n My statement was in no way misleading, dishonest, or incorrect (except perhaps that I should have said anti-neoDarwinian instead of anti-Darwinian, despite the fact that sport throws around the latter in place of the former. Hell, Mayr was a major contributor to the modern synthesis). Mayr's explanation is in agreement with the standard modern definition of evolution: change in allele frequencies over generations. If the relative frequency of alleles for green eyes increases (or decreases, or reaches unity, or reaches extinction), that's evolution, and without mutation; surely nobody believes that everybody with an allele for green eyes obtained that allele via mutation. How that allele (and others arose), on the other hand, is not explained by recombination. Mayr goes on to say that these should be recognized as distinct; supersport seems to imply that Mayr thinks that mutations are evolutionarily unimportant.\n \n If sport would care to read any books by Mayr-- oh, who am I kidding? He'd never do that.",
