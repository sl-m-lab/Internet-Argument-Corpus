   "How many neocons does it take to screw in a light bulb?\n \n version1:\n \n None.\n \n Nothing is wrong with the light bulb; its conditions are improving every day.\n \n Any reports of its lack of incandescence are a delusional spin from the liberal media.\n \n That light bulb has served honorably, and anything you say undermines the lighting effect.\n \n Why do you hate freedom?\n \n \n \n version 2:\n \n 1. One to deny that a light bulb needs to be changed;\n \n 2. One to attack the patriotism of anyone who says the light bulb needs\n to be changed;\n \n 3. One to blame Clinton for burning out the light bulb;\n \n 4. One to arrange the invasion of a country rumored to have a secret\n stockpile of light bulbs;\n \n 5. One to give a billion dollar no-bid contract to Halliburton for the\n new light bulb;\n \n 6. One to arrange a photograph of Bush, dressed as a janitor,\n standing on a step ladder under the banner: Light Bulb Change Accomplished;\n \n 7. One administration insider to resign and write a book documenting\n in detail how Bush was literally in the dark;\n \n 8. One to viciously smear #7;\n \n 9. One surrogate to campaign on TV and at rallies on how George Bush\n has had a strong light-bulb-changing policy all along;\n \n 10. And finally one to confuse Americans about the difference between\n screwing a light bulb and screwing the country.",
