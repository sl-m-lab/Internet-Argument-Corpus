   "Jesus said \"I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh.' The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, 'How can this man give us his flesh to eat?'\" (John 6:51-52). \n \n The reason his disciples were stupefied was that they took his words literally. Jesus repeated this again, and he added \"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him\" (John 6:53-56). \n \n If Chirst was speaking metaphorically, he would have tried to clarify what he said. However, he did not. Plus, some could not accept this: \"After this, many of his disciples drew back and no longer went about with him\" (John 6:66). If it had all been a confusion, why didn't he call them back to straighten things out? This is the only record we have of Christ's followers forsaking him for doctrinal purposes.\n \n Finally, Paul himself confirms all this in his letters: \"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?\" (1 Cor. 10:16). \"Therefore whoever eats the bread and drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will have to answer for the body and blood of the Lord. . . . For any one who eats and drinks without discerning the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself\" (1 Cor. 11:27, 29).",

   "[QUOTE]\nOkay, can you give me specific evidence of how the Catholic Church contradicts the bible, because I can give you all the evidence that the Bible supports the existence of this church.\n\n \n \n Now we take the apostle Paul when he found certain disciples that were wonderful people. I believe they were saved, and yet they had not been baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, through they had been baptized (Acts 19). Paul passed through the upper coast of Ephesus; he finds certain disciples. And he said unto them,\" Have you receive the Holy Ghost since you believed.?\"\n \n And they said unto him , \" We don't know about the Holy Ghost, whether there be any Holy Ghost.\"\n \n He said, \" Then unto what were you baptized?\"\n \n \n They said, \" We've been baptized. John baptized us, the same man that baptized Jesus.\" That's a pretty good baptism.\n \n \n Watch this stern apostle though. He said, \" But John only baptized unto repentance,\" not for remission of sins, because the sacrifice had not been killed. And when they heard this, they were rebaptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit came upon them.\n \n \n So I believe that the pattern had been laid down. Every person in the Bible was baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ. Never one time was anybody ever baptized in the name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost. See? Never was anybody ever sprinkled; they were all immersed.\n \n \n Paul said in Galatians 1:8 , \" If a Angel from Heaven comes and preaches any other gospel than this I've preached unto you, let him be accursed. \n \n Excerpt by William Branham\n \n \n \n ** Does the R.C.C. dispute the teachings of Paul?\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs to your second point, sure, I am outraged that the church has not done a good job ensuring that children are safe. However, I think that the media has focused way too heavily on just the Catholic Church, since other Christian Churches have the same problems (which are often unreported by the media)\n\n \n \n You should be outrage, exspecially, since they have no intentions of ridding the church of paraphilic satanic priest, and I agree some other denominations are purposely putting paraphilic at the pulpit, but not as many as the R.C.C.",

How did the Church invent it if Jesus commanded it right there in scripture? How does the Catholic Church go against the teaching of Christ by baptizing in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost if it is found in scripture that Jesus himself commanded this?\n \n Then you say no apostles were baptized in this manner but is this scriptural?\n \n Do you think if Jesus commanded the apostles to go out and baptize in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit that they would not do so? You say that the apostles that \"followed the teachings of Christ\" were not baptized in titles. But if they were to follow the teaching of Christ then they would have to baptize others in this form as was commanded in Matthew 28:19. \n \n The other problem with this quote is that you imply that the Catholic Church was established in 300 A.D. when in actuality it was established in the time of Christ (Matthew 16:18). Your church on the other hand was not started until around 1913. That's a big gap from the time Christ was around. However, the heresy that your church promotes was condemned as sebelianism as far back as 217.\n \n \nI'm sure people have been baptized in the name of Santa Clause, and will still claim to follow Christ, look at our churchs, anyways, it's the spiritual baptism(ACTS) that get's one in Heaven\n \n \n I'm not making a wild, off-the-wall, hollow claim of following Christ. I'm not making up a name to be baptized in like Santa Clause. I am using THE names that Christ told us to use. Those who claim to follow Christ might want to look at Matthew 28:19  and make their claim valid. \n \n This \"rapture\" that you believe in, is this a scriptural name for the event?",

There is that revelation again.\n \n \n Excerpt by William Marrion Branham\n -Rev 1:5\n \n \n \n \nIn Luke 22:42  and the parallel passage in Matthew 26  why does Jesus say \"nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.\" Why does he not say, \"not my will but mine be done?\" \n\n \n If one did God's will are they not following Christ(God)? Christ pointing the disciple towards himself , his real self, a spirit\n \n \nJohn 14:23, \"Jesus answered him, 'If a man loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our   home with him.\" We and our denote distinct personalities.\n\n \n The Holy Spirit which is in Christ with those who love him\n \n \n I hope I helped some, I'm just a babe in learning, like I said, when I find more detail, which there definately is, I'll post. I have over 600 sermons of William Branham. I've only listen to approx 35 and haven't yet read all the Bible, but from my own spiritual experiences I met one God and one Satan.",

   "=maximus]I can think of one good reason. Jesus commanded it. Matthew 28\n\n \n \n \n He also stated unless a man be born again he can in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. I can be baptized in the Mississipi River under the name twinkle toes, but if I haven't received the spiritual conversion, no purgatory for me. Nothing but devil's and flames- peace\n \n \n \n \n \nFirst you say that there was no such thing as a name of \"Father, Son, Holy Ghost.\" So I show you that there is in scripture. \n\n \n Have you ever named a child FATHER, SON, OR HOLYGHOST? What about PHD or Gynacologist?\n \n \nYou say that everybody until 300 A.D. was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you say that the Catholic Church invented the practice of baptizing in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. How did the Church invent it if Jesus commanded it right there in scripture? How does the Catholic Church go against the teaching of Christ by baptizing in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost if it is found in scripture that Jesus himself commanded this?\n\n \n I guess they didn't understand Jesus Christ is NOT MARY\n \n \nThen you say no apostles were baptized in this manner but is this scriptural?\n\n \n I haven't found it. Let me know if you do\n \n \n \nDo you think if Jesus commanded the apostles to go out and baptize in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit that they would not do so? You say that the apostles that \"followed the teachings of Christ\" were not baptized in titles. But if they were to follow the teaching of Christ then they would have to baptize others in this form as was commanded in Matthew 28:19.\n \n \n They didn't because at least Peter( Rock) knew who Christ was. The Revelation was made known \n \n \nThe other problem with this quote is that you imply that the Catholic Church was established in 300 A.D. when in actuality it was established in the time of Christ (Matthew 16:18). Your church on the other hand was not started until around 1913. That's a big gap from the time Christ was around. However, the heresy that your church promotes was condemned as sebelianism as far back as 217.\n\n \n I don't really care when it was established and it's not my words, but I am curious what wicked Pope made up purgatory? Which century?\n \n \n \n \nI'm not making a wild, off-the-wall, hollow claim of following Christ. I'm not making up a name to be baptized in like Santa Clause. I am using THE names that Christ told us to use. Those who claim to follow Christ might want to look at Matthew 28:19  and make their claim valid.\n\n \n \n Just Pray about it, like I said before, without the conversion your going to HELL anyway \n \n This \"rapture\" that you believe in, is this a scriptural name for the event?\n\n \n Check out Revelations when the church is taken away before the tribulation.",

   "Dreamweaver,\n Do not take this as ingratitude. I appreciate your diplomacy. I try to dialogue and interact with all Christians (and all humans) as brothers in Christ (or brothers). In debate, however, I do not mind exchanging stern words (though keeping it civil). The apostles would do no less. \n \n Now, Galatians makes a good statement on the universality of the Church. It is \"equal opportunity.\" It accepts from any nation, race, or ethnic group. \n \n But I don't think your revision of Galatians would have been accepted. I do not think Paul would have allowed some of the doctrinal diversion that occurs today. John 10:16  says that there shall be one fold and one shepherd and Philemon 2:2 says to be of the same mind, united in heart, thinking one thing. Paul told us to beware of someone preaching another Christ. The problem with the approximately 33,000 denominations of Christianity is that the truth does not remain intact.

   "Rapture,\n \nHoly Ghost\n\n Can your preacher trace himself back to the authority granted by Christ himself?\n \n \nNo, sister in Christ\n\n You may want to read your Bible. Mary is the Queen of heaven and your mother, the mother of the Church, the mother of us all. Mary is the Mother of Salvation. Read the entire 12th chapter of Revelation . Who do you think \"brought forth a male child, one who is to rule all the nations?\" (Rev 12:5) \"Then the dragon went off to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and bear testimony to Jesus.\" (Rev 12:17) Do you keep the commandments and bear testimony to Jesus? If so, then you are Mary's child.\n \n \nWell when I get to heaven I'm not going to kick her in the eye or anything, nor make a statue and fall down on my knees before her\n\n \n Refer to the 4th commandment: Honor your father and your mother. Jesus was without sin as it says in Hebrews. Jesus kept the commandments perfectly. If Jesus kept the commandments then he honored his mother. Can anyone keep the commandments better then Jesus? Then how must he have honored his mother? Do you honor YOUR mother, Mary? \n \n Mary \"is blessed among women.\" Mary states also that \"ALL generations shall call me blessed.\" (Luke 1:48) Does our generation call her blessed? Blessed among women? Yes. Blessed among any human past, present, or future? Yes. Why do I say this? Because Jesus was not created, he was begotten. He was not a human creation. Mary, on the other hand, was a human creation. However, she had a more intimate union with God than any human has experienced and will ever experience. No one has been closer to God than Mary. She held God in her womb. Consider this quotation, \"I have long recognized the unique vocation of our Lady, called to the highest honor among all created beings. It is a fact of history that, if true honor  is not paid to her as the Mother of God, people put our Lord in her place as the highest of creation  rather than adoring him as God Incarnate.\" Rev. Msgr. Graham Leonard from The Path to Rome (emphasis mine). \n \n \nDo you believe that Mary has been the closest human to God in all of history past, present, and future?\n \n \nNo \n \n \n Mary is not only the mother of God but also the bride of God. It is written in scripture that the Holy Spirit overshadowed her. Mary was betrothed to God.\n \n Mary is the ark of the New Covenant. The Old Testament Ark is only a type. It is a type that prefigures the perfection and reality of the New Testament ark. Consider the following parallels:\n \n David rose and went up to the hill country of Judea. (2 Sam 6:2-4)\n Mary rose and went up to the hill country of Judea. (Luke 1:39)\n \n David asked, \"Who am I that the ark of the Lord should come to me?\" (2 Sam 6:9) \n Elizabeth asked, \"Who am I that the mother of my Lord should come to me? (Luke 1:43)\n \n The Ark stayed in the House of Obededom for 3 months. (2 Sam 6:11)\n Mary (the new ark) stayed in Elizabeth's house for 3 months. (Luke 1:56)\n \n David's response to the Ark was to leap and dance. (2 Sam 6:14)\n John the Baptist responded to Mary by leaping in his mother's womb (Luke 1:41)\n \n The tabernacle that housed the Ark was covered or overshadowed by the glory cloud and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. (Exodus 40:34-35)\n The Holy Spirit overshadowed Mary as told in the Annunciation. (Luke 1:35)\n \n The ark contained the Law/Lord of God in the Ten Commandments, the urn of manna, and the staff of the true priesthood of Aaron. (Deut 10:3-5, Heb 9:4)\n Mary contained the Law/Word of God in flesh, the bread of life, and the true priest. (Matthew 1:23, Luke 1:35, John 1:1, 14, John 6:31-33, Heb 3:1) \n \n Luke knew scripture! Do you know how sacred the Ark of the Covenant was in the Old Testament? If anyone but the high priest touched it or looked on it then they died (1 Samuel 6:19 and 2 Samuel 6:7)-a good reason that Joseph dared not touch the Ark of the New Covenant. Is it coincidence that John says he saw the ark of the covenant in Revelation 11:19  then he begins describing the portent of Mary? (based upon Mary: The Mother of God video from Steve Ray's Footprints of God series).\n \n Mary was the perfect disciple. She was stronger than Peter who denied Christ 3 times and the other apostles that fled at Christ's crucifixion. Her words show how willingly she followed God, \"Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.\" (Luke 1:38) Jesus gave her to the \"disciple whom he loved\" at the Cross. Why is he entrusting her to someone else's protection if he took her lightly? Why to the disciple whom he loved? Mary had an intimate relationship with the apostles as seen with her relationship with John and her presence with the apostles praying shortly after the death and appearance of Christ. (Acts 1:12)\n \n \nSure....but I know if I want sin forgiven I must Go before God, myself\n\n \n We ask Mary to intercede for us with her prayers. We ask her to pray to Jesus for us just as you ask someone here on earth to pray for you. Her ability to intercede is fact and can be seen in her intercession at the wedding of Cana. Jesus told her it was not his time but he ended up performing the miracle of turning water to wine at her request. This is concrete in scripture if you read 1 Timothy 2:1, \"First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men.\" This is written just before the line Protestants quote on the one mediator. Another concrete example of the acceptance of prayer for intercession can be found in Revelation 8:3 where it describes the prayers of saints being presented before God. So we ask the saints to pray for us. We do not pray to dead people because the saints are not dead, they are living in heaven.\n \n \nSo the devil's wash right off? Doesn't sound like a state of Grace durning Death\n\n \n Revelation 21:27, \"nothing unclean shall enter heaven\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 3:10-15  \"...each man's work will become manifest; for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done. If the work which any man has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward. If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.\"",

She held God in her womb.\"\n \n Your first paragraph doesn't have any meaning of why we should pray to Mary. Duh, we are supposed to honor our father and mother. Are we supposed to WORSHIP our father and mother? I think not. They are human and sinners. Mary was a SINNER. How about the verses Romans 3:10 and 3:23? ALL have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. That includes Mary, but does not include Jesus. Jesus was God in the flesh. Mary was not.\n \n Secondly, yes Mary IS blessed among women. I called her blessed. That was quite a blessing, but I am not going to pray to a sinner, regardless of how blessed they are. Why would you?\n \n Quote:\n \"Consider this quotation, \"I have long recognized the unique vocation of our Lady, called to the highest honor among all created beings. It is a fact of history that, if true honor is not paid to her as the Mother of God, people put our Lord in her place as the highest of creation rather than adoring him as God Incarnate.\" Rev. Msgr. Graham Leonard from The Path to Rome (emphasis mine).\"\n \n Heh, it isn't scripture buddy. Why should we even consider it truth then? Back it up with scripture, then talk to me.\n \n Quote:\n \"Mary is not only the mother of God but also the bride of God. It is written in scripture that the Holy Spirit overshadowed her. Mary was betrothed to God.\n Mary is the ark of the New Covenant. The Old Testament Ark is only a type. It is a type that prefigures the perfection and reality of the New Testament ark. Consider the following parallels:\n David rose and went up to the hill country of Judea. (2 Sam 6:2-4)\n Mary rose and went up to the hill country of Judea. (Luke 1:39)\n David asked, \"Who am I that the ark of the Lord should come to me?\" (2 Sam 6:9) \n Elizabeth asked, \"Who am I that the mother of my Lord should come to me? (Luke 1:43)\n The Ark stayed in the House of Obededom for 3 months. (2 Sam 6:11)\n Mary (the new ark) stayed in Elizabeth's house for 3 months. (Luke 1:56)\n David's response to the Ark was to leap and dance. (2 Sam 6:14)\n John the Baptist responded to Mary by leaping in his mother's womb (Luke 1:41)\n The tabernacle that housed the Ark was covered or overshadowed by the glory cloud and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. (Exodus 40:34-35)\n The Holy Spirit overshadowed Mary as told in the Annunciation. (Luke 1:35)\n The ark contained the Law/Lord of God in the Ten Commandments, the urn of manna, and the staff of the true priesthood of Aaron. (Deut 10:3-5, Heb 9:4)\n Mary contained the Law/Word of God in flesh, the bread of life, and the true priest. (Matthew 1:23, Luke 1:35, John 1:1, 14, John 6:31-33, Heb 3:1) \n \n Luke knew scripture! Do you know how sacred the Ark of the Covenant was in the Old Testament? If anyone but the high priest touched it or looked on it then they died (1 Samuel 6:19 and 2 Samuel 6:7)-a good reason that Joseph dared not touch the Ark of the New Covenant. Is it coincidence that John says he saw the ark of the covenant in Revelation 11:19 then he begins describing the portent of Mary? (based upon Mary: The Mother of God video from Steve Ray's Footprints of God series).\"\n \n Alright, here is where things get sticky. I'm not sure if Mary is the Ark of the New Covenant or not, but I do know one thing. Joseph did touch Mary and they did have children together. Check Matt. 13:55-56. Jesus had brothers and sisters. Also see Mark 6:3. And besides, what does it matter if Mary is the new Ark? Did the Jews pray to the Ark? Nope. They prayed to God.\n \n Quote:\n \"Mary was the perfect disciple. She was stronger than Peter who denied Christ 3 times and the other apostles that fled at Christ's crucifixion. Her words show how willingly she followed God, \"Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.\" (Luke 1:38) Jesus gave her to the \"disciple whom he loved\" at the Cross. Why is he entrusting her to someone else's protection if he took her lightly? Why to the disciple whom he loved? Mary had an intimate relationship with the apostles as seen with her relationship with John and her presence with the apostles praying shortly after the death and appearance of Christ. (Acts 1:12)\"\n \n First of all, lets get one thing straight. The verse is Acts 1:14, not Acts 1:12.\n Okay, now to your main points. So she didn't deny Christ like Peter did. Whoopdie do...did she sin even once? According to the book of Romans chapter 3 she did. That would mean she was going to hell like everyone else who sinned and had to accept Christ like everyone else to go to heaven. Was she blameless? No. If she was, she could have been crucified. Was she crucified for our sins? Thank goodness no. And besides, who cares if she had an intimate relationship with the apostles or not? Does that make her special? Special enough to pray to? I don't think so.\n \n Quote:\n \"We ask Mary to intercede for us with her prayers. We ask her to pray to Jesus for us just as you ask someone here on earth to pray for you. Her ability to intercede is fact and can be seen in her intercession at the wedding of Cana. Jesus told her it was not his time but he ended up performing the miracle of turning water to wine at her request. This is concrete in scripture if you read 1 Timothy 2:1, \"First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men.\" This is written just before the line Protestants quote on the one mediator. Another concrete example of the acceptance of prayer for intercession can be found in Revelation 8:3 where it describes the prayers of saints being presented before God. So we ask the saints to pray for us. We do not pray to dead people because the saints are not dead, they are living in heaven.\"\n \n True, Mary did intercede at the wedding. But let me ask you this? Should we pray to Jesus even? No. You were very close with 1 Timothy 2:1 to coming on to something very good. You should have looked down a few verses because right there in 1 Tim 2:5 it says, \"For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;\" Oh my. That sounds like only Jesus mediates for us in heaven. I noticed Mary isn't mentioned anywhere in that passage. Jesus Himself said in John 16:23 \"And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.\" So tell me this, if we can receive things directly from the father by praying TO THE FATHER, why waste time by praying to Mary and other saints (assuming we should)? In essence, you are saying that instead of asking the head of the company for a job, even though he guaranteed it to you, you would ask his son's mom to ask the son who would, in turn, ask his dad? That is just plain silly.\n \n Also, the prayers of the saints in Rev 8:3 being poured out is talking about the end times. I don't know about you, but I would rather have my prayers answered by God before I get raptured up, wouldn't you?\n \n Quote:\n \"Revelation 21:27, \"nothing unclean shall enter heaven\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 3:10-15 '...each man's work will become manifest; for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done. If the work which any man has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward. If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.' \"\n \n I don't really understand what you are trying to say here. Are you trying to say you can work your way into heaven? Ephesians 2:8-9 blows that right out of the water. \"For by grace are ye saved through FAITH...\" That seems pretty straight forward to me.\n \n Anyway, bottom line is that Mary is a human. Humans sin. Sinners go to hell unless they accept Christ. The Bible doesn't want us to pray to sinners. The only way we are made perfect is by accepting the free gift of salvation through Jesus Christ our Lord. And by the way, that guy was right when he said, \"Sure....but I know if I want sin forgiven I must Go before God, myself\" Check the scriptures. Romans 10:9, 14:11, Phil 2:11 just to name a few. YOU must confess that Jesus is the Son of God, that he died for YOUR sins, that he rose on the third day, and that YOU accept his perfect sacrifice of himself to cover YOUR sins. Unless you do that, you will die and spend an eternity in hell. There are plenty of people who think they can confess to a priest and do good things to get into heaven. Jesus said in Matt 7:22-23 \"Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?\n And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.\" They can't. If they live that way, they will die and spend eternity in hell. Only by accepting Christ can we have hope of eternal salvation. Think on that.\n \n One last issue. Mary statues. Two verses say that you should not make statues of Mary or Christ. Exodus 20:4-5.\n \n I will pray for you. I would appreciate any email form any of you that find this an encourgement or if you disagree totally. That is fine by me. I will disagree right back =). My email is killergerbil@hotmail.com. Thank you.",

   "So which traditions did they have back then? Infant baptism? No. Praying to Mary and the saints? No. Confession to a priest? No. The candle tradition? No. Confirmation? No. So which traditions do YOU think they were talking about friend?\n\n \n They had the Eucharist - see the Didache c.150AD. Most Protestant churches instead have just bread as a symbol. The first church was so adamant that it was the actual Body of Christ that many pagans accused them of being cannibals.\n \n Conversely, they lost some traditions, such as the prohibition on pork, preaching to the Gentiles, removing head-scarves from women and having women separated from the rest of the congregation - as Jesus empowered them to do.\n \n Infant Baptism...\n \"The first time the Gospel was ever proclaimed was on the day of Pentecost by the Apostle Peter. In his Spirit-inspired sermon he made it clear that the blessing and promise of salvation was not just for adults, but for children as well. \n \"And Peter said to them, 'Repent and let each of you be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is for you and your children, and for all who are far off as many as the Lord our God shall call to Himself \" (Acts 2:38,39). \n \n It is also interesting to note that this quote from Peter's Pentecostal sermon does not merely state \"... the promise is for you and children,\" but \"for you and your children,\" which makes it clear that the children mentioned here were young enough to still be considered under the protection and authority of their parents. This is underscored when one understands that it was common for women and men to marry at the very young ages of twelve and thirteen, respectively. From this it becomes reasonable to assume that these children to whom Peter refers were young juveniles or, at the very least, in their preadolescence. \"\n http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/articles/article7067.asp\n \n Whole households were baptised...\n \"Although this is only indirect Scriptural evidence, the fact that the Bible mentions that entire \"households\" were baptised does make it seem probable that children and infants were included. \"Now I did baptise the household of Stephanas . . . \" (1 Corinthians 1:16) (An angel spoke to Cornelius saying) \"Send to Joppa, and have Simon, who is called Peter, brought here; and he shall speak words to you by which you will be saved, and all your household \" (Later, when Peter arrived at (Cornelius' household) \"... he ordered them to be baptised.\"(Acts 11:13b, 14; Acts 10:48a) \"And when she (Lydia of Thyatira) and her household had been baptised . . . \" (Acts 16:15a) \"Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household . . . and immediately he was baptised, he and all his household. \" (Acts 16:31, 33b) We know that the Greek word oikos, translated \"house\" or \"household,\" has traditionally included infants and children in its meaning for several reasons. There is no evidence of this word being used either in secular Greek, Biblical Greek,or in the writing of Hellenistic Judaism in a way which would restrict its meaning only to adults. The Old Testament parallel for \"house\" carries the sense of the entire family. The Greek translation of the original Hebrew manuscripts (completed in 250 B.C.) uses this word when translating the Hebrew word meaning the complete family (men, women, children, infants). Similarly, we know that the phrase \"he and his house\" refers to the total family; the Old Testament use of this phrase clearly demonstrates this by specifically mentioning the presence of children and infants at times. \"\n Ibid.\n \n Praying to Saints \n \"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus.\" (Eph. 1:1 KJV) Here is St. Paul writing to the Ephesians. He calls them saints. At the end of the book of Ephesians (6:18-19), he tells these saints to pray for him: \"Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly.?\" (KJV) \"\n http://www.catholicism.org/pages/praying.htm\n \n Tertullian (211) \n Wrote that Christians offered prayer and the Eucharist for the deceased on the anniversaries of their death. \n St. Augustine (354 - 430) \n Neither are the souls of the pious dead separated from the Church, which even now is the Kingdom of Christ. Otherwise there would be no remembrance of them at the altar of God in the communication of the Body of Christ. \n http://www.catholicapologetics.org/ap070600.htm\n \n Confession to a priest? Maximus covered that in another post - confessing our sins to one another is Biblical.\n \n Candles come from Jewish tradition.\n \n Confirmation or Chrismation as we call it in Orthodoxy is the coming of the Holy Spirit. This is clearly in Acts... at the time of Pentecost.\n \n Perhaps you might want to re-think your statement.",

That doesn't mean anything however because the pagans obviously didn't know enough about it.\n \n Quote:\n \n \"Jesus was a Jew. He preached to Jews. The early Church made a decision to spread teachings beyond Jews - to Gentiles. This decision is in the Bible - there was a meeting in Jerusalem.

Check Matt 28:19.\n \n Quote:\n \n \"So, the infants were still baptised, whether they were able to understand it or not. You're not actually arguing against what I said at all. A moment ago you were arguing infant baptism was absolutely non-Biblical, now you're qualifying it.\"\n \n No, I was saying that you have to believe before you can get baptized. I quoted Acts 2:38. It says, \"Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.\" That means that baptism alone doesn't save you. The repenting factor is listed first. Without it, you have nothing. So what exactly would the point of baptising an infant be if they can't repent? You can't be forgiven without repentance. Infant baptism does nothing, and it can not be proven that Jesus and his diciples taught such things.\n \n Quote:\n \n \"So what? He asked the Saints to pray for him. Again you're not arguing against what I said, just presenting more evidence that agrees with me. Again you're now back-pedalling rather than admitting you were wrong to make a statement dealing with absolutes.\"\n \n He asked the LIVING saints to pray for him. He didn't pray to ask the saints in heaven to pray for him. Is it ever written in scripture that anyone asked the saints in heaven to pray for them? I can't seem to find it. Probably because it isn't in there.\n \n Quote:\n \n \"You are asked by Jesus to forgive your brother, not seven times, but seven times seventy times. I'm not sure if you're familiar with the Bible... if you want I can provide the verse.\"\n \n Yes, we are asked to forgive our brother. No, our brother does not have the power to cleanse us of our sins. Only the power of the blood of Jesus can do that. On a side note, why did you have to get insulting? I wasn't insulting your intelligence. Obviously I quoted more scripture than you have. The biggest time you used scripture was a quote from someone else. It wasn't even your work. And by the way, since you obviously don't know the chapter and verse of that scripture off hand, it is in Matt 18:22.\n \n Quote:\n \n \"Isn't it. Tell me why then.\" (talking about the Jewish candle tradition.)\n \n The Catholics light candles in honor of saints. The Jews never did that.\n \n Quote:\n \n \"Look at Pentecost.

Another case of looking at absolutes.\n \n I was not Baptised on my confirmation day.\"\n \n I am so gald you brought this point up. In Acts 19, they had been baptized wrongly. If you read it, they were baptised AGAIN in the correct fashion. I am even more happy that you brought up the thief on the cross. You don't actually need rituals to get you into heaven. There are verses that talk about salvation, but say nothing of baptism. The thief on the cross simply had faith in Christ and obviously turned from his sin, and that was enough to get him into heaven. Baptism in itself does not wash away sin. As I have said many times before, it takes repentance to be saved. Some of those verses I was talking about are 2 Thes:2:13, Romans 1:16, Romans 10:10, and 2 Tim 3:15. So thank you for siding with my point.\n \n Quote:\n \n \"I have.

I was not just \"rattling off facts,\" but rather I was quoting Biblical truths. And from this post, I believe they have helped my cause.\n \n Also, for you to say there is a weakness in the Bible shows me that I am probably wasting my time with you. God's Word says in 2 Tim 3:16-17, \"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:\n That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.\" It also states in 2 Peter 1:21, \"For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\" For you to say that there is a flaw in God's Holy Word is to say that God does not know what He is doing. And about your interpretation line, 2 Peter 1:20 says, \"Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.\" Your treasured \"holy tradition\" you can keep. For quite some time, the Catholic church threw people in prision and killed them for even reading the scriptures. That is because they knew that many scriptures went against their teachings. My church never did that. My church gets their beliefs from the Bible alone. I belive that God's word is much better than any men's \"holy traditions\" don't you? Or would you prefer to put man's words above God's? Either way it is your choice I guess. Snake handling is not scriptural, but women covering their heads is. Sadly, many women do not cover their heads when they pray like it says to in 1 Cor 11:5. Bottom line is that I should not be arguing with someone who believes that the Word of the Lord is fallible. And one other thing about the insults you threw in. For someone that is *** years of age, you have a lot of growing up left to do.\n \n Matt 7:6 and Romans 1:22.",

(You accept the Bible as presented to you by the Orthodox Church).\n\n \n The Didache pre-dates the compilation of the Bible. Further, you didn't address the claims made by pagans. It was common for them to criticise early Christians as cannibals... because they partook of the Eucharist\"\n \n \nWhich church would that be?\n\n \n There was only one church at that time. What church do you think it was?\n \n \nI would suppose that if I had never heard of communion and someone quoted Jesus saying this is my body, I would have some concerns also. That doesn't mean anything however because the pagans obviously didn't know enough about it.\n\n \n Of course they didn't understand it! That's why they accused the Christians of cannibalism! We're not cannibals, but we do take Christ's body. You too obviously don't know enough about it... which is why you reject Jesus' words to \"Do this in memory of Me\"\n \n \n\"Jesus was a Jew. He preached to Jews. The early Church made a decision to spread teachings beyond Jews - to Gentiles. This decision is in the Bible - there was a meeting in Jerusalem. They made the decision because they had the authority to do so.\"\n\n \n \nWrong. Jesus made the decision in the great commission. Check Matt 28:19.\n\n \n Err.. no, you're wrong here... Your interpretation of Matt 28:19 is different because of hindsight. If it was so clear to the Apostles then why in Acts would there be such heated debate over it? They may later have interpreted Jesus' words to mean what you do, but there was a huge argument over it... in a meeting in Jerusalem. The Jerusalem branch decided to continue converting Jews, whilst Paul was all for converting Gentiles, and Peter took a cautious middle-way. This was the first ecumenical meeting of Bishops. They gathered together to decide.\n \n Taking one verse out of the context of the experience of the early church will always bring your argument undone.\n \n \n\"So, the infants were still baptised, whether they were able to understand it or not. You're not actually arguing against what I said at all. A moment ago you were arguing infant baptism was absolutely non-Biblical, now you're qualifying it.\"\n\n \n \nNo, I was saying that you have to believe before you can get baptised. I quoted Acts 2:38. It says, \"Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptised every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.\" That means that baptism alone doesn't save you. The repenting factor is listed first. Without it, you have nothing. So what exactly would the point of baptising an infant be if they can't repent? You can't be forgiven without repentance. Infant baptism does nothing, and it can not be proven that Jesus and his disciples taught such things.\n\n \n Fact: A whole household could be baptised.\n Fact: Infants could be part of that group being baptised.\n Therefore you really do need to ask yourself about what it means to allow infants to be baptised... because obviously the Apostles did it!\n \n Start with Matthew 19:13-14\n \n The fact that most Protestant denominations also practice it seems to have escaped you.(http://www.sundayschoolcourses.com/baptism/baptism.htm)\n \n \"... she [Lydia] and the members of her household were baptised...\"\n (Acts 16:15)\n \n \"... immediately he [the jailer] and all his family were baptised.\"\n (Acts 16:33)\n \n \"... I [the apostle Paul] also baptised the household of Stephanas...\"\n (I Corinthians 1:16)\n \n Peter replied, \"Repent and be baptised, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for you and your children...\" (Acts 2:38-39)\n \n \n\"So what? He asked the Saints to pray for him. Again you're not arguing against what I said, just presenting more evidence that agrees with me. Again you're now back-pedalling rather than admitting you were wrong to make a statement dealing with absolutes.\"\n\n \n \nHe asked the LIVING saints to pray for him. He didn't pray to ask the saints in heaven to pray for him. Is it ever written in scripture that anyone asked the saints in heaven to pray for them? I can't seem to find it. Probably because it isn't in there.\n\n \n So? The Saints are still living! They are living with Christ.\n \n \n \n\"You are asked by Jesus to forgive your brother, not seven times, but seven times seventy times. I'm not sure if you're familiar with the Bible... if you want I can provide the verse.\"\n\n \n \nYes, we are asked to forgive our brother. No, our brother does not have the power to cleanse us of our sins. Only the power of the blood of Jesus can do that. \n\n \n Part of the reason for going to a priest is because (at least in Orthodoxy) he helps get to the bottom of things. Like people now go to a shrink (in Orthodoxy the priest is supposed to be a witness, not the one to forgive)\n \n \nOn a side note, why did you have to get insulting? I wasn't insulting your intelligence. \n\n \n It is a character fault with me. I don't mean to, but I always end rubbing people up the wrong way. All I can say is sorry.\n \n \nObviously I quoted more scripture than you have. The biggest time you used scripture was a quote from someone else. It wasn't even your work. And by the way, since you obviously don't know the chapter and verse of that scripture off hand, it is in Matt 18:22.\n\n \n Orthodoxy does not rely wholly on Scripture, I'm sort of having to work backwards to meet with you on common ground. I could quote heaps of things from Holy Tradition, but that'd be no good as you won't accept it\n \n Oh, and I have my Orthodox Study Bible with me during these debates, so I can just as easily find the verse.\n \n \n \n\"Isn't it. Tell me why then.\" (talking about the Jewish candle tradition.)\n\n \n \nThe Catholics light candles in honour of saints. The Jews never did that.\n\n \n This is news to me. I was a Catholic too!\n \n \n \"Look at Pentecost. They were not baptised then! They'd already been baptised. Look at Acts 19: Paul finds people who were baptised but hadn't even heard of the Holy Spirit!\n Dragging out a single passage won't help your cause. You've got to look at what was the rule and what was the exception - thus the thief on the cross was neither baptised nor confirmed, but still Jesus said that he was going to be with Jesus in heaven. Another case of looking at absolutes.\n I was not Baptised on my confirmation day.\"\n\n \n \nI am so glad you brought this point up. In Acts 19, they had been baptised wrongly. If you read it, they were baptised AGAIN in the correct fashion. I am even more happy that you brought up the thief on the cross. You don't actually need rituals to get you into heaven. There are verses that talk about salvation, but say nothing of baptism. The thief on the cross simply had faith in Christ and obviously turned from his sin, and that was enough to get him into heaven. Baptism in itself does not wash away sin. As I have said many times before, it takes repentance to be saved. Some of those verses I was talking about are 2 Thes:2:13, Romans 1:16, Romans 10:10, and 2 Tim 3:15. So thank you for siding with my point.\n\n \n Nice try. The thief on the cross, I believe I said, was an exception to the rule.\n \n If 'rituals' are meaningless, then all of Jesus' life is meaningless.\n \n He was born a Jew and died a practicing Jew.\n \n The very fact that he sacrificed His life (which is an 'act' or 'work') escapes many Protestants. He could well have just come to earth and asked for people to trust Him. But that was not enough! He performed works; miracles, and His ultimate sacrifice.\n \n \n \n\n \n \"I have. But, you should actually present an argument - rather than just rattling off facts... especially if they don't help your case.\n \n The problem is you are just taking verses out of the Bible wily-inly. I can, if I so desire do likewise. That is the weakness of the Bible - which is why it was never intended to be the only work to call upon. For when people interpret it for themselves, outside of the guides of Holy Tradition - the result is 100,000s of Christian churches. That is what is so wrong with the Protestant Churches - they present to the non-Christian world 'evidence' that Christianity has lost its way.\n \n Do you handle snakes? Do the women in your church cover their heads? It says to do so in the Bible.\"\n\n \n I note here you didn't mention the snakes, or the women covering their heads... if they do it in your church.\n \n \nYou last statements greatly sadden me, friend. I was not just \"rattling off facts,\" but rather I was quoting Biblical truths. And from this post, I believe they have helped my cause.\n \n Also, for you to say there is a weakness in the Bible shows me that I am probably wasting my time with you. God's Word says in 2 Tim 3:16-17, \"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:\n That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.\" It also states in 2 Peter 1:21, \"For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\" For you to say that there is a flaw in God's Holy Word is to say that God does not know what He is doing. And about your interpretation line, 2 Peter 1:20 says, \"Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.\" Your treasured \"holy tradition\" you can keep. For quite some time, the Catholic church threw people in prison and killed them for even reading the scriptures. That is because they knew that many scriptures went against their teachings. My church never did that. My church gets their beliefs from the Bible alone. I believe that God's word is much better than any men's \"holy traditions\" don't you? Or would you prefer to put man's words above God's? Either way it is your choice I guess. Snake handling is not scriptural, but women covering their heads is. Sadly, many women do not cover their heads when they pray like it says to in 1 Cor 11:5. Bottom line is that I should not be arguing with someone who believes that the Word of the Lord is fallible. And one other thing about the insults you threw in. For someone that is  ***  years of age, you have a lot of growing up left to do.\n \n Matt 7:6 and Romans 1:22.\n\n \n I didn't say there was a flaw in God's Holy Word. You're putting words in my mouth. I said that the flaw lies in looking at only the Bible.\n \n If you have a picture of the Mona Lisa, you don't just look at the signature (a word) you need to look at the whole picture. God gave you His Church. The same Church that produced the Bible had already produced a number of books, such as the Didache, the Epistles of Clement of Rome, and Ignatius of Antioch. The Church is offering all these to you, and you come along, pick up one book and say \"No, thanks, I'll just read this one by myself\", and then you also turn around and despise the people who gave you the book. If the Church did try and prevent people interpreting Scripture for themselves, you must be aware of the dangers.\n \n I can go to several web-sites run by Muslims who will use singular quotes from Scripture to give evidence that Muhammad was predicted by Christians! Anyone, I repeat anyone can wily-inly quote from the Bible.\n \n Why, just take a moment to ask yourself this, why are there continuing fractures in Christianity? Every day more and more churches appear. Where did Paul say \"You have faith in Jesus, now go and worship in your own way - because the type of worship you practice is meaningless'?\n \n You have me at a disadvantage when you talk about 'your church' because I don't know which church it is, therefore when you make blanket statements attacking Catholicism (which remember, I'm not a Catholic) and then say your church never did such and such, how do I know?\n \n Anyway, I've seen how a person from your church is prepared to mis-use information, both Biblical and personal!",

   "Well, buddy, I read Rev Chapter 12, and guess what? I believe it talks about Mary too. One problem with your thinking. No where does it say that anyone prayed to Mary, or that Mary prayed for anyone else. Isn't that interesting?\n \n Your first paragraph doesn't have any meaning of why we should pray to Mary. Duh, we are supposed to honor our father and mother. Are we supposed to WORSHIP our father and mother? I think not. They are human and sinners. Mary was a SINNER. How about the verses Romans 3:10 and 3:23? ALL have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. That includes Mary, but does not include Jesus. Jesus was God in the flesh. Mary was not.\n\n \n Stro,\n You have some misconceptions of Catholic teaching. I'm sure it is not your fault. You have probably learned this from someone else who has their own misconceptions. Catholics DO NOT WORSHIP Mary. You must understand that when one says \"pray to\" it is only a figure of speech. We are actually asking those in heaven (and on earth) to pray for us as Paul instructed. We are joined with those who have gone from the physical world before us by the union of the mystical body of Christ as revealed in scripture. My comments below will further illustrate these ideas. \n \n But first, I must ask, why did you say you would pray for me? \nI will pray for you. I would appreciate any email form any of you that find this an encourgement or if you disagree totally. That is fine by me. I will disagree right back =). My email is killergerbil@hotmail.com. Thank you\n\n Are you trying to mediate and take the role of Christ? Why do I need your prayers if I have confessed my belief? Why are you trying to get between me and God?\n \n Well, in actuality you are doing the right thing in praying for me because scripture shows us this (Romans 15:30, Colossians 4:3, 1 Thessalonians 5:25, 2 Thessalonians 1:11, 3:1, Ephesians 6:18-19). You are not doing anything wrong. You are not trying to take Jesus' place. You are trying to intercede in a different way. The same thing goes for Catholics. Again, my comments below will further elaborate on this.\n \n Yes, there is one mediator. No one gets to the Father except through Jesus. But we can intercede for others in the body of Christ, we can pray for them, and God hears our prayers (Revelation 5:8). \n \n 1 Timothy 2:1, \"First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, godly and respectful in every way. This is good and it is acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.\" \n \n What did Paul mean by asking men to make prayers, intercessions, and supplications? \n \n Why can we intercede? Because we have been given the grace and knowledge of God through his son Jesus...because we are \"children of God, and if children, then heirs, heirs of God, FELLOW heirs with Christ, provided that we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.\" (Romans 8:16-17) \n \n Why? Because \"we are ambassadors of Christ, God making his appeal through us...Working together with him, then, we entreat you...\" (2 Corinthians 5:20 and 6:1) \n \n Why? Because Christ told us to take up our cross and follow him. We can participate in redemptive suffering and intercession because Christ has granted us this power by his all sufficient sacrifice and through baptism he has joined us to his body. (Colossians 1:24) \n \n This is the way Catholics intercede--as Paul intended, as Christ commanded. Our intercession takes away nothing from the glory of Christ.\n \n Furthermore,\n \n We do not pray to dead people. Our God is a God of the living, not of the dead. (Mk 12:26-27, Luke 16:19-30, luke 23:43, Mk 9:4). We are promised eternal LIFE. Do not forget the living presence of Elijah and Moses at the Transfiguration. And the elders in Revelation were living souls in heaven. They were not dead. They were not angels because the angels were mentioned separately. Who were they? Unless there is a species besides humans and angels that we have not heard of, then this seems to be evidence that human souls live and are in action in heaven. Remember also that we are united in the mystical body of Christ as believers.\n \n Now, it is true that the saints mentioned in Revelation are the living Christians on earth. But their prayers are submitted to God nonetheless. Why do they pray? They petition God, as Paul tells us to do (Rom 15:30, Col 4:3, 1 Thess 5:25, 2 Thess 3:1, Eph 6:18,19, 1 Tim 2:1-7). So, their prayer is intercessory whether they are asking the ones in heaven to pray for them or whether they are praying to God themselves. Even if they ask God for something for themselves they are interceding. This shows that we can take action in prayer and petition God. The fact that Paul asks us to intercede for others and the fact that there are animated human souls in heaven presents the implication that we may ask those in heaven for prayers just as we ask those on earth to pray for us. This also tells us something of the nature of intercession. We can intercede for one another without taking any of the glory away from the mediation of Christ. This is what Catholics do. When it is said that we pray \"to\" saints this is perhaps a misleading choice of words. In reality, Catholics ask the saints for their prayers so that they may intercede for us. Paul understood this, Catholics understand it.\n \n \nHeh, it isn't scripture buddy. Why should we even consider it truth then? Back it up with scripture, then talk to me.\n\n \n This is a dangerous statement--that there is no truth outside of scripture.\n \n \nAlright, here is where things get sticky. I'm not sure if Mary is the Ark of the New Covenant or not, but I do know one thing. Joseph did touch Mary and they did have children together. Check Matt. 13:55-56. Jesus had brothers and sisters. Also see Mark 6:3. And besides, what does it matter if Mary is the new Ark? Did the Jews pray to the Ark? Nope. They prayed to God.\n\n \n You may be interested in the other threads \"Theotokos\" and \"Calvinism.\" We are having a debate on the topic you bring up.\n \n \nTrue, Mary did intercede at the wedding. But let me ask you this? Should we pray to Jesus even? No. You were very close with 1 Timothy 2:1 to coming on to something very good. You should have looked down a few verses because right there in 1 Tim 2:5 it says, \"For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;\" Oh my. That sounds like only Jesus mediates for us in heaven. I noticed Mary isn't mentioned anywhere in that passage. Jesus Himself said in John 16:23 \"And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.\" So tell me this, if we can receive things directly from the father by praying TO THE FATHER, why waste time by praying to Mary and other saints (assuming we should)? In essence, you are saying that instead of asking the head of the company for a job, even though he guaranteed it to you, you would ask his son's mom to ask the son who would, in turn, ask his dad? That is just plain silly.\n\n \n \"If we can receive things directly from the father by praying TO THE FATHER\" then why would you waste your time offering to pray for me?\n Why can't I get what I need myself? Your passage also seems to say in the beginning that we shouldn't pray to Jesus and then later that we should. Can you clarify your meaning? \n \n \nAnyway, bottom line is that Mary is a human. Humans sin. Sinners go to hell unless they accept Christ. The Bible doesn't want us to pray to sinners. The only way we are made perfect is by accepting the free gift of salvation through Jesus Christ our Lord. And by the way, that guy was right when he said, \"Sure....but I know if I want sin forgiven I must Go before God, myself\" Check the scriptures. Romans 10:9, 14:11, Phil 2:11 just to name a few. YOU must confess that Jesus is the Son of God, that he died for YOUR sins, that he rose on the third day, and that YOU accept his perfect sacrifice of himself to cover YOUR sins. Unless you do that, you will die and spend an eternity in hell. There are plenty of people who think they can confess to a priest and do good things to get into heaven. Jesus said in Matt 7:22-23 \"Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?\n And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.\" They can't. If they live that way, they will die and spend eternity in hell. Only by accepting Christ can we have hope of eternal salvation. Think on that.\n\n \n You seem to refute yourself in this paragraph. You seem to imply that one need only profess his faith and he will be accepted into heaven and the you state that Jesus will not accept those who simply call on his name for salvation. You use a verse that supports the idea that faith and works are necessary to support a faith alone position. Look at Matthew 7: 21  just before the verse you quoted, \"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord' shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will   of my Father who is in heaven.\" Calling on the Lord is not enough. Look also at Matthew 25: 31-46  to see what Jesus requires of us.\n \n What do you think of these verses in relation to confession to a priest? John 20: 22-23\n \n Now, we disagree on Mary's sinfulness (not on the fact that she was saved by Christ) and the idea that Catholics participate in idol worship but for the sake of brevity I will take up these issues at another time.\n \n Peace.",

   "Stro,\n Let me just give you a couple of things to consider without getting too deep concerning Exodus 20:4-5:\n \n 1. Check out Exodus 25:18-19, 1 Kings 6:23-29, and 1 Kings 7:25-45. Aren't the cherubim described a \"likeness\" of that which is \"in heaven?\" What does God mean when he says in Exodus 20:4-5 that we can't make any images of things in earth or sea?

We are joined with those who have gone from the physical world before us by the union of the mystical body of Christ as revealed in scripture. My comments below will further illustrate these ideas.\"\n \n I know that you do not worship Mary. The line where I said that we don't \"WORSHIP our parents\" was actually not what I meant. What I meant to say was, \"Should we pray to our parents?\" I don't believe we should.\n \n Quote:\n \n \"But first, I must ask, why did you say you would pray for me? \n Quote:\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n I will pray for you. I would appreciate any email form any of you that find this an encourgement or if you disagree totally. That is fine by me. I will disagree right back =). My email is killergerbil@hotmail.com. Thank you\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Are you trying to mediate and take the role of Christ? Why do I need your prayers if I have confessed my belief? Why are you trying to get between me and God?\n \n Well, in actuality you are doing the right thing in praying for me because scripture shows us this (Romans 15:30, Colossians 4:3, 1 Thessalonians 5:25, 2 Thessalonians 1:11, 3:1, Ephesians 6:18-19). You are not doing anything wrong. You are not trying to take Jesus' place. You are trying to intercede in a different way. The same thing goes for Catholics. Again, my comments below will further elaborate on this.\n \n Yes, there is one mediator. No one gets to the Father except through Jesus. But we can intercede for others in the body of Christ, we can pray for them, and God hears our prayers (Revelation 5:8). \n \n 1 Timothy 2:1, \"First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, godly and respectful in every way. This is good and it is acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.\" \n \n What did Paul mean by asking men to make prayers, intercessions, and supplications? \n \n Why can we intercede? Because we have been given the grace and knowledge of God through his son Jesus...because we are \"children of God, and if children, then heirs, heirs of God, FELLOW heirs with Christ, provided that we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.\" (Romans 8:16-17) \n \n Why? Because \"we are ambassadors of Christ, God making his appeal through us...Working together with him, then, we entreat you...\" (2 Corinthians 5:20 and 6:1) \n \n Why? Because Christ told us to take up our cross and follow him. We can participate in redemptive suffering and intercession because Christ has granted us this power by his all sufficient sacrifice and through baptism he has joined us to his body. (Colossians 1:24) \n \n This is the way Catholics intercede--as Paul intended, as Christ commanded. Our intercession takes away nothing from the glory of Christ.\n \n Furthermore,\n \n We do not pray to dead people. Our God is a God of the living, not of the dead. (Mk 12:26-27, Luke 16:19-30, luke 23:43, Mk 9:4). We are promised eternal LIFE. Do not forget the living presence of Elijah and Moses at the Transfiguration. And the elders in Revelation were living souls in heaven. They were not dead. They were not angels because the angels were mentioned separately. Who were they? Unless there is a species besides humans and angels that we have not heard of, then this seems to be evidence that human souls live and are in action in heaven. Remember also that we are united in the mystical body of Christ as believers.\"\n \n Yes, we do have eternal life in heaven, but there aren't any scriptures that even mention the believers that have passed on into heaven hearing our prayers. Whenever a disciple asked for prayer, did he also ask people to ask the expired believers for prayer? No, they didn't. It still doesn't answer where in scripture you find that those in heaven can even hear our prayers. He always asked the believers still living on this earth. Don't you find that a little strange?\n \n Also, about me praying for you, it follows two different paths. I am praying that if what I say is true, that God would show you this, BUT, I also pray that if I am wrong, that you would display the power and authority through scripture to show me the error of my ways. I hope you don't mind that.\n \n Quote:\n \n \"This is a dangerous statement--that there is no truth outside of scripture.\"\n \n How so? It seems to me that if you followed everything in scripture to the letter (which I fail to) that everything would be perfect because the Bible is, after all, God's Holy Word.\n \n Quote:\n \n \"\"If we can receive things directly from the father by praying TO THE FATHER\" then why would you waste your time offering to pray for me?\n Why can't I get what I need myself? Your passage also seems to say in the beginning that we shouldn't pray to Jesus and then later that we should. Can you clarify your meaning?\"\n \n We can get things by praying to the Father. The Bible says so. And, as you said before (and I am agreeing with you), the prayers of others help. But that still raises the question of the scriptures talking about praying to those who are already in heaven. I am saying that we ask the Father (not Jesus) for things in Jesus' name. And then the Bible tells us we can get it. Does that help clarify?\n \n Quote:\n \n \"You seem to refute yourself in this paragraph. You seem to imply that one need only profess his faith and he will be accepted into heaven and the you state that Jesus will not accept those who simply call on his name for salvation. You use a verse that supports the idea that faith and works are necessary to support a faith alone position. Look at Matthew 7: 21 just before the verse you quoted, \"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord' shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.\" Calling on the Lord is not enough. Look also at Matthew 25: 31-46 to see what Jesus requires of us.\"\n \n Which verse supported salvation by works and faith? I don't recall using one of those. What I believe that verse in Matthew is saying is that many will say that they did all kinds of good works in the world, and the Father has to say that he never knew them because they never accepted His Son. I believe that working iniquity means that they did the works to try to get themselves into heaven. The Bible clearly states how easy it is to get into heaven. Romans 10:9 is just one of many examples of this. Ephesians 2:8-9 is another.\n \n Quote:\n \n \"What do you think of these verses in relation to confession to a priest? John 20: 22-23\"\n \n I think they are very vague and do not support that very well.\n \n I will look forward to your next responses.",

   "Stro,\n Let me just give you a couple of things to consider without getting too deep concerning Exodus 20:4-5:\n \n 1. Check out Exodus 25:18-19, 1 Kings 6:23-29, and 1 Kings 7:25-45. Aren't the cherubim described a \"likeness\" of that which is \"in heaven?\" What does God mean when he says in Exodus 20:4-5 that we can't make any images of things in earth or sea? Can we not have artwork, pictures? He is clearly outlawing worship of these images as a god--idolatry. He is not outlawing the images themselves. He is seeking to prevent a golden cow.\n \n 2. Have you ever watched a Passion Play/Christmas Pageant? Have you ever watched a movie about Jesus where an actor portrayed him? Did you think that you were doing anything wrong? Yet, was not an image of God portrayed?\n\n \n I do believe we can have artwork, but we should not worship it, like you said. I think that the statues of Mary and the Crucifixes are very misleading because they are most likely not what they looked like at all. Why would you have these then if not to worship them? I have heard a lot of catholics that actually DO worship them. I don't believe something should be placed in a church when the image it portrays is false. Jesus did not have a little trickle of blood on His head and that was pretty much (other than the spear wound) the only damage that could be seen. Look at the crucifixion story. You couldn't even tell He was human when they were done with Him. Why then do you place a false Christ at the front of your church? I don't understand why exactly you need them.\n \n In answer to Number 2, I don't believe anyone is worthy to act on behalf of Christ. I don't think we should. It seems to me as almost \"playing God\" if you will. I sure wouldn't do it.\n \n Just some thoughts.",

We also venerate the material objects through which our salvation is effected -- the blessed wood of the Cross, the Holy Gospel, Holy Relics of Saints, and, above all, the Most-Pure Body and Blood of Christ, which have grace-bestowing properties and Divine Power. Orthodox Christians do not venerate an Icon of Christ because of the nature of the wood or the paint, but rather we venerate the inanimate image of Christ with the intention of worshipping Christ Himself as God Incarnate through it.\"\n http://www.ocf.org/OrthodoxPage/reading/catechism.html",

Some have written commentary... or argument rather than a statement.\n \n \nAnd besides, they had the living apostles to guide them back then, and during that period they were writing down scripture.\n\n \n Not quite, the Apostles were long dead when the Bible was compiled. The Bible was compiled about 300 years after the fact.\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/\n gives a partial list of the books that the church had to work with. Some were written by the genuine article. Some were not. How to decide which ones? They used Holy Tradition.\n \n \nBe carefuly about your holy tradition also. \n\n \n I've no idea what this means.\n \n \nAt that time there were many churches that were teaching false doctrines and doing things wrong. That is why Paul had to write so many letters. No one seemed to be getting it right.\n\n \n Indeed Paul never said \"Go, you have faith, that is enough!\" He was always calling them back into line. I agree with you on this.",

Thus, we conclude the bible through Holy Tradition- the writings of early Christians.\n\n \n Just as one person can find a number of passages of the Bible to do with faith alone, I can find a great many that deal with the importance of both faith and works (see below).\n \n The problem then remains ... \"Who is right?\"\n \n \"It is important to understand that Scripture is, in and of itself, \"Of the Church.\" The final Canon of the New Testament, as we have it today, was approved in AD 397 by the Church and no other. For every Book of the New Testament that was accepted, one or another was rejected.\n http://www.unicorne.org/orthodoxy/articles/alex_roman/faithandworks.htm\n \n Thus I look to the early Church. I don't just read the Bible, I try to get inside the minds of the people who wrote it. There are other books that they wrote... the easiest collection you can find is \"Early Christian Writings\" in Penguin Classics.\n \n \n \"Among these books is the Epistle of St James. James states quite emphatically in the second chapter, beginning with verse 24: \"Ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only . . . For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.\" In verse 14, this is what James has to say as well: \"What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?\"\n (Ibid)\n \n \n \n \"What good is faith without works?\n James 2:14-26\n What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? Can faith save him? If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto them, \"Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled;\" notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit? Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. Yea, a man may say, \"Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.\" Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way? For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.\n We must avoid sin.\n Hebrews 10:26\n For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins.\n \"Earning\" forgiveness.\n James 5:20\n Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.\n We must do the will of God.\n Luke 6:46\n And why call ye me, \"Lord, Lord,\" and do not the things which I say?\n Matthew 7:21\n Not every one that saith unto me, \"Lord, Lord,\" shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.\n Matthew 19:16-21\n And, behold, one came and said unto him, \"Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?\" And he said unto him, \"Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.\" He saith unto him, \"Which?\" Jesus said, \"thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\" The young man saith unto him, \"All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?\" Jesus said unto him, \"If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.\"\n 1 Timothy 5:8\n But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.\n Hebrews 12:14\n Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:\n We must strive to win salvation.\n 1 Corinthians 9:24-27\n Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.\n Luke 13:24\n Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.\n Works have merit.\n Philippians 2:12\n Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.\n 2 Corinthians 5:10\n For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.\n Rom 2:5-10,13\n But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; who will render to every man according to his deeds: To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life: But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified).\n Rom 3:31\n Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\n Matthew 25:32-46\n And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, \"Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.\" Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, \"Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?\" And the King shall answer and say unto them, \"Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\" Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, \"Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.\" Then shall they also answer him, saying, \"Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?\" Then shall he answer them, saying, \"Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.\" And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.\n Galatians 6:6-10\n Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.\n 1 Timothy 6:17-19\n Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.\n Revelations 22:12\n And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.\n We must keep the commandments.\n 1 John 2:3-4\n And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He that saith, \"I know him,\" and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.\n 1 John 3:24\n And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.\n 1 John 5:3\n For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.\n http://www.globalserve.net/~bumblebee/ecclesia/solafide.htm",

Lewis, Dallas Willard, Bill Thrall, Nouen, tolstoy, and many others. They have assisted me and enlightened me. But scriptures are inspired. God breathed. I do not believe that is true of tradition.

   "I don't actually know what the church believes. I only report what was stated in various other threads with montalban.\n \n Montalban, if Parcum is representing you correctly please advise. if not also please advise. I thought it was clear that you believed tradition equally with scripture.\n \n Parcum: What about the argument that scripture was canonized through tradition and that tradition was superior as to this? What is your take on that. Again, I repeat an argument from another thread.\n\n \n Tradition is the Bible as best understood. This is something I've stated before.\n \n Parcum has touched upon this now when he said that people can read a passage of the Bible but need guidance. Without guidance, you get 100,000s of different Christian groups each saying \"we are right; we base our beliefs on the Bible\"\n \n In a sense Tradition is superior, in that it generated the Bible, and is older. But Tradition does not contradict the Bible. Tradition has also said that the Bible is the pinnacle of our Holy Books.\n \n Look at the 'Doctrine of the Trinity'. This was developed after the 12 Apostles moved on. It has its roots in the Bible. Using the Bible, we could have argued that God created Jesus.\n \n Or another argument that Jesus was not corporeal, but a phantom, because Arians claimed that God couldn't actually 'suffer' on the cross.\n \n If you believe in the Trinity, as existing co-eternally, and that Jesus was both Man and God together then you are accepting the Bible as interpreted through Holy Tradition.\n \n I agree with Parcum and not Maximus that Holy Tradition in the Catholic Church has changed.\n \n In Orthodoxy, we keep to the same Divine Liturgy as written in the 300s. In a Catholic Church there is probably musical instruments that accompany the chanting - or actually, Catholics don't so much chant anymore as sing. Catholics don't think it is an issue to have liturgical consistency, and neither do most Protestants. Thus on any particular Sunday you can go to any Catholic Church and hear a different service from the one down the road. Not so with Orthodoxy. For a particular date, the Liturgy is the same throughout the Orthodox world. And certainly we don't jump up and down in ecstasy as many Chaismatics do.\n \n We believe we keep to the ways of worship as first developed.\n \n \n \n \n \n Go m\u00e9ada\u00ed Dia th\u00fa!

Actually and more importantly he agrees with the Church which is the duty of any Catholic. And everything I have stated is in submission to the Church. Tradition cannot \"change\" being that it is part of the revelation of God. It can develop however. (Tradition--\"the Church's lived understanding of the deposit of faith, handed on faithfully and completely from one generation of Christians to the next.\" Pat Madrid)\n \n You are mistaken if you think that Catholics do not believe in liturgical consistency. There are several rites but all of the essentials are preserved. What you have seen in modern Catholicism is liturgical abuse and priests taking free reign to change liturgy when they have no legitimate power to do so. This stems from misinterpretation and distortion of Vatican II. A \"reform\" of the \"reformed\" liturgy is under way.",

   "Why does the Catholic Church seek to destroy Orthodoxy?\n\n \n A very good question :)\n \n (I had hoped to spur debate - but none's forth coming hence more releasing of cats amongst pigeons here...)\n \n The Catholic Church argues very doggedly on a number of issues\n \n a) a celibate clergy\n b) the filioque controversy*\n \n A number of Catholics will argue quite convincingly why their Church holds to these ideas.\n \n However, the Roman Catholic Church wanted to woo Orthodox Christians away. They offered them protection from the Turks and in order to sweeten the deal, allowed these groups to continue on with their own forms of worship.\n \n Thus the Maronite Catholic Church, the Greek Catholic Church, the Ukrainian Catholic Church and others were born.\n \n They all allow a married clergy, and they say the Creed in its original form - without the filioque. Even when the Pope pays visit to one of these churches, the Eastern Liturgy is used - so the Pope says the Creed in the original manner.\n \n Thus Catholic arguments fall through, because they are willing to make exceptions to their rulings - in order to undermine the Orthodox faith.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n *The Nicene Creed - a statement of what we believe, was drawn up in the 300s. One line states... \"We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and giver of life... who proceeds from the Father.\"\n \n Some centuries later, the western churches (Roman ones) added to this line. After \"Father\" they added \"and the Son\" (in Latin this is Filioque). This suggests that the Holy Spirit proceeds from two sources which is theologically flawed. Further, the decision to add to the sentence was done out of the context of an eccumenical meeting.",
