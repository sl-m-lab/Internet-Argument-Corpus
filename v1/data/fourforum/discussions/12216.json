   "While the choice of [Bishop Gene Robinson] may be designed to placate angry liberals, the irony of it isn't lost on religious conservatives. The ballyhoo over Pastor Warren's selection was in large part because he was \"divisive\" in supporting Prop 8. Yet if there was ever a pastor whose actions were divisive it was Gene Robinson who almost single handedly devastated one of America's oldest Christian denominations. Robinson's confirmation in 2003 as the first openly gay Bishop shattered the once-conservative Episcopal Church and created a painful split between the liberal leadership and faithful Anglicans that cost it hundreds of thousands of followers. Robinson says, \"I believe in my heart that the church got it wrong about homosexuality.\" This view, which he emphasized in at least three private meetings with Obama, may be reflective of the next president's ideology, but it's far from mainstream. While liberals may not appreciate Warren's position on marriage, a majority of voters happen to agree with him. Far more states--including California--have banned counterfeit marriage than have ratified it.\n\n Family Research Council\n \n You just gotta love the mentality of the anti-gay...\n So a pastor who supports REMOVING A RECOGNIZED GAY RIGHT is not \"divisive\".\n A pastor whose nomination is a sign of ENDING DISCRIMINATION is supposedly divisive.\n \n Just think about how that works!\n If you had a club traditionally (and exclusively) lead by WHITES, and then somebody introduces a BLACK leader, where would the REAL SOURCE of the divisiveness truly come from?\n From the RACISTS of course, who can't stand the thought of a black leader...\n \n Likewise here. When you have an organization traditionally run by STRAIGHTS ONLY, which has members who actively support discrimination against gays and are prejudiced against gays, WHERE is the real source of the \"divisiveness\" when a gay leader gets nominated???\n The complaining religious leaders are so far backwards that they blame THE VICTIM of the discrimination for DIVIDING the group when the group decides to STOP being so DIVISIVE by not excluding that segment...",
