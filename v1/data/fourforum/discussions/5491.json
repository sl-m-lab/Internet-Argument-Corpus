   "You could try canada the city of windsor even has what you need on their web site http://www.citywindsor.ca/000063.asp\n \n Wait a couple weeks and head for california. The below is from 365gay.com they are so close.\n \n California Assembly To Vote Today On Gay Marriage Bill \n by Mark Worrall 365Gay.com San Francisco Bureau \n \n Posted: June 2, 2005 12:01 am ET \n \n \n (Sacramento, California) Same-sex couples are nervously awaiting today's final vote in the California Assembly on legislation that would legalize gay marriage. \n \n Debate on the measure began late Wednesday. An initial vote saw support from 35 of the 80 members, six short of the number needed for passage. \n \n All Republicans in the Assembly, along with a number of Democrats voted against the bill. As the legislation moves today toward the final vote supporters and opponents are frantically trying to muster as much support as they can. Neither side Wednesday night as the chamber adjourned for the evening would predict the outcome today. \n \n Even if the bill passes the Assembly it still needs to pass the Senate where it also is expected to encounter stiff opposition. It would then need to gain the approval of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to become law. \n \n But, even if the legislation is signed into law it will likely need to overcome a threatened constitutional amendment that would ban gay unions. \n \n Currently, the only state where gays can marry is Massachusetts following a court ruling that stuck down the law preventing same-sex marriage. \n \n The Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Protection Act was authored by openly gay Assemblymember Mark Leno ( D-San Francisco).\n \n The bill would require local clerks to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples but allow people opposed to gay marriage to refuse to conduct weddings.\n \n The measure has the support of Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez and other key Democrats. Last month the California Democratic Party passed a resolution supporting same-sex marriage. (story)\n \n So far Gov. Schwarzenegger has sent mixed messages about whether he would sign the legislation if it were passed.\n \n In a January meeting with the editorial board of the San Francisco Chronicle Schwarzenegger suggested that this may not be the best time to push gay marriage, saying that a legislative push to fully recognize marriage rights for gays might backfire.\n \n \"Eventually in a few years from now, you can readdress it again and see what the people of California think,'' he told the paper. \"You cannot force-feed those kind of things.''\n \n Last year in a Tonight Show appearance Schwarzenegger said gay marriage would be \"fine with me\" if it were enshrined in state law or ruled legal by the courts. (story)\n \n The issue of same-sex marriage also is slowly heading toward the California Supreme Court. Last month a San San Francisco judge ruled that state laws preventing gay marriage are illegal. (story)\n \n Tuesday, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer filed an appeal in the case. \n \n Meanwhile, a conservative group called the \"Voters' Right to Protect Marriage Initiative\" has begun collecting signatures to have a proposed amendment to the California Constitution banning same-sex marriage placed on the 2006 ballot. (story) If approved by voters it would not only bar gays and lesbians from marrying but also void the state's landmark domestic partner law.\n \n Last week, LGBT groups and their supporters announced a broad coalition to combat the attempt to amend the Constitution. (story) On Monday, the nation's two largest LGBT civil rights groups announced a million dollar fundraising drive to help defeat the proposed amendment.\n \n The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the Human Rights Campaign announced they would donate up to $100,000 each as a challenge to encourage others to contribute.\n \n The groups said they hoped to raise the $1 million by Labor Day.\n \n \"We know that it's going to take a huge amount of money and intense organizing to defeat this hurtful and immoral initiative,\" said Matt Foreman, the Task Force's executive director. \n \n \"This is too important and we can neither afford to lose nor wait another day.\"\n \n \u00a9365Gay.com 2005",
