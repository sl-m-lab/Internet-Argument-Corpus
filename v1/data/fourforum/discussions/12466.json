   "This came up in another thread and I thought it was interesting enough to have its own. \n \n CAFE stands for \"Corporate Average Fuel Economy\". CAFE standards were adopted in the wake of the 1973 oil embargo as part of an energy security bill. Prior to the adoption of CAFE, several states were either contemplating, or had bills in the works at the state level, that had the same impact (fuel efficiency requirements). Congress moved and passed CAFE with the support of the automakers because they argued that it would be far to expensive for them to produce different models for different states based on different criteria.\n \n CAFE has been examined in the courts and the courts have unanimously agreed that energy security has a profound impact on interstate commerce and that congress had a clear and compelling need to act to ensure energy security and that CAFE was absolutely a natural part of their powers under the commerce clause.\n \n Personally, I see no argument against the logic there.\n \n In the other thread, we kind of combined emissions standards with CAFE, even though they are completely different. \n \n Emissions standards in the US were also passed under the commerce clause. They were actually introduced and argued primarily by republican senators from lumber states that were seeing vast stretches of prime timber being damaged by acid rain, decimating their resource value. Congress started passing emissions standards for automobiles primarily to combat the rise in sulphur dioxide from tailpipes that was causing the damage.\n \n The courts have ruled that since the impact of pollution is not localized and has a significant economic impact in other states, that enviromental regulations from congress are a legitimat euse of their power to regulate interstate commerce. For example, at one time the runoff from spraying in Nebraska and Iowa was entering the Kansas River, which was costing residents of Kansas, who pull and filter water from the river to drink, hundreds of millions of dollars per year in additional costs to filter out the agricultural chemicals being introduced upstream. Contaminates being dumped in the Missouri river at one time were so bad that farmers in Tenesee could not use the water to irrigate their crops. Acid rain produced by vehicles in California were wiping out valuable tracts of lumber in Oregon. \n \n Again, I agree with the courts on this one. I can see a clear and logical connection between these regulations and interstate commerce. \n \n Thoughts??",

   "Ok, I admit I am a little disappointed that some of our neocon posters did not pop up to argue against the constitutionality of CAFE standards. I had all my material ready to go...logic cannons locked and loaded.\n \n I will expand this a little further. In the same thread that we were talking about CAFE standards, Marc said the following:\n \n \nJust like it is well within their powers to recognize the degradation and destruction that things like abortion and gay marriage can do to a society. It is conservative to oppose things like that federally. The \"states rights\" thing meanders back and fourth according to liberal vs conservative principles. When you don't like states rights on CAF\u00c9 standards, and do like states rights on gay marriage, it largely identifies you as a liberal. When it's reversed, it largely identifies you as a conservative.\n\n \n Ok, now I do not see anywhere in the constitution that would even IMPLY that congress has the power to enact laws to \"prevent social degradation\". I searched the internet and while I found many neocons who believe that congress SHOULD enact such laws, I did not find any who could provide a constitutional justification for them.\n \n Anybody???",

   "Well, I agree with you. The Federal government had a legitimate reason to regulate these items because it was hurting the economy, well being of people, etc I could go on. There is nothing in the constitution that says the feds can't. Gay marriage and abortion are on a different level because they involve the rights of individuals as such enacting laws against them would be IMHO unconstitutional. Also where is the proof gay marriage and abortion are degrading society? As far as I can think of there is no legitimate reason to regulate.",

From purely constitutional standpoint, the federal government does not have the power to pass a law against MURDER. I simply do not see anything in there that suggests they would have the POWER to regulate abortion or marriage even if there was a clear reason for them to do so (actual evidence of societal degradation).",

   "There is nothing in the constitution that says the feds can't. \nSOMEONE SAID IT!!!! I've been waiting for someone to say this for awhile on these forums. Sorry you are the one Charlie but this kind of statement deserves to be shoved back in your mouth. \n \n The federalist argued against a bill of rights because they didn't want people going \"well it doesn't say we can't so therefore we can\". The federalists claimed that the constitution only talks about powers the federal government does have so all others are implied to be with the states and people (see 10th amendment). The constitution before amendments gives powers that congress can have and the 10th amendment directly says (as it was indirect before) that the feds get no more power. So saying it doesn't say they \"can't\" is an idiotic statement because the constitution is a \"what you can do\" document. \n \n Congratulations on proving the federalists right.\n \n RAWRemoticon_xkill\n \n \nGay marriage and abortion are on a different level because they involve the rights of individuals as such enacting laws against them would be IMHO unconstitutional.

   "I would argue that the EPA being given power to enact regulations on their own is unconstitutional, as is the BATFE having that same power. Congress has the power to do those things, I do not see anything that would suggest they have the power to let others.\n\n \n You basically claim this comes down to an \"interstate commerce issue\". \n \n \nTo regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;\nReally depends on what you mean by \"commerce\". If you look at interstates, that clearly seems to effect commerce. Pollution is a by-product that isn't used for commerce so the question really becomes does it hinder commerce from one state to the next. I'd assume the argument would be that pollution can cause something like acid rain or polluted streams and rivers which in return can ruin an economy down wind or down river of the polluted area. If this is the case than I'd probably agree off hand but I'd say this is a case by case deal. You don't want to go down the road of making anything or its byproducts that cross state lines is now able to be regulated by congress. I think you have to make it so the regulation is to solve an interstate dispute (in a way).",
