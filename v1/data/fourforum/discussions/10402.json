   "Barbara Leavitt, a Woman Whose Marriage Ended After 'Ex-Gay' Therapy Did Not Cure Her Husband Warned Against Such Marriages\n \n TAMPA, Fl -- Truth Wins Out's Executive Director Wayne Besen spoke at an Equality Florida press conference today to counter the rabidly anti-gay Family Impact Summit. Besen, the author of \"Anything But Straight: Unmasking the Scandals and Lies Behind the Ex-Gay Myth,\" said right wing organizations were embracing so-called ex-gay ministries to cloak their discriminatory aims. \n \n \"The Family Impact Summit is a cynical political ploy to use gay baiting to energize voters in a critical election year,\" said Wayne Besen, Executive Director of Truth Wins Out. \"The red meat conservatives are using so-called ex-gays as cover for their extremist views. By exploiting these vulnerable people, they are pretending to love gay people, when in reality they simply love discrimination.\"\n \n Barbara Leavitt also shared her story at the press conference in front of Bell Shoals Baptist Church. She discussed how her life was upended because her gay husband was told that marriage could help cure him of his homosexuality. Earlier in the year, Truth Wins Out featured her and her husband Lester in a video that can now be seen on YouTube. \n \n \"I want you to know that when ex-gays marry straight women, it hurts both the man and the woman and any children that come,\" said Leavitt. \n \n The Family Impact Summit will include right wing stalwarts, such as Gary Bauer, Katherine Harris, Dr. Richard Land, Don Wildmon, Bob Knight and Alan Chambers.",

If we are talking about religious people being given support for holding to their beliefs that they shouldn't engage in sexual relations that they believe they shouldn't, then there are plenty of happy people out there who have said so, because their happiness is based on other things.

Religion is a personal thing and people should not be ridiculed or opposed if they want to abide by a different set of rules than others do. Let's be straight up here: the reason these movements are so hated by gay rights proponents is that it's an alternative to their view that all gays should live the way they think they should ('out' and 'proud'.) This situation is sort of like the negative mentality that some feminists have had at times toward stay-at-home moms who happen to prefer to defer to their husbands on things. The feminist movement sometimes doesn't understand that there are women out there who PREFER and WANT to live that way, for whatever personal reasons they have. If the feminist movement wants women to be truly be independent, then they have to be willing to allow for the fact that there are women out there who's independent preferences don't line up with what the feminist movement thinks women should be like, and that there are women who may simply be happier taking a more traditional role.

There might be some positive results - but my guess is that those persons were homosexually orientated in the first place! Life is not a Seinfeld episode you know.

Basically they just want the right for those that do not fit that sterotype to exercise their freedom to exercise a different set of options. One would think listening to the radical straights that sex is something dependent on what appendage is placed in which orifice rather than the actual physiological and emotional experience it is.

First is whether anyone can, even with considerable effort, voluntarily change their sexual orientation. The bulk of evidence suggests that most people can't, but they can alter their behaviour and mask their feelings from observers. They can even be induced into misrepresenting their feelings in order to make others happy. Dissembling is a common human trait.\n \n The other question is whether they ought to want to change, which brings us to your next point.\n \n \nIf we are talking about religious people being given support for holding to their beliefs that they shouldn't engage in sexual relations that they believe they shouldn't, then there are plenty of happy people out there who have said so, because their happiness is based on other things.

That's up to them. Maybe some people can be happy that way, though I would argue most wouldn't be. But when a religion tries to argue that they should be celibate because that's what the religion's deity has commanded, then I draw the line. I think that's really bullying individuals into doing things that may go against their natures when there is no harm in letting nature take its course, and indeed, there can be love and happiness in letting nature take its course.\n \n \nLet's be straight up here: the reason these movements are so hated by gay rights proponents is that it's an alternative to their view that all gays should live the way they think they should ('out' and 'proud'.)

Such religions are claiming that gays should be ashamed of their themselves and the feelings they have.\n \n Sorry, but that is simply not acceptable. Why would a gay person want to live in a closet, if it weren't for religion telling him he's evil if he doesn't? Why would a gay person want to lie to his family about who he is, and pretend to be something he isn't, if it weren't for heterosexist expectations of sexual conformity?\n \n The reason too many gay people subject themselves to these ex-gay quacks is because they are fearful of homophobia. If homophobia didn't exist, then they wouldn't feel pressured into trying to get degayed by therapy.\n \n It's the same sort of syndrome as black people who used to, and sadly still do, apply chemical treatments to lighten their skin colour. You would argue by analogy that there is nothing wrong with wanting to look whiter in an anti-black racist society, and that there is something wrong in criticising the market for such cosmetic products, but isn't it far, far better to treat the causes of racism than simply to accept as normal and fine that some blacks feel ashamed of their skin colour because of racism?",

Let them make their own choices, based on full information, that are right for them without being bullied about eternal damnation, and without the religious demonisation of homosexuality that is stock in trade with the vast majority of ex-gay ministries.\n\n \n Well, no one is holding gays at gunpoint telling them they have to make a certain choice on this. No one is saying they can't make their own choices. Or that they can't get whatever information they want. Sometimes gays are voluntarily making this choice, not out of fear but simply because it is their religious belief and they believe it is what God wants. Many people don't eat pork either. It's their choice, and no one is making them do it.\n \n Of course, the only way anyone is going to understand why someone would make the choice not to live the \"out\" and \"proud\" way, is to be in their shoes. Making assumptions that it's only out of fear and that they are automatically miserable is making assumptions that may or many NOT be true. I say let people make their choices without criticism, even if it doesn't tow the gay pride line.\n \n \nThere are two questions here. First is whether anyone can, even with considerable effort, voluntarily change their sexual orientation. The bulk of evidence suggests that most people can't ...\n\n \n This is moot, at this point. I've already said I don't think gays can change from gay to straight physiologically or psychologically. The more pertinent issue, I think, is that not all of what you call the \"ex-gay movement\" consists of this. Again, it's a rather varied movement, and some of it is simply geared toward giving support to those who decide to choose a different path than the one the gay pride movement insists gay people take. Since we've covered this, I'm not going to spend time debating in this discussion the issue of the part of the \"ex-gay movement\" that seeks to change people from gay to straight in terms of nature and innateness. We're on the same page there.\n \n \nThe other question is whether they ought to want to change, which brings us to your next point.\n\n \n No, that next point has nothing to do with change from gay to straight. Again, that's moot at this point. It has to do with changing behavior based on one's religion. And that's a personal choice that people have to be free to make. \n \n \nBut when a religion tries to argue that they should be celibate because that's what the religion's deity has commanded, then I draw the line. I think that's really bullying individuals into doing things that may go against their natures when there is no harm in letting nature take its course, and indeed, there can be love and happiness in letting nature take its course.\n\n \n But religion is different from person to person. If a monk goes to a monastery and decides to live celibate his whole life, he may feel that is his calling, and that has nothing to do with organised religion, at least not directly. It's a personal issue between he and his God. I don't see why someone who feels it is the will of God that they abstain from gay relations is any different. Again, both gay AND straight people have lived lives that didn't make sexual orientation an issue in their lives for centuries. This is nothing new. \n \n Regarding the cases where religions DO have teachings about gay sex, I think it's important to point out that most religious groups I know of--at least the evangelical ones (I can't really speak for Catholics, Anglicans, and Orthodox) are not, in point of fact, out to instill self-loathing. I have never heard a sermon indicating gay PEOPLE are bad, and this seems to be a common accusation by the gay pride movement. Religion is always going to set it's rules--whether it be against fornication, gay sex, adultery, or whatever other sexual rule it makes. That's religion--it's certainly not going away. That said, again, religion isn't holding a gun to anyone's head here. People are free to make their choices, particularly nowadays when sodomy laws have been repealed (and rightly so). \n \n A lot of times these \"ex-gays\" don't need direct religious teaching to know that gay sex isn't right for them. To use monks again as an example, there usually was no teaching in place telling them to go join the monastery and take up a life that didn't give in to their sexual orientation. No one held a scriptural gun to their head. No one threatened them with hellfire. They just wanted to do it out of their belief and devotion that there are higher and more important things. The bottom line here is that they (just like many of these gay people who choose not to live by their sexual orientation) simply are not slaves to their sexual orientation and choose to live in a way despite it. To someone for whom sexual orientation is a lot bigger deal, that's no doubt hard to understand. But every person is different.\n \n \nYou might as well argue that if a cult argues that people will be happier flogging themselves and living in filthy and degrading cells, then it's OK for them to do that without criticism for it.\n\n \n But the problem here is that you aren't just criticising the cult; you're criticising the practitioners for the choice. As well as (as a movement) even resorting to such tactics trying to catch them in failures and publicise it to make them out as hypocrites. Look, it's not like there's not clear hostility toward the \"ex-gay movement\" going on (and again, I'm talking about the religious-choice part of it, NOT the \"change-the-nature\" part). \n \n And for that matter, your analogy fails because flogging is known to cause physical harm in every case, and living in filth is known to cause disease. You just can't reliably say that someone choosing not to let sexual orientation run their life is going to harm them, particularly when there ARE people out there who insist they are just fine and content doing it.\n \n \nIt's the same sort of syndrome as black people who used to, and sadly still do, apply chemical treatments to lighten their skin colour. You would argue by analogy that there is nothing wrong with wanting to look whiter in an anti-black racist society, and that there is something wrong in criticising the market for such cosmetic products, but isn't it far, far better to treat the causes of racism than simply to accept as normal and fine that some blacks feel ashamed of their skin colour because of racism?\n\n \n But you aren't taking into account cases where it has nothing to do with racism/homophobia. By your logic a black person should only wear African clothes and never wear things that are more western in influence. Or should never apply hair treatment to make their hair straight when it's not naturally straight because it looks more like a 'white person's'. It's all about motive. The problem here is that you ONLY equate the choice to live differently than their sexual orientation as a bad motive. You're ONLY assuming bad motive. You aren't entertaining, in your mind, the reality that some people simply prefer to do things differently than you. If religion wants to support that, I say fine. After all, they certainly aren't going to get support for that from the gay pride movement. Perhaps if you did, you'd find more people would turn to your movement for such support for that choice rather than religion. Who knows?",

   "Well, no one is holding gays at gunpoint telling them they have to make a certain choice on this. No one is saying they can't make their own choices. Or that they can't get whatever information they want. Sometimes gays are voluntarily making this choice, not out of fear but simply because it is their religious belief and they believe it is what God wants. Many people don't eat pork either. It's their choice, and no one is making them do it.\n\n \n Sorry, but religious believers telling gays they are damned if they don't become straight is pretty much holding a gun, and this is a common practice of ex-gay ministries.\n \n \nOf course, the only way anyone is going to understand why someone would make the choice not to live the \"out\" and \"proud\" way, is to be in their shoes. Making assumptions that it's only out of fear and that they are automatically miserable is making assumptions that may or many NOT be true. I say let people make their choices without criticism, even if it doesn't tow the gay pride line.\n\n \n I think maybe you should listen to some ex-ex-gays instead of swallowing religious propaganda whole. Religious extremists are never slow to condemn gay people who do not tow the line.\n \n \nI've already said I don't think gays can change from gay to straight physiologically or psychologically. \n\n \n The only folk who don't agree with this are those running ex-gay ministries.\n \n \n \nThe more pertinent issue, I think, is that not all of what you call the \"ex-gay movement\" consists of this. Again, it's a rather varied movement, and some of it is simply geared toward giving support to those who decide to choose a different path than the one the gay pride movement insists gay people take.\n\n \n Disingenuous. The victims of the ex-gay cults aren't making free choices; they are being bullied into making these pathetic choices.\n \n On the other hand, there is no monolithic \"gay lifestyle\" advocated by gay activists. In fact, the latest choice of lifestyle on the gay smorgasbord suggested by gay activists is monogamous gay marriage, which for some reason you and the ex-gay movement stoutly oppose!\n \n You know, if the ex-gay cults would admit there is nothing wrong with being gay, and in fact genuinely offered a free choice, I'd have little grounds for complaint. Unfortunately, they don't do this. They bully people and lie to them. They demonise and condemn those who avoid their traps or free themselves from ex-gay bondage.\n \n \nIt has to do with changing behavior based on one's religion. And that's a personal choice that people have to be free to make. \n\n \n Of course they should be free to make it. But when ex-gays make it their way of the hell-bound way, there really isn't much free choice involved. they are stacking the deck to start with.\n \n \nRegarding the cases where religions DO have teachings about gay sex, I think it's important to point out that most religious groups I know of--at least the evangelical ones (I can't really speak for Catholics, Anglicans, and Orthodox) are not, in point of fact, out to instill self-loathing. I have never heard a sermon indicating gay PEOPLE are bad, and this seems to be a common accusation by the gay pride movement. Religion is always going to set it's rules--whether it be against fornication, gay sex, adultery, or whatever other sexual rule it makes. That's religion--it's certainly not going away. That said, again, religion isn't holding a gun to anyone's head here. People are free to make their choices, particularly nowadays when sodomy laws have been repealed (and rightly so). \n\n \n Well, tell the evangelical pastor you know he's probably a nice guy. Unfortunately, the 99% of other pastors running ex-gay cults are inducing self-loathing, because without it, no-one would want to subject themselves to this dreadful experience. \n \n \nA lot of times these \"ex-gays\" don't need direct religious teaching to know that gay sex isn't right for them. \n\n \n And how do they \"know\" this? Because their pastors tell them they are going to hell if they try it.\n \n And round and round we go. Ex-gay cults wouldn't exist if it weren't for religious demonisation of gays, and they wouldn't be failures if it were possible for them to achieve conversions.\n \n They are therefore a very bad idea. If someone wishes to be celibate on account of his or her religion, they already have many options without putting themselves through an ex-gay wringer. There is no gay activist group holding a gun to their heads demanding they have promiscuous gay sex with complete strangers. Ex-gay cults are totally unnecessary from the POV of religious celibacy, and exist only as part of the attempt to demonise gays in general.",

   "Well, what I know is that those who oppose ex-gay movement and indicate it's all out of this benevolent idea of preventing harm and hurt (of which I'm entirely unconvinced because they also attack the participants too rather than just the organisations) have not shown any proof whatsoever (through stats or data) that it's always harmful. On the flip-side, there are so-called \"ex-gays\" who claim to be living content lives. In this vacuum of proof that it's always harmful, what we have left are personal accounts, and those accounts don't ONLY indicate harm--they are both pro- AND con about people who are living a different life than their sexual orientation calls for, out of personal religious belief. Sure, there may be some (perhaps many) cases where it's harmful to live against one's sexual orientation. But people still get to choose and should be able to do so, and not everyone seems to feel so harmed after all. This is one of those issues that don't need to be tackled in terms of generalities.\n \n One would think that those in the gay-pride movement would be happy about a gay person who claimed to be living contently this way.

   "The American Psychiatric Assn. Position Statement on Therapies Focused on Attempts to Change Sexual Orientation (2000)\n full document here\n \n \nRecommendations:\n \n 1. APA affirms its 1973 position that homosexuality per se is not a diagnosable mental disorder. Recent publicized efforts to repathologize homosexuality by claiming that it can be cured are often guided not by rigorous scientific or psychiatric research, but sometimes by religious and political forces opposed to full civil rights for gay men and lesbians. APA recommends that the APA respond quickly and appropriately as a scientific organization when claims that homosexuality is a curable illness are made by political or religious groups.\n \n 2. As a general principle, a therapist should not determine the goal of treatment either coercively or through subtle influence. Psychotherapeutic modalities to convert or \"repair\" homosexuality are based on developmental theories whose scientific validity is questionable. Furthermore, anecdotal reports of \"cures\" are counterbalanced by anecdotal claims of psychological harm. In the last four decades, \"reparative\" therapists have not produced any rigorous scientific research to substantiate their claims of cure. Until there is such research available, APA recommends that ethical practitioners refrain from attempts to change individuals' sexual orientation, keeping in mind the medical dictum to first, do no harm.\n \n 3. The \"reparative\" therapy literature uses theories that make it difficult to formulate scientific selection criteria for their treatment modality. This literature not only ignores the impact of social stigma in motivating efforts to cure homosexuality; it is a literature that actively stigmatizes homosexuality as well. \"Reparative\" therapy literature also tends to overstate the treatment's accomplishments while neglecting any potential risks to patients. APA encourages and supports research in the NIMH and the academic research community to further determines \"reparative\" therapy's risks versus its benefits.\n \n \n",

Naturally.\n\n \n Your bizarre standard of proof is certainly impossible. Let's try it out in some other situations. Does there exist a person who does heroin but hasn't ruined their life? Why yes, such a person exists. Therefore heroin is not always bad for you and no one should have any issues with it. Putting a gun to your head and pulling the trigger? It's a known fact that sometimes the gun will misfire and no damage will be done, therefore it isn't always bad and no one should have any issues. \n \n There is no baby in the bath water, it's just full of broken glass. These treatments can't actually help, since there is no problem to begin with, and they are known to hurt. Of course those who have been indoctrinated to think that being gay is bad may turn to this sort of thing in desperation; that proves nothing except how susceptible people are to social pressure. The very concept that gayness needs to be cured is sick, it's hatefull, and it's wrong.",

I'm talking about the part of the \"ex-gay movement\" which is about (mainly) Christian gays who try to live lives that don't involve gay relationships. I'm simply talking about people who choose to live a certain way out of religious belief. People have done this sort of thing for centuries, and that's why I used celibate monks as an example earlier. \n \n \nYour bizarre standard of proof is certainly impossible.
