When someone finds themselves in the posi i was in, it is the most scariest posi to be in!!!. \n There was no way out, Sinjin, i was ready to top myself champ... I could only do what was left to do, and that was to invite JESUS into my heart. I remember the day well. I was at home alone, a broken mess when a friend that i hadent seen in along time showed up at my doorstep, i couldent hide my brokeness, i was to far gone. He came in, put his arm around me and began to share with me all about this man named JESUS, that he asked into his life. So right there i decided to lay my life down and let Jesus into my heart. When i finished crieing out to JESUS, i could feel his presence all round me, Mate it was so strong i could literally feel it when i waved my arms around in the air. HE DELIVERED ME!!!, HE SET ME FREE!!!. I never had a drink from that time onwards.\n Now, i still have that very relationship with him that i started from that day. \n What really shits me, is that these stories never do make it on the news. See the problem is, is that if it were on the news, that would result in God being glorified, and i dont think that a world that is happy to live for its own selfish desires, would not want to witness, then they will be confronted with the descision to give up their sin. AND THAT SUX!, because he wants to see all to turn to him and know of the life that can only be found in him, And i hope and prey that Sinjin and all the guys in here will come to know of that life!!!!\n STORMY",

   "so you are saying that it is totally impossible for us to OBSERVE an occurance that defies laws of nature? i can think of many things that are both observable and unnatural. things like animals talking, pigs floating, walking rocks, healing wounds with a touch. you are telling me that even if the cause is an unseen, unmeasureable entity, the phenomena themselves must be natural?\n \n lets say that and invisible, unobservable being picked up a pencil and started to write. to you, you'd just observe a pencil writing by itself. to the invisible entity, there's nothing strange about him scribbling on paper with a pencil. the reality would be that this invisible being isnt doing anything supernatural (holding a pencil with his fingers, moving it over a paper surface) but pencils dont just get up and write\n \n would such a phenomenon be considered supernatural?\n\n \n That's correct. They would all, by definition, be \"not supernatural\", or within the natural world. Supernatural, by definition, is a negative, \"outside of human experience\". If it's inside human experience, it's not supernatural. I realize this word, and many like it, are misused a lot (like say, X files).\n \n Something like you describe could \"theoretically\" occur, if, for instance, some ET had the ability to hide from our senses or affect our mind in such a way that we would no longer \"observe\". \n But supernatural, being a negative (not natural), it cannot occur, by definition, in the natural universe. We can say \"super-human\", but not \"super-natural\". Or we say \"super powers\". And be consistent. So we can still enjoy some good old fashioned super hero battles, or a silverback gorilla hitting with \"super human\" strength, or an ET that can control energy and hurl flaming fireballs at you...but not the supernatural. The supernatural can still be portrayed in works of fiction that don't have to adhere to the sometimes boring, rational universe, I enjoy them there, personally.\n \n -Mach",
