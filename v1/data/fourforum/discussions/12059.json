   "Tackled by the long arm of the law.\n \n \nLAS VEGAS - A weary and beaten-looking O.J. Simpson was put away Friday for at least nine years - and perhaps the rest of his life - for an armed robbery in a hotel room, bringing a measure of satisfaction to those who believed the football star got away with murder more than a decade ago. The 61-year-old Hall of Famer listened stone-faced, his wrists in shackles, as Judge Jackie Glass pronounced the sentence - 33 years behind bars with eligibility for parole after less than a third of that.\n O.J. gets at least 9 years for armed hotel robbery - Yahoo! News\n \n\n \n Jeesh, I should write headlines. emoticon_smile",

   "When it comes to the American system of punishment, I tend to think we are spineless. Why not have a prison like they do in the middle east. Ten by Ten room with thirty men with one bucket for water and the other for waste. Stick them in there for punishment. We have homeless people committing crimes in the winter so that they can go to prison to get free meals, time to watch television, workout and a place to sleep. This is not prison or even jail. If we would just be more realistic about punishments maybe we would not have so many people in prison. They will learn, \"O what i did was wrong, and I never want to do that again.\" INSTEAD they walk out with friends and a good laugh. Ridiculous! Take care of the criminals in jail so when they get back on the streets they LEARN to be responsible and civilized! ",

   "I am one that believes OJ got away cleanly with a double murder...thanks to his lawyers, the racism of the detective and the playing of the race card, all of which had nothing top do with the actual murder. The things that I cannot erase from the evidence against him are the presence of his own blood in the foyer of his home and his forgetting of how he got an obvious gash on his hand. (It was not just a paper cut.) He came up with multiple stories about that and I just do not believe a person can receive that kind of wound and not know where it came from.\n \n Regardless, the judge is his armed robbery/kidnap case stated that she did not consider his history in arriving at his sentence. The evidence in this case was overwhelming, thanks to the recording of OJ's commands to his cronies during the ordeal. He could have been jailed for life. I believe she cut him some slack.\n \n I hope he dies in prison, after eight and a half years of looking forward to another blonde girlfriend...maybe by having his throat slashed with a dull knife while showering with several well endowed Bubbas.",
