   "Found this online from unknown writer, but I liked it so I thought I would share it!\n _________________________________-\n \n To the immediate and personal attention of:\n Senator Frank Lautenberg\n Senator John Corzine\n Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle\n Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist\n the United States Senate, and the people of the United States.\n \n An open letter to the Senate of the United States of America\n \n Ladies and Gentlemen,\n \n It is with profound reverence for the constitution and to this great nation that we are all blessed to be a part of, despite and in spite of our vast differences. I write these things to you in hopes that common sense will prevail and that you will reject Senate Joint Resolution 30, or Federal Marriage Amendment (\"FMA\") wholeheratedly. I am writing to you to tell you, among other things, that there are plenty of other things that this great nation of ours must make right, and are more important than a ridiculous amendment to supposedly \"Protect Marriage\". For the record, I am a registered Democrat but I am not particularly loyal to one party, and I actually think more like a moderate Republican (which most of my family is) than a Democrat. However, this was the LAST straw in me ever considering supporting Republicans. You may say that the FMA is narrow in focus, but ask any gun enthusiast what has happened to the Second Amendment. I am asking for a reply, and a reply that is original, candid, and thoughtful! Not some form letter!\n \n For those of you who oppose the FMA, you have my appreciation and support in the coming years. For those of you who support the FMA, I respectfully say this to you:\n \n While more money goes down into corrupt political machines, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While gay 9/11/01 hero Mark Bingham lies in obscurity because of his \"lifestyle\", YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n \n While more hard earned tax dollars get squandered on various programs better off privatized or abolished, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While more jobs go overseas, more talented and hard working Americans, loyal to their God, Country, Family, and Company get displaced and dumped like last night's leftovers, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!\n \n While more and more Senior Citizens are dumped off into substandard nursing homes, or left to eat catfood by \"pro family\" activists, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n When trial lawyers sue fast food companies (that give our teenagers character-building jobs) for peoples' obesity from eating too much fast food, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n When Trial Lawyers sue companies for having coffee that's too hot that a woman dumps on herself, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While the rights of people to just be left alone (and maybe be separatists) and sovereign in their religious, civic, and family lives are being trampled on, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While citizens around the world, such as in China or Sudan face horrific persecution because of their religion or ethnicity, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n When Presidents lie about sex or Weapons of Mass Destruction, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While Congress passes foolish laws scaring off businesses from keeping jobs here in the US, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While innocent people are executed, or on death row for crimes they did not commit, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n When nice little old men or ladies or children cannot even walk down the street in their neighborhood without facing violence, gangs, and being sold drugs YOU GO AHEAD AND BE OUTRAGED THAT THE CITY'S MAYOR ISSUED A GAY COUPLE A MARRIAGE LICENSE....AND YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While children, by the fault of their awful \"God-ordained heterosexual family\" are stuck in abusive and neglective foster homes (often) ran by opportunistic \"wonderful normal heterosexual families\" seeking mostly to cash in on the government dole...YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While \"pro-family\" activists decry the existence of abortion, and decry the MURDER of innocent human life, YOU GO PASS AN AMENDMENT SAYING NOTHING ABOUT ABORTION.....WHICH YOU ARE SO OPPOSED TO, BUT INSTEAD, BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While more people sit around on the welfare rolls, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While fathers and mothers neglect or dump off their kids for drugs, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While stupid mothers have their babies and then abandon or kill them, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While heterosexual couples just give up and divorce \"because they grew apart\" or \"the flame has died\", YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGES!!\n \n When I, or others have to suffer through commercials featuring former Senator Bob Dole (a man with a wife well beyond child bearing years) talking about Erectile Dysfunction (YUCK!), YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While churches opposed to contraception, in vitro fertilization, and capital punishment say NOTHING most of the time about the subject,YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While the US Senate uses \"facts\" and \"statistics\" from a discredited and expelled (by leading mental health authorities) former \"mental health professional\", YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While (Former Senate Candidate) Jack Ryan (R-IL) is on national Television having his obsession with visiting sex clubs (and pestering his wife to do the same), but AT THE SAME TIME speaking out against Same Sex Marriages, Domestic Partnerships, and Civil Unions, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n When I, or any others cannot watch a football game without constantly seeing ads for drugs that help \"Erectile Dysfunction\", YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n When children, whose parents cannot or will not bother to keep them out of gangs, lose their sons and daughters to them, are killed or in prison, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While the mother (Phyllis Shafly) of an openly gay man, testifies in favor of this amendment, it calls into question what her motivations are for her son's esate...should he ever die, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While THE SENATE KNOWS FULL WELL that married gay couples WOULD NEVER fit the definition of a \"traditional marriage\", just like blended families are not nuclear families, YOU GO BAN GAY MARRIAGE!!\n \n While THE SENATE KNOWS FULL WELL that society will NOT AUTOMATICALLY assume that a man who calls himself married is married to another man, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n When people marry just for the sake of obtaining citizenship to this great country, to whom they have no loyalty, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE for committed couples who love this country!!\n \n While children cannot be openly gay or openly religious in public schools (as it's a \"choice\" to be open about it) without facing discrimination and harrassment, like having \"***\" scrawled all over their lockers or having their essays about \"why I love Jesus\" torn up in front of the class, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While the former Speaker of the House of Representatives (Newt Gingrich) is allowed to dump his cancer stricken wife by handing her divorce papers in a hospital room, YOU BLAME GAYS FOR CHEAPENING MARRIAGE, AND THEN PASS THIS AMENDMENT!!\n \n While the Pledge of Allegiance was nearly ruled unconstitutional and therefore banned, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While prison inmate convicted murderers are allowed to marry non-inmate spouses, YOU EXPLAIN THAT TO THE VICTIM'S FAMILY, and then GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n When citizens are deprived of their second amendment rights, and cannot properly defend themselves if attacked or robbed, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While committment-fearing couples \"live in sin\" or \"have kids out of wedlock\" which they have been doing for YEARS, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While the Congress passes, and the president signs MORE AND MORE foolish, grandstanding, pandering, power-grabbing \"Washington Knows Best how to run your life according to our favorite special interest groups\" legislation, YOU GO AHEAD AND PASS THIS AMENDMENT TOO!!\n \n While the Vice President of the United States can congratulate himself, without rebuke from Senate Leadership or the President, for spewing out an expletive at an adversary, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!! (Great example for children of \"the traditional family\" by the way)\n \n While you sit there, and you know that gays have always been persecuted throughout history, and now they (in my opinion) are now finally getting their rightful place in society, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n While you sit there, and you know that gays make a valuable contribution to society as Americans (maybe despite or in spite of their \"lifestyle\") and their relationships receive little or no recognition under law, YOU GO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!\n \n ...YOU THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS, and then cast your vote!!! History and Voters like me WILL remember!!\n \n Sincerely,\n \n \n \n William\n (Contact Info Deleted by me for security)",

They're probably not ever enforced, but they're there.\n \n At one time laws against blaspheming were common. There were laws against swearing in public. Lots of things. Religion and the Bible has long had a profound effect on law in this country.\n\n \n Oops, sorry, you are indeed right about this. I had meant to say that none of our founding fathers intended to implement any laws based on the Bible. Certainly I would say there are some laws based on the Bible, even in our Federal government, though not many, and I'd argue that those Biblical laws which are not based on the words of Jesus, are largely poor laws. This includes Blue laws and profanity laws.\n \n \nThere are also laws based on the 10 commandments......\n \n Thou shall not kill comes to mind..........\n\n \n Well, laws against killing existed in just about every society and every set of laws before and after the Bible, so it would be impossible to suggest that the law against killing is based in any way shape or form, on the Bible. \n \n Looking at the ten commandments:\n \n \nI. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\n\n \n Our constitution protects the right of any individual worship any God he pleases.\n \n \nII. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.\n\n \n Our constitution protects freedom of speech.\n \n \nIII. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.\n\n \n Our constitution may protect this in the form of freedom of speech or religion, however it is certainly not illegal to do this.\n \n \nIV. Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy.\n\n \n Again, our Constitution protects each person's freedom of religion.\n \n \nV. Honor thy father and thy mother.\n\n \n There are surely no laws saying we need to do this.\n \n \nVI. Thou shalt not kill.\n\n \n Again, this law existed in just about every society that ever existed.\n \n \nVII. Thou shalt not commit adultery.\n\n \n Do a few states have laws against this? I'm not sure; I know Michigan doesn't.\n \n \nVIII. Thou shalt not steal.\n\n \n Again, this law existed in just about every society that ever existed.\n \n \nIX. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.\n\n \n This isn't law at all, in fact our freedom of speech protects our right to do this, except in a court of law.\n \n \nX. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbors goods\n\n \n As someone who isn't me once wrote: our society is based on coveting. There really aren't laws against coveting your neighbor's wife, and though there are laws against stealing your neighbor's goods, that is covered in the stealing commandment. So really, there are maybe.. two or three commandments that are law, all of which have existed in countless past societies. I would not say that our law is based on the Bible based on the Ten Commandments.",

   "All the laws you guys keep referring to as Mosaic pre-date Moses in various legal codes found throughout world cultures. Moses and the Hebrews came late to the legal codification party. \n \n As for our modern culture, our laws descend from English common law (which predates Christianity) and from Roman Law (which also predates Christianity). \n \n Sure, while the Christians were in charge, they reworded some laws and, lord knows, they wrote a lot of rationalizations about society using the Bible as a source. Much of this was done, I suppose, in benign ignorance. To continue the fraud today is hardly benign.\n \n The only branch of American law that one might argue has Christian roots is the blue laws others have mentioned, though the idea of legally requiring religious observance of holy days was hardly a Christian invention either.",

   "Let me guess..you all who say the Bible wasnt specific..or the Bible never said we couldnt marry, are the same immature children who when told as a child to jump, you didnt do it... because nobody told you how high. Giggle giggle Ya got outta that one! Try thinking like an adult...deep down you know your percieving it wrong.\n\n \n Again, you point your accusatory finger at me yet site NO specific examples. You do nothing to prove yourself right or even prove me wrong. Insted you resort to name calling and finger pointing. And you have the nerve to call ME immature? Get over yourself.\n \n Here, let me give you some examples of the SECULAR NATURE of our government.\n \n First off the Treaty of Tripolli. Herein I am posting a link to a site which refutes the assertation that American Government was in any way meant to be influenced by \"Christianity\" or any other specific religion whatsoever. \n \n http://earlyamerica.com/review/summer97/secular.html\n \n \n Some other interesting quotes by our founding fathers regarding \n \"Christianity.\" \n \n Thomas Jefferson:  \n \n I have examined all the known superstitions of the world, and I do not find in our particular superstition of Christianity one redeeming feature. They are all alike founded on fables and mythology. Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of this coercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites; to support roguery and error all over the earth.\n \n SIX HISTORIC AMERICANS,\n by John E. Remsburg, letter to William Short\n \n Jefferson again:  \n \n Christianity...(has become) the most perverted system that ever shone on man. ...Rogueries, absurdities and untruths were perpetrated upon the teachings of Jesus by a large band of dupes and importers led by Paul, the first great corrupter of the teaching of Jesus.\n \n More Jefferson:  \n \n The clergy converted the simple teachings of Jesus into an engine for enslaving mankind and adulterated by artificial constructions into a contrivance to filch wealth and power to themselves...these clergy, in fact, constitute the real Anti-Christ.\n \n Jefferson's word for the Bible?  \n \n Dunghill.\n \n \n John Adams:  \n \n Where do we find a precept in the Bible for Creeds, Confessions, Doctrines and Oaths, and whole carloads of other trumpery that we find religion encumbered with in these days?\n \n Also Adams:\n \n The doctrine of the divinity of Jesus is made a convenient cover for absurdity.\n Adams signed the Treaty of Tripoli. Article 11 states: \n The Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.\n \n Here's Thomas Paine:  \n \n I would not dare to so dishonor my Creator God by attaching His name to that book (the Bible).\n \n Among the most detestable villains in history, you could not find one worse than Moses. Here is an order, attributed to 'God' to butcher the boys, to massacre the mothers and to debauch and rape the daughters. I would not dare so dishonor my Creator's name by (attaching) it to this filthy book (the Bible).\n \n It is the duty of every true Deist to vindicate the moral justice of God against the evils of the Bible.\n \n Accustom a people to believe that priests and clergy can forgive sins...and you will have sins in abundance.\n \n The Christian church has set up a religion of pomp and revenue in pretended imitation of a person (Jesus) who lived a life of poverty.\n \n Finally let's hear from James Madison:  \n \n What influence in fact have Christian ecclesiastical establishments had on civil society? In many instances they have been upholding the thrones of political tyranny. In no instance have they been seen as the guardians of the liberties of the people. Rulers who wished to subvert the public liberty have found in the clergy convenient auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate liberty, does not need the clergy.\n \n Madison objected to state-supported chaplains in Congress and to the exemption of churches from taxation. He wrote: \n \n Religion and government will both exist in greater purity, the less they are mixed together.\n \n These founding fathers were a reflection of the American population. Having escaped from the state-established religions of Europe, only 7% of the people in the 13 colonies belonged to a church when the Declaration of Independence was signed.",

   "Well, sure there are, and to say that laws based on the Bible don't exist is to deny reality. You might be surprised to know that around 3/4s of our states have blue laws on their books(http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/rcah/html/ah_011100_bluelaws.htm), some in \"liberal\" New England (Massachusetts, Connecticut). They're probably not ever enforced, but they're there.\n \n At one time laws against blaspheming were common. There were laws against swearing in public. Lots of things. Religion and the Bible has long had a profound effect on law in this country.\n\n \n Ah, but your take that these laws were based in \"Christian\" beliefs is unfounded. Just because the laws you stated are SIMILAR to your Christian Bible doesn't mean that they are only found there. Many other religions have similar admonishments to their followers. \n It's purely coincedental that you assume that these laws are somehow based in \"Christianity\" rather than any other religion.",

   "You couldnt be more wrong. Our goverment was built on the word of God. Its ALL OVER our founding documents. George Washington was quoted to say \"You cannot call yourself an American and subvert the word of God.\" Your only argument can go back to the sep.of church and state. Which is new compaired to when our laws were drafted. So not always... just unfortuanatly now. Which is a BIG mistake by the way and could be the downfall of our country. \n \n Try again...\n\n \n Geez. emoticon_rolleyes Will you people EVERY grow up?\n http://earlyamerica.com/review/summer97/secular.html\n http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/treaty_tripoli.html\n http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/diplomacy/barbary/bar1796t.htm\n \n \nSome people today assert that the United States government came from Christian foundations. They argue that our political system represents a Christian ideal form of government and that Jefferson, Madison, et al, had simply expressed Christian values while framing the Constitution. If this proved true, then we should have a wealth of evidence to support it, yet just the opposite proves the case.\n \n Although, indeed, many of America's colonial statesmen practiced Christianity, our most influential Founding Fathers broke away from traditional religious thinking. The ideas of the Great Enlightenment that began in Europe had begun to sever the chains of monarchical theocracy. These heretical European ideas spread throughout early America. Instead of relying on faith, people began to use reason and science as their guide. The humanistic philosophical writers of the Enlightenment, such as Locke, Rousseau, and Voltaire, had greatly influenced our Founding Fathers and Isaac Newton's mechanical and mathematical foundations served as a grounding post for their scientific reasoning.\n \n A few Christian fundamentalists attempt to convince us to return to the Christianity of early America, yet according to the historian, Robert T. Handy, \"No more than 10 percent-- probably less-- of Americans in 1800 were members of congregations.\"\n \n The Founding Fathers, also, rarely practiced Christian orthodoxy. Although they supported the free exercise of any religion, they understood the dangers of religion. Most of them believed in deism and attended Freemasonry lodges. According to John J. Robinson, \"Freemasonry had been a powerful force for religious freedom.\" Freemasons took seriously the principle that men should worship according to their own conscious. Masonry welcomed anyone from any religion or non-religion, as long as they believed in a Supreme Being. Washington, Franklin, Hancock, Hamilton, Lafayette, and many others accepted Freemasonry.\n \n The Constitution reflects our founders views of a secular government, protecting the freedom of any belief or unbelief. The historian, Robert Middlekauff, observed, \"the idea that the Constitution expressed a moral view seems absurd. There were no genuine evangelicals in the Convention, and there were no heated declarations of Christian piety.\"  \n\n \n \nAuthored by American diplomat Joel Barlow in 1796, the following treaty was sent to the floor of the Senate, June 7, 1797, where it was read aloud in its entirety and unanimously approved. John Adams, haven seen the treaty, signed it and proudly proclaimed it to the Nation.\n\n \n \n Art. 11. As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquillity, of Mussulmen; and, as the said States never entered into any war, or act of hostility against any Mahometan nation, it is declared by the parties, that no pretext arising from religious opinions, shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.\n\n \n The year was 1797. Passed unanimously. \n \n Now what part of that is it that you don't understand?",
