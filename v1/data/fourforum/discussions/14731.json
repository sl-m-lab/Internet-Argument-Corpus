As the U.S. Pacific Headquarters was transferred to Guam during and immediately after the war, U.S. military equipment and salvaged war material that had been in use at the military bases in the Admiralty Islands of northern Papua New Guinea were shipped back to the permanent bases and scrap metal processors on Guam. Additional support for this origination site is based on the characteristics of the snakes on Guam. Depending on the area it inhabits, the colors and scale patterns of the brown Treesnake vary. The snakes on Guam are most similar to those of the Admiralty Island group.\n \n History of The Brown Tree Snake Invasion on Guam\n \n Jesus is God and Creator!",

   "History of The Brown Tree Snake Invasion on Guam\n\n \n A fine link. More important in terms of what I was saying are paragraphs 4 and 5 from the link:\n \n \nThe disappearance of birds on the island followed the advancing high densities of snakes. By 1963, several formerly abundant species of native birds had disappeared from the central part of the island where snakes were most populous. By the late 1960s, birds had begun to decline in the central and southern parts of the island and remained abundant only in isolated patches of forest on the northern end of the island. Snakes began affecting the birds in the north-central and extreme northern parts of the island in the 1970s, and most native forest species were virtually extinct when they were listed as threatened or endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1984. The species of birds remaining on Guam are extremely patchy in distribution, occurring only in special habitats where some protection from snakes exists.\n \n At present, even small mammals are extremely rare in most forested habitats of Guam. Predation by the brown Treesnake is the most likely primary factor preventing recruitment to the single population of native Mariana fruit bats remaining on Guam. Lizard densities, particularly of introduced species with high reproductive rates, remain high, supporting the snake population. Although larger snakes are showing signs of stress, exhibited by low fat reserves, the ability to shift from birds to rodents or lizards has enabled the snake to reach and maintain extraordinarily high densities of as many as 13,000 per square mile. This is higher than snake densities in the rainforests of the Amazon Basin of Ecuador where 51 different snake species occupy the same habitat.\n\n \n Introduce a species into someplace it doesn't belong, and all manner of ecological havoc ensues.\n \n In any event, one wonders: Guam is obviously a great place for snakes to make a living -- so why weren't there any snakes there already?...",
