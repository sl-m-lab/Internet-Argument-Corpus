However, quantum-scale fluctuations almost immediately introduced nonuniformity, and according to inflationary cosmology, this quantum-scale nonuniformity ultimately resulted in the formation of stars and galazies.\n \n As soon as the universe began there would have been microscopic variations (about 1 part in 100,000) in the amount of energy present at different spatial locations, this being due to the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics, which simply put, makes things at the level of particles jittery and turbulent as opposed to nice and deterministic and rational.\n \n The near-immediate, incredibly fast and incredibly powerful burst of inflation that followed the Big Bang stretched space by such a huge factor, and crucially, in such a short space of time, that these quantum-scale energy fluctuations were equally stretched to macroscopic scales.\n \n So some areas (we're talking macroscopic areas now) following inflation contained more energy than others. As the universe cooled and matter condensed from the raw energy, these areas contained more matter than others, and over the next millions of years attracted more matter because of gravity. Eventually these areas became the first stars and galaxies.\n \n Additionally, the inflationary process was itself subject to quantum fluctuation, which explains why the universe is not only nonuniform, but the 'amount' of nonuniformity differs depending on where we look, for example the different shapes, sizes and distributions of galaxies, clusters and superclusters that we see.\n \n I should add that not all physicists accept inflationary cosmology, but it is the most widely accepted theory of its kind, and neatly explains a whole host of previously puzzling aspects of the universe, and is like many successful theories in that it seems less likely to be falsified than built upon, extended and changed to accomodate new data as technology catches up with theory.",

How do you think this factor fits into the picture? \n \n James.\n\n \n Aha! Great question! Interestingly, inflationary cosmology actually predicted the existence of dark matter and dark energy before confirmed physical evidence for these phenomena was found. I'll try to put this as simply as I can without being too long-winded. \n \n I mentioned that inflation solved other puzzling aspects of the universe; one of these is the so-called 'flatness problem', which involves the amount of mass-energy in the universe determining the overall curvature of spacetime. The amount of mass-energy known as the 'critical density' which determines that spacetime is flat (as opposed to negatively/positively curved) is an extremely precise quantity, and almost any deviation from it would have been massively exaggerated during inflation. \n \n Measurements taken in the 1980s, although far from complete at the time, showed that the mass-energy density is not hugely smaller or larger than the critical density; space is relatively flat. This means that just after the Big Bang, the mass-energy density must have been extraordinarily close to the critical density (less than a thousand billionth of a percent deviation): anything more would have been exaggerated by inflation to produce a completely different present day density from that which we see.\n \n However, in terms of the visible matter in the universe, observations actually came up short of the critical density; about 4% in fact. This sounds like a huge error, but is still in line with the early universe being incredibly close to the critical density, as anything more than the tiniest deviation would have been more likely to produce either something like 0.000000000001% or 1000000000000% disparities; 4% is relatively accurate. But it's still not good enough; for inflationary cosmology to work, we have to find the other 96% of the universe's mass-energy. Luckily there was already a candidate.\n \n The concept of dark matter goes back to the 1930s, when research at the California Institute of Technology showed that galaxies at the edge of the Coma Cluster were moving so quickly that gravity should not be able to stop them from being thrown out of the cluster. Calculations showed that if there were extra matter that did not give off light but supplied the necessary extra gravity, it would comprise the vast majority of the cluster's mass. More observations were made by various institutions over the next few decades, of the same problem in other clusters, and in every individual galaxy studied; individual stars at the galaxy's edge should overcome the galaxy's gravity and be thrown out, but none were.\n \n Nobody knows what dark matter is made of, but by analysing its gravitational effects astronomers have determined that it makes up about 23% of the critical density, bringing the total, along with visible baryonic matter, to 27%. Some of it may be comprised of neutrinos, but the rest must be as yet unobserved 'exotic' particles. The most recent research, published February 2006 by the Cambridge Institute of Astronomy, studied the gravitational relationships of so-called 'dwarf galaxies' that orbit the Milky Way, and their constituent stars, has provided astronomers with a model for the distribution of dark matter and some of its physical properties. It is also expected that 'dark galaxies' will be found in intergalactic space, and one candidate has been put forward already.\n \n That just leaves the other 73%...which is also intimately tied to inflationary cosmology, and the puzzle of the universe's accelerating expansion, confirmed in 1998 at Lawrence Berkely National Laboratory by a study of the recession speeds of type 1a supernovae. They concluded that after the infinitessimally short inflation burst, gravity slowed the expansion of the universe for about 7 billion years, but then the expansion started to speed up!\n Even more strikingly, the mysterious, anti-gravitational energy required for such an acceleration at just such a time in the universe's history, was calculated to be the remaining 73% of the critical mass-energy density predicted by inflation! This is what has been dubbed 'dark energy'.\n \n OK I hope that was all comprehensible! I should sum up by adding that dark matter, although mysterious, is nonetheless definitely very real, and dark energy, while seemingly an even more nebulous concept (physicists have absolutely no idea what it is made of), is certainly suggested to be just as real by the findings of the LBNL. \n \n It is very similar to the 'cosmological constant' that Einstein created to balance gravity in his equations, because in his day everyone 'knew' the universe was neither expanding or contracting. However, the universe is not held in such a balance; the universe's intrinsic gravitational attraction weakens as it expands and becomes less dense, but the repulsive energy of 'dark energy' or the 'cosmological constant' or whatever it actually is, does not change as matter spreads out, hence at some point 6.5 billion years ago it overcame gravity and expansion accelerated.",

I imagine the heat death of the universe would leave immensely scattered and eternal concentrations of cold and dark matter. Everything perhaps 'too far apart' for gravity to effect any changes at all (if that makes sense !)\n \n James.\n\n \n Well, if contemporary models are correct, a flat universe like the one we live in will continue to expand, indefinitely, not at diminishing speed (this would require an increase in the strength of gravity), but at higher and higher speeds until we experience, as you say, 'heat death'. In this way the presence of dark energy causes our flat universe to behave as an open universe.\n \n One analogy is blowing up a balloon. At first the balloon expands rapidly but its expansion slows as you try to fill it with more and more air. If you keep blowing air into it however, eventually the pressure inside the balloon overcomes the outside pressure and the strength of the rubber, and the balloon flies apart into pieces. \n \n Obviously this final stage does not happen nearly so rapidly with the real universe; we are set for a multi-trillion year period of ever-accelerating expansion which will leave the universe a vast, cold, dark place uniformly filled with radiation just above absolute zero. In this scenario the final, dominant force is the repulsive energy of dark energy, as opposed to gravity which would be the final dominant force in a Big Crunch scenario, which looks very unlikely.\n \n This final uniform stage may possibly form a universal Bose-Einstein condensate (these have already been created at such cold temperatures in the lab) where all the mass-energy in the condensate behaves as a single unit subject to macroscopic quantum effects, and the final dominant force would be electromagnetism.\n \n Both this theory and brane cosmology (which is horrifically abstract, involving many higher dimensions) posit that the final state of the universe may pave the way for a new Big Bang, but this is highly speculative theory and not to be accepted.

I started off reading layman's books, and recently I've started to teach myself the basics of some of the maths behind it so I can try read the more technical papers, with a view to doing a degree in astrophysics at the Open University after I finish my Music degree. \n A few books I can recommend (you may know them already):\n \n The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos both by Brian Greene\n Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed by Jim Al-Khalili\n Chaos: The Amazing Science of the Unpredictable by James Gleick\n \n Once you've got these under your belt go for Hawking's Universe in a Nutshell; it's basically A Brief History of Time rewritten to make it 'easier' but it's still the most daunting physics book out there in my opinion, and best approached after the major concepts of modern physics and cosmology have been fully digested.\n \n \nI understand the observations that the expansion of the universe is accelerating run counter to what was expected - i.e. that the gravitational attraction of dark matter would act as a brake on the speed of expansion. This is why I imagined the expanding universe gradually pulling up and 'hovering' forever in its final cold and dark state.\n\n \n Well, dark and ordinary baryonic matter did act as a brake for the first ~7 billion years, but then as the density of (both kinds of) matter dropped due to expansion, the repulsive effect of dark energy took over, and the attractive effect of matter can only continue to get weaker from that point onwards. Remember that dark energy (whatever it is) accounts for 73% of the universe, so it is not surprising that on the scale of the entire lifetime of the universe, dark energy will have a far greater effect than matter-oriented gravity. \n \n Imagine a hypothetical observer in a trillion years time. They would look back and notice a tiny discrepancy in the well-known \"accelerating expansion\" theory of the universe; that for a very brief period at its very beginning (in fact just 0.7% of the time elapsed by then), the universe expanded at a decelerating rate, before the familiar accelerating expansion began.\n \n \nWhat you say about the final uniform stage of the cosmos behaving as a single unit subject to quantum effects, does seem almost to set up the original conditions for a 'new' Big Bang triggered by a quantum fluctuation.

As I said, all current models allow for some kind of cyclical process, but the 2nd law of thermodynamics, when applied in the context of these models, still maintains that each successive universe, although starting in a low-entropy state, would have a slightly more entropic initial state than its predecessor. This implies that\n \n a) The cyclic model cannot extend infinitely far into the past, and\n \n b) Each successive universe will have a shorter lifespan than its predecessor, therefore eventually there will come a universe that exists for less than the planck time (10^-43 seconds), at which point there can be no more universes.\n \n There may be aspects of brane cosmology which resolve this, but as yet this field is beyond me!\n \n By the way, no need to thank me, writing about this stuff is enjoyable and helps me understand it more clearly than just reading about it.",

I started off reading layman's books, and recently I've started to teach myself the basics of some of the maths behind it so I can try read the more technical papers, with a view to doing a degree in astrophysics at the Open University after I finish my Music degree. \n A few books I can recommend (you may know them already):\n \n The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos both by Brian Greene\n Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed by Jim Al-Khalili\n Chaos: The Amazing Science of the Unpredictable by James Gleick\n \n Once you've got these under your belt go for Hawking's Universe in a Nutshell; it's basically A Brief History of Time rewritten to make it 'easier' but it's still the most daunting physics book out there in my opinion, and best approached after the major concepts of modern physics and cosmology have been fully digested.\n \n\n \n Three books, related to this topic, I've read over the last few months:\n \n A Short History of the Universe by Joseph Silk. (Quite difficult for non-mathematicians) \n \n Quantum Reality by Nick Herbert. (Accessible, but not a popularization)\n \n In Search of the Big Bang by John Gribbin. (A popularization that oversimplifies a lot) \n \n I had to give up on Hawking's A Brief History of Time, but I will, on your recommendation, read his Universe in a Nutshell.\n \n I also got lost in the discussion of superstrings in Greene's The Elegant Universe. So I've half a mind to ask you about string theory - but it might be a bit off topic? Lee Smolin has just published a book saying that it's a dead end in theoretical physics. \n \n James.",

Your questions and the work I will have to do to respond will undoubtedly be an enjoyable challenge! \n \n Any other physicists out there (professional or amateur!) please join in; I am certainly not the final authority on these matters!",

I'll think out what I want to say over the weekend.\n \n James.",

   "If the big bang theory is correct, that everything started from one single point and has been expanding outward in all directions since, why would we not see matter more clustered when we peer into the outer reaches of the universe?\n \n If we can detect starlight from ten billion years ago and feel confident that is what it looked like then, wouldn't we expect to see something resembling almost a soup-like formation?\n\n \n I have realised that, my description of inflationary cosmology notwithstanding, I have actually failed to accurately answer the original question of this thread. In attempting to answer the questions posed therein, I skipped a huge chunk of cosmology and went straight for an explanation of the theory which best describes why we see, on scales familiar to us, 'clusterence' for want of a better term, as opposed to the 'soup' posited in this opening post.\n \n There is a very 'simple' reason why we do not see this soup. Inflation aside, in fact most of big bang theory aside, we cannot 'see' further back than about 300K years after Time Zero due to the fact that before this time the universe and its material constituents are too dense to allow photons to travel freely through space; after this time photons decoupled from matter ie there was enough space for them to travel relatively unimpeded through space.\n \n The famous cosmic microwave background, the earliest 'map' of the universe that we have, stems from this time, which (to bring up inflation again) was already massively 'clustered' due to the post-inflation exaggeration of pre-inflation quantum fluctuations that I have already (satisfactorily?) described.\n \n Before this time (300Ky after TZero) we have no observational data. At all. We have only mathematical extrapolations based on 1) the theories which already existed and 2) subsequent observations which, amazingly, concur with theory. \n \n The 'soup' which Billsco assumes we would see if we looked back far enough did indeed exist, but we have no way of looking back this far, and in fact this soup only existed before 1 second after Time Zero, and in a very real way, in terms of what the word 'soup' implies, only before inflation took place, before about 10^-35 seconds, an unimaginably short period of time. The state of the universe at any time after inflation includes all of the 'clusterence' that we observe today.",
