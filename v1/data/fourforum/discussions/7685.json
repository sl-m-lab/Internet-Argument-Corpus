   "Though we likely won't see much about it on the news programs, the levee breaching blame in New Orleans and the implications that Bush is the bad guy seem to be washed up.\n \n \n \n \n http://www.forbes.com/technology/ebusiness/feeds/ap/2006/03/02/ap2567320.html\n \n In the hectic, confused hours after Hurricane Katrina lashed the Gulf Coast, Louisiana's governor hesitantly but mistakenly assured the Bush administration that New Orleans' protective levees were intact, according to new video obtained by The Associated Press showing briefings that day with federal officials. \n \n \"We keep getting reports in some places that maybe water is coming over the levees,\" Gov. Kathleen Blanco said shortly after noon on Aug. 29, according to the video. \"We heard a report unconfirmed, I think, we have not breached the levee. I think we have not breached the levee at this time.\" \n \n In fact, the National Weather Service received a report of a levee breach and issued a flash-flood warning as early as 9:12 a.m. that day, according to the White House's formal recounting of events the day Katrina struck. \n \n Critics have maintained the Homeland Security Department responded too slowly to the breaches, delaying repair efforts and allowing flooding to worsen. Formal reports of New Orleans' levee breaches reached the White House by 6 p.m., and the administration confirmed the damage by the next morning, according to the White House's recount. \n \n In the video of the conference call, Blanco appears uncertain about the reliability of her information and cautioned that the situation \"could change.\" \n \n Blanco said floodwaters were rising in parts of the city \"where we have waters that are 8 to 10 feet deep, and we have people swimming in there.\" \n \n \"That's got a considerable amount of water itself,\" the governor said. \"That's about all I know right now on the specifics that you haven't heard.\" \n \n The AP separately obtained video earlier from other briefings before the hurricane made landfall. That video showed U.S. officials warning that Katrina might breach levees, put lives at risk in New Orleans' Superdome and overwhelm rescuers. \n \n Before the release of the latest video, lawmakers from both parties said the pre-Katrina briefing for President Bush and top administration officials raised new questions about government response to the storm that flooded New Orleans and killed more than 1,300 people. \n \n Sen. David Vitter, R-La., said the earlier video \"makes it perfectly clear once again that this disaster was not out of the blue or unforeseeable. It was not only predictable, it was actually predicted. That's what made the failures in response - at the local, state and federal level - all the more outrageous.\" \n \n The earlier video \"confirms what we have suspected all along,\" said Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada, charging that Bush administration officials have \"systematically misled the American people.\" \n \n Reid and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California renewed their calls for an independent commission to investigate the federal response to the hurricane. \n \n The House and Senate have conducted separate investigations of the federal response, and the White House did its own investigation. House Democrats for the most part refused to participate in the House probe, insisting since last fall that an independent commission should be created to handle the probe. \n \n \"I try not to get angry, but I am plenty frustrated that we're not getting answers\" from the administration, said Rep. Charlie Melancon, D-La., one of the few Democrats who participated in the House investigation. \"If nobody was hiding anything, why did the committee not get the documents it requested? We need to use subpoenas if necessary to get those documents.\" \n \n A spokesman for Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., who headed the House investigation, said there was nothing new in the videotapes and accompanying transcripts made public Wednesday. \n \n \"Top federal, state and local officials failed to process and act on information at their disposal,\" said David Marin, the spokesman. \"We already knew that.\" \n \n But Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the ranking Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, disagreed. \n \n \"If a picture is worth a thousand words, a video must be worth a million,\" he said. \"Six months after Hurricane Katrina destroyed the homes and livelihoods of millions along the Gulf Coast, the truth about what the president knew and when he knew it has come to light.\" \n \n The earlier videotape captured a briefing, one day before Katrina stuck on Aug. 29, involving then-Federal Emergency Management Agency head Michael Brown, Bush, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and other officials. \n \n Five days after the briefing, with most of New Orleans underwater, Bush said, \"I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees.\" \n \n Presidential spokesman Trent Duffy said Wednesday that Bush \"received multiple briefings from multiple officials, and he was \"completely engaged at all times.\" \n \n The White House did not immediately respond Thursday to the renewed Democratic calls for an independent investigation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n For some thoughtful comments, see this link:\n \n \n http://www.lucianne.com/threads2.asp?artnum=263340",

I don't know where the initial information that we expected the levees to be breached came from. It may have been expressed as a fear of some participant at a meeting, but that does not mean a general concensus was reached at the meeting that the threat was valid. I would have to know exact dialog and timing to determine whether I thought Bush ignored significant opinions of advisors or was simply expressing a commonly held opinion that was held by the majority of his advisors that we didn't expect the levees to break.\n \n It appears to me that the mayor and the governor fell asleep at the wheel and wanted to shift the blame for the exponential increase in grief caused by their failure to evacuate the lowlands. As I recall, they were offered Am-Trac, had hundreds of school buses (later inundated) and simply didn't see the threat as significant enough to warrant their use.",

   "The ones I glanced at seemed to just be harping on a \"liberals suck, Bush is great\" theme. Does any specific quote convey your feelings?\nSeveral. See below. For credits, go to the second link in the OP and read.\n \n On NBC News for two days, the doofus chief investigative reporterette was too dim to distinguish the difference between water \"topping\" the levees and \"breaching\" the levees. She was using the possibility of water topping the levees as proof that Bush was \"lying\" when he said no one had supposed the levees would be breached, as if he knew better after being told the levees might be topped. Today NBC finally got it right, and they backed off the attack, though there was no apology or acknowledgement of their error.\n \n \n AND\n \n \n \n When are we going to see the conservative columnists make a critique of the Katrina analysis we have seen in the media and from the Senate and House committees? This has been a political attack on the Bush administration throughout and the Republicans have deen acting like a deer caught in the headlights. Anyone who has followed this reaction to Katrina knows that all of this emotion( and political calculation) has been fueled by the TV images of the survivors at the Superdome. But I have yet to see any attempt to determine who was making decisions about those survivors and what those decisions were. An interview with the Director of the Red Cross on Fox News at time the survivors were still at the Superdome indicated that Louisiana officials were making the decisions about how to handle the survivors. This was appropriate under the procedures in effect at that time but I have seen no attempt to examine such decisions in the analysis I have seen. This focus on when the levies were breached and who knew it is superflous.\n \n \n AND\n \n \n Here in Florida, we watch approaching storms at category 1 and above and if there's the slightest chance it will hit us, we take the clearly marked evacuation routes. The first responders in New Orleans were the NO RESPONDERS and responsibility for their catastrophe lies almost clearly on them. Protect your family and friends first.\n \n \n AND\n \n \n \n #22 is exactly right. Here is the problem in a nutshell...\"I try not to get angry, but I am plenty frustrated that we're not getting answers\" from the administration, said Rep. Charlie Melancon, D-La\".....they're asking the WRONG ADMINISTRATION FOR ANSWERS. These Politicians should be asking the PEOPLE IN CHARGE at the time, which was BLANCO AND NAGIN. I'm waiting for the Video of Nagin explaining WHY he didn't use the SCHOOL BUSSES! Then the Democrats will say it was Bush's fault because he didn't fly in Bus Drivers!\n \n \n AND\n \n \n We knew this would happen. The leftists just can't seem to realize that a good part of this country no longer relies on their puppet media for information. If one part of a video slips out and the spin is one way, then another part of the video will AND SHOULD slip out showing the actual truth. \n \n We must be ever vigilant, and NEVER allow leftists to control our country.\n \n \n AND\n \n \n BRAVO!!! Blanco cannot refute her own words on this video. \n \n ...Every time the dems & THEIR lsm attempt to revise the facts, (in other words, when they L-I-E...!), proof of the reality of WHATEVER the situation exposes their charade. 'When will they ever learn?' \n \n dems have no shame\n \n \n \n \n ***************\n \n\n I stick by my original opinion. If one, known unconfirmed report screws things up, then they weren't working right to start with. It's not like the Gov said that the levees are definately up, take it to the bank, it's a slam dunk. The report was presented as unconfirmed. If Bush's team made life or death decisions based on that then yes, they're at fault.\n I believe she said twice in a row as in a repeat announcement, that they did not think the levees had been breached. If I read correctly, this was in a video also.\n \n \n\n There's plenty of blame to go around, no argument there. But to say that the Bush bashers are wrong, that the Bush administration shouldn't carry any of the blame? No, that's going too far.\nNot even I will say the BA bares no blame in the pitiful response. Afterall, he's the one that appointed the horse expert as FEMA director. There should have been a military persoon, either a retired general or someone familiar with logistics in that seat. However, all the harping of the liberal media seems to be keyed on what can be said to tarnish the BA record.",

All levels of government have been in the crosshairs; federal, state and local, not to mention civilians acting poorly.

   "Here's my take on the video and I think Bush is the worst president ever.\n \n 1. The video is not evidence of Bush lying.\n \n The NWS guy said that it's not certain if the levees would be TOPPED.\n The levees in question WERE NOT TOPPED, they were BREACHED.\n With that being said, Bush was still lying as well as Chertoff. \n One example is the Hurricane Pam simulation of 2004. In the simulation, the levees are breached, not topped. The White House was given a copy of the report.\n \n 2. The video makes Brownie look like he actually was doing a heckuva job.\n \n The video makes Brownie look concerned and prescient and makes Bush and Chertoff look complacent. Right after that Bush went on a speaking engagement tour, strummed a guitar, and was cutting a cake for McCain.\n \n 3. This is a chopped up video that could be re-editted to \"say\" almost anything.\n \n People in TV know this is easy to do. You can always edit footage together to make people look just about any way you want them to look. Documentaries with bias do this all the time. While the footage is indeed authentic, the way it is edited together can convey to the viewer a certain attitude or emotion in the characters that may or may not exist. \n \n \n This is another example of why sometimes being a liberal can be frustrating. There are so many times when people in the media will hype something that shouldn't be hyped and in the end it makes them look stupid and hurts their cause. Notice the main cable news outlets didn't focus on the topped/breached part. The Democrat blogs (I can't call them liberal blogs) were SOOOOOO ###### miffed that the MSM \"buried\" that part of the story. They thought that they were cynically covering Bush's XXX. Not so, they are just smarter than flaming fuming blogs. They knew that hyping that would ultimately lose credibilty for them. Instead they focused on Bush's promises to be vigilant and to assist with all assets available, which didn't exactly play out. Whenever I go onto these blogs and leave comments saying \"please for the love of god, drop this, it's only going to make you look stupid\" I get called names and people automatically assume I'm a Republican operative. I guess they really want badly to look like dumbasses. It can be pretty depressing since these are the only people really standing between me and a Bushless America.",
