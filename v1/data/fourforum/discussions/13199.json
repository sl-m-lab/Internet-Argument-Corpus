Here is the historical truth and as expected, reality doesn't resemble what pinfold's account says since being the third President of the Continental Congress is very different from being the first ELECTED President of the United States of America. \n First President controversy\n Hanson has been claimed by some to have been the first President of the United States.[9]\n \n The claim that Hanson is the \"forgotten\" first President was distilled in a 1932 book by Seymour Wemyss Smith titled John Hanson - Our First President. Officially Hanson was the third President of the Continental Congress, successor to the first two men to hold the office, Samuel Huntington and Thomas McKean. He was the first to be elected to the position after the surrender of the British at Yorktown, the first to serve a full one-year term, and the first to formally use the title President of the United States in Congress Assembled.\n \n The office was in existence from 1781 to 1788, under the Articles of Confederation. It was replaced by the modern office of President of the United States when the Constitution took effect in 1789. The modern office is significantly more powerful as an executive position.

   "I have seen alot of Jesus bashing, and while I am no preacher, i feel compelled to defend him.\n \n And alot of people have problems with the church, any church etc... and maybe even religion in general...\n \n well...\n \n \n The church... as you know it, was not built by Jesus, it was built by men.\n \n Men... who could not live up to the standard of Jesus, so they use a lower one.\n \n You, should not blame Jesus for the flaws of the men who follow him.\n \n \n If you want me to justify Jesus to you, I could try, and make many arguments, but you have probubly heard them all before.\n \n Simply put, I would say that you need only accept the gift he gave to you, and that gift is salvation, accept it, embrace it, and say thankyou, and allow Jesus to come into your heart, and begin to have a personal relationship with jesus... so that in your life he can come to stand on your shoulder, and speak with you, in your mind if nothing else... or in your heart.. and can give you strength when you are weak.\n \n I can't tell you which church to go to ... or whether the words of the disciples are the words of God... how would I know?\n \n All I know is that comparitively, there is no one in history which compares to Jesus, and if nothing else, he is the greatest role model for human kind to follow, as a truly giving loving, compassionate caring leader, who taught us to love each other.\n \n As such, he is deserveing of the position of.. lord of this world.\n \n I say give yourself to him, as his servent, and you will find that he will be your friend.\n \n And if he is Messiah, then indeed, his gift and sacrfice washed the sins of humankind away, and openned the doors of heaven to us all, by proving human kind worthy of bulk salvation... so that we can all get in... if we are his friend.. his brothers.. gods children...\n \n he is holding open the door to heaven, as the light in purgatory, and when we die, we may see that light, but if we reject it... and say..\"I dont believe it\".. and if we say to Jesus at the door.. \"I reject you..\"... then that door may close on you.\n \n The fact is... once your dead.. you wont be forming any new ideas... you are what you are... so if you die.. hating Jesus.. and rejecting him.. you will come to the doors of heaven in that form... and then it is too late.\n \n I suggest you all repent for your sins, and past ways of rejection, and simply accept the gift, and while you may have no evidence of knoweldge of the truth of anything.. anything at all... you can still say.. Jesus was totally awesome.. and is your friend, and worthy of being your lord... because he was so cool.\n \n \n \n -Mosheh Thezion (This was not an endorsement of any one religion, but simply an endorsement of Jesus himself, as ruler of this earth. )\n\n \n \nAll I know is that if you read what Jesus is reported to have said by those who were not there either .... you will find it extremely difficult to argue with him.\n \n I have read it.\n \n And then, knowing how he is reprted to have lived by those who were not there.. and how he is reported to have died by those who were not there, and why he allowed himself to die... for you and me.. all of us,...\n \n Remember, these are your beliefs, not everyone's.\n \n you see that indeed... he is reported to have willingly done what no other figure in religious history has ever done.\n \n He is reported to have given himself up, as evidence of mankinds worth.\n \n I cant say it worked, how could I? Indeed, you were not there.\n \n but the reported intent.. is more awesome than any other figure in history.\n \n and if mankind seeks a role model upon which to base perfection, then we have found that perfect role model in Jesus. Perhaps, but how real is this rolemodel.\n \n Remember (again). These are your beliefs. They are not shared by everyone.\n\n \n I agree with you Smiley.\n \n I am always amused who say that it is organized religion, a product of man, that may be flawed, but the Word is what counts. Jesus is what matters.\n What this fails to recognize is that all we know about Jesus come packaged, filtered, translated, copied, redacted, edited, buffed and polished by organized religion based on writings separated from Jesus in place and time. \n \n We only know Jesus by what organized religion has decided we should know about him. The Scriptures are not solely Jesus' words, if they are at all. \n It gets worse. There are those that say the truth is in the Word. It stands for itself. The message is clear and unambiguous. \n \n Well, anyone who has bothered to glance at a page knows it is written, shall we say, poetically, and greatly open to interpretation. The proof of this is that so many people take many different messages away. Certainly, there are unmistakable themes but the details are murky. (I actually don't think ambiguity in this respect is a bad thing - many great writings are open to personal interpretations; that's why they are great.) So we have twentieth hand knowledge of Jesus presented in flowery language. Expecting certitude from that is pretty nuts.\n \n If one has had a personal revelation and a relationship with the Word, no one can gainsay that. That is simply wonderful. Good for you. But to move on from that and suggest there is some \"truth\" that can be validated externally, that simply is not the case. Enjoy your \"relationship\" with Jesus, but let's get real. The relationship is one you have decided to make and has nothing to do with anything outside yourself. Moreover, you have no business suggesting it is \"right\" and that those who disagree have missed the boat.",

Let me offer a scriptural promise which supports what you say so the nay sayers will be without excuse.\n 2Th 2:7 For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains {will do so} until he is taken out of the way.\n 2Th 2:8 Then that lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord will slay with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming;\n In the verses above, we see clearly that this is an end times prophecy. This is important to point out to show that it applies to this generation. And as the bolded shows, the Holy Spirit is here for just a limited amount of time before He withdraws once satan finally pulls out all of the stops and declares war on humanity.\n 2Th 2:9 {that is,} the one whose coming is in accord with the activity of Satan, with all power and signs and false wonders,\n This verse is speaking of the anti-christ who will come and deceive the spiritually blind and foolish who mock God and scoff at His wonder and Glory.\n 2Th 2:10 and with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved.\n 2Th 2:11 For this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false,\n 2Th 2:12 in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness.\n Note the bolded. Those verses make clear that those who reject the truth NOW, while the Holy Spirit of salvation is still here and working to save humanity as He draws us to Gods truths, will be sent a deluding influence which will once and for all time blind them from receiving Gods salvation during the tribulation period. The door is closing and they aren't even aware that a door exists. I offer this passage and explanation as a warning that the time is short, not as a declaration of condemnation since the door is still open.",
