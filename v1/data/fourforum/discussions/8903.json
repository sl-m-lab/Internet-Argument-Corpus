Or would that really require looking at each one in question?\n\n \n Three things\n \n 1) It would not be easy and for context you would have to look at each individually.\n \n 2) It is not entirely a concept of \"saved from\". It also includes the concept of \"saved to\". We are saved from, not god's wrath, as much as we are saved from our own state of incompleteness. Also it is saved from that to the state of completeness. If you want to look at the afterlife perspective then it is saved from an eternity spent separated from God to an eternity in unity with him.\n \n 3) A good starting place is in the Psalms. There you will more often find the concept specifically referring to being saved by God, although it is all over the old testament. Remember this does not refer to saving your physical life on this earth. There are some references where that is specific, but there are many where it speaks of the eternal kingdom\n \n Another item concerns the jewish concept of messiah. He was supposed to save. The name jesus (yeshua) litterally means God saves.\n \n EF",
