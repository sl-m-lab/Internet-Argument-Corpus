   "When I'm asked, \"Do you believe in God?\", that depends on what you mean by that. That's probably not a good answer. Sometimes I'll say, \"I don't believe in your God.\" Let me tell you why I don't believe in your God.\n \n Maybe you don't believe in your God. I have this nasty habit of thinking about things. I don't always make the right decision; I'm not the smartest guy on the face of the earth and sometimes I am kind of na\u00efve; sometimes pretty silly and pretty damn stupid. But, I try my best to make sense of things. I try to understand why I feel the way I do. And sometimes I can't tell you why I feel this way, it's just because I feel that way. But that's not the case with God or the devil. \n \n My God could never send an earthquake to punish people. My God would never send floods or illness' or set one people against another because of some perceived insult. He would never go through villages and kill innocent, first born just to get even or be an example to an enemy. My God would never send people out to \"smite\", or to take wordily goods, their camels and their virgins from them. My God would never do that. God is not a monster. He couldn't possibly be.\n \n Yet so often the Judea-Christian God is portrayed unacceptable to me. My God could never, ever, ever create a being who would turn into Lucifer and allow that being to exist, never. My God could never \"invent\" evil and allow it to bring misery into people's lives. My God would never punish me eternally for loving a gay person, being a gay person or punish a gay person because that's who they are. My God would never punish me eternally for falling in love with the wrong person. He would never do that. \n \n My God however, would probably punish me forever for supporting a war that was ill-conceived where millions upon millions of people were going to suffer. I think he'd punish me for not trying to do my part in getting out of office such people in power claiming themselves to be Christians. And I might be deserving of that punishment. So when I say I don't believe in your God that's what I mean. \n \n I've read the book. I'm aware of what it says. There's a lot of good in it, there's a lot on nonsense and there's a lot that isn't very good at all; things that my God could never possibly do under any circumstances or conditions. \n \n I have no way of knowing whether my God sits around in a white rob on a throne with angels playing harps but it doesn't really make any difference to me at this point in my life. I don't know if I will ever see my God. I don't know that I will ever know my God in this life or in another life. I'm not sure there is another life.\n \n I find it a bizarre concept that I was placed on this earth or my ancestors were placed on this earth by a superior being, a supreme being. And I have no way of knowing whether there is one Supreme Being or many supreme beings who are in essence my God. \n \n I hope you will think about what I wrote here. My God would never punish me forever for saying the wrong word. But he might punish me eternally for messing up this world, bringing grief and misery to people and not trying to correct it. I think my God is a whole lot better than your God but I'm not going to try to sell you on mine. Please be kind and not try to sell me yours. And don't be so quick to come down on me when I say I don't believe in your God.",
