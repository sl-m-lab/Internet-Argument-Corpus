   "I decided to take this answer to another thread in the religion forum.\n \n \n \n.\n \n But, it's nice to know you have at least been exposed to most of the nonsense. Scary aren't they?\n\n \n The intresting thing about being exposed to many different denominations, and different churches, in different parts of the country is that you see though the veil. They all have very different interpratations of the bible, different customs, and different beliefs, even with in the same denomination. Many of those who attend these churches have grown up in the churches so do not understand christianity viewed though a plural lens. I suspect that many of are christian posters here were born into the church, grew up in the same church, so only know on way of thinking. \n \n The salvation army, they are a strange bunch, there I attended classes on what is a true christian vs a false christian. They believe that the mormons, the catholics, are false christains. My father worked for them and they fired him but he would never tell me why. I deduced many years later that it was because he was gay and they found out about his activties. They also don't like the term Xmas, even though Xmas is a traditional form of christmas from the middle ages. There worship services are traditional protestant fundie service. There we sang songs about the rapture.\n \n The bapitists once again a strange bunch altar calls at the drop of a hat, in sunday school, church service, walking on to the play ground, on the sunday school bus, and any church activity. It is if they have built the whole theme of the church around the altar call. \"Come get saved\" \"Come know Jesus christ\" The one thing I never understood was what I was being saved from. I know now but it was never clearly explained. Also what was never explained is why do you have to keep getting saved over and over again. It is almost as if they believe god has a long term memory problem.\n \n The catholic church, were I was born into, several things are strange about that. Confession. I always felt wierd going into the box to tell the priest, who I now think my father was sleeping with, my sins and wrong thoughts. I could never remember the prayers, and I ended up making some stuff up because it was almost as if I were expected to come up with something.\n \n My husbands families nondenominational bible church. They believe that marriage between a man and a woman creates this strange being where the man is the head and the woman is the heart. It is also here that I heard that homosexuals and feminists were trying to destroy fatherhood. This is the only time in my life that I \"shunned\" any preacher or pastor. As a visitor to the church after the service I was standing by the door and the preacher made a beeline striaght to me, stuck out his hand and said hello. I put my hands behind my back and just looked at his outstreched hand and then ignored him. I did after about 45 sec to a min shake his hand but then he ran striaght to his office. It was later that week when the preacher went to my husbands father and asked him what was wrong with me that I had found out that I had \"shunned\" him. The wierd thing is that he was clueless. He had no idea that anti gay, anti woman sermon was to blame. \n \n I was visiting my mother in Dallas several years ago and my little brother wanted to go to church. He and I went down to this large church on the corner. The church was a nondenominational church of some variety. I don't even remember the name. It reminded me of some of the pentacostal churches you see on TV. We go in the service is going alright. Until the sermon then he starts in on how homosexuals are trying to subvert democracy and the courts are over turning the will of Gods people. This was in 1993 or 1994 right after the Colorado amendment 2 was struck down by the courts. This is the only church I walked out of.\n \n When visiting my mother in Dallas several years later, after meeting my husband, we went to the MCC church. All I can say is that it felt like Gods presence was there. This may sound wierd but I had a vision. There standing behind the pastor with his outstreached arms was Jesus. He had this loving look on his face and kept sort of beaconing me to come. In all the years of my life up to that point I have never felt the presence of God as much as I did there. It was here that I understood that my gayness is a wonderful gift and blessing from God that should be celebrated as all His gifts.\n \n I attended the MCC in Grand Rapids michigan. That was fun they had a clown ministry that served communion. Once again I felt the pesence of God and a re affermation of His gift.\n \n I have attended in Dallas one church, nondenominational, that had a gay majority membership. This one was a gay baptist type church that did altar calls but reafirmed Gods gift.\n \n I have attended a small church here in michigan that was a gay majority membership. There we worshiped in a circle and did what they call popcorn, random members of the congragation offering prayers. Once again My gift was reaffirmed.\n \n I am currently a member of a small ELCA Lutheran church. I am an openly gay man and we are an openly gay couple. My husband is the organist and a member of the council. I have taught sunday school, and have organized and led one years VBS. Several years ago an interracial couple threatened and did leave as members, if the church didn't bar my husband and myself from attending. The church council came to us and re affirmed our place in their family. \"Our vision is to be a christ centered church, extending our bounderies and accepting all people.\" The other church memebers, and the council showed their love, and lived up to our churches vision. They were not willing to cut us off because of someone elses prejudice. They said to the couple, \"we are sad to see you leave and wish you would stay but as you have been welcomed and loved here so must we continue to love the other members of our family.\" How christ centered, loving, and reaffirming is that statement?\n \n I have also atteneded many other churches, I can't remember them all. Many of the fundie churches do not offer communion. Which is strange because Jesus himself asks us \"to do this in rememberance of him\" \n \n I have gleened over the years, and this falls right in line with my elca church I now attend, is if all these christian churchs have different bibles, different interpatations of the bible, and the bible contradicts itself in many, many, many places; How can the bible be litteral history, God inspired, or God written? I am now doing Bible study on monday nights with a group that includes our pastor, and our pastors intern. We are discussing the contradictions in the bible and trying to find the message behind the words. \n \n I do not hate the fundies infact the opposite is true I love them that is why I fight them. I fight them to bring the realization they are Gods children just as I am, that theyare wrong but they can be the most wonderfull people if they would just listen to what Jesus is teaching and listen to the message without getting bogged down by the words. I am angry at them and sometimes that anger gets the best of me and I say and write things I shouldn't. I must learn to forgive that is my cross to bear.",

JP is the one who voted to degade my family and apply the fundie religious beliefs to mine and every gay persons life in the stae of Michigan. Apparently in order to be considered tolerant I have to be tolerant of intolerance.\n \n What exactly do you consider victimhood? So I should just accept that you have a right to vote upon my family, and be happy with it? Yet in your opinion I am not allowed to use my right self expression, and assembly to protest those who oppress?",

What you have is a non-legally binding relationship with another man.\n \n\n What exactly do you consider victimhood? So I should just accept that you have a right to vote upon my family, and be happy with it? \n\n Nobody voted on your mythical family; they voted on the meaning of the term marriage in Michigan. They probably wouldn't have had to do so if it wasn't for the sneaky efforts of activist gays trying to circumvent the legislative process and get judges to make gay-friendly fiat laws instead.:xcensored \n \n\n Yet in your opinion I am not allowed to use my right self expression, and assembly to protest those who oppress?\n\n I never said that you couldn't protest my daughter's wedding. I may have warned you to make sure that your healthcare insurance was paid up to date, though. :)",
