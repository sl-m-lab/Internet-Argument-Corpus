   "What is it with the eyes of organisms? Why are we (not only humans) compelled to \"look into the eyes\" of others?\n\n \n Because the eyes reveal where someone (or something) is looking. Since we have a narrow range of perception this information tells the looker important information about what we are interested in at that time. Note that many animals don't look into each others eyes (most herbivours; since they have near-360 degree vision, eyes convey almost no information), and many animals take different information from them than we do (cats for example take looking at them as hostile behaviour, and narrowing the eyes and looking away as friendly). \n \n \nThose responding please be sure to include education level, whether it is 6th grade, to multiple PhDs or MDs. This information is vital for me to form an accurate opinion.\n\n \n How is this information vital, or even useful, in any way? The facts are the facts no matter who profers them.",

It is easy to attribute social explanations to humans, but the question I propose pertains to all organisms.\n\n \n I saw a documentary on dogs. They showed that short-nose dogs had a narrower feild of vision but could see more detail in that field. Longer nose dogs had a wider field of vision, which is better for hunting because the slightest movement will attract their attention; but conversely makes them less quite then the short-nosed varieties. The short-nosed ones are better suited for close human company; lap-dogs form part of this group. Short noses are connected to concentrating; at least in dogs\n \n \nI am curious what others think.
