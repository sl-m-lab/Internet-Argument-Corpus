   "Saudi to build 8-billion-dollar economic city in north by Suleiman Nimr \n Tue Jun 13, 6:41 PM ET\n \n \n \n HAIL, Saudi Arabia (AFP) - Saudi Arabia unveiled plans to build a northern economic city at a cost of eight billion dollars (6.4 billion euros), the latest massive project in the oil-rich kingdom. \n \n The city, announced by King Abdullah at a night ceremony in Hail, 720 kilometers (450 miles) north of Riyadh, will be built over 10 years and host agricultural and mineral industries, an education zone and a residential area with 30,000 housing units.\n \n Saudi Arabia, reaping a windfall from record high oil prices, announced in December a plan to build the \"King Abdullah Economic City\" north of the Red Sea port of Jeddah with investments of 26.6 billion dollars.\n \n The \"Prince Abdul Aziz bin Musaed Economic City,\" named after the first governor of the Hail region, an agricultural area rich in mineral resources that counts some 600,000 inhabitants, will have its own airport, a railway service and a dry dock, according to a leaflet and film released at the ceremony.\n \n The city will cost 30 billion riyals (eight billion dollars), according to a source in Rakisa Holding, the company which will oversee the project along with the Saudi investment authority SAGIA and the High Commission for Hail Development.\n \n Some 80,000 people are expected to take up residence in the new city, which will have business and leisure centers.\n \n Extending over 156 million square meters, it will also house 3,000 office units and a \"logistical supply and services center.\"\n \n The venture, whose cost was confirmed by other officials at the launch, is part of efforts to boost less developed regions of the Gulf country and was announced by the Saudi monarch after a visit to the oil-rich Eastern Province during which a number of economic projects were launched.\n \n \"The state is making sure to allocate a large part of the budget surplus to development projects in the regions which did not get their full share,\" Abdullah told Hail residents attending the ceremony.\n \n The planned economic city will provide \"a strong boost to development in the area,\" he said, adding that it will create 30,000 jobs.\n \n Saudi Arabia posted a record budget surplus of 57 billion dollars in 2005 on the back of surging crude prices and is channeling billions into development projects.\n \n But Riyadh is still struggling to provide work for its unemployed nationals despite a \"Saudization\" policy whereby employers have to hire a specific percentage of locals, and it continues to rely heavily on some six million expatriate workers, mostly poorly paid Asians.\n \n Unofficial estimates put the unemployment rate at around 20 percent of the male population, while only 10 percent of women of working age have a job in the conservative Muslim kingdom.\n \n During his visit to Hail, King Abdullah is also due to lay the cornerstone for the first university in the area.\n\n \n See, these high gas prices are stimulating the economy...just not ours.",
