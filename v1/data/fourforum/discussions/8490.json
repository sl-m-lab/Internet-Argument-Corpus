   "I don't know if anybody has been following the Cash for Honours scandal in the UK, but just recently the chief fund raiser for Labour(and a close personal friend of Tony Blair's) was arrested by the Police as part of their Investigation.\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5174938.stm\n \n Now in my opinion this stinks, it seems like if a person donates(or loans) some money to the Labour Party he will get some kind of honour and may even get a seat in the House of Lords which will allow that person to vote on legislation.\n \n Do you think the PM will get caught up in this scandal ?\n \n Also how do you think ordinary members of the Labour Party feel ? \n \n Their party was setup to fight the corner of the working man but it seems with this scandal that the Party only represents the rich.",

Peter Mandelson's indescritions, Dodgy Dossier(Iraq War), Dr David Kelly's Death, John Prescott affair and now this. The Labour Government came into power in 1997 because of Tory sleaze, Tony Blair said that they need to be whiter than white in order to gain the trust of the people.\n \n This also goes to the heart of our political system, not only are the Labour Party in trouble the other two(Tories and Lib Dems) are in the same boat.\n \n http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/index.html\n \n The link above is a good read.",

   "British Council (BC) commits quite noble mission of providing help to cultural development all over Europe. In Lithuania and France it meets engagements of cultural department of British embassy and use its diplomatic status in absolutely non-cultural interests. Under pretence of initiating of raw of projects of 'promoting diversity and inclusion in Our Europe' BC with all its might is 'diversifying' ranks of local criminals with former Chechen militants.\n 'Good' officials of BC assign really fantastic sums for naturalization of those shady characters in Lithuania and France. And those 'poor victims' of war with their rich military experience become fighting force of different criminal groups and performers of explosions and other acts of terrorism in their new homelands and other EU countries.\n The question remains: whose will is BC carries out and what aims is their customer pursuing? For I doubt that it is their own initiative. Imho there is only one rather big rival of EU that wants to weaken it as much as possible. That's USA. Americans always have been unscrupulous in their aiming to absolute world power. And such methods of acting resemble much their own.",

   "Hello! here, read this guardian.co.uk/nuclear/article/0,,2238329,00.html Ministers give nuclear power the green light.\n I wonder what Gordon Brown was thinking about when he decided to sacrifice british environmental security and health of british people rather than patching up firm relations with reliable suppliers of traditional energy sources like, say for example, russia. The thing is that - as it was said in the article I linked to above - british government adopted a decision to build a \"new generation of nuclear power stations\" that will be allegedly providing Britain with \"clean, secure and affordable\" energy. Well, as for me, I see that Brown disregards the disastrous rise of radiation pressure in the surrounding water area in the 80's which took place mainly thanks to british atomic scientists and their nuclear researches. I say that there is no safe nuclear plant! Every nuclear station that gets built in Britain may sooner or later become a timebomb! Besides, nuclear plants are a very attractive target for terrorists of all kinds, which is exactly important in the view of incompetence of british security services.",

I wish Nicola Sarcozy did same sort of thing in France. \n I hope you are well aware of the notorious London's courtesy with some marginal and criminal men fled from different countries (Russia and some other, European as well). There are even Islamic terrorists among them including terrorists of Chechen descent. Fancy, BC is no stranger to it. To be more exact British secret services are exploiting BC to render help to those bastards who explode bombs and kill people in European land, France in particular. I suspect that all those Muslim riots in Paris and other locations were due to that British involvement. France's dominance in Europe has always been major irritant for highly ambitious and arrogant Brits! BC in France enjoys diplomatic status, which is in fact good enough cover for conducting espionage and subversive activities here. \n London would better stop fooling us with their tales about 'humanitarian and educational role of BC'. Though I can't but sympathize with those true British teachers and other BC personnel who are used as a cover and may stay unaware of BC shadowy activities.",
