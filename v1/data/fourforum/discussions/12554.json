   "What this ##### did should have no relevance to any gun control issue anywhere,by anybody. \n Responsible citizens who own guns and keep them in their homes for protection, know all the pros and cons that go along with their decision.\n I`m sure these kinds of citizens far out number the citizens like Mr. Spector.\n Tied to Hollywood for something popular years ago, that nobody even remembers now, once was movie star or producers or whatever , \n but now is nothing more than an alcoholic,paranoid schizophrenic,with a distorted sense of reality,\n who had an obsession for Ms.Clarkson that eventually ended in murder.\n Of course the fact he was a gun user was blown out of proportion.\n Why is it you never hear story`s of people defending themselves against intruders by blowing them away ?\n Why doesn't this make the news on every channel or front page of every paper?\n how about a headline like\n \"Single mother of three saves her children s lives by confronting intruders with a gun!! \n yeah that`ll be the day.",
