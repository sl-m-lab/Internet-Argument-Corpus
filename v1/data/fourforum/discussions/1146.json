We have always highly prized individual freedoms and feel that government, although necessary for the protection of society in general, in theory must be kept to a minimum. That may sometimes come across as loathing our country but very few Americans loathe their government. And yes Americans are proud of their country, and that&#8217;s not just right-wing Americans, and sometimes we express that feeling so that it offends others. But my experience has been that for most Americans, it is unintentional when that happens.\n \n Very few Americans are &#8220;heavily armed&#8221;. Because we are a two party political system, the politicians tend to want to emphasize the differences so they can get re-elected. Most Americans have views that fall on both sides of our political spectrum. And probably most Americans feel that although their government is not the best it can be, it is the best at this time compared to other countries because we have so much personal freedoms. That of course can be debated because citizens in a lot of countries now have a lot of personal freedoms. But I was trying to answer your question.",

The very nature of this bulletin board is American - hence the debate on the 'Civil War' was started up by the administrators with 'was it slavery?' type questions.\n \n This assumes that we're talking about the American Civil War, and no other. The 'Civil War' means something else to a Brit, or a Spaniard etc. But the administrators just took it for granted that everyone would understand about US history. Hence I stopped the argument on that by throwing in a comment about Parliament vs. King Charles I.\n \n Same with issues such as 'civil rights' (not such an issue here in Australia)*\n Seat-belts - every state here has mad it compulsory\n Gun control - very much a US issue.\n \n This is, of course, not to suggest that Americans should create a board with all other nations in mind, but they should be aware that outsiders are going to butt in with our heathen opinions, now and then.\n \n \n *Not to say that it shouldn't be.",

   "A number of right-wing Americans, all proudly boasting of their national greatness, never-the-less feel that unless they are personally heavily armed, their politicians will steal from them.\n \n This seems to me a paradox, loving and loathing one's own government.\n \n Why is this so?\n\n Maybe i am an obsessed Orwellian but i think he covers this topic perfectly in this paradox you are talking about is what Orwell called \"doublethink\" or -verb to have two contradicting ideas in your head at the same time but suppressing one to fit the majority. Well we all read 1984 we can see what doublethink ultimately does to the world.",
