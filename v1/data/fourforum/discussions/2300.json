   "I was wondering what everyone thought about the rules of war, specifically the ban on chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons.\n \n Personally, I feel that the main thing they accomplish is drastically lengthening wars and dramatically increasing casualties. -Think about it, how fast would the Vietnam war have been over if we'd dropped a nuke on Hanoi and offered a treaty?",

   "THe ban on these weapons is roughly equivelant to incumbent protection laws. The big countries that are already in power want to stay that way. Chemical and bio weapons (not to mention nukes) tend to level the playing field between the big nations and the smaller ones. \n \n While a nuke on Hanoi followed by a treaty offer might have saved a lot of lifes, it leaves the US open to a nuclear attack on washinton, New York, and Los Angels as the opening shots on an anti US war.\n \n I do think we are going to see a lot more nuclear armed countries in the next few decades. The world has been paying attention, and people saw how we treated Iraq, who posed no imminent threat as opposed to how we treated N korea, who we believe actually does. \n \n Chem/bio capability is roughly the same as nuclear, except in scale.",

   "I feel that the only wars in which wmds would be used is in wars between a country that has then and a country that doesn't. The difference between Iraq and N Korea is that Iraq is a potential threat, but N Korea is a \"imminent\" (in quotes meaning that they are a real threat now, as opposed to war being unavoidable) threat, and has to be handled accordingly.",

   "WMD are a defense against things like the war of Iraq, the defending country could use a nuke in retaliation for the attack and know that there is no way a western power would use one back. Look at the level of negative support there was for a conventional war, there is no way they could use a nuclear weapon and keep the moral hihg ground that is vital to the way western powers fight.\n \n Not really gun control though, though not sure were else this would go.",

   "With NBCs you can have a war get out of hand very quickly and have no possible way to recover from it. With conventional war you can certainly have massive casualties but at the end of the day the cities are still there and the Plague isn't sweeping the globe. Preventing the use of NBCs isn't a way to lengthen wars, it is a way to ensure that we don't destroy ourselves.\n \n I do see the problem with not allowing the use of NBCs against a Middle Eastern nation who may choose to use them on us. I agree that no western power would retaliate with nuclear weapons if North Korea was to use a nuke on them. They would turn up the heat on the country and ensure that they lose in a conventional style but they wouldn't just retaliate with nuclear force. This prevents the nuclear threat of the US or Russia from being of any concern to rogue nations.",
