Also it's perfectally fine to say duck, or muck, or buck. But if I say the F sound at the start, for some reason it's a \"bad\" word. It's funny how most of the words that are banned are related to sex or bodily functions, yet the word sex is fine. Now I think THAT is f***ed up.\n \n Which brings to the next thing. Everyone knows what that last sentence meant, so why is it that with the *'s it's fine, but if I put the words u-c-k (sorry to people who didn't know what replaced the stars :)) in there the admin for this site would most likely warn me or just ban me and certainly edit the post.

It is he context in which they are used, and the person who uses them that give them a good or bad connotation.\n\n \n Even though that is true, when being used the \"no-no\" words are usually used in a way that is offensive moreso than other synonyms. For example, people almost never use the word buttocks to call someone else when they are angry. They are more likely to use the word a$$. People think by making the most popular offensive words censored then it will make the offenses decrease, and sometimes it is true. If someone will get fined by calling someone else a dumbf**k then they will be less likely to say anything because using a substitute, such as dummy, just sounds stupid. This isn't the case in most situations, but hey, it isn't that hard to just use another word or make up a new insult. \n \n And Matthew S., you jump at every chance to try and make the church look bad. It's rather immature. If I did the same thing about gays, then you'd end up looking like a bloody rectal wart on a bovine's backside (See what I mean? New insults are easy.). It's easy to try and make people look bad. Why don't you try intelligent conversation for once?",
