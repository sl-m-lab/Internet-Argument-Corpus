   "debating virgin birth is futile. even though you prove that it cannot happen (which I doubt you can) how will you show that it did not happen.\n\n \n Debate seldom proves anything, it just gives thoughts to those that have an open mind and are interested in hearing both sides. \n \n \n \n remember, the argument \"POOF! Goddidit!\" (thanks lurch) is the ultimate answer that can never be countered\n\n \n If you are going to use that as your counter, then why don't you just counter that God created everything 5 minutes ago with intact memories? It can't be countered for those that are dogmatic in their beliefs but that applies to every debate. If you believe the sun rotates around the earth because \"POOF! Goddidit!\", then nothing anyone can say will counter that. But most people take into account a little reason and logic.\n \n \nyou might be safer on a topic that involves reasoning and research, or even philosphy. but I'd stay away from the supernatural if I were you... \n\n \n But you're not me so I'll stick with what I decide to do. Besides I WOULD stay away from the supernatural. If the supernatural was going to be brought into the debate, my opponent would do the supernaturaling. :)",

I'm just waiting for a good debate challenge like everybody else. the topic of Virgin Birth is going be a short debate no matter how you set it up. \n \n for instance, say I'm debating against you in the defence of the possibility of Virgin birth, but you set the parameters. if you say that supernatural considerations can be brought into the discussion, then I'll simply say \"POOF!

In fact there is no evidence to substantiate the supernatural. It's a statement of belief. That's why my belief that it didn't happen is just as good as your belief that it did happen. Once you get past that, then there may or may not be evidence that it did or did not happen. It's like you saying there is a God and the atheist saying no there isn't. Neither can prove anything just by stating it.\n \n On the C vs E section the creationist believe the world was created supernaturally. Yet we have quite long and lively debates even though they believe that.\n \n But let's get back to the basics here. You are arguing that you can't have a debate, or at least it will be very short, about the virgin birth. If someone agrees to debate, I'll prove you wrong.",
