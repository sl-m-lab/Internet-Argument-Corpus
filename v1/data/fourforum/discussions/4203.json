   "It's certainly looking as if the vote in Iraq is turning out to be a success. The people there are hungry for democracy and are excited to be able to vote. The Iraq national security advisor said the was the greatest day in the history of that country.\n \n It is certainly easy to second-guess the decision to occupy the country and and Bush's desire to spread democracy in the world when things are not going as well as we would like and when troops are dying. But the truth is, at the end of the day, it is good for people to be free. Why would we not want to do what we can to help spread democracy throughout the world?\n \n That doesn't mean military action is warranted in every case. In fact the president himself has made it clear on multiple occassions that it wouldn't be. People should not automatically assume that just because we chose military action in one country, we would do it in every case. \n \n I think it is time for our country to stop being so self-centered when it comes to democracy. Other people in other parts of the world are hungry for it, as the Iraqi elections are making clear. So many times I've heard anti-Bush people, with their glass-half-empty attitude trying to make sure everyone has doubts that these elections will be successful. \"There'll be civil war,\" or \"it won't last,\" seems to be the popular skeptical message. What has happened to our desire to see people be free? Why are we not all behind the effort to allow Iraqis to vote? For the women to have rights? For the people to be free? Shouldn't we all be supporting this?\n \n The question that pops up over and over from anti-war people (and mostly anti-Bush people) is \"is it worth it?\" For me, the answer is, without a doubt. After all, we are talking about freedom. It comes with a price, and we had our revolution over 200 years ago. Let's not be selfish with it.",

Waving the flag creates emotion and emotion dislodges rational thinking. Throw in mythology as a personal driver and any semblence of rational thinking completely disappears.

We chose to ignore the inspectors. The problem here was not \"faulty intelligence\", but failure of US (and some other coutnries) officials to be able to pick what was real and what was bull. We chose to believe Chalibi, who had not been in Iraw for years, over our own inspectors. This was just stupid.\n \n As far as the election goes, it is still too soon to say anything at all about them. If they go the way afghanistans did, we have effectively killed a whole bunch of people and spent a ton of money for nothing (since in afghanistan the governement currently controls less than 20% of the country). \n \n Until we see the results of the elections, and how Iraqis respond to them, any contemplations regarding how sucessful they were is moot. Both the Shia and the Sunnis primary objection to the elections is that they were rigged since only people that Americans picked were getting any air time on the state run television and radio stations (this is how we rigged the Afghani elections as well). \n \n The Shiites solution ot this was to blow things up. The Sunnis used their religous networks in an attempt to counteract the propoganda on the television and radios. \n \n If the Shia were sucessful in their campaign, I think the elections will prove to be a postive step. If they were not, and the election results show that the winners are basically the result of the US picks and our propoganda efforts, I think the elections will be the start of a new wave of violence.\n \n Considering that polls in Iraq show that if allawi (the guy we appointed as president) was up for election tomorrow, he would loose in all districts and still win the election since other players are regional in nature and cannot get any media exposure, I think that any real optimism needs to be guarded.",

When the Shia were having an equally good time blowing things up, there was quite a bit that suggested collaboration between the Sunni and the shia, even the fundamentalists. Whis suggests that, if the elections do go badly in the long run, the US AMY manage to do what Saddam never could, which is to unite the Shia and the Sunnis in a common cause (to kill Americans). \n \n It seems that no matter which way this ends up going, we loose. It is simply a matter of deciding how long it will take for us to loose. Best case scenario for the short term is the Shia end up feeling they are represented fairly. this would curb short ter violence (except by the sunnis) but almost gaurantee that in the long term we end up with an Iraq with close ties to Iran. We certainly don't want this.\n \n If, on the other hand, the Shia don't feel they were fairly represented, we end up in a situation where they are killing US soldiers in the street. Of course, this way I think a civil war in the short term would be unlikely since the Shia and the Sunnis would be on the same side. \n \n I don't see the Kurds as being an issue, sinc ethey seem content to sit there up in the norht and prepare for a run at an independant state using their current territory in Iraq and annexing whatever else they need form turkey.

   "I would agree with various other people posting here that democracy in Iraq was not the stated goal of our invasion. It was Iraq's WMDs, its supposed ties to terrorists and the resulting hypothetical threat to our country. As we have seen, the WMDs simply were not a reality. Neither were the terrorist connections. I can agree that it is possible that spreading democracy through military means can be a positive goal but under certain conditions:\n \n 1) American people had to understand that liberating Iraqis was the main goal and be willing to make the sacrifice. This is not the case. Most people supported the war since they thought that Saddam posed a threat to us. Apparently, a large majority thought that he had some responsibility for the 9/11 attacks. I highly doubt that Americans would have supported the war if it were only to free the Iraqis. \n \n 2) The Iraqis themselves had to want to gain their freedom through the means of our military invasion. I am sure that a number of Iraqis did look positively on our invasion, as a desperate measure to topple a dictator that looked otherwise too entrenched. But I highly doubt that the majority of Iraqis would have supported such an option - partly due to simple national pride and partially due to distrust of US intentions.\n \n 3) Even if the first two conditions apply, an invasion has to be launched intelligently. Our military power is unrivaled and we easily defeated the official Iraqi army, but we were woefully underprepared to run the country in the interrim - as shown by the initial looting, the long-term lack of services (electricity, etc), and the continuing insurgency. Either Bush was openly lying about how Iraqis would welcome us or he let himself be fooled - both speak ill of his capabilities.",
