   "\"Legalizing Same-Sex Marriage\n Will Increase Prevalence of Homosexuality:\n Research Provides Significant EvidenceBy Trayce Hansen, Ph.D.\n \n Legalizing Same-Sex Marriage Will Increase Prevalence of Homosexuality: Research Provides Significant Evidence\n \n \"An accumulation of research from around the world finds that societies which endorse homosexual behavior increase the prevalence of homosexuality in those societies. The legalization of same-sex marriage--which is being considered by voters in several U.S. states--is the ultimate in societal endorsement and will result in more individuals living a homosexual lifestyle.\n \n Extensive research from Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and the United States reveals that homosexuality is primarily environmentally induced. Specifically, social and/or family factors, as well as permissive environments which affirm homosexuality, play major environmental roles in the development of homosexual behavior.\n \n A closer look at the research:\n Twin study investigations of homosexuality were recently conducted in both Sweden and Finland. Such twin studies compare rates of homosexual behavior between different sibling groups who share varying degrees of genetic similarity (i.e., identical twins versus non-identical twins). By comparing such rates, twin studies help sort out the extent to which homosexual behavior is genetic and/or environmental. For instance, if homosexuality is genetic, then in cases where one identical twin is homosexual the co-twin should be homosexual nearly 100% of the time because identical twins share 100% of their genes.\n \n But that is not what these two large-scale Scandinavian studies found. Both studies revealed that when one identical twin was homosexual the other twin was homosexual only 10% or 11% of the time. Such findings indicate that homosexuality is not genetically determined.\n \n Instead of genetic factors, these Scandinavian studies concluded that unique environmental factors play the largest role in the development of homosexual behavior. The question as to which specific environmental factors contribute to homosexuality was not answered by these studies although some conclusions are offered by Danish and American research data to be discussed later in this article.\n \n But first, it should be noted that although the Swedish and Finnish twin studies are among the best to date, they still have wide margins of error. In fact, the margins of error are so wide it remains entirely possible that genetic factors play no role in the development of homosexuality. That remains to be determined, but what has been resolved is that the primary factor in the development of homosexuality is environmental.\n \n A Danish research investigation studied two million adults living in Denmark, a country where same-sex marriage has been legal since 1989. This study uncovered a number of specific environmental factors that increase the probability an individual will seek a same-sex rather than an opposite-sex partner for marriage.\n \n For Danish men, the environmental factors associated with higher rates of homosexual marriage include an urban birthplace and an absent or unknown father. Significantly, there was a linear relationship between degree of urbanization of birthplace and whether a man chose homosexual or heterosexual marriage as an adult. In other words, the more urban a man's birthplace, the more likely he was to marry a man, while the more rural a man's birthplace, the more likely he was to marry a woman.\n \n For Danish women, the environmental factors related to increased likelihood of homosexual marriage include an urban birthplace, maternal death during adolescence, and mother-absence.\n Interestingly, this Danish research finds that urban birthplace and separation from the same-sex parent both were associated with same-sex marriage for men as well as women. (The latter finding supports psychological theories that have long asserted homosexuality is related to childhood problems--real or perceived--with the same-sex parent). In summary, this study finds that environmental factors that contribute to the development of homosexuality can be social and/or familial.\n \n Finally, an American research study--the most comprehensive and representative survey of sexual behavior in America--reported its findings concerning homosexuality. The results of this study also support an environmental theory of homosexuality, not a genetic one. In particular, this survey identified specific types of environments that increase the likelihood of homosexual behavior. The authors describe these environments as \"congenial\" to the development of homosexuality.\n \n For American men, the environmental factor most related to homosexual behavior was the degree of urbanization during the teenage years. Specifically, boys who lived in large urban centers between the ages of 14 and 16 were three to six times more likely to engage in homosexual behavior than were boys who lived in rural communities during those same ages. The authors offer the following possibility: \"an environment that provides increased opportunities for and fewer negative sanctions against same-gender sexuality may both allow and even elicit expression of same-gender interest and sexual behavior (p.308).\" Note the word \"elicit.\" These researchers believe that growing up in a more pro-homosexual region may evoke or draw out homosexual behavior in young men. The implication is that some homosexual men who were reared in urban centers would not have become homosexual if reared in non-urban centers. The authors explain, \"the environment in which people grow up affects their sexuality in very basic ways (p.309).\"\n \n For American women, the environmental factor most associated with a homosexual or bisexual identity was a higher level of education. And though that was also true for men, the pattern for women was more dramatic. For instance, a woman with a college degree was nine times more likely to identify herself as non-heterosexual than a woman with only a high school diploma. The specific elements that create this marked difference are unclear, but the researchers don't believe it's simply due to higher reporting of non-heterosexuality by more educated individuals. They believe one explanation is the fact that with more acceptance, even encouragement, of homosexuality at universities, more university women embrace a non-heterosexual lifestyle. For an example of how that might develop, see Dennis Prager's article entitled, \"College Taught Her Not To Be a Heterosexual.\"\n \n Based on the findings of this American research study, environments that sanction and/or promote homosexuality induce more individuals to engage in homosexual behavior.\n \n Conclusion:\n All of the aforementioned research studies from four different countries, each utilizing large, countrywide samples, reveal that homosexual behavior is not genetically determined. Rather, the data find that human sexuality is malleable, and environmental experiences and influences can and do shape its expression. Moreover, these findings are supported by decades of anthropological and sociological evidence that reveal that rates of homosexual behavior fluctuate--sometimes greatly--with changes in the social, cultural, and legal climate. The more an environment affirms or encourages same-sex sexuality--whether an urban center or a university campus--the more homosexuality there will be in that setting.\n \n Social and cultural norms, as well as legal regulations, influence human behavior including sexual behavior. So not surprisingly, as the United States and other Western Countries have become increasingly pro-homosexual--socially, politically, and legally--they have experienced an upward trend in the number of individuals engaging in homosexual behavior. That trend will continue if we move beyond mere tolerance of homosexual behavior (which is appropriate) to formally honoring it by legalizing same-sex marriage.\"\n \n ###\n \n \"References:\n Butler, A.C.

The findings were presented here at the American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference and Exhibition.\n \n \"The vast consensus of the studies is that children of same-sex parents do as well as children whose parents are heterosexual in every way,\" Dr. Perrin said. \"In some ways, children of same-sex parents actually may have advantages over other family structures.\"\n \n It has been estimated that one to six million children are being reared by committed lesbian or gay couples in this country. Some children were born to a heterosexual couple and later raised by a same-sex couple; others were placed in foster homes, were adopted, or conceived through a surrogate mother through artificial insemination.\n \n Previous studies of same-sex parenting have been criticized for being biased, but Dr. Perrin said the research team was extremely careful to select only solid, evidence-based research for review.\n \n Based on nine studies from 1981 to 1994 of 260 children, aged three to 11 years, reared by either heterosexual mothers or same sex-mothers after divorce, the researchers found there was no difference in intelligence of the children, type or prevalence of psychiatric disorders, self-esteem, well-being, peer relationships, or parental stress. \"The children all had a similar emotional experiences with divorce,\" she said.\n \n What they did find was that after divorce children being reared by lesbian mothers had more contact with fathers than children reared by divorced heterosexual mothers, Dr. Perrin said. \"There are interesting suggestions that these children are more tolerant of differences.\"\n \n A separate longitudinal study of 37 children of 27 divorced lesbian mothers and an equal number of children with divorced heterosexual mothers found no differences in behavior, adjustment, gender identity, and peer relationships.\n \n \"What is exciting about this study was that they followed the children 11 years later when they became adults,\" Dr. Perrin said. \"But they still found no difference in adjustment, self-esteem, psychiatric or psychological problems, family relationships, or in identifying sexual orientation.\"\n \n Four other large studies of more than 100 couples that evaluated children either born or adopted into families found that same-sex parents were more likely to have contact with extended family for social support as well as a more equal division of labor in the home. However, children of same-sex parents did experience some stigmatization.\n \n \"The researchers found no differences in the parents other than that lesbian couples share household and child care tasks more equitably,\" said Dr. Perrin. \"The children of lesbian couples also appeared to be less aggressive, more nurturing to peers, more tolerant of diversity, and more androgynous,\" playing with toys for both boys and girls.\n \n A further analysis of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health used randomly selected representative data from 44 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. The study compared children living with two women in a \"marriage-like\" relationship to teenagers living with two heterosexual parents.\n \n The study showed that the adolescents were similar in intrapersonal adjustments such as self-esteem, depression, and anxiety. They also were similar in school success, family relationships, and neighborhood integration, Dr. Perrin said.\n \n \"What is striking is that there are very consistent findings in these studies,\" she concluded. \"But further study conducted in a long-term systematic manner in community samples needs to be conducted.\"\n \n Dr. Perrin pointed out that \"as pediatricians we have a lot of different kinds of roles.

   "I've come to the conclusion that SoC will ignore the challenges, so I'm going to just cut to the chase by proving him wrong.\n The APA has NOT forbidden \"reparative therapy\" in the past.\n The \"self-determination\" policy IS NOT NEW.\n (Chicago, August 14, 1997). The Council of Representatives of the American Psychological Association (APA) has passed a resolution affirming four basic principles with regard to treatments to alter sexual orientation, so-called conversion or reparative therapies.\n \n These principles are:\n \n * Homosexuality is not a mental disorder and the APA opposes all portrayals of lesbian, gay and bisexual people as mentally ill and in need of treatment due to their sexual orientation; \n \n * Psychologists do not knowingly participate in or condone discriminatory practices with lesbian, gay and bisexual clients; \n \n * Psychologists respect the rights of individuals, including lesbian, gay and bisexual clients to privacy, confidentiality, self-determination and autonomy; \n \n * Psychologists obtain appropriate informed consent to therapy in their work with lesbian, gay and bisexual clients. \n \n The resolution further states that the APA \"urges all mental health professionals to take the lead in removing the stigma of mental illness that has long been associated with homosexual orientation.\" APA Resolution on \"Reparative Therapy\"\n \n \n Second:\n SoC repeatedly claims that NARTH (and his article(s)) are \"professional\".\n But in looking at them, they fail that on multiple fronts. I would be genuinely surprised if this editorial was ever published, because it demonstrates a variety of scientific fallacies and failure to understand how things REALLY work...\n \n For example...\"Twin study investigations of homosexuality were recently conducted in both Sweden and Finland. Such twin studies compare rates of homosexual behavior between different sibling groups who share varying degrees of genetic similarity (i.e., identical twins versus non-identical twins). By comparing such rates, twin studies help sort out the extent to which homosexual behavior is genetic and/or environmental. For instance, if homosexuality is genetic, then in cases where one identical twin is homosexual the co-twin should be homosexual nearly 100% of the time because identical twins share 100% of their genes.\"\n Note the last sentence.\n We could just as easily say \"For instance, if homosexuality is ENVIRONMENTAL, then in cases where one identical twin is homosexual the co-twin should be homosexual *at no greater frequency than the general population and/or other siblings*.\"\n But the study DID NOT find that to be true either. Twins have been proven, via multiple research studies, to have a HIGHER rate of shared homosexuality than the general population.\n \n To cut to the chase and expose the flaw, a REAL scientist with knowledge in this field of study would realize that BOTH environment AND genetics play a role. It's not an \"either/or\" situation. If it were, I just proved that it's neither!\n \n The APA has long realized that there is a COMBINATION of genetics AND environment that play a role. The author seems clueless on this fundamental aspect of behavioral studies. The author fails to accurately relay that the twin study she pretends to quote DOES CONFIRM a combination of genetics and environment.\n A professional would not make such a mistake...",

The Council of Representatives of the American Psychological Association (APA) has passed a resolution affirming four basic principles with regard to treatments to alter sexual orientation, so-called conversion or reparative therapies.\n \n These principles are:\n \n * Homosexuality is not a mental disorder and the APA opposes all portrayals of lesbian, gay and bisexual people as mentally ill and in need of treatment due to their sexual orientation; \n \n * Psychologists do not knowingly participate in or condone discriminatory practices with lesbian, gay and bisexual clients; \n \n * Psychologists respect the rights of individuals, including lesbian, gay and bisexual clients to privacy, confidentiality, self-determination and autonomy; \n \n * Psychologists obtain appropriate informed consent to therapy in their work with lesbian, gay and bisexual clients. \n \n The resolution further states that the APA \"urges all mental health professionals to take the lead in removing the stigma of mental illness that has long been associated with homosexual orientation.\" APA Resolution on \"Reparative Therapy\"\n \n \n Second:\n SoC repeatedly claims that NARTH (and his article(s)) are \"professional\".\n But in looking at them, they fail that on multiple fronts. I would be genuinely surprised if this editorial was ever published, because it demonstrates a variety of scientific fallacies and failure to understand how things REALLY work...\n \n For example...\"Twin study investigations of homosexuality were recently conducted in both Sweden and Finland. Such twin studies compare rates of homosexual behavior between different sibling groups who share varying degrees of genetic similarity (i.e., identical twins versus non-identical twins). By comparing such rates, twin studies help sort out the extent to which homosexual behavior is genetic and/or environmental. For instance, if homosexuality is genetic, then in cases where one identical twin is homosexual the co-twin should be homosexual nearly 100% of the time because identical twins share 100% of their genes.\"\n Note the last sentence.\n We could just as easily say \"For instance, if homosexuality is ENVIRONMENTAL, then in cases where one identical twin is homosexual the co-twin should be homosexual *at no greater frequency than the general population and/or other siblings*.\"\n But the study DID NOT find that to be true either. Twins have been proven, via multiple research studies, to have a HIGHER rate of shared homosexuality than the general population.\n \n To cut to the chase and expose the flaw, a REAL scientist with knowledge in this field of study would realize that BOTH environment AND genetics play a role. It's not an \"either/or\" situation. If it were, I just proved that it's neither!\n \n The APA has long realized that there is a COMBINATION of genetics AND environment that play a role. The author seems clueless on this fundamental aspect of behavioral studies. The author fails to accurately relay that the twin study she pretends to quote DOES CONFIRM a combination of genetics and environment.\n A professional would not make such a mistake...\n\n Um, you just posted it, if it is NOT a mental disorder or environmental disorder as your lilst claims, then how can therapy work? Are you even reading what you post here? Go read Dutchie post 36, he says there should not be reparative therapy, you say it is ok with APA, so which is it?\n \n These principles are:\n \n * Homosexuality is not a mental disorder and the APA opposes all portrayals of lesbian, gay and bisexual people as mentally ill and in need of treatment due to their sexual orientation; \n \n * Psychologists do not knowingly participate in or condone discriminatory practices with lesbian, gay and bisexual clients; \n \n * Psychologists respect the rights of individuals, including lesbian, gay and bisexual clients to privacy, confidentiality, self-determination and autonomy; \n \n * Psychologists obtain appropriate informed consent to therapy in their work with lesbian, gay and bisexual clients. \n \n The resolution further states that the APA \"urges all mental health professionals to take the lead in removing the stigma of mental illness that has long been associated with homosexual orientation.\" \n \n It is like being in the Twilight Zone in talking to you....you post the position is not to be treated, HERE: * Homosexuality is not a mental disorder and the APA opposes all portrayals of lesbian, gay and bisexual people as mentally ill and in need of treatment due to their sexual orientation; \n Then you say, the APA did not discourage reparative therapy. HUH? If it opposes the need for treatment of their sexual orientation, then how can the psychologist treat sexual orientation? YOU make absolutely, no sense.......",

   "Go look up the studies on reparative therapy.....you can find it on NARTH and yes, the APA absolutely stood AGAINST reparative therapy.\n\n 1) There is no dispute that the APA stood against reparative therapy.\n I agree on that.\n \n 2) The issue is that YOU CLAIMED: \"That is a HUGE difference to what they said two years ago, in fact a therapist was not permitted to even try such therapy according to the client's wishes.\"\n I just proved your claim false.\n In multiple ways, you REALLY do not understand what is going on here.\n \n 3) NARTH saying how well their reparative therapy works is like a used car salesman explaining how great his car runs, or a drug ad explaining how well their drug works.\n The problem with the reported \"change\" is like a surgeon who claims to cut out an appendix, and then fails to do ANY follow-up with the patient. When the patient still has his appendix six months from then, it's obvious that the surgeon's \"success\" was faulty.\n NARTH typically doesn't do long-term studies.\n INDEPENDENT REVIEW is the way to go to examine these claims, and for that \"reparative therapy\" has a really poor record.\n Dr Spitzer did a great study on reparative therapy. He personally SEARCHED for ex-gays, but had trouble finding any reparative therapy \"successes\".\n Eventually he did something that is a \"no-no\" in any scientific test. He asked the \"reparative therapy\" groups to tell him which \"successes\" they had.\n And even then the majority of them WERE STILL GAY. Some had returned to being full-out gay. Some had just gone celebate. Most still fantasized about men.\n And these were the people the reparative therapy groups HAND-PICKED.\n \n Reparative therapy is typically a failure.\n \n \n \nThe rest of the studies disagree with you.

If that is in fact the point you are trying to make. However, your sexual orientation, be it homosexual or heterosexual is not a choice. Many years ago there was a study group of 25heterosexual men who chose to become homosexuals. After two years, not even 1 of those 25 heterosexual men reported a homosexual encounter. Despite their \"choice\" to become members of the world of homosexuality. But oddly enough 23 of them had aquired complete libraries of Barbra Streisand CD's and DVD's. It is safe to conclude that had the two remaining men in the study group not been deaf, they too would have aquired the complete Streisand libraries as well. Which proves one thing, when \"real\" straight men choose to be gay that \"choice\" manifests itself into an obsession for musically gifted Jewish girls. But wait, if that were the case how come there was no discovery of Eydie Gorme or Bette Midler in these collections?......................... Time to assemble another study group!!!!!",

It doesn't base its condemnation of homosexuality on science at all. It bases it on the fact that God considers it immoral and an unnatural expression of fleshly lust. This condemnation is based solely on His \"spiritual laws\". And the negative consequences which result from it to both the individuals who practice it, and the societies which allow it, leads to the end result of ignoring that spiritual law.\n \n Man uses biological terms such as No clear evidence exists that most homosexual behaviour is biologically caused or determined, although indications exist that it may be influenced by pathological development of the hypothalamus or other brain structures. in order to explain it since that is how we attempt to explain what cannot be seen. But don't confuse mans explanation with Gods reasons for condemning it as an abomination. \n \n Also, believers reject it solely on that basis too. We are not motivated by any bigotry, prejudice, homophobia or personal animus toward individual homosexuals at all. The homosexual ethic must insert those buzz words in order to claim to be victims of unequal treatment. Remember this foundit, we don't hate who you are in any way. We hate what you represent in attempting to reshape our society in your image which defines rebellion against Gods spiritual laws and his moral principles.\n \n But if we buy into that lie and allow marriage to be redefined for this tiny minority, then it will naturally follow that the legal door will be opened, and the legal precedent established for every other lifestyle which currently is denied the right to marry, to also demand equality based on the rights given to homosexuals. \n \n That is why we oppose it. That is the slippery slope which is inevitable if marriage is redefined to include legal same gender unions. So we will never just surrender to these demands for the redefinition of marriage, it must be taken from us.",

   "A clear question should then be asked as to WHERE the line is drawn?\n WHEN does a person go from \"it's his religious belief\" to \"he's taking his religious belief to a prejudiced extreme\"?\n \n Can you answer that question Archie in a consistent manner?\n\n \n Sure I can. When their opposition to those they stand against turns violent. When they decide that the people they oppose don't deserve to live unless they adopt their way of thinking and living. you know, like radical islam who considers any non-moslem an infidel and not worthy of life. Like they believe it is their mission in life to send infidels to hell in the most painful, most violent way possible. That is extreme prejudice. \n \n And consider this. We've all seen video of those \"god hates fags\" groups, and how they scream, insult and threaten homosexuals without ever actually crossing the legal lines of harassment. Now go back to the videos of your homosexual brethren at the mormon churches and in the Castro district when that girl was hit and kicked and her bible stolen from her just because those young people were praying and singing and telling the people who were berating them that they love them. \n \n I realize you are in complete denial regarding the facts of what your militant community looks like to the rest of us, but to me, I see no difference between your group and those hate mongers who treat you just the way that you act with those whom you disagree with. So I must also place your community into that category of extreme prejudicial hate mongers. \n \n But all my community has done in order to suffer the wrath of your community was vote in a legally sanctioned election. Nothing more at all. They spent less money than your community spent on financing your campaign, and even though the turnout for that election was predominantly democrat voters since Obama won California handily, so you know the majority of the voters were liberal. Yet you still wont respect the outcome as you again attempt to bypass the will of the people of California and ask the court to legislate from the bench.\n \n So please don't accuse christians for extreme prejudice when your communities ethic is one of hatred, condemnation, harassment and refusing to accept the will of the people, the majority of whom are members of your own political party. By doing so, you just confirm that you're also hypocrites in addition to being hate mongers.",

It's not my community so you tell me where they are if they exist at all. Even the ones who don't march and sue everyone who doesn't include them in their circles are on forums like this one preaching the party line of inequality and oppression by a bigoted majority. You all sing the same song from what I can see. You all, even those who attend the episcopal church like Matthew excoriate christians who have the nerve to actually interpret the bible verses regarding homosexuality as they are clearly written.\n \n That example alone is evidence that you will twist and distort anything that opposes your warped world view and you will label anyone who opposes homosexuality on moral grounds as a homophobe and a bigot. So you tell me which homosexuals aren't militant hatemongers as that seems to be the crux of your gospel as you demand tolerance from us while showing none yourself.\n \n Added for accuracy: There is one gay member on this forum whom I respect as balanced and is neither a militant or a hatemonger. His name is EchoR1, and he's a friend of mine, and I wouldn't want to lump in him in with the rest. And I have 2 gay friends whom I love dearly and who know that my christian beliefs don't provoke any hatred or malice or condemnation for them at all, but they know me personally, unlike those here who judge me by my honest opinions in impersonal debates..",

   "Hi Ryuuichi, read up on what's happening in the real world where marriage has been redefined and then tell me I'm over reacting as to the results of the redefinition of marriage. Here's a relevant excerpt:\n Does this mean same-sex partnerships did nothing to contribute to Swedish marital decline? Not on your life. In \"The Marriage Mentality\" I showed how same-sex partnerships are pushing Sweden toward recognition of triple and quadruple parenting. And in \"Fanatical Swedish Feminists,\" I showed how Sweden's same-sex partnerships have opened the way for a drive to abolish marriage and recognize polyamory. Eskridge talks about \"nordic bliss.\" Read \"Fanatical Swedish Feminists\" and you'll see a nordic nightmare. When it comes to \"slippery slope\" issues, the impact of same-sex partnerships on Sweden is quite strong. \n \n But that's not all. The Swedish out-of-wedlock birthrate continued to rise after passage of registered partnerships in 1994, and there's good reason to view registered partnerships as a contributing factor in that rise. As we saw in \"Fanatical Swedish Feminists,\" Swedish legislation removing the final remaining differences between registered partnerships and marriage (e.g., the right to state-funded artificial insemination), made a point of treating marriage, registered partnerships, and mere cohabitation alike. So instead of highlighting marriage's privileged status as a site for parenthood, partnership legislation is communicating the message that marriage is no different from cohabitation.Stanley Kurtz on Marriage on National Review Online\n\n A NEW STAGE OF MARITAL DECLINE\n The critics ignore another key aspect of my causal argument. Gay marriage is part and parcel of a whole new stage of marital decline - a stage still relatively unfamiliar in the United States. In this new stage of marital decline, couples don't just cohabit before they become parents. Couples cohabit even after they become parents. Because gay marriage helps to break apart the ideas of marriage and parenthood, it is closely associated with this advanced stage of marital decline.\n There are three core elements in this new and more radical stage of marital decline: parental cohabitation, the legal equalization of marriage and cohabitation, and gay marriage. My claim is that these three factors are mutually reinforcing. When any of these three factors emerges, the others tend to follow. And they draw out the initial factors still further.\n \n In Sweden, marriage and cohabitation were almost completely equalized, and parental cohabitation was widespread, before gay marriage emerged. So in Sweden, gay marriage was more \"effect\" than \"cause.\" Nevertheless, gay marriage has played a key role in Swedish marital decline.\n \n Yet in Norway the effect of gay marriage was greater. Gay marriage arrived in Norway before parental cohabitation had reached Swedish levels, and before cohabitation and marriage were legally equalized. Norwegian radicals were able to use gay marriage to suppress traditionalists and to argue for a still more liberalized cohabitation regime. So in Norway, the causal role of gay marriage was greater. And in the Netherlands, the causal impact of gay marriage on marital decline has been decisive.Stanley Kurtz on Marriage and Gay Marriage on National Review Online",
