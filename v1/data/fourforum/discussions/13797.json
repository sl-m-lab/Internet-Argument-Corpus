   "Print Email Share Add to My Stories\n Hitler cited over stop and search laws\n \n Posted Wed Nov 11, 2009 8:05pm AEDT\n Mark McGowan, Labor MP\n \n Mark McGowan seizes on comments by Peter Abetz linking Hitler to stop and search laws.\n \n * Map: Northbridge 6003\n \n There has been fiery debate in State Parliament over the government's legislation proposing greater stop and search powers for police, with comparisons made to Nazi Germany.\n \n The legislation would allow police to search people for weapons and drugs in areas such as Northbridge without having to prove grounds of suspicion.\n \n Last night Liberal backbencher Peter Abetz spoke in support of the legislation and used the example of Hitler.\n \n He said the dictator gained support because he provided people security in a time of anarchy.\n \n The Opposition's Mark McGowan today seized on the comments in State Parliament.\n \n But Mr Abetz says he was not endorsing Hitler, only highlighting the importance people place on security.\n \n \"When it comes to the crunch, people prefer to be safe than to have freedom,\" he said.\n \n The Opposition's Alannah MacTiernan says the proposal effectively erodes civil liberties.\n \n \"You could be walking along the street, you could be grabbed, thrown up against a wall, your coat taken off, your shoes taken off, and you suffering the humiliation, public humiliation,\" she said.\n \n But the Police Minister Rob Johnson disagrees.\n \n \"A non-invasive search, I emphasise that, it will be a handheld metal detector,\" he said.\n \n The Police Commissioner Karl O'Callahan says he is concerned about the number of weapons on Perth streets.\n \n He believes the legislation would help police control the problem.\n \n The Opposition has proposed amendments to the legislation which it says would provide greater checks and balances.",
