   "The Life that Never Was \n by Abram DeWeese\n \n \"The most merciful thing a family can do with one of its infant members, is to kill it\" - Margaret Sanger, founder, Planed Parenthood\n \n You are washing dishes and your 6-year-old son yells from the living room, \"Mommy, can I kill this!\" What is your first response? Think about what you would say if confronted with such a question. If I were in this situation, I would ask him what is it that he wants to kill. If it is just a bug, then go ahead, kill it; but if it is something valuable like a pet, then no, do not kill it.\n Among the many bioethical controversies in our society, abortion is the most hotly debated. All the pro-life arguments really come down to one question: what is the unborn. Abortion is like the sinario given above; if we can answer, what is the unborn, then things falls into place and the issue becomes clear. If the unborn child has no human value and is nothing more than tissue, abortion would have the same moral equivalence as wondering if pulling a tooth was immoral. However, if the unborn child has the same human value as newborns and adults have, then even pro-choice advocates would say that abortion is nothing less than murder. We all agree that a mother does not have the right to kill her 2-year-old son if the unborn as the same human value and rights as a 2-year-old it logically follows that she does not have the choice to end the unborn's life.\n This is all to say that to solve the issue at had, one must find out if in fact the unborn has the same human value and right to life as we do outside the womb. Coming from a pro-life view, I believe that the unborn child does have human value from the time of conception. The major pro-choice argument for abortion is that the mother has the right to choice what she does with her body. I have already addressed that because the issue is not choice. The second major pro-choice argument for abortion is the fact that the unborn child is different then a newborn and therefore is nothing less then a developing tissue; removing tissue is not killing anything. I agree to a sirten extent, the unborn is different from a child that is outside the womb but dead things do not grow therefore the unborn is alive. Nevertheless, is being different relevant in determining someone's value?\n Let's look at the only differences there are between the unborn child and anyone outside the womb. As we look at these differences, we must ask each time if that difference disqualifies the child from human value. If it does, then the unborn is not human and we can do what we want with it. The best way to remember these differences is by using the acronym SLED. \n \u0095 Size\n \u0095 Level of development\n \u0095 Environment\n \u0095 Degree of dependency\n \n The first dissimilarity is the unborn's size. The fetus is indeed smaller than someone outside the womb, but does size make someone a person and takes away its value? The obvious answer is no because if size makes someone more human, then men who are generally larger than women, would be more human. Besides the unborn being smaller, it also is less developed. That is true, a fetus is less devolved then a newborn, but again, does level of development make it not a human? A 14 year-old girl is less develop then a 18 year-old girl; but we would all agree that the 14 year-old has the same human value as the 18 year-old. Level of development doesn't make the unborn not a human. The unborn's environment is the third difference. However, does where you are determine what you are? I do not think so. Coming from Brazil it did not add or detract from my humanity when arriving in Ohio. Likewise, 6 inches down the birth canal does not change the child's value. The last difference between the unborn and us is its degree of dependency. A fetus is dependent on its mother for survival. Just because someone is dependent of something does not take away its personhood. There are diabetics that are dependent on insulin to survive and others depends on pacemakers, still others depend on medicine. We would all agree that these people are just a human as we are. By looking the only difference between the child in the womb and everyone outside the womb, it is easy to see that these differences make no difference in the unborn's personhood. The unborn child is like us, just not as developed. Think about this; at 3 weeks the unborn heart begins to beat, at 6 weeks we can measure brain waves, at 6 weeks the child begins to move there arms and legs, and at 20 weeks the baby is viable.\n This is fine, but most pro-choice individuals raise come concerns at this point. Most often the objection are pragmatic but worth addressing. Now that I have tried to establish a reason why I think the unborn child has the same personhood as we do, it wont be difficult addressing the objections because I am starting with the assumption that all abortion is the killing of innocent life. Some of the pro-choice arguments and objections are as follows:\n \u0095 If I am raped, I don't want to have the child\n \u0095 The mother might die if she has the baby\n \u0095 I cant afford the child\n \u0095 Don't force your morality on me\n The first objection: If I am raped, I do not want to have the child. I could see why someone would feel this way. I cannot imagine how terrible it would be to be reminded of the rape experience every time the woman would look at her child. However, through this terrible experience, the mother must think about the unborn child. What wrong did it do to deserve such painful death? Killing the unborn is punishing the innocent. The rapist is the person at fault. She must remember that two wrongs do not make a right. If she does not want the child, she could give it up for adoption. Another common objection: The mother might die if she has the baby. When a fertilize egg is implanted in the fallopian tubes instead of the uterus wall, it is referred as an ectopic pregnancy and can be life threatening for both the mother and the child. In the case, the doctor must remove the fetus from the mother. The doctor should try to save both the mother and the unborn child. If the child dies, it is understandable. I cannot afford a child. If my 2-year-old gets expensive, can I kill him? Sound silly, but remember the unborn has the same right to life as the 2 year old. Killing for monetary relief is unethical. Again, if you cannot afford it, give the child up for adoption. The last common objection goes as follows: do not force your morality on me. The answer to this is don't force your morality on the unborn child. The mother has the right to do what she wishes with her body but the life within her in not hers. All law in legislative morality. Murder should stay as a crime.\n In closing, I have tried so show that the unborn child is just like you and me, accept not as developed. It does not matter what the situation is, abortion is a matter of taking a humans life. In the United States, every 20 seconds a little unborn child looses their life. Imagine all the hopes, dreams, accomplishments, adventures, goals, emotions, and all the beautiful things that await that child in the womb. It has a whole world to live for, just as we do; so do not shatter the life of that unborn child.",

   "your goldfish did not come from a human\n \n \n \n What is growing in the womb of the woman is alive. \n Even one celled creatures are alive. \n What is growing in the woman is more than a one celled creature. \n The nature of the life in the woman is human. \n It is the product of human DNA, therefore it's nature, its essence is undeniably human. \n Because it is human in nature, if left to live, it will result in a fully developed human baby. \n Humans are humans not because they have feet, hands, walk vertically, and speak, etc. Not all people have feet, hands, can walk, and speak. They are humans because of their nature, their essence, not because of physical abilities or disabilities. \n A person born without arms and legs is still human. \n A person who cannot speak is still human. \n A person in a coma, helpless, unaware, unmoving, is still human by nature and it is wrong to murder such a person. \n What is growing in the womb does not have the nature of an animal, a bird, or a fish. It has human nature. \n If it is not human in nature, then what nature is it? \n If it is not human in nature, then does it have a different nature than human? \n If so, then from where did it get this different nature since the only sources of its nature are human egg and and human sperm? \n Objection: A cell in the body has human DNA and is alive and it is okay to kill it. So, it doesn't make any difference with a fetus. \n Though it is true that a cell in the human body has DNA and is alive, a cell (muscle cell, skin cell, etc.) has the nature of being only what it is -- not a human. In other words, a muscle cell is by nature a muscle cell. A skin cell is by nature a skin cell. But, the fertilized egg of a human is by nature that very thing which becomes a fully developed human. Its nature is different than that of a muscle or skin cell because they do not grow into humans. Therefore, they are not the same thing.\n A fertilized human egg has the nature of human development and it is alive. This is not so with a muscle or skin cell. \n To abort the life, which is human in nature, is to kill that which is human in nature. \n Therefore, abortion is killing a life which is human by nature. \n Where, then, does the mother get the right to kill the human within her?\n \n Is it okay to take a fertilized egg between a man and a woman and place it in the womb of a dog? \n If you say no, then why? If it is not human then it doesn't matter, right? \n If you say no because it will become a human then you admit that it has human nature and is alive. If it is human in nature and alive, then you do not have the right to abort it. \n If you say it is alright, why is okay?",

   "Couple of points - the monkey/fetus thing is not related to the pro-choicers who believe that independant existance outside of the mother should be the cut off point to abortion, its more along the lines of those who beleive the cut of point is when the brain is sufficiently developed. In short, the monkey suffered (potentially for no reason) whilst there was no conceivable way the fetus could have - not having a developed enough brain for these experiences, or any experience to exist. Death in itself clearly isn't wrong as we happily kill millions of things everyday that we don't recognise as being important or consider harmful (bacteria, potatos etc) - what we do care about is suffering, so whilst I have little problem with eating chickens, I won't buy battery farm eggs or meat. \n If we arn't bringing souls into the arguement it seems the most obvious and ethical way to deal with the issue. \n Species is a concept that doesn't really exist, its like trying to define precisely at what wavelength light changes from blue to green and then explain why you picked that nm of wavelength in particular - its just a label to make things easier for people.\n \n As for the second point, strictly speaking a fetus doesn't become a baby/child until its born, far as the official definitions go. But that is a silly way to justify this stage of development being the cut of point for abortion.\n This is pretty much a minority view I think, as its really quite a late stage far as a lot of pro-choicers go but its basically due to the idea that the fetus has no right to demand resources of another for its existance however it should be given the chance to live if it can.\n So rather than abort the fetus which will certainly kill it, premature birth of some kind is induced (I really don't know the specifics) and the baby is removed from the mother and allowed to continue developing in an incubator or suchlike.\n \n Its based of the answer to the question 'Should someone be forced to assist another in need' - if you think no, then this cut off point makes sense. Otherwise there is a broad spectrum of possible ways you might interpret this in relation to abortion depending on a whole host of other factors.",

That is the main reason why I, personally, would object to killing a monkey while supporting a woman's right to choose to have an abortion up to the third trimester (when, I believe, a fetus can start to suffer). \n \n That said, there are a lot of situations where animals suffer and are killed by humans that we don't care about. I also eat meat which, of course, comes from animals that were killed for this purpose - most of which do have a mental existence of thoughts and emotions. I have always assumed that such food animals were killed \"humanely\" - i.e. so quickly that they had no time to know what happenned and barely even suffer. I am less certain of that now and would advocate for any laws that would mandate \"humane\" execution of food animals.",

   "Lets cut this into bits shall we,\n \n \nWe need to clarify something. Some of you, mostly you pro-choicers, believe that animals and humans are basically the same thing. This is due to your belief in evolution. \n Far as I'm concerned if you are siding with creationism over evolution, you don't belong in a debate over a medical issue. Despite this the issue here is a lot more complex than you make out.\n \n\n But, see, you don't really believe that animals are the same as humans because of this: If you see that a baby and a baby monkey are hanging off a ledge, you would first save the baby and then the monkey. Why? Well, let me answer it for you. Maybe we have a certain loyalty to our own species? That's the evolutionary answer. \n Here's another one for you - you have the option of curing your dog of a parasitic worm infection, at the expense of thousand of wormy lives. Are most people going to choose the dog over the worms because they innately realise that God likes dogs more than worms or because its a lot easier to emphasis with a dog than a worm?\n If we take the science answer (NOT evolutionary - its not relevant here) we pick the baby because we innately respond favourably to babies. Psychologists show that this applies even with cartoons - our brains recognise certain shapes and traits as belonging to babies. If asked to choose between a deformed rapist and a basket of puppies and kittens most people would have to think about it. You could organise a test that flashed up images of things on cliffs and you had a second to chose one, you'll probably find that fara more kitten baskets are rescued over deformed, ugly people (needn't even be a rapist if its an instaneous thing rather than getting morals involved).\n \n \n\n But I'm a Christian and I know there's a God. And I know I was made in His image. You can try to dispute that but that's not going anywhere, seeing that my brother's knee was healed miraculously from a skiing accident in a matter of days. So basically, I believe humans are more important than animals. I mean, we do have dominion over the earth don't we? Just like the Bible said. Interesting...\n\n Dominion over the earth - that would be why people arn't killed by tornados, floods and bears. What definition of Dominion are you using that can't be applied to anything else - we are hardly the most fertile, the most resiliant, the oldest organisms on this planet. I find it hard to count this miracle leg recovery as an act of God whilst terrible, terrible things are still allowed to Christians and other good people elsewhere. I don't mean to be cruel, but these are silly things to bring into the argument here.\n \n Those points aside, do you then beleive that this entitles humans to do as they will with animals and that any suffering on their part is completely irrelevant. God completely condones the burning of live puppies? Or should we perhaps consider their well being as being important without automatically granting them equal status. Saying 'don't torture animals' does not equal 'give them votes' - whatever means you use to come to the conclusion they clearly are not the same as us.\n \n\n Now here's the point of all that: you think that if a fetus is killed \"humanely\" (like say, a turkey), it's ok. How about this...I throw a bomb in your house and you die instantly. No pain. IT'S HUMANE!! But I still murdered you. The same with abortion. With pro-choicers it's when and how?

This is something we can't even prove when and how. That's why we need to be so careful. We're dealing with HUMAN LIVES!! Not turkeys and not chickens.\n There is more than one issue here, just because its humane doesn't make it morally right. There is no need to bring God into the discussion for you to come to the conclusion that this is unacceptable behaviour for someone living in a society. The same arguments can not be used to justify a ban on abortion.\n \n\n Human beings are more than just facts and figures. We're people. And we have personalities.\n Where is your personality? Surely this is in the brain, and something without a working brain can not have a personality - you've just said yourself here that you don't think an early fetus is a person.\n \n\n We're not like a breed of dogs (like my golden, he's so sweet, much like other goldens). Not that dogs don't have personalities, but they do have temperments. We humans don't. We're different. We make music, movies, we argue with each other, we paint and draw, we do all sorts of things that animals don't PURPOSELY do. We're different. For no obvious reason according to evolution. But according to the Bible it all makes sense.\n You really don't know enough about evolution, there are ways through which a society/civilisation can develop without God and reasonable explainations for where these apparently special behaviours (including religion) came from. Make a thread in the creation/evolution forum if you're interested in learning more about this.\n \n\n Now, I'll level the playing field. Let's now say, that deep down, we all believe that humans are more important than animals and different from animals. Now we can argue. Because you can't compare a chicken to a human when you're arguing with me.\n By saying a Chicken is more important than a human you are comparing the two. Just because two things are different does not mean they are uncomparable - blue and six are things that are pretty much incomparable, there are tons of comparisons you can make between humans and chickens. Your point relies on you making them\n \n\n And, even with your logic, I can show you how abortion is wrong no matter how painless it is. You're stealing your child's life. You can't change that or cut it in a way that is pleasing to you. If you kill a fetus, you end its life. Who should be able to decide whether an innocent person lives its life? \n By mine (and your) logic, its not a person. It has no personality or mind and therefore doesn't rate above the suffering of something with one. Nor does killing a fetus have repercusions on the value of adult (i.e your) life as we have a clear difference between them. Its a little more blurry on the subject of Euthanisia, but then there are other factors involved in all these issues. \n \n \n\n In the Declaration of Independence, it said that all men were CREATED equal and given certain \"inaliable rights, including Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.\" The sperm and the egg are the potential. The fetus is the created product. Yes, it will grow into what you deem as a human being. But what makes it NOT a human being when it's smaller? \n Lets not bring the Constitution or the Declaration into it, I'm not American and those inalienable rights get alienised all the time even in the US, or have you stopped executing people, imprisoning them and abolished tax?

   "Here...\n \nHuman beings are more than just facts and figures. We're people. And we have personalities...Not that dogs don't have personalities, but they do have temperments.\n\n ...you seem to state that personality is a uniquely human thing (sorry if I'm interpreting you wrong but I'm assuming that the 'Not' is a typo - animals don't have 'personalities', they have a more general 'temperment' instead. You might want to clarify this as at the moment it doesn't make sense).\n \n Anyway raw logic\n \n Human is an undefinable term, the biological and morphological species concepts are arbitary definitions that just help us classify things. They are much more limited than the common sense definition (because 'species' don't really exist, much like the colour blue - its a label for part of a continuous range). Evolution doesn't even need to come into it - there are issues with it already, with Black back and Herring Gulls, or dogs/wolves/coyotes and the fact that unless it looks the same or is able to breed with another example it can't be classed as a member of the same species. Bizarrely, feti fail both of the strict definitions of being human - I'm not saying they arn't because clearly we both know that they are to all intents and purposes human.\n \n Point of that is - human is meaningless and not a valid criteria for us to decide if something is morally wrong. If we speak hypothetically - is it fine to kill Vulcans and AIs, examples of something that clearly warrants similar protections to humans yet clearly there is no genetic connection?\n \n What connects Vulcans, AIs and Humans is that we all have minds. To me this is more important than a vague similarity in various DNA sequences and also extends cleanly down the animal kingdom. A cat has a slightly more limited mind than we do, but rates about worms. Bacteria have no mind at all and rate below worms. I would violently oppose someone trying to kill or torture another human, I would be very distressed if someone was trying to kill or torture a cat and I couldn't care less when someone disinfects their kitchen surfaces.\n \n It also allows various actions to be compared against each other - torturing a mouse for fun is very wrong to me, the mouse's suffering outways any benefit from amusement the torturer gains. However if 100 mice must die to find a test a cure for childhood leukemia, or 10 billion E.coli for a new antibiotic then I can live with that as the reduction in suffering outweighs the cost (though if there are better ways in the first case then they would be preferrable).\n \n Clearly then, even if you don't realise you are doing so in many cases, you are at some point going to be making moral choices based of the presence of suffering a mind undergoes. A fetus lacks any mind at the early stages of its development and therefore can not suffer - nor does allowing its termination due to its inability to suffer threaten others (like automatic euthanisia would - people losing loved ones who could be saved etc). Therefore its a stretch to claim there is anything morally wrong with aborting an early fetus as far as I'm concerned.\n \n Even if we bring religion into it, its not the fetus who suffers as its soul is sent to Heaven/Limbo (if we are being particularly cruel to souls) - only the soul of the unbeleiver is at risk, which is already damned anyway, infact the child's soul has in all likelyhood met a better fate by automatically qualifing for a nicer place than the Hell its atheist/relaxed religious upbringing would earn them.\n \n So in short -\n Suffering is required for something to be morally wrong\n A volentary abortion causes no suffering, and will generally reduce it\n Therefore an abortion can not be morally wrong.\n \n The only issues are at what point does the mind develop (which is know to reasonable limits due to knowledge of brain development) and some very dubious ones about possible futures - i.e that by aborting the fetus the mother is denied having the pleasure of raising that child. The uncertainity there should be great enough so that it should cancel it out when considering the greater likelyhood the mother will suffer reduction of quality of life due to having the child (lets face it, if this weren't the case its unlikely she would be considering abortion).",

Contrary to popular belief, the fetus isn't an invader, seeing that it was an egg in it's mother's body even before she met its father.\n \n Also, cancer cells consume the human's body; a fetus will be born and exit the mother's body. Cancer will kill a person, while a baby can actually enrich a person's life.\n \n 95% of abortions are the result of the parent/parents not wanting the child. It doesn't make any logical sense to say that since the fetus is living inside its own mother's body (it has no say in that), the mother has the right to end its life.\n \n What makes the mother's life so much more important than the fetus'? This is Darwin's theory: only the strongest will survive. But how can we be content to throw away human lives?",

   "Cancer cells are not predators, and anything but invaders. That aside, I'm not saying they are completely alike just that the body deciding to support something is not enough to assume its nice and happy. The fetus actually sends signals to the mother's body to overide various normal processes, of couse its not a choice, because its not something the embryo or fetus is even aware of. Cancer cells produce molecular signals that encourage the body to develop a better blood supply in the area, providing more more nutrients for it. Again not a choice but just how the body reacts like in the fetus/embryo's case.\n \n I don't think babies or feti are evil, or would compare them to a cancer unless someone was making a flawed argument - the whole point of the comparison was to show you that the point isn't valid as it allows things that are clearly not the same to be included, its like if someone argued that having hands was the deciding factor in whether a someone should get the vote (to exclude theives in islamic theocracies). Pointing out that this is nonsense and would extend the vote to monkeys is not saying that monkeys should have the vote.\n \n Its got nothing to do with evolution whatsoever, the fetus isn't anymore 'fit' than the parent - its completely incomparable. Banning abortion means that rape becomes a better strategy for propagation of genes than before if we want to talk evolution (which I suppose could be an interesting topic - eugenics aside, what evolutionary pressure does abortion create or lift?). \n \n However that is just incidental, I've told you what makes the mother's life more important than the fetus'. The mother will experience more suffering due to an unwanted preganancy than the fetus will have with an abortion (assuming the fetus is at a certain early developmental stage).",

The approach has to be about the rights of the baby, and how the rights of the mother must be accomodated so as not to harm the baby's fundamental right to life. I also think abortion is not directly about women's rights because an abortion is not a question of a woman \"having control of her own body\", its about the conflict between what she can claim and the right of the fetus to live. So really it isn't about her body (because the fetus, although it is inside her, it is not a part of her body, it has its own body and therefore is a different human being), its about two people's conflictin rights.",

Generally it is the case that the bond is stronger but this is generally once the child has been born, before then its a bit more lax. You can have ideas of what parenthood should entail or what it usually does but I don't think you can try to legislate a deeper bond.\n \n In most cases of abortion the mother did not make a choice to create the child's life, someone else did or it was an unintended consquence.

   "We need to clarify something. Some of you, mostly you pro-choicers, believe that animals and humans are basically the same thing. This is due to your belief in evolution. \n \n But, see, you don't really believe that animals are the same as humans because of this: If you see that a baby and a baby monkey are hanging off a ledge, you would first save the baby and then the monkey. Why? Well, let me answer it for you. Maybe we have a certain loyalty to our own species? That's the evolutionary answer. But I'm a Christian and I know there's a God. And I know I was made in His image. You can try to dispute that but that's not going anywhere, seeing that my brother's knee was healed miraculously from a skiing accident in a matter of days. So basically, I believe humans are more important than animals. I mean, we do have dominion over the earth don't we? Just like the Bible said. Interesting...\n \n Now here's the point of all that: you think that if a fetus is killed \"humanely\" (like say, a turkey), it's ok. How about this...I throw a bomb in your house and you die instantly. No pain. IT'S HUMANE!! But I still murdered you. The same with abortion. With pro-choicers it's when and how? With pro-lifers it's never! Because we have no proof that can make us believe that the fetus is not a human being or \"aware\". I mean, what makes you you? When does that come in? This is something we can't even prove when and how. That's why we need to be so careful. We're dealing with HUMAN LIVES!! Not turkeys and not chickens.\n \n Human beings are more than just facts and figures. We're people. And we have personalities. We're not like a breed of dogs (like my golden, he's so sweet, much like other goldens). Not that dogs don't have personalities, but they do have temperments. We humans don't. We're different. We make music, movies, we argue with each other, we paint and draw, we do all sorts of things that animals don't PURPOSELY do. We're different. For no obvious reason according to evolution. But according to the Bible it all makes sense.\n \n Now, I'll level the playing field. Let's now say, that deep down, we all believe that humans are more important than animals and different from animals. Now we can argue. Because you can't compare a chicken to a human when you're arguing with me.\n \n And, even with your logic, I can show you how abortion is wrong no matter how painless it is. You're stealing your child's life. You can't change that or cut it in a way that is pleasing to you. If you kill a fetus, you end its life. Who should be able to decide whether an innocent person lives its life? In the Declaration of Independence, it said that all men were CREATED equal and given certain \"inaliable rights, including Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.\" The sperm and the egg are the potential. The fetus is the created product. Yes, it will grow into what you deem as a human being. But what makes it NOT a human being when it's smaller? \n \n If O. J. Simpson has the right to live his life, how much more should a fetus have the right to live its life?\n\n \n Nicely said. Wow... nicely said...emoticon_wow",
