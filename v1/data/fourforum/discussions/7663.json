   "Is there a difference between secularism and atheism? Here are the dictionary.com definitions of the two words;\n \n \nsec\u0095u\u0095lar\u0095ism P Pronunciation Key (s k y -l -r z m)\n n. \n 1. Religious skepticism or indifference. \n 2. The view that religious considerations should be excluded from civil affairs or public education. \n \n \n a\u0095the\u0095ism P Pronunciation Key ( th - z m)\n n. \n 1. \n a. Disbelief in or denial of the existence of God or gods. \n b. The doctrine that there is no God or gods. \n 2. Godlessness; immorality. \n\n \n Here is part of the Humanist manifesto 2, concerning religion;\n \n \nFIRST: In the best sense, religion may inspire dedication to the highest ethical ideals. The cultivation of moral devotion and creative imagination is an expression of genuine \"spiritual\" experience and aspiration.\n We believe, however, that traditional dogmatic or authoritarian religions that place revelation, God, ritual, or creed above human needs and experience do a disservice to the human species. Any account of nature should pass the tests of scientific evidence; in our judgment, the dogmas and myths of traditional religions do not do so. Even at this late date in human history, certain elementary facts based upon the critical use of scientific reason have to be restated. We find insufficient evidence for belief in the existence of a supernatural; it is either meaningless or irrelevant to the question of survival and fulfillment of the human race. As nontheists, we begin with humans not God, nature not deity. Nature may indeed be broader and deeper than we now know; any new discoveries, however, will but enlarge our knowledge of the natural.\n \n Some humanists believe we should reinterpret traditional religions and reinvest them with meanings appropriate to the current situation. Such redefinitions, however, often perpetuate old dependencies and escapisms; they easily become obscurantist, impeding the free use of the intellect. We need, instead, radically new human purposes and goals.\n \n We appreciate the need to preserve the best ethical teachings in the religious traditions of humankind, many of which we share in common. But we reject those features of traditional religious morality that deny humans a full appreciation of their own potentialities and responsibilities. Traditional religions often offer solace to humans, but, as often, they inhibit humans from helping themselves or experiencing their full potentialities. Such institutions, creeds, and rituals often impede the will to serve others. Too often traditional faiths encourage dependence rather than independence, obedience rather than affirmation, fear rather than courage. More recently they have generated concerned social action, with many signs of relevance appearing in the wake of the \"God Is Dead\" theologies. But we can discover no divine purpose or providence for the human species. While there is much that we do not know, humans are responsible for what we are or will become. No deity will save us; we must save ourselves.\n \n SECOND: Promises of immortal salvation or fear of eternal damnation are both illusory and harmful. They distract humans from present concerns, from self-actualization, and from rectifying social injustices. Modern science discredits such historic concepts as the \"ghost in the machine\" and the \"separable soul.\" Rather, science affirms that the human species is an emergence from natural evolutionary forces. As far as we know, the total personality is a function of the biological organism transacting in a social and cultural context. There is no credible evidence that life survives the death of the body. We continue to exist in our progeny and in the way that our lives have influenced others in our culture.\n \n Traditional religions are surely not the only obstacles to human progress. Other ideologies also impede human advance. Some forms of political doctrine, for instance, function religiously, reflecting the worst features of orthodoxy and authoritarianism, especially when they sacrifice individuals on the altar of Utopian promises. Purely economic and political viewpoints, whether capitalist or communist, often function as religious and ideological dogma. Although humans undoubtedly need economic and political goals, they also need creative values by which to live. \n\n \n http://www.jcn.com/manifestos.html\n \n Are the sentences I highlighted above not basic, strong core beliefs of both secularists and atheists?

It has nothing to do with \"forcing\".\n \n However, aside from that, your reasoning is still suspect.\n \n Marc, first, you are \"forced\" every day to do things that coincide with reality, and it's only ethical that you SHOULD be. You are forced to pay enormous penalities if you violate certain laws, up to even being killed as a result. You are forced to go on green, and stop on red. Forced to drive the right way on the street. Forced to pay debt, etc. Laws and the associated penalities are generally formed by, and enforced by, secular government, employing non-theistic reasoning. Nonsense like religion simply has no place in a reasonable government (let freee people worship whatever they like, but it's NOT ethical to put it into government).\n \n For instance, regarding your claim that atheism claims man is the highest form of intelligence. That's incorrect, again, atheism is \"without belief in mythological, nonsencial dieties and the like\".\n \n HOWEVER, any sane person acknowledges the simple fact that there is NO EVIDENCE of ANY life in the universe that is more intelligent than human beings. If you have some, please share (with CNN and the scientific community). If not, then your claims are simply of no consequence...just like saying a red headed demon just told me to type this. There's no evidence for it, it's either : A lie. A delusion. A joke. Take your pick. If some bobble-headed alien shows up one day and runs circles around our intellect, great, we have a new winner, and we proceed with the new alien as the most intelligent...that is if we are reasonable.

I know of no one who agrees with all government policies, or all of the premesis that they're based on. But we do all agree (or at least almost all) that we need some method for forming those policies. Compromises must be made. A religious secularist could believe, for example, that if we allow religious beliefs to dictate policy than it's just a matter of time before general religious freedom is compromised for all but those who follow the religion of the ruling party.

   "Why not? Based on the evidence there is no evidence there is any supernatural deity that created the universe. Such evidence is unlikely to occur, ever. Based on that, I conclude there is no god.\n\n \n It's only because the rabble rousers love to argue. Perhaps my language was strong, while it's common usage to say \"god does or does not exist\", I think push come to shove, the debate always ends up doing something similar to this:\n \n 1. Scientific investigation beings with observation of reality.\n 2. One cannot form a meaningful statement of existence without referring to some observation..i.e evidence.\n \n So, in the god case, what was your definition of god? A supernatural being? Yes, by definition, supernatural beings cannot exist, saying there is no evidence for one, is like saying there is no evidence for something that cannot have evidence to support it is just talking in circles.\n \n Accepting logical definitions of dieties with regards to reality, opens up discussion of proof, evidence, and all sorts of other things that simply are not reasonable, since before any of that can happen, we have to arrive at a definition that is consistent with reality. Such as, how can you prove there is no xyz? You can't, but you don't need to, we don't know what xyz is in this case.\n \n Theists have a belief in one or more deites. We need the opposite, that's a-theist.\n Have no belief in one or more dieties. And that makes sense, atheists may differ in why they don't have such a belief, but the root definitoin and important language is \"no belief\". You may be agnostic on the why, or scientific, or illogical, any of which could still qualify as an atheist outlook. Saying more than that just weakens the argument unecessarily.\n \n -Mach",

Your ball....\n\n \n The claim is either circular, or illogical, I'll illustrate as best I can.\n \n The simple answer is:\n doG, I do not understand your claim, you use a word I don't know the definition of... \"God\".\n \n The most likely conclusions after that is addressed will be:\n 1. God is defined as something for which by definition, there can be no evidence, and does not \"exist\". That makes it circular (there is no evidence for this thing which cannot have evidence).\n \n 2. The definition of god includes some illogical qualities that make the claim \"god does not exist\", unreasonable (illogical, insert any descriptive here).\n \n You know how much energy is spent in debates about \"can god exist, does god exist, where is the evidence, even that there is evidence in the bible and gulp, eye-witnesses, I feel him every day, he is love\", etc, etc.\n \n Each of these is unecessary when we don't use the word god without first defining it. For example, if someone were to define the qualities of god such that they were identicial to what we describe as \"nature\", then that person would just be using the term god as a synonym for nature..uncessary, we have a good word for that...nature. Or they say he's love...OK, we have a word for that too. OK, he's completely undectable and outside the universe...OK, we have a word for that, it's nothing, or silence (that is, no claim at all).\n \n It's also why some get so bent with proving there is no god. How can one go prove that something doesn't exist? They don't need to, it's unreasonable.\n \n What is reasonable are the basic tenants of science:\n \n Knowledge is derived from observation of reality.\n \n That's really all there is to it. If there is no observation of [god] (insert anything for god), then discussion of it's existence or not is circular or meaningless.\n \n It's the same reason we cannot reasonably say things like this:\n It's possible that there may be a god.\n \n How on earth(doh) can someone claim to know if something is or is not possible in reality? We derive our knowledge FROM reality, not the other way around.\n \n Pick it apart, I'd like to be corrected if it's entirely off-track.\n \n -Mach",

   "No, I gave a perfectly valid example that shows why atheism is not the same as secularism. \n\n \n One event doesn't establish the complexity of worldviews.\n \n \n \nSome theists might agree with the reasoning behind those attempts. Does that mean that theism and atheism are the same? Of course not. (This goes back to the overlap issue, which you apparently cannot grasp.) doG's statements, however valid, do not make your analogy hold. \n\n \n Very few, most of them 'pretend' theists. I've heard that there are a few atheists who financially support Christian music radio. But those are both examples that are so minuscule that they have no bearing on societal trends.\n \n \n \nThe Declaration of Independence has absolutely no legal authority whatsoever. \n\n \n It came first - it was the inspiration for documents that do. If atheists and secularists claim that some rights are unalienable, they can't be AS unalienable as rights that came from a higher source. It shows how atheists and secularists would interpret the constitution in a similar way, differing from Deism and Judeo Christianity.\n \n \n \nI think this might be for another thread. However, it would be good if you could support the bare assertion a bit before it gets approached here or in another thread. \n\n \n You only wish it belonged in another thread, because it so clearly shows how atheists and secularists wouldviews would harmonize, yet differ so starkly from the religion that is prominent in the U.S. \n \n I don't think that assertion needs support - it's obvious to just about anyone who doesn't have a tightly closed mind.\n \n \n \nYou also should stop presenting evolutionary theory inaccurately, but I suppose there's no hope of that. \n\n \n No there's not - atheists and secularists aren't the only ones permitted to present evolutionary theory.\n \n \n \nIs it your position that an atheistic society would grant no rights to anybody?\n See also above. \n\n \n \"ANYBODY\" is an emotional, strong word. It's my position that it would grant fewer rights than the U.S. constitution intends to grant. World history and current events pretty well prove it.\n \n \n \nStart here, first on the morality list. I'll save the trump for later.\n \n \n Is there some point in this comment, or . . . ? \n\n \n Yes there is. Atheists and secularists both seem to embrace FREETHOUGHT. How would one think more freely than the other? Would an atheist think less freely than a secularist? If so why? Would a \"strong\" atheist think less freely than a \"weak\" atheist? Wouldn't there be a bigger difference in the worldview of a strong atheist vs a weak atheist, as opposed to the difference between an average, middle of the road atheist and a secularist? (I guess there couldn't be a \"strong\" or \"weak\" secularist - there couldn't be variations in intensity for drawing a blank) \n \n \n \nIt's evident that you didn't look over their site very well, otherwise you would have seen the link I provided above and not made the comment you did. \n\n \n I did see your link, I'm glad you posted it. I made the comment because of the word freethought. Atheists and secularists are in lockstep on it. \n \n \nEthics is a recognized subcategory of philosophy, so one could argue that discussion of ethics belongs in the philosophy forum. Nevertheless, we'll at least start the ethics conversation here. \n\n \n And philosophy is related to worldviews, like the humanist worldview from the first post. The philosophy of atheists and secularists seems to be very similar, according to American Atheists, religioustolerance, and Freedom from religion foundation, and last but not least, the Humanist Manifesto.\n \n \n \nThe same way atheists worship their televisions, ovens, kitchen sinks, vehicles, etc., because all those things are secular? \n\n \n No - Occam's razor is a philosophy, a concept, a way to think.

President, 1988.\n \n I don't agree with it, and I think it's been exagerated / taken out of context.\n \n I see comments like that as entirely evil, and unethical. It's both contrary to the principles of a free democracy, our free democracy, and is founded on ignorance (there is no gods and godesses and santa claus, or easter bunny).\n You are right, if you suggest that persecution, theocracy, and anti-freedom are acceptable, I'll be ticked...and I'd pity those that aren't.\n \n -Mach\n\n \n It's not honest for that website to imply that that phrase represents all of the religion of U.S. tradition.",
