   "Well, on the surface India and China seem to hold the better cards, although better still doesn't mean good.\n \n Pros:\n \n - Good industrial infrastructure\n - They can actually create wealth by producing goods\n - Cheap and readily available labor force\n - Less restricting labor laws\n - More than 1 trillion dollars in their piggy bank\n \n Cons:\n \n - Lots of outstanding bad loans\n - Internal consumer markets are underdeveloped\n - Same counterfeit fiat currency system as the West\n - Possibility of massive social unrest because of environmental issues. The Indus, Ganges and Yantze rivers, which are responsible for a large part of the fresh water supply, have dried up or turned into industrial sludge. And the air quality in certain parts of China and India is comparable to a coalmine.\n - More than 1 trillion depreciating dollars in their piggy bank\n \n \n We also have to consider the way that the economies of the world are interconnected. A good example of this was the worldwide stockmarket crash last month. China went down 9% and the rest of the world followed quickly.\n \n \n My views for the coming years are as follows:\n \n - When the dollar index drops below 80 (at 82 right now) it will cause the dollar to tank, which will result in the US economy tanking. A Great Depression scenario is not unlikely. The US will lose it's sole superpower status.\n \n - Exports from China, India and the EU will drop significantly and will result in a worldwide recession (maybe even a depression).\n \n - Gold and silver will go up, stocks and bonds will go down.\n \n - China, India and the EU will slowly crawl out of the cesspool, but the US will have far greater difficulty crawling out of the cesspool because of the weak fundamentals of the US economy (massive debt, completely neglected industrial infrastructure, massive military spending etc)\n \n \n In the end this will result in a multipolar world where India, China, the US, the EU and also Russia and Japan will have about the same amount of influence.",

Furthermore, since the EU got a lot of countries hooked on the Euro, it would make more economic sense for Eastern European countries to supply the local European market instead of the Asian one.\n\n \n IMO, this is what the chinese are planning for with the yuan. They are sitting on a currency that is, at present, easily undervalued by 40%. In the event of major instability in the FX market, a free floating yuan would be a safe haven currency since, regardless of their other problems, they have, wihtout question, the future production capacity to account for their currnecy issue. They are the only major player that can really say that. They also have a HUGE, relatively well educated workforce that can be leveraged to keep wages, and thus internal inflation, low. Over half of their imports are raw materials and scrap metals, which would become much cheaper in an economic disruption. \n \n The real biggie, though, is the chinese price of goods. I theory, as US economic fundamentals have faltered, US produciton shoudl have increased and Chinese imports should have decreased. That is not what has happened, though. Instead as our economy has faltered (at least in regards to the middle class) chinese imports have increased s consumers become more cost conscious. The same pattern has been prevelant regarding other nations as well. The extent of the wge imbalance is staggering, and the Chinese are well aware of that and are in a good position to exploit it. They have spent the last decade wrapping their hand firmly around the worlds nuts. I don't think they will hesitate to squeeze.\n \n \n \nIn case of an economic meltdown the Russians would also be in bad shape, certainly in no better shape than the EU. I don't see what the Russians could offer the Eastern European countries that would make them consider leaving the EU.\n\n \n Energy. Look what happened last year when they shut down an export pipeline. The Russians are already using their energy production to keep former eastern bloc nations in line. In the event of a major economic disruption, their ability to control them using cheap energy multiplies exponentially. People will make some pretty desperate deals in order to avoid freezing to death.\n \n \nWhile it's ceratinly true that the Russians and the Asians would love to kick the West when it's down (if there is little to no risk to themselves), it's important to note that there is no love lost between Russia and the Asians or even even the Asians amongst themselves. China and India are not friends, neither are China and Vietnam, nor are India and Pakistan.\n Every country has a couple of bones to pick.

Each country only has it's own interests at heart.\n\n \n This is true. If there is one interest they DO share, however, it is decreased western influence. Ultimatly the major players there are China and Russia. Japan will be in REALLY bad shape should US market availability decrease. Pakistan will almost certainly fall into civil war with the US government unable to continue propping up the dictator there. Indias influence can only increase, but they lack the military power to stand with Russia and China. The other asian nations will fall in line with the chinese, at least in the short term. Once the power of the west has declined they will probably resume trying to cut each others throats, but I have no trouble believing that they will see a strategic anti western move as being in everybodies best interest.\n \n \nIf the Yuan floats then all Chinese goods become at least 40% more expensive. This will result in an economic recession for China because their #1 and #2 customers, the US and the EU, will stop buying their stuff or buy less. Not to mention the fact that the $ 1 trillion that they have will be worthless when the dollar tanks. That's one hell of a write-off.\n\n \n BUT....look at their rate of currency generation. We keep hearing about their loan default rate and how it coul crash thier economy. If we had a similar default rate in the US or Europe, it woudl almost certainly do so. If you look at the structure of those loans and who is holding them, the chinese \"problem\" is exposed for what it is...massive government subsidies to their industrial sector. over 90% of Chinas non performing loans are held by state run banks. Chinas state run banks are a little different from what you find elsewhere. They have no fractional reserve requirements. When they issue a loan, they simply print the money (electronic money of course). If you want to build a half billion dollar factory, they just print you a half billion dollars. If you do not repay the loan, they are not out anything because there is nothing at all backing that loan on their end. It is a freebie to them. \n \n Here in the US, that would be an inflationary disaster. In China, their currency is massively undervalued and the only real impediment to growth is capital and lead time, so who gives a rats asss? They are accomplishing their goals. They are getting currency issued, they are gettign their infrastructure built, and it is all essentially free. IT costs the state run banks profitability, but that does not matter because the state run banks are essentially non profit organizations anyway. \n \n So, lets say that tomorrow the dollar tanks. In the VERY short term (we are talking 30-60 days) US goods would be cheaper for US citizens becuase it would take time for that market level inflation to get to the consumer. Not much time, though. then we are in the same boat....with Chinese goods ebing cheaper than US goods becuase the structural imbalances in the US economy will not have been worked out yet.\n \n At the same time, the chinese flood their own economy with cash. They float the yuan and convert their dollar holdings to newly created yuan. This is one scenario that people have not seemed to consider for their reserves. The chinese do not necessarily have to sell those dollars on the market. They can simply use them as justification for generation of their own currency. They say \"we are writing off the trillion dollars we are holding and replacing it with 400 trillion yaun\". \n \n For the yuan it is basically a value neutral it is just an equity split. The US certainly isn't going to complain because we don't want that trillion $$ floating on the market anyway. The US still fails economically, but the chinese internalize that wealth, which they then use to jump start growth of their internal economy. Can you imagine what they could do with that trillion dollars if they shoved it into internal economic development projects? We have been conditioned to believe that a 10% growth rate is cause for alarm, largely because our fiat money system and service based, non production economies cannot withstand that kind of growth. \n \n China is different. This is essentially their industril revolution. During the US industrial revolution real growth rates are estimated to have been as high as 20%. Europes industrial revolution brought similar growth. There is no reason that Chinas cannot bring the same. Even post WWII Us saw growth rates at 12% and we had a DEFLATIONARY problem.\n \n \nHow do you figure that? Last time I checked, Germany on it's own was the worlds largest exporter.\n \n \n And they export to........The Us and the Euro zone. \n \n \nI disagree. The EU is currently by far the largest exporter in the world, it is the largest economy in the world, it's stock markets have the largest market cap in the world and the Euro has replaced the dollar has the most cash handled currency in the world.\n Our economic fundementals are bad, but not that bad.\n What will kill us though is the all the social programs, entitlement systems and labor laws, because they will make us uncompetetive and broke in the long run. These will have to be adressed and posibly abolished to keep us going.\n \n EDIT: I made a mistake, the market cap includes Russia's stockmarket.\n \n\n \n Market cap in the event of a dollar crash and subsequent global economic re alingment is not an issue since a major component of such an event would wihtout question be an equity upheaval. Stock markets have never done well during periods of major global recessions. It is impossibel to even guess where that market cap would end up, but it would not be pretty. In a way, Europes high market cap is likely to be a hinderance since that market cap=more to loose. \n \n You are correct about Europes social problems and social entilement situation. I just don't know if the Europeans can handle a move away from those. France made some steps in that direction and the riots alone were enough to make people step back and take another look. \n \n \n \nChina has the potential to become so, but they still have very grave issues that they have to work out.\n The bad loans have still not been seriously addressed and the social unrest can play havoc if they're not careful.\n\n \n The non performing loans are not a problem. Eveyr bank in the world is working their butts off to get their foot in the door in china. That would not be the case if there was a real loan performance problem. The chinese will continue to use their state banks to generate \"free\" capital for as long as they cna get away with it.\n \n Their social problems are an issue, but if they started making moves towards increased street level internal development a lot of those would go away. Unrest among the chinese populas is a joke. They have been unhappy for decades. All the government there has to do is give some lip service to helping the people and everybody perks right up. If they actually DO somethign to make things better, they are adored by the people.\n \n Unltimatly chinas internal situation is what gives them an advantage over other nations. They have a HUGE potential for internal market development. Nobody else has that kind of potential. Not only do they have the people to make it happen, they have the money to make it happen. \n \n \nThat I can agree with. Thank God they don't use the Euro.\n\n \n Right now the British are playing both sides. They basically seem to be trying to claim the positives of being part of the EU, while downplaying their own negative economic situation. Right now the pound is high, and continues to climb, but that is not sustainable. It is basically moving with the Euro as a result of dollar abandonment. That will not continue for long, and as the pound tries to stand on its own it is going to become PAINFULLY obvious that it has no legs. The british are screwed. \n \n \n \nWhat it comes down to for me is that in todays interconnected economic world there is no way for an economy to be isolated from the woes of others, especially if those others are your biggest customers.\n \n If the US tanks, it will drag everyone down with it. The EU, China and India will lose their biggest customer and will not be able to compensate for it by switching to internal markets.\n\n \n I agree with this. I just don't think that it will take the chinese all that long to convert their former US sales to internal transactions. They have been planning for this for a long time. You are talking about people who spent nearly 1000 years building a wall. They understand long term planning. \n \n Even WITHOUT massive infrastructure improvement, a 40% upward treasury level revaluation of the yuan woudl make China the worlds largest consumer economy. They have roughly 500 million people who are living on less than $500 per year, so I don't see an inflationary issue there. \n \n They would certainyl take a short term hit but I have trouble imaginign that it would take them more than 5 years to come back, at which point they would be stronger than ever. The EU, I think, is looking at a much tougher road. If they can keep their people under control, I would imagine they could be clawing thier way back out in 10 years or so, but it might be centuries before they regain the prominence they have now. If the events in France (riots, etc...) were a preview of what we can expect from the people of the EU in the face of a loss of social services, then the EU may rip itself apart and emerge as something entirely unrecognizable.\n \n Britain will be a third world country, unless the EU bails them out. There is little or no question of that. Their economy is largely based on reflected glory from the EU and the US. They don't have a snowballs chance in hell.\n \n I am not sure what will happen in the US. Based on my firsthand experience when it comes to the American public, especially the sense of entitlement felt by our non productive and ignorant middle class, I would not be at all surprised to see the US tear itself apart from within. I would also not be surprised to see US military attacks against other nations that the middle class can be convinced are responsible for our problems. Sure it would be stupid and serve no purpose, but so was the war in Iraq and it enjoyed widespread public support for a long time. We are not talking about intelligent people here.\n \n The feeling of entitlement is, IME, just as prevelant in the US as it is in Europe. The only difference is in the means of that entitlement. In the US the middle class expects the government subsidized private sector to provide the money and benifits that they need to live outrageously lavish lifestyles. In Europe they expect firect government intervention. In the end it is the same thing, the money just takes a different route. I do not think that the American public is going to take it well, especially since they are so adverse to accepting blame for thier own actions.\n \n \nIn the end there will be a massive tightening of liquidity and all that leverage will work the other way.\n No cash = no economic growth for anyone.\n\n \n Except in cases where liquidity and economic growth can be spurred internally. That is where the Russians and the Chinese shine. The chinese already have the money and the population to make it happen. The Russians have the population to make it happen and the energy income to pay for it. the US has debt. The british have nothing, and the EU has good intentions, out of control social costs, and a populaiton that riots every time they suggest that maybe contracted for life employment is ant competitive. Not a pretty picture all around.",

The US certainly isn't going to complain because we don't want that trillion $$ floating on the market anyway. The US still fails economically, but the chinese internalize that wealth, which they then use to jump start growth of their internal economy. Can you imagine what they could do with that trillion dollars if they shoved it into internal economic development projects? We have been conditioned to believe that a 10% growth rate is cause for alarm, largely because our fiat money system and service based, non production economies cannot withstand that kind of growth. \n \n China is different. This is essentially their industril revolution. During the US industrial revolution real growth rates are estimated to have been as high as 20%. Europes industrial revolution brought similar growth. There is no reason that Chinas cannot bring the same. Even post WWII Us saw growth rates at 12% and we had a DEFLATIONARY problem.\n\n I must admit I hadn't thought of the part that I highlighted in your post. Mainly because I get really nervous about printing money out of thin air and try not to think about it too much. But the way you put it, it makes sense (and most likely it makes sense to the Chinese too).\n \n \n \nMarket cap in the event of a dollar crash and subsequent global economic re alingment is not an issue since a major component of such an event would wihtout question be an equity upheaval. Stock markets have never done well during periods of major global recessions. It is impossibel to even guess where that market cap would end up, but it would not be pretty. In a way, Europes high market cap is likely to be a hinderance since that market cap=more to loose. \n \n You are correct about Europes social problems and social entilement situation. I just don't know if the Europeans can handle a move away from those. France made some steps in that direction and the riots alone were enough to make people step back and take another look. \n\n The social entitlement programs are IMO the single biggest threat to our economy.\n We still have good industrial infrastructure and with the arrival of Eastern European nations in the EU, we also have some cheap labor, so I'm not too worried about those things. \n But if Europeans keep insisting on these ridiculous \"right to welfare\" demands, we might as well flush the economy down the toilet.\n \n Basically it all rests with France and Germany, because if the largest economies in Europe don't reform, it won't matter what the other do. We'd be screwed no matter what.\n \n \n \n \nThe non performing loans are not a problem. Eveyr bank in the world is working their butts off to get their foot in the door in china. That would not be the case if there was a real loan performance problem. The chinese will continue to use their state banks to generate \"free\" capital for as long as they cna get away with it.\n \n Their social problems are an issue, but if they started making moves towards increased street level internal development a lot of those would go away. Unrest among the chinese populas is a joke. They have been unhappy for decades. All the government there has to do is give some lip service to helping the people and everybody perks right up. If they actually DO somethign to make things better, they are adored by the people.\n \n Unltimatly chinas internal situation is what gives them an advantage over other nations. They have a HUGE potential for internal market development. Nobody else has that kind of potential. Not only do they have the people to make it happen, they have the money to make it happen. \n\n It's certainly true that China has a huge internal market that can be developed, but that can only happen if the wealth that is being created in this current boom gets spread out amongst the population as a whole instead of being concentrated at the top level.\n People that earn $ 2,- a day don't buy iPods. They too need to earn serious cash before they become the hallowed consumers.\n \n Chairman Mao says: I encourage you all to go shopping more. :p",

   "BTW I've got a question with regards to floating the yuan. \n With the dollar plummeting at the moment and the yuan still being pegged to the dollar, at what point do you see the Chinese unpegging the yuan?

   "It's true that they can and will use energy as a bargaining tool, though I find them lacking in finding the right balance between honest persuasion and blackmail. Russia still hasn't gotten used to the carrot and stick method. Right now the only thing they know is the stick, which angers certain countries to the extent that they view Russia in a negative way.\n\n \n I agree 100% here. The Russians have always lacked tact. Despite their heavy handed tactics, everybody was still keen to jump into bed with them as soon as they were willing to turn the gas back on. \n \n \nThat's true. Given the chance they won't hesitate to gang up on the West (I would), but I think that their distrust of eachother will hinder them in reaching their full potential.\n\n \n I can buy that.\n \n \nI must admit I hadn't thought of the part that I highlighted in your post. Mainly because I get really nervous about printing money out of thin air and try not to think about it too much. But the way you put it, it makes sense (and most likely it makes sense to the Chinese too).\n\n \n I, too, have a problem with just printing currency from nowhere. The chinese can do it, though, and get away with it, so they probably will. As long as they stay reasonable, it should not be a big problem. \n \n \n \nThe social entitlement programs are IMO the single biggest threat to our economy.\n We still have good industrial infrastructure and with the arrival of Eastern European nations in the EU, we also have some cheap labor, so I'm not too worried about those things. \n But if Europeans keep insisting on these ridiculous \"right to welfare\" demands, we might as well flush the economy down the toilet.\n \n Basically it all rests with France and Germany, because if the largest economies in Europe don't reform, it won't matter what the other do. We'd be screwed no matter what.\n\n \n I agree. There is going to have to be a major paradigm shift in Europe in order for them to pull through this. In the past, when Europe has gone into recession people have demanded MORE social benifits. Now they are in a situation where their benifits have reached an unsustainable level even without factoring in a major economic event. They are going to have to face some harsh realities and I have some doubt as to whether the people are going to be willing to accept that. \n \n \n \nIt's certainly true that China has a huge internal market that can be developed, but that can only happen if the wealth that is being created in this current boom gets spread out amongst the population as a whole instead of being concentrated at the top level.\n People that earn $ 2,- a day don't buy iPods. They too need to earn serious cash before they become the hallowed consumers.\n \n Chairman Mao says: I encourage you all to go shopping more. :p\n\n \n BUT, your consumer market does not necessarily have to rely heavily on high end goods. I certainly agree that they are going ot have to continue advancing their average individual income, but IIRC once they get to an average annual income of $18,000 per year they will surpass the US as the worlds largest consumer economy. While an average income of $18,000 per year does not foreshadow a large import market for Ipods and other luxury goods, it will be a hell of a market for cars, pots and pans, television sets, shoes, computers, crappy flat pack furniture, tools, vacuum cleaners, space heaters, light fixtures, telephones, etc....\n \n The trick is going to be in boosting those incomes without generating run away inflation.",

The primary currencies in the basket are the US dollar, the Euro, and the Won (S korean). Conspicously absent is the british pound. Probbaly because the chinese have in the past refered to it as an \"up and coming garbage currency\".\n \n They will, IMO, remain dollar dominant until such a time as the cost of propping up the dollar exceeds the benifit derived from squeezing us dry. Then they will convert those dollars that they are still holding to yuan and use them to screw the rest of us.\n \n I have heard speculation that they will do as you suggest and move to another currecy as a primary peg. The Euro has been suggested. The problem I see with this is that when thing finally reach a point that dollar capitulation makes sense, the Euro is not going to be looking real hot either. While I can agree that the Euros recovery time is likely to be shorter than that of the US (assuming that the US ever recovers...and that Europeans still posess enough common sense to let some of their social benifits go) it does not seem to me that it would make a whole lot of sense for them to convert to a Euro peg or even a Yen peg.\n \n Ultimatly I woudl imagine that they will free float the yuan when they move away from their dollar dominated basket. IMO, Chinas goal is superpower status, and they have the mechanisms in place to accomplish those goals. I also think that there is an \"old guard\" contingent in China that sees their increased income as an opportunity to rekindle the socialist dream. \n \n In the not too distant future we are going to need a replacement for the dollar as a reserve currency. In the long term, the Euro may be a good choice. In the short to medium term, it is really not for the reasons we discuss above. The Yuan, however, may be a viable option. If the chinese play their cards right, they may well end up the only first tier nation on the planet that avoids the upcoming recession/depression. It will simply depend on how efficiently they can bring their internal markets online. Whatever else one might say about chinas method of directed capitalism, it HAS proven itself efficient. Even if all they manage is stagnation, that looks a hell of a lot better than recession. If they can pull of stagnation, or even slight growth, in the face of a global recession, we will see a lot of countries reserves listed in Yuan. \n \n Obviously they will have to have a free floating yuan in order to pull this off, and they will, IMO, float the yuan the minute it will screw us the most. The chinese are NOT our friends.",

   "That's a provocation! No one among Europeans could commit such stupid action. As if all of us are XXXXXX suffering from amnesia. We remember very well Muslim reaction on those quite inoffensive Danish cartoons and quoting of historical document by the Pope. No one here wants repetition of that horror of last year.\n But actually that Girt Wilders, who has made the movie, has great connections with British 'businessmen' and tidy sum in his bank account. It wouldn't be surprise if this sum is a gift of his British friends who are in fact Islam radicals hiding under the wing of MI-6. And MI-6 is trying hard to play up to their US colleagues. I'm sure the provocations that cause massacres in French suburbia and scandal with Danish cartoons are also US doing. Of course United States can't tolerate if Europe would live peacefully and quietly.\n So thanks a lot to brave US Special Service for organizing us that entertaining custom of yearly Muslim disturbances in Europe. But there is lots of fun without their participation here.",
