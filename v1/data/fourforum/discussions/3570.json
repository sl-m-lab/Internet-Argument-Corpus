This may sound strange, but let me explain. Step into my shoes for a moment. Try to take on a pro-life perspective for a moment and maybe you will understand what I meant a little better. When you are coming from an ethic of life, the idea that all life is precious and valuable period, some  circumstances start to matter less and what does matter is life. What does matter is the idea that just because that child is highly dependant upon another does not make it any less human or less valuable. When you are coming from this perspective, it becomes much, much more than a women's issue, it trancends gender. Not that I don't seriously consider legitamate extenuating circumstances and am still thinking through some of those. But let's not pretend that most abortions are a result of these things (like rape, abuse, health, etc.). The vast majority of abortions (and this is not mere conjecture) are abortions of convenience- the child would be too much of a hassle or a problem. Please recognize that this is the case. So let's stop talking about the exceptions as if they are the rule.\n \n You yourself said that men have a voice in this debate, so why are you asking me that question?\n \n And of course I know that women are sexual objects and baby making machines to be controlled by men, so why don't you go back in the kitchen naked, barefoot, and pregant where you belong and make your man some dinner?",

So let's stop talking about the exceptions as if they are the rule.\n\n \n I disagree. Ending a pregnancy isn't a convenience issue because pregnancy is more than an inconvenience. And that is just pregnancy - raising a CHILD! Both are major life-altering experiences. It's awfully good of you to want to value that life above all, but asking women to shoulder (alone) the responsibilty of child, and dismissing most reasons they may have for not wanting to as matters of \"convenience\" is all kinds compassionate. Not to mention REALLY easy for a man to say.\n \n I also want to see as much abortion as possible go away. I do not believe that will happen by making abortion illegal. You need to address the issues that lead to unwanted pregnancies and the reasons women abort or you will not succeed in fixing this problem.\n \n Domestic abuse, financial situation, school, jobs, access to medical care, health reasons (not just caused by the pregnancy - but pre-existing ones), not having a decent support network, being really young, being afraid, being alone - and a million stories you don't know are all valid circumstances that can and will impact pregnancies. \n \n I have never had an abortion, but as a women am highly offended by your once again casually dismissing what pregnant women face. You can't advocate for the child and dismiss the mother, successful pregnancies depend on her.\n \n \nYou yourself said that men have a voice in this debate, so why are you asking me that question?\n\n \n Because you said that these issues have nothing to do with the abortion argument and they do - I was asking why you would say that.\n \n \nAnd of course I know that women are sexual objects and baby making machines to be controlled by men, so why don't you go back in the kitchen naked, barefoot, and pregant where you belong and make your man some dinner?\n\n \n HA!

I am not trying to make this a men vs women issue, nor am I talking about parenting. Nobody has to be a parent - most new-borns can be droped off at hospitals - no questions asked, you can give your child up for adoption and you can sign away you parental rights. I am talking about being pregnant. ONLY women get pregnant. For a man to dismiss what a pregnant woman has to face is out of line.\n \n And I can easily see how your wife would have that view. She clearly is a in a loving, stable environment with the support all women should have when pregnant. This however does not make her an expert on what pregnancy is for all women. There are plenty of pregnant women out there who do not have that kind of environment - just because it is not your's or your wife's experience with pregnancy does not mean that these other expereiences aren't valid and should not be recognized.\n \n I state once again - continue to demonize women and dismiss their issues and all anti-abortion laws will do is give lifers the chance to pat themselves on the back, make things even harder for women in a hard place and will fix ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.",

We believe that respect and value for diversity in all aspects of our organization are essential to our well-being. We believe that reproductive self-determination must be voluntary and preserve the individual's right to privacy. We further believe that such self-determination will contribute to an enhancement of the quality of life, strong family relationships, and population stability.\n \n Based on these beliefs, and reflecting the diverse communities within which we operate, the mission of Planned Parenthood is: \n \n - to provide comprehensive reproductive and complementary health care services in settings which preserve and protect the essential privacy and rights of each individual; \n \n - to advocate public policies which guarantee these rights and ensure access to such services; \n \n - to provide educational programs which enhance understanding of individual and societal implications of human sexuality; \n \n - to promote research and the advancement of technology in reproductive health care and encourage understanding of their inherent bioethical, behavioral, and social implications.\" \n \n There is even a section on  Abortion itself on their website in the \"About Us\" section, and there is not a word about stopping abortion as a goal. \n \n So, given that this is the most visible and largest pro-choice organization and they say nothing about it, do you seriously think anyone is going to believe you when you indicate that stopping abortion is a goal of pro-choicers?",

As I said earlier, if I knew one day that, out of the blue, women were suddenly going to stop aborting their babies for any reason other than the mother's life being in definite danger, out of their own accord, as far as I'm concerd Roe v Wade can stay in place forever.

   "I'm attempting to learn more about this issue, and the arguments for and against, but between two prof-lifers, I can't fathom what your justifications are, other than \"cause it's wrong\", which I reject.\n\n \n It's because it's not just about rights curtailment. You have to understand that for pro-lifers, a fetus, especially one in late-term, is as viable as any baby. Even some pro-choicers also believe that abortion should only be done on a embryo/fetus before it could viably live outside the womb. (Though I'd call that a 'pro-life' postion to a large degree, but they self-describe as \"pro-choice.\") \n \n A baby that has been born is often still depending on it's mother to live and survive, just not in her body. It's wrong and illegal to kill the baby under those circumstances, so why should it be easy and legal to kill the baby if the mother is supporting it while it's inside her? She's still using her body either way (she may have to work to support it after it's born, she may be breastfeeding it, etc.) She's till sacrificing, and she's still giving up her \"rights\" to many freedoms. The hangup with many pro-choicers seems to be that moment when the baby exits the birth canal, where, in their minds, it somehow magically becomes a person. In my view, it was already a person. I'm not even against women giving up their babies if they don't want to raise it, or can't. That is one reason we have an adoption system in this country. But I am against women killing them, before or after it exits the birth canal.\n \n For someone who views the baby as a person, surely you can understand why there would be moral indignation over it being killed.\n \n Now, where do you stand? What are your views and what do you have to bring to the table? I agree with MasterShake--so far you seem much more inclined to be pro-choice than anything else.

   "You guys mind if I jump in? Abortion is something I feel pretty strongly about, but usually stay away from the topic because everyone else feels so strongly, too. By definition, the topic is opinion only and I've never seen anybody who considered changing their mind. None the less, here's something to consider. Since the election is over and the politics board is so slow....\n \n A piece of info I've never shared before: My mother was advised to abort me for health reasons. I'm probably one of the few that can say that and speak to the subject from an entirely different perspective. My mother was the one in a million who played the long shot and beat the odds.\n \n It was more than a couple decades ago. Medicine then wasn't what medicine is today. She had seriously bleeding ulcers and her doctor didn't expect her to live through the end of the pregnancy. She needed surgery for the ulcers. It was very risky surgery to begin with and delaying it made the odds nearly insurmountable. Not that that was much of a factor as they expected her to bleed to death before delivery. It's not hard to figure out that I was the family accident.\n \n Obviously, I made it. She did, too. She went through pregnancy consuming nothing but heavy cream. 4 weeks after delivery, she had 75% of her stomach removed. Again, she wasn't expected to survive the surgery, but she did.\n \n I hear that my Dad played Mommy for my first 4 - 5 months. My grandmother and his aunt took turns babysitting during the day while he was at work. Then he came home at 5 o'clock to make the bottles - from scratch in those days - they were made from canned milk and sterilized. He washed the diapers - they were clothe. He did the midnight feedings. He did it all.\n \n So, I can say that it definitely can be done through hardship if the desire is there.\n \n Now. How did (does) everybody involved feel about it.\n \n My mother never really talked about her decision. Everybody else talked about what a hard time she had. I can only give a couple of facts.\n \n 1. I was the apple of my father's eye.\n \n 2. She had lost a baby 10 years before me that she dearly wanted. That left a hole. I didn't fill it. She certainly loved me just as she would have any baby. I was never second place. How could I be. She risked everything to have me. But from time to time she'd talk about what happened to the other one and cry. She wanted both of us.\n \n 3. She saw abortion become legal and she was pro-choice. Of course, that was before Roe v. Wade and before there even was such a term as pro-choice. She just thought that it was good that it was finally safe. She was born in 1917 and saw first hand, from that era, what happened to women who used knitting needles. She and I talked about it once and she explained to me that back in the day, the most common abortion - by far - was among married women. It truly was, in her day of the early 1900's, birth control.\n \n So, I feel confident that she made the choice she made for her own reasons. She grew up knowing that abortions were done and having never even thought about it as a \"life\" decision - but rather a family planning decision. She carried me because she knew what was best for her. She knew that she couldn't cope with the loss of another one. Realistically though, she did risk leaving my father and my older sister alone.\n \n How do I feel about it - being the one that almost got aborted? It doesn't bother me at all. I'm pro-choice, too, probably mostly because my mother, who had the choice, taught me to be. Had she done it, I wouldn't be here. Oh well. I've known every day of my life, since I was old enough to comprehend, that some day I won't be here. I'm just still waiting for my hourglass to run out. I've looked at my children and thought about the fact that they wouldn't be here either. My children are grown and likely, before too many more years, I'll look at my grandchildren and think the same thing. It just doesn't have a big impact on me. My husband would have married somebody else. There would be different children here that never made it. The world would have kept on turning. I don't know what feelings a psychologist would expect me to have - but they'd probably be surprised at my total apathy regarding my own possible demise.\n \n I always wonder why, if I'm not obsessed with the \"what would have become of me\" question, why is anybody else?",

One night 27 babies were born - 25 were HIV positive.\n \n In India and China - girl babies are left to die or put in orphanages at an alarming rate.\n \n The blundering selfish activities of adults at war kill thousands of children every year. Just look at Russia. Just look at Iraq. Or 9/11.\n \n My brother's best friend just fathered his second child in two years due to promiscuity and all he can manage to be to the mother is a jerk.\n \n I know dozens of people whose fathers split - including mine and my son's.\n \n I work mentally ill people who are taken advantage of sexually and otherwise all the time.\n \n Roughly a dozen children have been shot due to being in the way of gang violence in my neighborhood -just this year.

We don't allow a circumstance to justify an intentional killing, so we do care more about the individual than the individual circumstance.

   "I guess it would be accurate to say that pro-lifers try to decide for women what they should do with their pregnancies. We do that because we care less about \"pregnancies\" and more about babies. \n\n \n The point and message of your post is clear, and I couldn't agree more with what you are saying overall. I have to take some difference with the language \"pro-lifers are deciding for\" someone. I would say that pro-lifers are trying to make sure that women don't decide death for their babies, simply because (as you point out) a baby is unable to decide or defend itself. So in a sense, it is the pro-choicers who are \"deciding for\" someone, namely unborn babies.\n \n I still stand by my view that pro-lifers can't all be painted with the same single brushstroke. Many pro-lifers agree that women should have the abortion option if their life is in danger, as do I. And I am certainly not pro-choice. The fact is, choice groups fought hard against the partial-birth abortion ban so many choicers obviously are not in favor of any legal controls on abortion, but instead full rights to it.

   "The fact is, choice groups fought hard against the partial-birth abortion ban so many choicers obviously are not in favor of any legal controls on abortion, but instead full rights to it. To imply otherwise is downright dishonest on their part.\nI won't imply it. I'll say it straight out. That's not, IMO, the reason for the fight against it.\n \n Pro-choice people fought against that ban for the same reason pro-gun people fought against a ban on assault weapons. This country has a known history of taking compromise and turning it into a precident. We seem to have a problem avoiding the far end of the spectrum on multiple issues. It's an opening the pro-choice people thought it unwise to give.\n \n Also, late term abortions, I don't think, are terribly common. I can't imagine where to even find a doctor willing to do that unless there's a severe risk to the mother. So, it's my understanding that the goal is only to end that particular procedure, not late-term abortions as a whole. The abortion, under those health of the mother conditions could still be accomplished, only not that way. So, in the case of say a pregnant woman who had been in a car accident and needed that baby out of there NOW, she has to take a slower more risky path to the same end.\n \n Having said all that, the partial birth abortion ban would have only a downside to the pro-choice group. It would give the legal opening to the pro-life side but wouldn't actually change the anything. It's all about politics and legalities and precidents. When can the two sides stop trying to manipulate the system and start looking for a productive solution.",

However, the mother must act as a mother even when her state of mind tells her she does not want to be a mother. \n \n When a mother begins to act on her state of mind or feelings that she doesn't want to be a mother and transfers this to children then we all know there is a problem.\n \n \nThe mothering instinct is not even present in all animals at all times.

Whether they are going through tough times, or have a mental illness, or are just exhausted, do we think of them as needing help or being normal? Would anyone say that the cure to their lack of a \"mothering state of mind\" would be to eliminate their motherhood by eliminating their children? Is a woman seeking to abort her child in a normal (or appropriate) state? Is there anything in a human that raises her above a cat in terms of dealing with life issues, mothering, etc?\n \n Yes, mothering is noble. Abortion is not.\n \n \nWhen a mother doesn't want its own young, be it human or otherwise, that doesn't make her less of female. It's a natural phenomenon.

It depends almost entirely upon her organ and life processes, because it's are incomplete or are not working.\n\n It doesn't have a body? Its body is contained within the woman's.\n \n \nEven regardless of that, she gets to make the decision on whether her organs and life processes are used against her will and without her consent.\n\n We know she gets to. But should she get to is the question.\n \n \nNo no no... helping is fine. I fully support that. However, making the decision for her is not fine. In no way in in no how should the gov't decide for her whether she remains pregnant.\n\n Yes, helping and influencing is good if it works. If it doesn't then the government has the right to protect life.\n \n \nNo, it is perfectly valid to decide when a human is covered under the constitution. Birth is a logically sound point.\n\n What do you think of the rationale from the very same constitution that made slaves non-persons?\n \n \nIt is in there without her consent, and if it isn't wanted it is against her will. The gov't should not force it.\n\n Did the government have the right to step in (or even fight a war) to ensure personhood for slaves?\n \n \nYou care less about the individual that is already there and more about the potential individual being carrying inside her.\n\n No. One is more vulnerable than the other though.\n \n \nOh, so self-defence isn't justified killing? War isn't justified killing? There are no circumstances where killing is justified?\n \n I agree, you care more about what the woman is carrying than you do her circumstances. Very little compassion for her.\n\n There is more than just circumstance involved in justifying killing. Circumstance is not the determinant. Although, I will admit that I was being a bit coy with my wording when I wrote about pro-lifers' decision making for women. \n \n You accuse the pro-life crowd of caring little for circumstance. But can not this same thing be said of the pro-choice movement? They do not care, for instance, when a late-term abortion is performed on a fully developed baby because they say it might endanger other areas of choice. They don't consider the circumstance when a father wants his child but a mother doesn't want to bear it. They don't consider when a woman engages in irresponsible behavior and has repeated abortions. Choice is their god, their supreme being.\n \n What action has the baby taken to justify its killing?\n \n \nHowever, the one in the womb is not preeminently more important than the woman. The woman is preeminently more important. Her rights are superior to what she is carrying.\n\n I didn't say preeminently more important. I said preeminently more vulnerable and thus worthy of protection.",

   "There are times when people make desperate, misguided, or just bad decisions.\n\n \n I agree. That does not mean others get to make the decisions for them.\n \n \n\n They need help and influence from others. I do not see that a mother deciding to kill her child should have that power.\n\n \n You are mixing up \"child\" with \"fetus\". A child is outside of her body that she can give up for adoption, etc. A fetus is attached to her organs and living off of her life processes. One she has other options if she does not want it. The fetus she only has one option if she does not want it. I do not see how she can be denied the right to kill something living off of her life processes as the fetus does.\n \n \n\n As far as the legality of abortion goes it is a sham. And it has only existed for 31 years. A relatively short segment of our nation's history. It has not been immutably set in stone for ages as some make it out to be.\n\n \n Ok emoticon_confused\n \n \n\n Thanks for your translation of my own words. I see that you know me better than myself. How have you extrapolated this?\n\n \n Sometimes that happens.\n \n You said: \"We do that because we care less about \"pregnancies\" and more about babies\"\n \n You care less about the pregnancy, which involves the woman, and more about the \"babies\", which I'm taking to mean what is inside her. Translation: you care more about what is inside her than the woman herself.\n \n \n\n We do not care less about the woman. We simply recognize that the baby is in a more vulnerable position. The two are not mutually exclusive.\n\n \n The fetus inside her is indeed more vulnerable. Does that mean it can use her body when she does not wish it to? Which do you support more? The fetus' ability to use her body against her will, or her right to not let that happen?\n \n \n\n See my reply to kickin' above.\n\n \n You said \"That a woman is actually pregnant with a baby-a living human being-a person...one innocent and vulnerable and worthy of protection\" to kickin'\n \n I assume you are not using \"person\" in the legal sense, because it is not. I assume you are using \"human being\" as \"human\". In that case, I don't think many dispute this. How is it a deeper meaning?\n \n \n\n Yes! It is weird that someone other than the mother should have to decide not to kill her children.\n\n \n I assume you mean the fetus inside her body, and not her existing children outside her body, correct? A woman cannot kill her children outside her body.\n \n \n\n Instead of using the descriptor weird one could use abnormal, lacking compassion, desperate, or mentally ill as I did in the previous post to kickin'\n\n \n Yes, anyone would be all of those things to think they should decide for the woman what to do with her body. Whether she is these things is irrelevant (except mentally ill), because it is and should be her right.\n \n \n\n You don't believe the government has the authority to intervene to protect life\n\n \n Not at the expense of our rights.\n \n \n\n and act according to moral issues?\n\n \n No. The gov't does not exist to make us moral. \n \n \n\n It doesn't have a body? Its body is contained within the woman's.\n\n \n When it's organs are entirely dependant on another living thing's organs, it does not have a \"body\" in that sense.\n \n \n\n We know she gets to. But should she get to is the question.\n\n \n She should have the ability to decide to terminate her pregnancy.\n \n \n\n Yes, helping and influencing is good if it works. If it doesn't then the government has the right to protect life.\n\n \n Not at the expense of rights. The gov't should not violate people's rights, even to ensure the survival of someone else.\n \n \n\n What do you think of the rationale from the very same constitution that made slaves non-persons?\n\n \n I think the situation between a fetus inside of a woman and living off of her organs and life processes is an entirely different situation from born people. It cannot be compared to slavery, infantcide, or really any other situation in this sense.\n \n \n\n Did the government have the right to step in (or even fight a war) to ensure personhood for slaves?\n\n \n I don't know, did it? Did the gov't assigning personhood to slaves interfere with other's rights to their own bodies? Did the gov't protecting the lives of slaves mean that other's bodies were being used in ways that they did not wish?\n \n \n\n No. One is more vulnerable than the other though.\n\n \n I fail to see how that gives others the right to violate women's rights.\n \n \n\n There is more than just circumstance involved in justifying killing. Circumstance is not the determinant\n\n \n But circumstances can justify killing, can they not?\n \n \n\n Although, I will admit that I was being a bit coy with my wording when I wrote about pro-lifers' decision making for women.\n\n \n Ok \n \n \n\n You accuse the pro-life crowd of caring little for circumstance. But can not this same thing be said of the pro-choice movement?\n\n \n No, I don't believe the same can be said.\n \n \n\n They do not care, for instance, when a late-term abortion is performed on a fully developed baby because they say it might endanger other areas of choice.\n\n \n Why do you say they do not care? Because they support a woman's right to do it?\n \n If I, for example, could never do that to something in my body, but I support every woman's right to be able to, where do I fall? If I were pregnant, I would not do it unless the situation were dire. That does not mean I force others to believe the same as me.\n \n \n\n They don't consider the circumstance when a father wants his child but a mother doesn't want to bear it.\n\n \n Only in the sense that pro-choice people do not believe the father should decide for the mother, who has to carry it. No one should decide for the woman. However, I don't believe that means they don't care. I, for example, believe a woman should take the father's belief into account, but in no situation should the father decide for her.\n \n \n\n They don't consider when a woman engages in irresponsible behavior and has repeated abortions. Choice is their god, their supreme being.\n\n \n Pregnancy and childbirth should not be required because a woman is irresponsible or has had abortions before. Actually, choice seems to be the supreme being in our society. Individual rights and choice are paramount in the philosophy of the constitution. Legislated morals for the sake of morality is fascism.\n \n \n\n What action has the baby taken to justify its killing?\n\n \n Why does it need to take an action?\n \n \n\n I didn't say preeminently more important. I said preeminently more vulnerable and thus worthy of protection.\n\n \n Worthy of protection... but not at the detriment of who's body is containing it. The woman is preeminently more important.",

   "Mothering is not simply a state of mind. If it was then all of us would be in trouble. For I think that a mother's state of mind changes from time to time and sometimes it does not feel motherly.

Be a mother, even when you don't want to, and keep all traces of your true feelings hidden - forever. It can't be done.\n\n I didn't say anything about hiding one's feelings. I said that they can't be the dominant factor in ruling one's actions as a mother (as a person for that matter). Feelings are fine, killing one's children due to feelings is not.\n \n \nThis is where many discussions lead to she could do it if she wanted to. That's the point. She doesn't want to. Not even if she won the lottery. period. \n \n My point was not that she could  do it if she wanted to. It was that she must do it even if she doesn't want to. A mother carrying a baby should be held to the same standard as a mother who has born children. A mother with born children cannot stop being a mother via killing her children.

The fetus she only has one option if she does not want it. I do not see how she can be denied the right to kill something living off of her life processes as the fetus does.\n\n Did I? Whatever would make me mix up a child with a fetus? The two are so remotely similar, that is, so dramatically different, that I have erred in a gigantic way. But if I err in this then so do most humans. Why would one say that a mother is with child? Why would one ask a mother when her baby is due? Why would the mother say that he or she is kicking? Why do even young children accept that there is a baby or brother or sister in mommy's tummy? Perhaps these mishaps occur for the same reason that I have confused a child with a fetus. The term fetus does not denote a nonhuman or nonperson it denotes a human, a person at a particular stage of development as does toddler, child, adolescent, etc. As I said, we pro-lifers do have a deeper meaning of pregnancy.\n \n \nThe fetus inside her is indeed more vulnerable. Does that mean it can use her body when she does not wish it to? Which do you support more? The fetus' ability to use her body against her will, or her right to not let that happen?\n\n For the overwhelming majority of cases, your statement on the fetus using the woman's body against her will is faulty. If one traces the fetus back to its origin then it can be seen by whom's will it has come to depend on the body of the mother. \n \n \nI assume you are not using \"person\" in the legal sense, because it is not. I assume you are using \"human being\" as \"human\". In that case, I don't think many dispute this. How is it a deeper meaning?\n\n I told you that the current \"legal sense\" is a sham, relatively young in our nation's history, and brought about by a wild stretch of our constitution by 9 people. The current \"legal sense\" is really nonsense.\n \n \nNot at the expense of our rights.\n\n The government does so all the time. There would be anarchy if it didn't.\n \n \nNo. The gov't does not exist to make us moral. \n \n Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. But it does, in fact, often times legislate morality. Because it is for the people, by the people and the people have chosen that some aspects of morality must be governed.\n \n \nWhen it's organs are entirely dependant on another living thing's organs, it does not have a \"body\" in that sense.\n\n I wasn't aware that that was a sense in which \"body\" was defined.\n \n \nI think the situation between a fetus inside of a woman and living off of her organs and life processes is an entirely different situation from born people. It cannot be compared to slavery, infantcide, or really any other situation in this sense.\n\n The idea of what constitued a person  was distorted in the time of slavery. I propose to you that it is again distorted in modern times in the arena of abortion. Birth is not the issue. It is simply an arbitrary legal framework, marking personhood. A framework that is falling and being contradicted with fetal homicide laws and survival at the \"age of viability.\"\n \n \nI don't know, did it? Did the gov't assigning personhood to slaves interfere with other's rights to their own bodies? Did the gov't protecting the lives of slaves mean that other's bodies were being used in ways that they did not wish?\n\n Did the slave have control over his/her own body? Is the fetus a slave in the womb? Does he have any control over his body, over his life? Nor does a born child outside the womb. But we have common sense enough to know that those young outside of the womb need to be protected--and they are--in the family, in the community, in the legal system. We have simply regressed in our common sense so much that we do not extend that same protection to the living but vulnerable child in the womb. \n \n \nIf I, for example, could never do that to something in my body, but I support every woman's right to be able to, where do I fall? If I were pregnant, I would not do it unless the situation were dire.

In an intellectual debate, there have to be pretty clear lines between things. When speaking in the \"real world\" there do not. The term \"fetus\" is clear in what it means, as is \"child\" if we define it before-hand. \"Child\", how you are using it, is not. Mothers can get away with it because everyone knows what they are refering to (well, generally). In this debate, where one is inside her body and another is not, there have to be distinctions made between what we are talking about as aspects of the debate change depending. Get it straight so there is no confusion.\n \n \n\n For the overwhelming majority of cases, your statement on the fetus using the woman's body against her will is faulty. If one traces the fetus back to its origin then it can be seen by whom's will it has come to depend on the body of the mother. \n\n \n Oh? Is the fetus \"willed\" into existance? In an unwanted pregnancy, the fetus was not there because the woman wanted it there. It is there against her will, because she does not want it there.\n \n To ask the question again: Which do you support more? The fetus' ability to use her body against her will, or her right to not let that happen?\n \n \n\n I told you that the current \"legal sense\" is a sham, relatively young in our nation's history, and brought about by a wild stretch of our constitution by 9 people.

Why does it matter how \"young\" the law is? How is it a wild stretch of our constitution? How is it nonsense?\n \n \n\n The government does so all the time. There would be anarchy if it didn't.\n\n \n How does the gov't limit our rights to our bodies, and how will there be anarchy if it didn't?\n \n \n\n Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. But it does, in fact, often times legislate morality. Because it is for the people, by the people and the people have chosen that some aspects of morality must be governed.\n\n \n Morals are not legislated because they are morals (or at least, they shouldn't be). There are reasons behind morals, and some of those same reasons are used for laws. Simply because something is moral is not justification for making it into law.\n \n \n\n I wasn't aware that that was a sense in which \"body\" was defined.\n\n \n It depends on who is doing the defining I suppose. In the sense of an independently functioning body, the fetus does not have one. That is not my justification for abortion btw, Jyoshu. \n \n \n\n The idea of what constitued a person  was distorted in the time of slavery. I propose to you that it is again distorted in modern times in the arena of abortion. Birth is not the issue. It is simply an arbitrary legal framework, marking personhood. A framework that is falling and being contradicted with fetal homicide laws and survival at the \"age of viability.\"\n\n \n Any point marking personhood is arbitrary in some sense. Birth is the only one that is logically sound, easily marked and practical to enforce. \n \n The legal framework is intact. Roe v. Wade stated that after viability the states can put limits on abortion. Any law or limit placed on abortion in violation of Roe v. Wade is unconstitutional.\n \n \n\n Did the slave have control over his/her own body?\n\n \n No. Are you making my point for me? Shall women be slaves?\n \n \n\n Is the fetus a slave in the womb?\n\n \n I wouldn't call it such emoticon_confused By what thinking is it a \"slave\"? It is subject to other's wills, but then so are coma patients. Is a coma patient a \"slave\" to their next-of-kin if the next-of-kin decides to pull the plug? I suppose, in a sense, the coma patient is a \"slave\" to the next-of-kin's decision, but it is not generally viewed as such. Is that what you meant?\n \n \n\n Does he have any control over his body, over his life?\n\n \n It's \"body\" is the woman's body, and I do not believe it should be able to control that. If you wish it to control it's own body, you'd have to disconnect it from the woman's. Unfortunately, in the vast majority of the time-frames that abortion occurs, this means certain death for the fetus.\n \n \n\n Nor does a born child outside the womb.\n\n \n But it's life-processes are separate and complete within itself. It has an independent body, it's organ processes are dependant on no other living creature's. The born child can be separated from the mother with no ill effects (physically, anyway). The mother does not have to care for it, others can for her. This is not the case with a fetus. There really is no comparison.\n \n \n\n But we have common sense enough to know that those young outside of the womb need to be protected--and they are--in the family, in the community, in the legal system. We have simply regressed in our common sense so much that we do not extend that same protection to the living but vulnerable child in the womb. \n\n \n Some of us also have the common sense to know that born children are different from the fetus in the womb. Born children are able to be put up for adoption. A fetus cannot be.\n \n \n\n As Harriet Beecher Stowe would say about a system of slavery that would be allowed to continue for the sake of its benevolent and kind slavemasters--You fall into a category that supports an inherently evil system. A living human being is killed--approximately 4,000 a day in that system. To stand by and say that I don't support  the killings   but I support the right   to kill seems to me a bit absurd.\n\n \n I don't support smoking, but I support the right to smoke. I don't support drinking, but I support the right to drink. I don't support having fire-arms in the home, but I support the right to own fire-arms. I don't particularly like gay marriage, but I support the right of gay people to be in a legal relationship. I don't like S&M, but I support the right of people to have their private sex lives be whatever they please (generally). I don't like abortion, but I fully support women's rights to have them. I don't like Christianity, but I support their right to exist and preach. I don't like the Boy Scouts stance of anti-gays, but I support their right to exclude those they don't want. I don't like the fact that \"holiday parades\" are specifically banning Christmas songs, but I support their right as a private enterprise to do that.\n \n Your argument is absurd. I don't have to agree with someone or something to support their rights. It is not inherently evil. That is freedom.\n \n \n\n Choice by itself is not the ultimate privilege of our constitution. One must ask the right to choose what? As I have stated many times on these threads, \"Choice without reference to the object of choice  is morally empty.\" Abe Lincoln  (paraphrased).\n\n \n And as it is said back to you an equal number of times: The choice to terminate her pregnancy. In what way do you want me to say it so you stop acting like no one is telling you what women want to choose? The right to choose whether or not to bear or beget a child.\n \n And yes, choice and freedom is the point of the constitution and bill of rights. The limitation of the federal gov't is a central theme of the document. State and individual rights and choice are of paramount importance in our society. A national ban on abortion violates the spirit of it.",

   "kickin50- could you respond to my last post, I'd like to continue our discussion.\nJust been very busy lately.\n \n \nIt wasn't my question, it was yours, I was just trying to make sure that actually was  your question. You keep saying the  argument revolves around the idea of the existence of the soul, but that doesn't seem to be anyone's argument here but your own. You seem to be the one concerned with the soul, which is a much more religious premise than anyone else here.\nI'm guessing that this is the portion you'd like an answer to. Yes. You are absolutely correct. My pro-choice reasoning is the most religious premise here. Since the Garden of Eden, we've understood choice and consequences. I feel no need to try to create a America or a world that is without temptation. I do feel a need to improve upon an America that is currently racked with greed and judgmentalism. The religious right should be Democrats. It's the Democrats who care for the weakest among us. As for the \"unborn\", that's not in our hands.",

They should always be accepting of the result of their actions (if there is a result), because when there is a result then that result is always a living human being.

It is not something of another substance or species that is becoming a human being. \n\n \n again, you're making the claim that a zef is a human being without backing it up.\n \n \nNo. No one is charged with a crime when someone dies a natural death are they? There is a difference in someone dying and someone being willfully killed.\n\n \n And when the woman has drank and inadvertently caused a miscarriage? or played the clarinet and induced a miscarriage? The woman that fell down stairs and caused a miscarriage? etc etc\n \n \nI unapologetically believe it is a good idea. I am an optimist. I respect a culture of life much more than a culture of death. I believe it to be much more healthy.\n\n \n And what about the 2/3 of these \"people\" that fail to implant? Are you going to inspect womens periods to find them and give them their death certificate and social security number? And what is this \"culture of life\". Please define it for me.\n \n \nWhat do you think of hospitals being forced to give medical care to those presenting in their emergency room who have no insurance or medicaid/medicare?\n\n \n IMO the government should look after people who have no insurance and pay for their care. In the Uk there is the NHS which means that everyone gets free healthcare.\n \n \nI see a designation of what constitutes a citizen in the 14th amendment but not of what constitutes a person.\n\n \n \"born persons\". Look it up.\n \n \nI'm not sure I need to read up on them. I know they give personhood status to the fetus. The Scott Peterson case is a very notable one that has been in recent news. So it is evident that our legal system can and does  give the fetus personhood status in many cases.\n\n \n The SP case involved a fetus waaaay past viability. They also only give personhood when the fetus is killed by an attack on the woman, not if the woman refuses to donate her bodily resources. \n \n \nThanks. Why are these statistics relevant?\n\n \n Because you'll realise that 24 weeks is very, very early in the pregnancy. 24 week preemies rarely survive to be happy and healthy. this will take a few days as I'm with family atm and not on my home computer (which has all the stats saved on it).\n \n \nDo you think of pregnancy as a disease? You frequently speak of how harmful it is. \n\n \n It is always harmful to the woman. There's labour for a start (the clues in the name: LABOUR).\n \n \nOne way abortion is more harmful than pregnancy that quickly comes to mind is that it results in the death of someone. \n\n \n Faulty premise, you've yet to prove this. \n \n \nOften the mother suffers through and agonizes over that death because she feels a unique connection to that other being.\n\n \n Actually, most women do not regret aborting (see studies in the Wilkes section below).\n \n \nThere are also the controversial issues of post abortion stress and an abortion-breast cancer link.\n\n \n The breast cancer link doesn't exist. See here for starters: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3431817.stm which includes the quote:\n \n \"Christine Fogg, joint chief executive of Breast Cancer Care, said: \"Current research has consistently failed to show any link between induced or spontaneous abortions and breast cancer risk.\" \n \n She said \"scare stories\" which claimed to show a link increased the anxiety of many women. \n \n \"We want to reassure women that there is no proven link between abortion and the risk of breast cancer and that age remains the strongest risk factor for breast cancer.\" \"\n \n \n \nHere's some anti-abortion clap-trap:\n \n http://www.silentnomoreawareness.org/ \n\n \n What's the point of this political site? really max, you're obviously bright so have the sense to use unbiased sites for your info (eg the CDC, WHO, APA etc)\n \n \nhttp://www.abortionfacts.com/online_books/love_them_both/why_cant_we_love_them_both_9.asp#Are%20there%20valid%20studies? \n\n \n By Dr and MRS (note: mrs, not doctor) Wilke, with a political title on a biased site. \n \n most of the info on this page is over 20 years old - in medical terms, that's old.

Greenglass, \"Abortion & Psychiatric Disturbance,\" Canadian Psych. Assn. Jour., vol. 21, no. 7, Nov. 1976, pp. 453-459 \"\n \n Notice it doesn't compare it with continuing a pregnancy.

   "Jessica,\n \n But what if this parent would actively kill this child so they would not be burdened by it? \n\n \n So refusing to donate your bodily resources is actively killing? Then I have caused somebodys blindness by not donating a cornea.\n \n \nAgain, I must ask if you consider pregnancy a disease. Are all pregnancies doing harm to the mother?\n\n \n Yes. \n \n \nAnd what do you think of a father's role in adoption?\n\n \n I like Indianas adoption laws- the father has to prove he is willing and able to care for a child ie he can't forbid the adoption out of spite, or just because he doesn't like the idea of it etc. \n \n \nIf he must approve adoption should he also have the right to approve or disapprove an abortion?\n\n \n Really. I have to veto my health decisions with anyone I have sex with? It's the womans body that is being used, and he can't force her to incubate for his benefit. I presume that as in your in favour of vetoing abortion then he can also force abortion or let me guess, it only works to force pregnancy not force abortion.\n \n \nBut if adoption is not an option does that mean that killing should be an option?\n\n \n AGAIN you're working on the assumption that a zef is a child which you have yet to prove. Plus refusing to donate your resources is not killing.\n \n \nMany women decide on adoption as an alternative to abortion when they are pregnant--not only after the child is born. Many pledge their children for adoption when they are still in the womb.\n\n \n And the zef is adopted in utero? nope. it's adopted when it's born and cannot be legally adopted in utero. The pregnancy is not adopted and cared for by somebody else.\n \n \nI'm not sure why disproving of abortion in the case of incest and rape means I should endorse promiscuity and dismiss people from the responsibilities of it.\n\n \n Endorse promiscuity? How pray? Plus abortion is taking responsibility -and why do you want to force rape victims to take responsibility for something that they in no way caused? Your point is that engaging in sex means you must accept the offspring but not willingly engaging in sex does not absolve you from continuing the pregnancy - therefore this line of argument is invalid.\n \n \nIf you run someone down then you will be held accountable.\n\n \n But you won't be forced to donate your bodily resources to the person.\n \n \nYou have yet to prove that the \"zef\" is not a person.\n\n \n It's up to you to prove the positive. For example, much to my surprise while I was typing a large chimpanzee ran into the room, ate a bowl of chips on the side, did a jig and ran away again. prove it didn't happen.\n \n Stop avoiding the issue - you constantly presume that a zef is a person but provide no proof. \n \n \nFor one reason, married couples are the only ones who should engage in sex because they are the only ones offering a stable home environment to raise children.\n\n \n Oh really. So a couple who've been cohabiting for 15 years and have been together for 20 can't provide a stable home? And by your argument a widower can't provide a stable home - perhaps their kids should automatically be made wards of state. Please explain how a ceremony and a piece of jewellery magically makes you a good parent, i'm really intrigued. Then google fred and Rose West and tell me how they were better parents than an unmarried couple.\n \n \nAlso, I did not say that those engaging in sex must necessarily want offspring at that very moment but they should always be accepting of offspring if that is the result of their actions.\n\n \n Why? And why are you against adoption (which is not accepting offspring).\n \n \nThey should always be accepting of the result of their actions (if there is a result),\n\n \n And abortion is \"accepting the result\".\n \n \nbecause when there is a result then that result is always a living human being.\n\n \n Faulty premise. Where is your proof for this?\n \n \nBut procreation is not the only purpose of sex. The other purpose is to renew one's marriage vows and foster unity in the couple. Note also that I never said that sex should be devoid of pleasure. But that is not the primary goal.\n\n \n Actually, as sex rarely results in pregnancy that is not it's goal. And why the obsession with marriage? (non theological reasons aside please).\n \n \nMerry Christmas. (Are you a Christian?)\n\n \n nope. I do however follow Jesus' teachings of love, forgiveness and so on. Perhaps you could look up what the Bible says about abortion (here's a clue: NOTHING).",

   "By the way, Jito, (and others who argue that pro-lifers hate women),\n \n It is estimated that 750,000 females are aborted each year. I know of no more intense hate of women than is demonstrated by their extermination on this massive scale.\n\n \n Ah, the old anti-abortion rhetoric...\n \n You advocate forced pregnancy, meaning that women and only women must be forced to harm themselves for another person (accepting the faulty premise that a zef is a person). you advocate women having less rights than men.\n \n \nAnd it seems odd to me that Sigma and Jessica argue for the woman's right to kill a \"zef\" due to its interconnectedness, dependency, location within the mother, and vulnerability.\n\n \n Nope. I think a woman can kill a zef because it's not a person. I think that even if it was, the woman has a right to determine her own medical treatment and should not be forced to harm herself for another.\n \n \nIn my view, this is not a reason for granting the \"right\" to kill or to have power over these beings.\n\n \n Again, prove it's a \"being\" then prove that a woman should be forced to incubate it. Little thing called bodily autonomy...\n \n \nOn the contrary, this unique, intimate, closeness is all the more reason that a mother (and others) would want to care for and protect these little ones\n\n \n Please drop the emotional rhetoric, it has no place in a debate. Then prove that a zef is a person.\n \n \nI am sorry that the relationship between mother and child has been distorted and deformed so much in our society. \n\n \n And how has society distorted it? And one more time - how is a zef a child?\n \n \nIt is the most frail and vulnerable that need our extra attention and assistance.\n\n \n But you don't force people to donate your bodily resources to another, however vulnerable they are.",

   "Jito,\n I responded to your position on rape on the \"When does it get the right to live and why?\" thread and you posted no response.\n\n \n Not intentionally - I must have missed. I am a fly by poster most days. \n \n \nTo reduce my position to one that names women whores is an absurdity. You will never find a statement from me degrading women in that way. You have debated me on several threads and you know my Christian position on the dignity of women. \n \n To call me an ally to rapists and a woman-hater is an insult and extremely offensive. If you would review my posts throughout this forum then you would not find that to be truthful. If you would review my life then you would definitely know it had no substance whatsoever. \n \n Do not claim your victimhood as a tool of power to slander others who had nothing to do with your rape. Your victimhood is also not a defense for promoting the horrible act of killing others.\n\n \n I am not trying to slander you. I am telling you in complete honesty EXACTLY how your position makes me feel. You have no idea whatsoever what it is to be raped. You can not possibly understand what it is. Your position that rape victims are accountable to whatever poison a rapist may leave behind is insult and extremely offensive to me. \n \n People and especially men who feel women are responsible to the babies they did not consent to make me feel EXACTLY the same way rapists do. You do not get to force me into pregnancy or motherhood when I said \"no\" and made NO action to get pregnant. For you to think otherwise is more rape. It is utilizing my body against my will. To me you are like a rapist. That, may bother you to hear, but to say otherwise would be a lie. I shake and get ill when you speak of respecting women when I know you hold this position. I plain and simple do not believe you possibly could anymore than I believe the sky will turn green and grass blue. That is how outrageous your claim is to me.\n \n \nIf Christmas is not Christian then I would like to know what it is.\n \n To say that the birthdate of Christ is not really known is true. To say that Christmas supplanted and overtook Pagan celebrations may also be true. But that is the key. Christmas overtook and outlasted. \n \n Christmas is nothing but Christian (with a dash of capitalism/commercialism I admit). But you will find no Christians, wherever you might look in the entire world, commemorating the sun god or any other god on this holiday because they know that it is a day for the Son of God.\n\n \n To celebrate a dead pagan holiday in secular manner is one thing (Halloween), to use pagan ritual and claim it Christian smacks of false worship to me.

   "Jessica,\n \nYour point seems to be that if a child believes it, it's true therefore there are fairies in the bottom of the garden.\n\n No, I am acknowledging your point that children do have an imagination. But they see something more than a fairy with a baby in the womb. They see the distinction between imagination and reality there. They can be insightful at times.\n \n \nPregnancy ALWAYS harms the woman. if that wasn't the case, why would a doctor be worried about a woman having 12 pregnancies in her life? And as the woman is aborting then yes, it's clear that the pregnancy is harming her.\n\n Perhaps the term \"harm\" should be qualified.\n \n Are all doctors worried about women having 12 pregnancies in her life? Do most women have 12 pregnancies? Does the doctor only start worrying after that significant quantity of 12? Why doesn't he sterilize prior to her first pregnancy or at least after it?\n \n If all pregnancies harm should all pregnancies be aborted?\n \n And all women abort due to the fact that they are being harmed by a \"zef\"?\n \n \nagain, you're making the claim that a zef is a human being without backing it up.\n\n Can you tell me when a \"zef\" is not   a living, growing, developing, human being? \n \n Is it alive from its moment of conception? Does it grow and development from that point?\n \n Is it human from its moment of conception? Or something else?\n \n \nAnd when the woman has drank and inadvertently caused a miscarriage? or played the clarinet and induced a miscarriage? The woman that fell down stairs and caused a miscarriage? etc etc\n\n Was the woman intending to harm the \"zef\"? If so, then the consequence should be accordingly applied. If not, then the consequences should be accordingly applied. If the prosecution has no solid evidence or knows it can get no solid evidence then there is no case. (no case does not mean no crime) If malicious intent or negligence can't be proven beyond a reasonable doubt then the woman cannot be held responsible. I am not speaking of introducing a complexity into law that is not already present in dealing with any other legal case.\n \n \nAnd what about the 2/3 of these \"people\" that fail to implant? Are you going to inspect womens periods to find them and give them their death certificate and social security number? And what is this \"culture of life\". Please define it for me.\n\n Have you ever known women to grieve after a miscarriage?\n \n The 2/3 of these \"people\" that fail to implant would not need a SSN nor a death certificate. This is not a rationale that supports abortion nor negates a view of protecting life at conception.\n \n The culture of life is a philosophy and way of life described by the Catholic Church. It respects and seeks to care for and protect life from conception to natural death. It is a culture in which human life is upheld for being human life. Value is inherent in each human no matter physical deformity, disease, mental state, lack of production in a material economy, etc.\n \n \nIMO the government should look after people who have no insurance and pay for their care. In the Uk there is the NHS which means that everyone gets free healthcare.\n \n You mean you would allow the government to step in to private affairs to save lives? The government should look after people who are vulnerable and lacking care?\n \n \n\"born persons\". Look it up.\n\n Interesting. This amendment also states that the person must be born in the U.S. to be a citizen of the U.S--in your thinking, to be a person. If it is speaking of birth as a requirement to being a person then it is also requiring that birth to be in the U.S. in order to gain personhood. The other way one gains personhood is to be naturalized as a citizen of the U.S.. Are persons born in countries outside the U.S. not persons? Are those remaining without some type of U.S. citizenship (born or naturalized) not persons? That might be upsetting to most of our diplomatic relations with other countries. Also, the word used is born persons. That is past tense. Does this wording not imply that personhood was present prior to birth? I think citizenship is the gist, not personhood.\n \n \nThe SP case involved a fetus waaaay past viability. They also only give personhood when the fetus is killed by an attack on the woman, not if the woman refuses to donate her bodily resources. \n \n Do you know of any other cases involve fetuses younger than in the SP case? Are all fetal homicide laws based on the age of viability? \n \n More importantly, what makes the fetus a person when someone attacks the mother but not when the mother decides to destroy it with abortion? How is it a person in one instance but not in another?\n \n \nBecause you'll realise that 24 weeks is very, very early in the pregnancy. 24 week preemies rarely survive to be happy and healthy. this will take a few days as I'm with family atm and not on my home computer (which has all the stats saved on it).\n\n Because they do not survive at a high rate, that does not mean that it is okay to kill them?\n \n \nIt is always harmful to the woman. There's labour for a start (the clues in the name: LABOUR).\n\n Do you mean harmful or difficult? Does the mother have to work to deliver the baby or simply lay around? Is that what labor indicates? Are some things worth working for?\n \n \nFaulty premise, you've yet to prove this. \n \n If I showed you pictures of the torn remains of aborted fetuses would that be enough proof that a living person with a human body was destroyed?\n \n \nWhat's the point of this political site? really max, you're obviously bright so have the sense to use unbiased sites for your info (eg the CDC, WHO, APA etc)\n\n Political site? I thought you respected women? This is a site and organization where women talk about the harm they have experienced with abortion. These are women who have been through abortion. I may be mistaken but I believe this site and the organization was started by women.\n \n \nWOW a pro-life site says life begins at conception!! That's a shock!! Sorry for the sarcasm max, but I can show you multiple pc sites that says life doesn't begin at conception. What's your point?\n\n This has nothing to do with a pro-life site. Let me refresh your memory. You asked me to prove that the \"zef\" was a \"living human being\" back in post #135, page 27. In post #137, page 28, I asked you if you had a medical or biology textbook handy. You said you did. I then asked you to look up reproduction or the beginning of human life or something close to that in your textbooks to see what science says about the beginning of a living human being.\n \n \nWomen have always believed in abortion. Women will abort whether it's legal or not - why do you think abortion was legalised - because politicians just wanted to invent it? Hippocrates wrote about abortion. It's always existed. \n \n Yes, abortion has existed since the beginnings of time. And it has been wrong since the beginning. Because women believed in it forever, does not mean that their beliefs were right. Hippocrates did write about abortion and he stated that medical doctors should not participate in it. See the Hippocrates and abortion thread I started.\n \n \nHow do you plan to make ALL women worldwide pro-life?\n\n Changing hearts and minds would be the most effective way. Providing financial, emotional, and moral support would also help. Showing women that they deserve better might help. Removing some of the familial and societal pressures on women to abort would be significant. Changing the legal framework in this country to protect the unborn would be another factor.\n \n \nActually, most women do not regret aborting (see studies in the Wilkes section below).\n\n \n \nThe breast cancer link doesn't exist.

   "Jessica,\n \nSo refusing to donate your bodily resources is actively killing? Then I have caused somebodys blindness by not donating a cornea.\n\n No. I am not saying refusing to donate bodily resources is actively killing. But I am saying abortion is different than simply withholding resources and is actively killing. Using a chemical to burn up \"zefs\" or inserting scissors into their skull, removing them from the womb, are all active means of killing. There is more to an abortion than withholding resources as nice as that euphemism sounds.\n \n \nYes.\n \n What is your definition of disease? Is pregnancy a condition that impairs a vital function of the body or something that impairs normal function in a harmful way?\n \n Is the condition that has propagated the human species (and all animal species) since the beginning of time actually a disease process? \n \n \nReally. I have to veto my health decisions with anyone I have sex with? It's the womans body that is being used, and he can't force her to incubate for his benefit. I presume that as in your in favour of vetoing abortion then he can also force abortion or let me guess, it only works to force pregnancy not force abortion.\n\n Is there another body involved in this besides the man and woman's? Is there a third body made up of components of the man and components of the woman?\n \n No, why would I be in favor of a male being able to force abortion? I hold him to the same standard as the woman. I would prohibit both from abortion.\n \n \nAGAIN you're working on the assumption that a zef is a child which you have yet to prove. Plus refusing to donate your resources is not killing.\n \n See my comments about the textbooks in the last post and also my distinction between witholding resources and the active killing of abortion.\n \n \nEndorse promiscuity? How pray? Plus abortion is taking responsibility -and why do you want to force rape victims to take responsibility for something that they in no way caused? Your point is that engaging in sex means you must accept the offspring but not willingly engaging in sex does not absolve you from continuing the pregnancy - therefore this line of argument is invalid.\n\n Yes. Exactly right. The consequences should be accepted in both because both result in a living, human being. One puts herself at risk of being pregnant and the other is forced into pregnancy. Both must accept the consequence because that is the humane thing to do. Both must accept the consequence because the consequence is a living human being. See the thread I referred Jito to for more on the rape argument--\"\n \n \nIt's up to you to prove the positive. For example, much to my surprise while I was typing a large chimpanzee ran into the room, ate a bowl of chips on the side, did a jig and ran away again. prove it didn't happen.\n \n Stop avoiding the issue - you constantly presume that a zef is a person but provide no proof. \n \n If you showed me the chimpanzee then I would believe you. If I show you a living, human being inside the womb will you believe me? Science agrees with me. That's why I asked you about your textbooks. There is an objective designation that has nothing to do with religion or legality. The pro-choice side wishes a subjective designation of life.\n \n \nOh really. So a couple who've been cohabiting for 15 years and have been together for 20 can't provide a stable home? And by your argument a widower can't provide a stable home - perhaps their kids should automatically be made wards of state. Please explain how a ceremony and a piece of jewellery magically makes you a good parent, i'm really intrigued. Then google fred and Rose West and tell me how they were better parents than an unmarried couple.\n\n A cohabitating couple living together might provide the facade of stability. But the word cohabitation in itself is a betrayal of what's going on. There are two separate people with their own  interests co-habitating. A co-habitation is not so much a unification as an association. They are not two joined until death do them part in their duties as husband and wife and their duties as mother and father. Marriage lends a solidification of commitment that is the foundation for security for the children. It is a bold statement for a bold and trying venture. \n \n A widower? The widower was once married. Why do you think he was married? Did he plan on being unmarried? So even the widower points to the time when he had a wife that made him a widower. The state of the widower points to the natural and ideal state that children should be brought up in--a marriage.\n \n \n \n \nWhy? And why are you against adoption (which is not accepting offspring).\n\n I am against adoption. I am against it because I don't believe people should deny their offspring but rather care for them and love them. I believe one should be close to those they help create, those they have blood ties to, those that are a part of them and all those coming before them. \n \n But I am against abortion more than I am against adoption because one results in death and the other allows life. Those who bear their children and give them up for adoption rather than abort them are in an imperfect sense accepting of offspring-that is, they respect human life.\n \n \nActually, as sex rarely results in pregnancy that is not it's goal. And why the obsession with marriage? (non theological reasons aside please).\n\n What is the purpose of sex in your opinion?\n \n Non-theological reasons aside, marriage and the natural family of mother/father/children is the foundation of civilization. Traditional families benefit society because of their stability.\n \n \nnope. I do however follow Jesus' teachings of love, forgiveness and so on. Perhaps you could look up what the Bible says about abortion (here's a clue: NOTHING).\n\n For Christians \"real human life\" has never been a gray area. It has been an area that has been enlightened by science but the newborn child has always been worthy of protection in the Christian view. The pro-choice Christian is a 20th century phenomenon. See this link for the earliest of Christian prohibitions against abortion:\n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Abortion.asp  \n \n Notice that women's children who were injured or killed before birth were treated as children.\n \n Other scripture indicates how the being in the womb was thought of:\n \n \"The babies jostled each other within her.\" Genesis 25:22\n \n \"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.\" Jeremiah 1:5\n \n \"But the angel said to Mary 'you will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus...\" Luke 1:30\n \n Randy Alcorn, a Protestant minister, discusses historical Christian view on abortion here:\n \n http://www.epm.org/articles/aborhistory.html  \n \n I will answer your third post tomorrow, hopefully.",

   "Jessica,\n \n No, I am acknowledging your point that children do have an imagination. But they see something more than a fairy with a baby in the womb. They see the distinction between imagination and reality there. They can be insightful at times.\n\n \n I see. Their pov can only be used as evidence when you agree with it.\n \n \n\n Are all doctors worried about women having 12 pregnancies in her life? Do most women have 12 pregnancies? Does the doctor only start worrying after that significant quantity of 12? Why doesn't he sterilize prior to her first pregnancy or at least after it?\n\n \n I used 12 as a random large number - and yes, with the stress of pregnancy and birth a doctor would be very concerned about multiple pregnancies. Pregnancy is dangerous. \n \n See the cdc reports for example http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5202a1.htm (overall 11 deaths per 100 000 births between 1991-99). See table 3 and 4 especially -far fewer women died from abortion than from pregnancy (4% abortion compared to 60% for live birth alone). Each year 1000 women die from pregnancy - and that's just the deaths. It doesn't include for example, the strain on the internal organs (including the heart, which can only rarely be replaced), loss of the uterus or any other long or short term effects.\n \n \nIf all pregnancies harm should all pregnancies be aborted?\n\n \n No. If a woman chooses to carry a pregnancy she has that right. There are no circumstances I would say that somebody \"should\" abort as it's not my decision to make: even though there are circumstances such as abnormalities incompatible with life where I personally believe birthing is cruel, I would not enforce my opinion on others. Under what circumstances would you accpet abortion?\n \n \nAnd all women abort due to the fact that they are being harmed by a \"zef\"?\n\n \n Yes. the unwanted pregnancy is obviously harming them or they wouldn't abort.\n \n \nCan you tell me when a \"zef\" is not   a living, growing, developing, human being? \n\n \n No. It's a zef, not a human being.\n \n \nIs it alive from its moment of conception? \n\n \n No. It's alive before that as an egg and sperm.\n \n \nDoes it grow and development from that point?\n\n \n Usually not. 2/3 - 4/5 fail to implant so actually, growth and development are rare.\n \n [QUOTE=&quot;max&quot;]Is it human from its moment of conception? Or something else?[QUOTE=&quot;max&quot;]\n \n No, eggs and sperm are human. my toe is human. My hair is human. Human denotes species and species only.\n \n \nWas the woman intending to harm the \"zef\"? If so, then the consequence should be accordingly applied. If not, then the consequences should be accordingly applied. \n\n \n so you are advocating punishment for the woman who miscarries. Even without intent, she must be punished for negligence, so the clarinet player who didn't know she was pregnant will be incarcerated for manslaughter. Your prisons are going to be full with women who miscarried. \n \n I'm going to start a new thread for this to avoid clogging up this one.\n \n \nHave you ever known women to grieve after a miscarriage?\n\n \n Yes. I've also known women who haven't grieved, so I fail to see what your point is. The women I've known who've miscarried have not grieved as a woman who has a stillbirth or tragically lost a child.\n \n \nThe 2/3 of these \"people\" that fail to implant would not need a SSN nor a death certificate. This is not a rationale that supports abortion nor negates a view of protecting life at conception.\n\n \n ah, so you're not really giving them personhood - if they were people, you'd give them their SSN and death certificate.\n \n \nThe culture of life is a philosophy and way of life described by the Catholic Church. It respects and seeks to care for and protect life from conception to natural death. It is a culture in which human life is upheld for being human life. Value is inherent in each human no matter physical deformity, disease, mental state, lack of production in a material economy, etc.\n\n \n Thanks for the definition. Out of curiosity, how do you feel about the death penalty and Iraq war?\n \n also you may want to look up the RCs stance on abortion over the ages: http://www.catholicsforchoice.org/nobandwidth/English/cathwomen/abortiondecision.htm \n \n \nYou mean you would allow the government to step in to private affairs to save lives? The government should look after people who are vulnerable and lacking care?\n\n \n Yes. This does not however include forcing bodily resource donation and harm to others.\n \n \nInteresting. This amendment also states that the person must be born [I][B]etc\n\n \n yes, it clearly hinges on BORN persons.\n \n \nDo you know of any other cases involve fetuses younger than in the SP case? Are all fetal homicide laws based on the age of viability? \n\n \n No. The laws differ wildly from state to state.\n \n \nMore importantly, what makes the fetus a person when someone attacks the mother but not when the mother decides to destroy it with abortion? How is it a person in one instance but not in another?\n\n \n That's why fetal homicide laws are contradictory and nonsensical.\n \n \nBecause they do not survive at a high rate, that does not mean that it is okay to kill them?\n\n \n That's not what I'm saying. I'm highlighting the fact that at 24 weeks surviving is less than 50%, 100% have chronic lung problems and chances of disability are incredibly high - in short, they're not ready to come out yet. (please note these figures are from memory and I'll confirm then when I get to my home pc). There's a myth propogated by the Anti Abortion Propoganda Industry that 24 weeks is absolutely fine and dandy but it's just too early. \n \n \nDo you mean harmful or difficult?\n\n \n Both.\n \n \n Does the mother have to work to deliver the baby or simply lay around?\n\n \n emoticon_wow Yes, labour involves laying about reading magazines, not hideous pain and episiotomies. max, word of advice - don't belittle the agony women go through in pregnancy and birth, it'll make you very unpopular.\n \n \nIs that what labor indicates? Are some things worth working for?\n\n \n If a woman chooses to go through it, that's great for her but you cannot be forced to go through this for another person (taking a zef to be aperson). \n \n \nIf I showed you pictures of the torn remains of aborted fetuses would that be enough proof that a living person with a human body was destroyed?\n\n \n Please show me. \n \n \nPolitical site? I thought you respected women? This is a site and organization where women talk about the harm they have experienced with abortion. \n\n \n It's a political site and a project of Priests for Life and Noel. It doesn't matter if it was started by men or women. It's not offering women non-judgemental support after an abortion, but spinning a few stories to suggest that a substantial amount of women regret their abortion which they just don't. Why don't you have alook at http://www.imnotsorry.net/ started by women.\n \n \nThese are women who have been through abortion. I may be mistaken but I believe this site and the organization was started by women.\n\n \n And?\n \n \nThis has nothing to do with a pro-life site.\n\n \n It is a pro-life site, linked with pro-life sites and also contains frequent theological references (e.g. sin).\n \n \n Let me refresh your memory. You asked me to prove that the \"zef\" was a \"living human being\" back in post #135, page 27. In post #137, page 28, I asked you if you had a medical or biology textbook handy. You said you did. I then asked you to look up reproduction or the beginning of human life or something close to that in your textbooks to see what science says about the beginning of a living human being.\n\n \n I did. I'm waiting for your evidence that a zef is a person as you've supplied no proof.\n \n \nYes, abortion has existed since the beginnings of time. And it has been wrong since the beginning. Because women believed in it forever, does not mean that their beliefs were right. Hippocrates did write about abortion and he stated that medical doctors should not participate in it. See the Hippocrates and abortion thread I started.\n\n \n Seen it. I was pointing out that abortion has existed for millenia. As we're agreed, lets leave this.\n \n \nChanging hearts and minds would be the most effective way.\n\n \n And how are you going to do that? Bearing in mind that women have always aborted so obviously many don't see it as wrong, how are you going to make everyone pro-life?\n \n \n Providing financial, emotional, and moral support would also help. \n\n \n I completely agree. I don't want to see women forced into abortion when they want to continue the pregnancy.\n \n \nShowing women that they deserve better might help. \n\n \n I'm confused. What do you mean here?\n \n \nRemoving some of the familial and societal pressures on women to abort would be significant. \n\n \n I agree. But how do you do this?\n \n \nChanging the legal framework in this country to protect the unborn would be another factor.\n\n \n Yes if abortion was made illegal tomorrow it would rarely happen...not. Look at any country where abortion is illegal and you'll see that it stil happens. women douche themselves with hydrochloric acid, self abort with sharp implements and so on to terminate a pregnancy. It doesn't stop it at all.\n \n Even if a zef was legally a person and abortion murder, you still wouldn't stop women - they can abort as soon as they find out their pregnant and nobody will know. Nobody knows about the \"person\" and there's no body. It'll be even harder to stop it in the US as there are multiple sites about self aborting, buying RU486 and so on (I will not discuss these sites in detail on a public forum. You can die from self aborting. If you want more details I'll pm you). Underground groups such as Jane will come into action again. Women can travel to another country to abort. You just won't stop it, whatever the penalties are.\n \n \n\n I need time to research all of this. My time is limited. I will do my best and if time permits give you a response.\n\n \n Look forward to your reply.",

I hold him to the same standard as the woman. I would prohibit both from abortion.\n\n \n Oh I see. Having to veto medical help only applies to stopping abortions. Hardly being consistent. Why do you think a man should be able to forbid an abortion when *in no other circumstance* is a compos mentis adult forbiddon to make their own medical procedures? why are you in favour of rapists controlling their victims body?\n \n \nSee my comments about the textbooks in the last post and also my distinction between witholding resources and the active killing of abortion.\n\n \n Still waiting for your proof of personhood.\n \n \nYes. Exactly right.

They do however have other legal joinings: a joint mortgage, joint bank account, joint will and so on. If they don't believe in marriage, what's the point? Their commitment comes from each other and they don't need a piece of paper to prove it to the world. IMO desperately needing a certificate as proof of commitment shows an insecurity and lack of stability in the relationship.\n \n \nMarriage lends a solidification of commitment that is the foundation for security for the children. It is a bold statement for a bold and trying venture.\n \n \n The solidification of commitment comes from within, not a ceremony. the married man who commits adultery is far less committed than the cohabiting man who doesn't.\n \n \nA widower? The widower was once married. Why do you think he was married? Did he plan on being unmarried? So even the widower points to the time when he had a wife that made him a widower.

I believe one should be close to those they help create, those they have blood ties to, those that are a part of them and all those coming before them. \n\n \n Wonderful. So the 14 year old that can't care for a child should be forced into unwilling and incapable motherhood. The mother that doesn't have the resources to care for a heavily disabled child should be forced to do the same. You're basically condemning people for being unable to care for children. I respect people's rights to not be parents - we can't all cope with it.\n \n \nBut I am against abortion more than I am against adoption because one results in death and the other allows life. Those who bear their children and give them up for adoption rather than abort them are in an imperfect sense accepting of offspring-that is, they respect human life.\n\n \n I respect human life as in people.

That aside, the translations of this passage differ: the King James for example says \"thou shalt conceive in thy womb\" not \"with child\".\n \n \nRandy Alcorn, a Protestant minister, discusses historical Christian view on abortion here:\n \n http://www.epm.org/articles/aborhistory.html  \n\n \n Interesting text. I'll look up the translation issues in more detail and get back to you.\n \n There are translation issues which the author fails to address, such as Psalm 51:5 which is often translated as \"...in sin did my mother conceive me\" which completely changes the meaning of the verse. Also nicely omits the absurdities in Psalms such as 22:21s possible unicorn reference or 91:3 where the earth is stabilised when of course, it moves constantly. Or indeed 137:9 where children are dashed against stones and the person who does it \"happy shall he be\".\n \n He also mentions Romans 9:11, which states that God has predestined who will go to hell so there ain't a lot you can do about it.\n \n Nowhere does the Bible say \"and lo, the Lord said \"abortion is wrong and an abomination unto me\" or similar. Nowhere is it condemned and as we know, abortion was without a doubt around in Jesus' times yet he never says a word about it either. it seems odd that we have clothing advice, strict laws about mildew in houses and emissions of semen (Leviticus) yet not once did he condemn abortion. if it was such a big deal, you think it would be in there somewhere.\n \n \nI will answer your third post tomorrow, hopefully.\n\n \n look forward to it. i'm very much enjoying this - it's nice to have a civilised abortion debate.

They aren't out to \"kill babies\". Your *respectful* (note sarcasm) view of women, their issues, circumstances, and reasons for their choices gets clearer with every single one of your posts.\n \n \nYes. Exactly right. The consequences should be accepted in both because both result in a living, human being. One puts herself at risk of being pregnant and the other is forced into pregnancy.

   "Jito,\n \nI am not trying to slander you. I am telling you in complete honesty EXACTLY how your position makes me feel. You have no idea whatsoever what it is to be raped. You can not possibly understand what it is. Your position that rape victims are accountable to whatever poison a rapist may leave behind is insult and extremely offensive to me.\n \n I think there are better ways to express your emotions (if there is a place for emotions in these debates, right) than to call me a woman hater and ally to rapists. I am not sure why the message has not gotten across from our collection of debates that I am pro-life out of a deep respect for the dignity of women and the dignity of humanity. I think women are misled and deceived about abortion. I think no woman should be subject to abortion--there are much better alternatives. Finally, I do not consider a baby left behind from rape a poison. Would the pregnancy be extremely difficult? Most definitely. But to save a life from becoming the victim of an undeserved death, just as your rape was undeserved, would be worth it. Please see my post on the \"When does it get the right to live and why.\"\n \n \nPeople and especially men who feel women are responsible to the babies they did not consent to make me feel EXACTLY the same way rapists do. You do not get to force me into pregnancy or motherhood when I said \"no\" and made NO action to get pregnant. For you to think otherwise is more rape. It is utilizing my body against my will. To me you are like a rapist. That, may bother you to hear, but to say otherwise would be a lie. I shake and get ill when you speak of respecting women when I know you hold this position. I plain and simple do not believe you possibly could anymore than I believe the sky will turn green and grass blue. That is how outrageous your claim is to me.\n\n I'm not sure why men wanting you to have mercy and save a life would be equal to a rape--I see that as in stark contrast to the abuse and evil of rape.\n \n Again, if you would review my life you would know that I do not come near that category. You could speak to my mother, my two sisters, my wife, and see how I care for my daughter and you would know that I seek to protect and uphold women, not rape them.\n \n \nTo celebrate a dead pagan holiday in secular manner is one thing (Halloween), to use pagan ritual and claim it Christian smacks of false worship to me. Won't do it - and as it is not commanded in the Bible I think I am safe in steering clear.\n\n To which pagan rituals are you referring?\n \n If you only do what is commanded in the Bible then a lot will be left out of your Christianity that has been a part of Christianity from the beginning. If you adopt this position of a very strong scriptural adherence then you will also be in trouble for not observing every commandment that the Bible does describe.\n \n There is always an attempt to discredit Christianity by comparing it to paganism. But Christianity makes everything new, just as Christ did. The truths of Christianity assume, consume, pervade, and overwhelm the cultures it contacts--because it is universal. The pagans had many inclinations that were proper and good. But they were only good in so far as they reflected and foreshadowed the truth of Christ. The worship of the gods  cannot compare to the worship of God.",

   "Jessica,\n How am I advocating women having less rights when I would restrict a man from killing a baby just as I restrict a woman? \n\n \n You're making forced bodily resource donation mandatory for women and women only. That is advocating less rights for women. Forced childbearing also means that women will do less well career wise, are less likely to continue education (only 2% go on to college) meaning they have far fewer chances in life than men.\n \n \nWhy do you think these living, human beings are not persons? \n\n \n They're not living human beings and you have yet to prove otherwise.\n \n \nYou act as if the \"zef\" appeared out of nowhere and was stuck in her body as in a test tube. It is there due to a natural course of events and it is in its normal place. \n\n \n Actually, as most fertilised eggs fail to implant and the miscarriage rate is very high (especially in the first month) the \"natural\" place for a zef is in a toilet bowl.\n \n \nYou cannot hope for bodily autonomy by destroying the body of another. \n\n \n you can't have bodily autonomy if you are forced to donate your body to another (taking the zef to be a person). There is no forced resource donation in society - there is however, bodily autonomy.\n \n \nHave you ever seen the emotion experienced by a parent or parents when they lose a child in a miscarriage? \n\n \n Yes, I've known women miscarry. I have seen few that think it's a child and even those that do aren't as pained as people who lose a born child. You insult people who've gone through the agony of losing a child when you say a failed implantation is the same thing.\n \n \nHave you ever witnessed or experienced the emotion experienced by parents when they give birth? \n\n \n By women when they give birth, yes. Remember, they are voluntarily giving birth.\n \n \nThough emotion should not be an all ruling factor it does have a place...because it tells us something about those involved.\n\n \n And?\n \n \nMust I tell you how the mother/child relationship has been distorted? The normal state of mother and child is for them to love one another.

   "Sorry to jump in on your post to Jito, but you made some truly absurd claims.\n \n \n I think women are misled and deceived about abortion.\n\n \n And what are they deceived about?\n \n \n I think no woman should be subject to abortion--there are much better alternatives.\n\n \n Really. And what are these?\n \n \nFinally, I do not consider a baby left behind from rape a poison. Would the pregnancy be extremely difficult? Most definitely.\n\n \n Difficult? Difficult doesn't begin to cover it. Rape is a traumatic event, and I have known women whose lives have been shattered by it: they never \"get over\" it, they just learn to cope with it; or not. Their lives would be ruined by having to bear their rapists child, and have a squirming reminder of their agony. Can you even begin to imagine the horror of having to continue a pregnancy because somebody else  says it's a baby? They then either have to go through the trauma of adoption, which has terrible long term effects on the woman, and of course is only an option if the rapist voluntarily gives up his parental rights which she will have to ask him, or perhaps beg him to do. Alternatively, she has to look at a daily reminder of her trauma. She has to raise it. She has to nurture it. She has to have contact with her rapist as he is the father. She has to explain to the kid that his father committed a brutal act, and that she was forced to give birth to him against her will - or she has to live a lie. \n \n Studies have proven that an unwanted pregnancy is traumatic for a woman, and the fact that women will risk death mutilating themselves where abortion is illegal shows how desperately they need to avoid it. Carrying a rape pregnancy would be even worse. Dismissing this unbearable situation as merely \"difficult\" shows an absolute lack of consideration and understanding of the horror rape victims go through.",

   "Jito,\n \nTo celebrate a dead pagan holiday in secular manner is one thing (Halloween), to use pagan ritual and claim it Christian smacks of false worship to me. Won't do it - and as it is not commanded in the Bible I think I am safe in steering clear.\n \n Are you certain about \"Halloween?\"\n \n \"Halloween, unfortunately, has been a holiday that has undergone a great deal of historical development over the years while moving away from its original purpose and reasoning. First, allow me to explain the problem as some see it, and follow that with how we should be practicing the holiday. The very word \"holiday\" derives from the phrase \"Holy Day\" which designated in the Catholic Christian tradition certain days of the year that we consider holy and sacred because of a theme they celebrate and honor. \"Christmas,\" for example, is a \"holiday\" because it is a \"Holy Day\" when we celebrate the \"Christ Mass\" which is the giving of God's self to the world through the incarnation of Jesus Christ. This principle of giving one's self was then exemplified by a number of Saints, one of which was the life of service by a Bishop Klaus who became known as Saint Klaus (hence, Santa Claus). Santa's pointy hat is in fact a resemblance of the miter worn by our own Bishop and Bishops throughout the world. Santa's red color was in fact the color worn by Cardinals and religious leaders of the time. The reindeer were used, like horses, to power the sled during the winters Bishop Klaus experienced when he gave out gifts to the poor and needy. \n \n Today, however, Christmas has become so commercialized that the original meaning of giving one's self to others has been lost in some ways. Moreover, the very connection between Santa Claus and Christmas has also been lost. Does that mean, though, that we should not celebrate Christmas at all? No way! Even though the holiday has become a public celebration and society has lost much of its' meaning, we should still participate in that celebration including Santa bringing presents, reindeers, Rudolph, mistletoe, etc. More so, we must also teach our children and each other that it is most especially a \"Holy Day,\" not just a watered-down holiday. We do that through the reading of scripture and the manger story, the use of a cr\u00e8che in the home, attending church on the Holy Day, and ensuring we never forget the true meaning of Christmas and its connection to us here and now. Unfortunately, some Fundamentalists take such a literal interpretation that since neither Santa Claus, December 25th, Christmas, reindeer nor any other holiday is specifically mentioned in the Bible, then it is all pagan ritual or crass commercialization. This, as you can see, shows how they fail to recognize the Christian history behind the holiday as a Holy Day, how they fail to celebrate the event for the true meaning it was intended, and how they fail to use the celebration as an opportunity to proclaim and celebrate God's giving of self to us in Jesus. \n \n Similarly, November 1 is the Solemnity of All Saints, which is also known in the British Isles as All Hallows. The night before is therefore called All Hallows Eve, that is Halloween. Many pagan cultures had celebrations dealing with ghosts and goblins, and in fact designated certain times of the year when they believed ghosts and spirits could be called to do one's will. Halloween, though, began as a day on which children dressed up as various Saints who would be honored, not worshipped, the following day. This holiday, thus, is derived from the Holy Day honoring the saints of the church. Over time there came to be a fusion between the pagan tradition of ghosts and goblins, with the Catholic Christian tradition of the Holy Day of All Hallows. The Church never fused or confused the two, but various cultures began to merge the two. As a result, on Halloween many societies lump together Dracula, Jack the Ripper, Frankenstein, ghosts, and goblins while the Church celebrated All Saints Day. Does that mean, though, that we should not celebrate Halloween at all? No way! As Christians we can help those around us and our children to live and recall the true meaning of Halloween, while we celebrate that Holy Day in our Church. Just as Christopher Columbus, Martin Luther King, all the Veterans, etc. have a day set aside in honor for their courageous and noble example, so we also have a day in honor of all those who gracefully and devoutly proved by example, their love for Jesus Christ, their Lord and Savior. Thus, it would seem appropriate that if kids are to dress-up in outfits they should not roam the streets like the pagan belief of ghosts roaming the streets, outfits should be ones that are not evil and do not glorify violence. The whole event should allow families to enjoy their time together visiting homes while teaching the true value of All Hallows Eve (preferably wearing outfits that honor those who have gone before us). I think any reasonable person would view this as harmless activity. Still, Halloween is not a time for black magic, s\u00e9ances, and other rituals which glorify and exalt the evil that is a reality is this world. But can you celebrate Halloween?---absolutely, if it seeks to remember and celebrate the true tradition of the Holy Day from which it began, and for which we continue to celebrate All Saints Day.\n \n Like anything, Halloween is what you make of it. It has been a fruitful day of evangelistic outreach as Christians reach out to partygoers with the Good News of Christ. While Halloween may be the high holy day of the pagan world, in truth, it is just another day out of 365 days where we can honor and love Jesus for those he has sent as a positive example of how we should pickup our cross and follow Him. Participation in, or the complete rejection of, Halloween is ultimately a matter of conscience, and we are forbidden to judge each other in matters of conscience before God. The best course of action is to pray and ask the Spirit of God what you should, or shouldn't be involved in. Walk in the Spirit and see if there might be a way to honor God before the increasingly pagan world and use this day that society has made to signify darkness, for the glory of God. We are encouraged to \"Redeem the time, for the days are evil.\" So, ask the Lord to show you how to turn what has become for some, a bizarre unholy day, into something that will honor Him.\" Is it wrong to celebrate Halloween?by Fr.

It's truly a tragedy that you were raped and I would never wish something like that on anyone. I can't imagine how horrible something like that must be.\n \n But there is a logical disconnect from what Max supposedly hinted at, and the idea that he is an \"ally to rapists.\" Saying that you are being honest in your thoughts about them do not make those statements any less offensive or hateful. I think Max's point was probably that it seems unfair for the child to bear the consequences of the rape anymore than it has to--ironically it is the one party who was the least involved in the heinous act of rape, yet it is the only one who ends up dying over it in abortion. That is why I (though I have tried) cannot bring myself to condone abortion in cases of rape. \n \n If knowing that yet a another (the baby) shouldn't bear the cost of this rape makes me an \"ally to a rapist\", then I guess that's your opinion, though it's not a very logical one. And I think if you would simply be honest here, you would say that you are letting your emotions talk rather than reason with such statements. \n \n I'm sorry you were raped, and as I said I can't imagine what it would be like.

   "Please don't take this the wrong way, but I really feel that you have some issues here; this is the sort of thing that counseling is good for. It's truly a tragedy that you were raped and I would never wish something like that on anyone. I can't imagine how horrible something like that must be.\n\n \n I have been counseled and have been a counselor to rape victims. I worked for a rape counseling center. I am intimately aware of what rape is, and what rape victims go through. I don't need to imagine it. Yet you condesendingly dismiss my first-hand experiences, tell me I have issues, need counseling and all this stuff like you are the expert and poor little me has no idea. Exactly what way would have me take it? \n \n \nBut there is a logical disconnect from what Max supposedly hinted at, and the idea that he is an \"ally to rapists.\" Saying that you are being honest in your thoughts about them do not make those statements any less offensive or hateful.\n\n \n I would like you take just five minutes of your heart and thought away from the world of the unborn and think about a rape victim. Torn, hurting, life shredded. She will spend a long time learning to trust again. Not be afraid again. \n \n I don't care if you find my opinion offensive or hateful. I find you looking at rape victim, saying \"I am so sorry you were raped, but you actually don't get your body and life back, others are going to continue to keep control of it against your will, you really actually don't matter all that much\" as hateful and offensive. The message you send to rape victims is crystal clear - and disgusting.\n \n Please tell me what you would call forcing a rape victim to remain pregnant against her hill. She is not responsible for being pregnant. So you can't claim she should have though ahead. What would you call it?\n \n I call it rape.\n \n \nI think Max's point was probably that it seems unfair for the child to bear the consequences of the rape anymore than it has to--ironically it is the one party who was the least involved in the heinous act of rape, yet it is the only one who ends up dying over it in abortion. That is why I (though I have tried) cannot bring myself to condone abortion in cases of rape.\n\n \n I don't care if you condone it or nor from your not likely to be raped and certainly won't be pregnant from one vatage. So safe for you to dismiss rape victims, women's bodies, so easy and so cowardly.\n \n Make it law and I will help people break it. \n \n \nIf knowing that yet a another (the baby) shouldn't bear the cost of this rape makes me an \"ally to a rapist\", then I guess that's your opinion, though it's not a very logical one. And I think if you would simply be honest here, you would say that you are letting your emotions talk rather than reason with such statements.\n\n \n Really? - what is the logical definition of your forcing a women to remain pregnant against her will in a pregnancy she did not consent to? What does that make you - not to the baby - but to HER?\n \n Answer that question. Take two freakin seconds and think about her and not the damned fetus!\n \n \nI'm sorry you were raped, and as I said I can't imagine what it would be like. But I do know that the baby didn't do it and doesn't deserve to die over it.\n\n \n I don't want or need you to be sorry for me. I did not get pregnant from rape - and I have never had an abortion in case you are wandering around with either of those illsuions. \n \n However I WOULD have one in a HEARTBEAT if I my health or life were serious jaopardy or I were raped. But, my tubes are tied, inspired in part by men like you and Max. As a rape and abuse victim, rights to my body are paramount and you guys have an idiot president who is even more blind to issues of real women than the pair of you.\n \n Do you even comprehend how offensive you can be at times? In every single post on this topic you dismiss women. You know more than them, they are emotional, you know what is best for them, pregnancy is wonderful why would they say otherwise? You and Max and your benevolent type who patronize, trivialize, placate and condescend to women are not allies to women. I don't care how nice you and your wife think you are. In the bigger picture - you are a nightmare. .\n \n \nOf course, because you ARE pro-choice. It's your movement.\n\n \n I know lots of pro-life people - like my best friend in the whole world. They argue from the perspective of responsibility - one I can understand if not always agree with. You and Max argue from some romantic notion that pregnancy is a perpetual girft, all women naturally want to be mothers and no woman really matters in the scheme of things. Not a single shred of her sanity, life or dreams matters in the face of pregnancy to you. All she is a walking talking baby oven.\n \n \nIt's about your ideology, not the fact you are a woman. My wife is a woman too, but she sure doesn't share your ideology.\n\n \n So she is a female mysogynist. It's really not all that rare.",

   "Sigma,\n \nOh? Is the fetus \"willed\" into existance? In an unwanted pregnancy, the fetus was not there because the woman wanted it there. It is there against her will, because she does not want it there.\n \n To ask the question again: Which do you support more? The fetus' ability to use her body against her will, or her right to not let that happen?\n\n I do not have an answer to your repeated question because I do not believe it to be a valid question. We all make choices and we are responsible for the consequences of these choices to one degree or another. In most cases, the woman actively participates in actions that can make her pregnant. If you say that the fetus is using the woman's body against her will then you might as well say that the woman was using her own body against her own will. \n \n \nWhether it was there for 100 years or 1 year, in the legal sense the fetus is not a person. On what basis do you call it a sham? Why does it matter how \"young\" the law is? How is it a wild stretch of our constitution? How is it nonsense?\n\n It is a sham because an all-powerful right to privacy was stretched into existence by 9 supreme court justices. And a right to privacy, if it exists, should not supercede a right to life. The right to privacy is suppressed in many instances in order to protect life and the common good.\n \n The point made on the youth of the law was a point to indicate the general attitude of the United States populace to abortion prior to that point. Many act as though the law cannot be changed because it is part of our constitution. They act as if it is a founding \"right\" and tradition of our country. That is not true. It was invented in 1973.\n \n \nHow does the gov't limit our rights to our bodies, and how will there be anarchy if it didn't?\n\n It limits our rights to do things with our bodies all the time. We can't use our body to murder others, to endanger others with reckless behavior, to harm ourselves and others with drugs, etc. Without a rule of law, anarchy would prevail, this is not difficult to see.\n \n \nMorals are not legislated because they are morals (or at least, they shouldn't be). There are reasons behind morals, and some of those same reasons are used for laws. Simply because something is moral is not justification for making it into law.\n\n Morals are legislated. Morals should be legislated although not all of them must be legislated. But ones concerning killing others should definitely be legislated.\n \n There are reasons behind morals???? Whatever do you mean? Are you attempting to imply that there is morality behind morals?\n \n \nIt depends on who is doing the defining I suppose. In the sense of an independently functioning body, the fetus does not have one. That is not my justification for abortion btw, Jyoshu.\n \n Does the mother have two beating hearts? Two brains with brain waves? \n \n \nAny point marking personhood is arbitrary in some sense. Birth is the only one that is logically sound, easily marked and practical to enforce. \n \n I don't see marking personhood as the beginning of life and growth of the distinct human being as arbitrary. I see that as objective (and supported by science).\n \n \nNo. Are you making my point for me? Shall women be slaves?\n\n Holding someone to acting in a better way does not make her a slave. The fetus is cut off from having control over his or her body. A death sentence is imposed upon him without any due process. \n \n The effect of legal action has an effect on attitudes concerning who are persons. Slavery's end was brought about and then the civil rights movement demanded change in laws. Legal action changes minds-you would be hard pressed to find a southerner who would embrace slavery as a valid moral/legal position even though he might have value for the old agrarian, chivalrous plantation lifestyle. So too the current legal conditions have warped common sense of many in judging who is a person and allowed killing of people who are not given status as people.\n \n \nI wouldn't call it such emoticon_confused By what thinking is it a \"slave\"? It is subject to other's wills, but then so are coma patients. Is a coma patient a \"slave\" to their next-of-kin if the next-of-kin decides to pull the plug? I suppose, in a sense, the coma patient is a \"slave\" to the next-of-kin's decision, but it is not generally viewed as such. Is that what you meant?\n\n Slaves usually have masters who look out for their own interests rather than the interests of the slaves. This fits in abortion. It does not fit in the case of coma patients.\n \n \nSome of us also have the common sense to know that born children are different from the fetus in the womb. Born children are able to be put up for adoption. A fetus cannot be.\n\n Born children can be put up for adoption, good point. But\n born children must be fetuses in the womb prior to be born.\n \n \nI don't support smoking, but I support the right to smoke. I don't support drinking, but I support the right to drink. I don't support having fire-arms in the home, but I support the right to own fire-arms. I don't particularly like gay marriage, but I support the right of gay people to be in a legal relationship. I don't like S&M, but I support the right of people to have their private sex lives be whatever they please (generally). I don't like abortion, but I fully support women's rights to have them. I don't like Christianity, but I support their right to exist and preach. I don't like the Boy Scouts stance of anti-gays, but I support their right to exclude those they don't want. I don't like the fact that \"holiday parades\" are specifically banning Christmas songs, but I support their right as a private enterprise to do that.\n \n \n Your argument is absurd. I don't have to agree with someone or something to support their rights. It is not inherently evil. That is freedom.\n\n Freedom to kill with unlimited license is not often recognized as freedom. It is most often described as tyranny. \n \n None of the examples you give in comparison to abortion have this crucial aspect involved...in abortion, there is an immediate, imminent threat leading to the destruction of human life. Which of your examples results in the death of an estimated 4,000 human lives a day? Although many of your examples contain aspects that are morally wrong, none of your examples compare to the importance and urgency of abortion.\n \n \n And as it is said back to you an equal number of times: The choice to terminate her pregnancy. In what way do you want me to say it so you stop acting like no one is telling you what women want to choose? The right to choose whether or not to bear or beget a child.\n \n And yes, choice and freedom is the point of the constitution and bill of rights. The limitation of the federal gov't is a central theme of the document. State and individual rights and choice are of paramount importance in our society. A national ban on abortion violates the spirit of it.[/QUOTE]\n A woman's right to bear and beget a child remains intact whether or not there is a ban on abortion. \n \n But I will ask you again: What does one terminate when she terminates a pregnancy?\n \n A national ban on abortion topples the God of Choice. But I would be just as content with all of the states individually banning abortion.",

That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher.

   "Jito and Jessica,\n \n Jito recently thought I was challenging Jessica because I wondered if she was a pro-life Christian. Jito was right. I was attempting to determine if she was Christian and pro-choice in order to challenge her just as I challenge all pro-choice Christians. I think it is a contradiction in terms and in living. It doesn't seem to matter that Jessica is not a Christian since she still seems to enjoy debating abortion in the realm of Christianity. So here we go.\n \n \nnope. I do however follow Jesus' teachings of love, forgiveness and so on. Perhaps you could look up what the Bible says about abortion (here's a clue: NOTHING).\n\n \n \nNowhere does the Bible say \"and lo, the Lord said \"abortion is wrong and an abomination unto me\" or similar. Nowhere is it condemned and as we know, abortion was without a doubt around in Jesus' times yet he never says a word about it either. it seems odd that we have clothing advice, strict laws about mildew in houses and emissions of semen (Leviticus) yet not once did he condemn abortion. if it was such a big deal, you think it would be in there somewhere.\n\n First, let me start by saying that \"the Bible does not say anything. You cannot put a book in the witness-box and ask it what it really means.\"* And when the Bible does not say anything to whom do we look to tell us what the Bible says? So one must look to the proper interpreter of the Bible. That interpreter is the Catholic Church...the Catholic Church who put together the Bible and preserved it through the ages. The Catholic Church has always taught that abortion is wrong though Jessica challenges this in the quotes below.\n \n (As a side note, the Bible does not put forth specific condemnations concerning many things that are considered immoral in Christian living although it always gives us a firm basis for extrapolating to form moral teachings). \n \n (As another side note to Jessica specifically, Catholics do not adhere to the doctrine of sola scriptura so just because the Bible does not contain something specifically does not mean that it isn't contained within the Revelation of Christ. The Church rests on a three legged stool: Scripture, Tradition, and the teaching authority of the Church (the Magisterium).)\n \n In discussing abortion in the light of Christianity, I think you (Jessica and Jito) miss the essentials of Christianity and scripture. In spite of Jessica's specific challenges to scripture, the Bible unequivocally tells us that abortion is wrong and in stark contrast to the Christian message. It does that in the nativity of the Gospel of Luke and it does that in the Passion narratives of the four Gospels. The Christian story is about birth, creation, joy, and perseverance. It is also about sacrifice for others and giving life. \n \n Father Frank Pavone illustrates this by describing a remarkable contrast in thought on abortion between abortion supporters and Christ. \n \n Abortion supporters say, \"This is my body, I can do with it what I want. I can destroy others to preserve my life. I can destroy others so that I may live as I want. Do not interfere with me.\"\n \n Whereas, Christ says, \"This is my body, which is given up for you.\" \n \n \"This is my body\"--same words but much different in intent, in action, in charity, in love, in faith, in hope... Jesus gives his body away so that others live. Abortion proponents cling to their own bodies so that others die. \n \n There is a profound difference. Christian abortion supporters perhaps miss the most basic and fundamental precept of Christianity. For as Jesus said, \"Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\" John 15:13\n \n Jito declines to celebrate Christmas when this is one of the most important celebrations that there is. She doesn't see that giving a gift, no matter how poor in comparison, is in the spirit of Christ giving himself to us (not to mention the gifts of the wise men). She doesn't see that decorating the Christmas tree is not so much about raising a pagan totem as it is about spending time with the family-mimicking the Holy Family. Jito declines due to pagan influence but accepts abortion when there can be nothing so pagan as child sacrifice-but abortion does not even measure up to that most of the time. For the child is not sacrificed to some greater god or gods (no matter that they are false), it is very often sacrificed to the mother's convenience or reputation or state of life. Jito, I suppose wishes to maintain the purity of a Christian Christmas-that is a true celebration of Christmas-which is truly a celebration of the Birth of a Child. Mary became pregnant, without marital relations with her husband. They were homeless and took a long, arduous journey without modern convenience. Powerful men were searching for them to kill them. They didn't have the assistance of modern medical care.\n She persevered through perhaps one of the most difficult situations of pregnancy imaginable. That is the Christian example.\n \n I would say that an abortion does more to violate the Christmas message than any pagan ritual short of human sacrifice might. Christmas is stifled by promoting abortion because each abortion snuffs out the spirit of Christmas by snuffing the spirit of a Child. Each household should celebrate the Christmas of every birth--as it is, a gift from God.\n \n Now if Jesus came down from the cross at the request of the criminal next to him because he was hurting, or tired, or in danger...or if Mary said, \"No, I will not have this baby due to scandal or hardship or lack of medical care,\" then it might well be said that the Bible said nothing about abortion or even that the Bible approved abortion. Fortunately, the Bible tells us a different story. That story is one of sacrifice for others, one of giving life to others, and one of celebrating birth and humanity.\n \n \nand see this one: http://www.catholicsforchoice.org/n...iondecision.htm and http://www.cbctrust.com/abortion.html#3\n \n The RCs stance on abortion has changed dramatically over the years.\n\n To this, I must reply that sourcing Catholics for a Free Choice to explain the teachings of the Catholic Church is laughable.\n \n The information you cite does not refute the fact that the Church has always condemned abortion. It does show that there has been some theological debate as to when a person was \"ensouled.\" This stemmed partly from the fact that the process of pregnancy was not fully known. Augustine chose the point of \"quickening\" or first movement as the point of ensoulment because that very well might have been the first evidence of life in the womb at that time. As I said, for Christians \"real human life\" has never been a gray area. It has been an area that has been enlightened by science and technology but the child in the womb (newborn child was an error) has always been worthy of protection in the Christian view--at the time when it was known that life was present then the being was deemed worthy of protection.\n \n \nHe also mentions Romans 9:11, which states that God has predestined who will go to hell so there ain't a lot you can do about it.\n\n I don't see that in the text. But 2 Peter 3:9 states, \"The Lord is not slow about his promise as some count slowness, but is forbearing toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.\"\n \n Happy Holy Days.\n \n *G.K. Chesterton in Why I Am A Catholic  (Collected Works).",

If you say that the fetus is using the woman's body against her will then you might as well say that the woman was using her own body against her own will.\n\n \n If you believe the fetus is a distinct individual, then how can you escape that the distinct individual is using the woman's organs and life-processes to live? And if it is doing so and the woman does not wish it to, then it is against her will. It seems to me that you are dodging the question.\n \n The fact that she had sex does not negate the fact that she does not wish to be pregnant. Consenting to sex is consenting to sex, it is consenting to nothing else.\n \n \n\n It is a sham because an all-powerful right to privacy was stretched into existence by 9 supreme court justices. And a right to privacy, if it exists, should not supercede a right to life. The right to privacy is suppressed in many instances in order to protect life and the common good.\n\n \n Then you do not believe there is a right to privacy?\n \n Our rights do indeed supercede the right to life of others. The gov't cannot and should not be able to force me to use my body to sustain the life of another. I cannot envision a world where it is acceptable to do that.\n \n \n\n The point made on the youth of the law was a point to indicate the general attitude of the United States populace to abortion prior to that point.\n\n \n And what was that attitude? Don't ask don't tell, I believe it was. Abortions still occured before it was legal. Housewives performed them on each other with tools that were at hand, including the famous wire-hangers. The exact numbers are not known, but do you really think there would be so many now, as you quote, if the desire was not also there in the past? There were abortion recipes written on tombs for goodness sake. Abortion is hardly new. The desire is always there (within a population). I for one would rather have them legal and safe because I believe the safety and health of women are always more important than what they are carrying inside them. Without the woman, there would be nothing inside her, present or future. She should be taken care of first, before any consideration for what is growing inside her.\n \n \n\n Many act as though the law cannot be changed because it is part of our constitution. They act as if it is a founding \"right\" and tradition of our country. That is not true. It was invented in 1973.\n\n \n It wasn't \"invented\". It was \"recognized\". :)\n \n I truly believe it is in the philosophy of the founding of our country. Freedom from governmental invasion in a matter so fundamentally affecting a person as family life.\n \n \n\n It limits our rights to do things with our bodies all the time. We can't use our body to murder others, to endanger others with reckless behavior, to harm ourselves and others with drugs, etc. Without a rule of law, anarchy would prevail, this is not difficult to see.\n\n \n Virtually all you mention violate other's rights. The fetus has no rights to violate.\n \n If the fetus were recognized as a \"person\" and had constitutional rights it still would not have the right to live off of another person if that person did not want them there. As you say, our rights to our bodies are limited to our bodies. The fetus' rights are limited as well. It cannot use it's body to violate the woman's rights.\n \n \n\n Morals are legislated. Morals should be legislated although not all of them must be legislated. But ones concerning killing others should definitely be legislated.\n \n There are reasons behind morals???? Whatever do you mean? Are you attempting to imply that there is morality behind morals?\n\n \n Morals should not be legislated because they're moral. Legislation should exist to protect our rights, not because something is moral. The gov't does not exist to make us moral, it exists to protect our rights and our country.\n \n No, I am implying that morals are not legislated because they're moral.\n \n \n\n Does the mother have two beating hearts? Two brains with brain waves?\n\n \n For a certain amount of time during the pregnancy she does. The fetus does not exist in a void, it exists within her body. Once the heart forms, she does have two hearts beating within her body. Of course, all of this takes time to form, and consistant brain waves do not appear until around the 3rd trimester. Are you accepting of abortion before any of this forms?\n \n Is this going to devolve into the old \"two genetic codes = two distinct people!\" argument?\n \n \n\n I don't see marking personhood as the beginning of life and growth of the distinct human being as arbitrary. I see that as objective (and supported by science).\n\n \n I don't see marking personhood as the beginning of life outside of the woman's body as arbitrary either; it is logical, supported by science and is a lot easier to enforce as well. Once it is separate from it's mother, it is a distinct person with all rights guaranteed by the constitution.\n \n Your point is not objective because no-one knows when a woman concieves, not even the woman herself. Marking personhood at that point is not logical, because there is no way to track it. It would have to be retroactive.\n \n \n\n Holding someone to acting in a better way does not make her a slave. The fetus is cut off from having control over his or her body. A death sentence is imposed upon him without any due process.\n\n \n Holding someone to your morals, not her own, is making her a slave to your morals. You are attempting to make all women \"live up\" to your standards by law.\n \n The fetus never gained control over its body. It never had an independant body to have control over. \n \n \n\n The effect of legal action has an effect on attitudes concerning who are persons. Slavery's end was brought about and then the civil rights movement demanded change in laws. Legal action changes minds-you would be hard pressed to find a southerner who would embrace slavery as a valid moral/legal position even though he might have value for the old agrarian, chivalrous plantation lifestyle. So too the current legal conditions have warped common sense of many in judging who is a person and allowed killing of people who are not given status as people.\n\n \n In a certain sense the status quo changes minds. I don't think the law does, though the law affects the status quo. I certainly don't think it's a bad thing in this case. However, during all those years of it being illegal, as you've said, obviously has not changed people's minds about it. The desire was still there, and rampant by the looks of things, wouldn't you say? It is rediculous to think that, given how \"young\" the legality is, that all these woman's minds just changed instantly, or over the span of a few years.\n \n You would be naive to think that all these woman would quietly start believing that their unwanted pregnancy is really a wonderful thing as quickly as legal abortion was jumped on. And I think the reason is that this right that I am arguing for has always been desired, regardless of the law.\n \n \n\n Slaves usually have masters who look out for their own interests rather than the interests of the slaves. This fits in abortion. It does not fit in the case of coma patients.\n\n \n This fits with banning abortion as well. Not so much with abortion because the fetus was never concious and never had a body independent of the woman's. You cannot compare born people with a fetus. Apples and oranges in nearly all cases.\n \n A mother deciding for the fetus fits my analogy of next-of-kin deciding for the coma patient a lot more closely than it fits your master-slave analogy.\n \n \n\n Born children can be put up for adoption, good point. But\n born children must be fetuses in the womb prior to be born.\n\n \n And must be a single cell before that too.\n \n \n\n Freedom to kill with unlimited license is not often recognized as freedom. It is most often described as tyranny.\n\n \n And when the State over-rides individual rights for moral reasons it is most often described as a theist regime, or a fascist regime. They are one and the same.\n \n There is no unlimited license. It is a specific set of circumstances, namely pregnancy. Within a certain set of circumstances it is an unlimited license, I suppose. A limited unlimited license :p\n \n \n\n None of the examples you give in comparison to abortion have this crucial aspect involved...in abortion, there is an immediate, imminent threat leading to the destruction of human life. Which of your examples results in the death of an estimated 4,000 human lives a day? Although many of your examples contain aspects that are morally wrong, none of your examples compare to the importance and urgency of abortion.\n\n \n They weren't meant to compare to every aspect of abortion. They were meant to show that I can disapprove of something but still believe in the right. Whether it is morally wrong to me is immaterial except as to whether I myself would engage in it. \n \n \n\n A woman's right to bear and beget a child remains intact whether or not there is a ban on abortion.\n\n \n The right to decide whether or not to bear or beget a child. A woman already has the right to bear and beget, but she also should have the right to decide not to. The law should never determine whether or not she does.\n \n That right includes the right to terminate her pregnancy.\n \n \n\n But I will ask you again: What does one terminate when she terminates a pregnancy?\n\n \n er... the fetus inside her. Perhaps if you told me how you want me to phrase it? If it does not conflict with my beliefs I can phrase it however you please.\n \n \n\n A national ban on abortion topples the God of Choice. But I would be just as content with all of the states individually banning abortion.\n\n \n If the states individually banned it (as long as it was voted on) then we would not be having this conversation because there would be so few abortions desired (most likely).\n \n Do you deny that a national ban violates the spirit of the constitution, namely that the federal gov't should not, constitutionally, have the power to do that?",

   "Jessica,\n \nUnder what circumstances would you accpet abortion?\n\n \"Abortion is never an acceptable moral choice for any reason. What we are talking about in the case of \"double effect\" is collateral damage that was morally certain to occur before a morally upright action is taken does not always render an action immoral. The case of the cancerous uterus is the one I was taught in moral theology. If a woman has a cancerous uterus that is going to kill both mother and unborn child, it would be morally acceptable to remove the cancerous UTERUS in order to save the life of the mother. In doing so, we do not will the death of the pre-born baby, but the death of the baby is a foreseen double effect of removing the cancerous uterus. \n \n Remember, one cannot directly kill the baby to save the mother's life. In this case, we are removing the cancer, not willing the death of the child. This is essentially different than abortion. In abortion one is immediately willing the death of the innocent baby. That is never acceptable for any reason.\" written by Tim Staples (a Catholic Apologist) in an e-mail response he sent to me.\n \n \nYes. the unwanted pregnancy is obviously harming them or they wouldn't abort.\n\n I think, perhaps, that you are more of an idealist for your cause than I am for mine.\n \n \nNo. It's a zef, not a human being.\n\n So it's a different species? When, in your opinion does a \"zef\" turn into a human being?\n \n \nNo. It's alive before that as an egg and sperm.\n\n A sperm is alive. An egg is alive (I guess??). But the two join to become something new and more than simply a sperm and an egg. That's elementary biology. You can do better than that argument. It is a living human being at the moment of conception. Before that it is something different--a separate sperm and a separate egg.\n \n \nUsually not. 2/3 - 4/5 fail to implant so actually, growth and development are rare.\n\n Is there any development prior to implantation? Those that do implant, do develop right?\n \n \nso you are advocating punishment for the woman who miscarries. Even without intent, she must be punished for negligence, so the clarinet player who didn't know she was pregnant will be incarcerated for manslaughter. Your prisons are going to be full with women who miscarried. \n \n There would be no way to prove this in the court of law--I put that disclaimer on my statement. But if the clarinet player did not know she was pregnant then I'm not sure really how it is negligence either. \n \n \nThanks for the definition. Out of curiosity, how do you feel about the death penalty and Iraq war?\n\n I am against the death penalty although I do believe there was a time in the past when it could have been justly imposed--if there was no other way to protect citizens from a murderous criminal via imprisonment for example.\n \n My view on the Iraq war...Did the Iraq War have to be fought? Not necessarily. Can some good come of it? Possibly. The Pope was against it but didn't make any official or binding teachings. This is an area that is debatable among Catholics on whether it meets the criteria for a just war.\n \n It is estimated that 100,000 Iraqis have been killed in the war and that approximately 1400 Americans have been killed. It is estimated that 4,000 a day die from abortion? Since 1973 it is estimated that 45,366,554 babies have been killed. This does not belittle the importance of those Iraqis and Americans who have died. The Church teaches that each life is important. It does show that the terrorism and death happening in Iraq pales in comparison to the terrorism that we commit on our own people each day in this country.\n Plus, a soldier has a chance (ability, weapons, assistance, etc.) to defend himself? A soldier going to war is not 100% guaranteed that he will be killed or even injured. Those going to abortion have an almost 100% guarantee of death I believe.\n \n \nYes. This does not however include forcing bodily resource donation and harm to others.\n\n And who forced the woman to donate her bodily resources to making the \"zef?\"\n \n \nyes, it clearly hinges on BORN persons.\n\n We continue to disagree on this. I don't think there is any empasis on BORN in the text.\n \n \nThat's why fetal homicide laws are contradictory and nonsensical.\n\n So, is it accurate to say that you do not believe that one should be punished for attacking a mother and killing whatever it is that is growing inside of her?\n \n \n emoticon_wow Yes, labour involves laying about reading magazines, not hideous pain and episiotomies. max, word of advice - don't belittle the agony women go through in pregnancy and birth, it'll make you very unpopular.\n\n I wasn't belittling the work of mothers in child birth. I was saying that labor involves work on the part of the woman, thus the name labor. \n \n \nIf a woman chooses to go through it, that's great for her but you cannot be forced to go through this for another person (taking a zef to be aperson). \n \n I think the choice should be made prior to creation of the being.\n \n \nPlease show me.\n\n \n http://www.blackgenocide.org/photos.html \n \n http://www.abortionno.org/Resources/pictures.html \n \n \nIt's a political site and a project of Priests for Life and Noel. It doesn't matter if it was started by men or women. It's not offering women non-judgemental support after an abortion, but spinning a few stories to suggest that a substantial amount of women regret their abortion which they just don't. Why don't you have alook at http://www.imnotsorry.net/ started by women.\n \n And?\n \n\n I will accept that there are some women who do not suffer the effects of post abortion trauma/stress if you will admit that there are some that do. \n \n How can you tell that the website I provided is spinning stories and not giving true life accounts but you supply me with a website that you expect me to accept as not spinning? \n \n \nIt is a pro-life site, linked with pro-life sites and also contains frequent theological references (e.g. sin).\n\n The statements I made that you are responding to in this quote were concerning the textbooks.\n \n \nI did. I'm waiting for your evidence that a zef is a person as you've supplied no proof.\n\n The proof is in your textbooks. Have you looked up what I asked? What did it say? A zef is a living human being and its beginning as that entity is conception.\n \n Let me again refresh your memory. You asked me to prove that the \"zef\" was a \"living human being\" back in post #135, page 27. (you didn't say \"person\" earlier as you do now, I don't believe and you were asserting that a \"zef\" wasn't a human being as you have done many times as well as asserting that conception is not the starting point of life...but I guess that doesn't matter greatly being that I consider the beginning of a living human being as the beginning of personhood) In post #137, page 28, I asked you if you had a medical or biology textbook handy. You said you did. I then asked you to look up reproduction or the beginning of human life or something close to that in your textbooks to see what science says about the beginning of a living human being. \n \n \nI'm confused. What do you mean here?\n\n \n \nI agree. But how do you do this?\n\n Women deserve better than abortion because they deserve the emotional, financial, and family support to not have to go to those drastic measures. They deserve fathers/husbands/boyfriends who won't abandon them or who won't take a role in raising the child. They deserve friends and family that will help them through a tough time. They shouldn't have to go through the trauma of abortion stacked onto the trauma of teen pregnancy, pregnancy without a father, etc. They shouldn't have to make that decision in a rush during a time of despair, confusion, etc.\n \n Abortion is not a solution. Abortion never addresses the root of the problem which are those things I mentioned above. Abortion never addresses the rejection, abandonment, loneliness, financial struggle, lack of education, unsupportive family, abusive family or boyfriend, etc. that a women might experienced when seeking abortion. \n \n \nYes if abortion was made illegal tomorrow it would rarely happen...not. Look at any country where abortion is illegal and you'll see that it stil happens. women douche themselves with hydrochloric acid, self abort with sharp implements and so on to terminate a pregnancy. It doesn't stop it at all.\n \n Even if a zef was legally a person and abortion murder, you still wouldn't stop women - they can abort as soon as they find out their pregnant and nobody will know. Nobody knows about the \"person\" and there's no body. It'll be even harder to stop it in the US as there are multiple sites about self aborting, buying RU486 and so on (I will not discuss these sites in detail on a public forum. You can die from self aborting. If you want more details I'll pm you). Underground groups such as Jane will come into action again. Women can travel to another country to abort. You just won't stop it, whatever the penalties are.\n\n See the statement I made to Sigma earlier on the effect of legal actions on the mindset of society over the years in regard to the personhood of black people. Abortion may not be totally stopped with a change in the law but it can be significantly reduced. I don't believe that 4,000 illegal abortions a day will occur if it is outlawed.",

   "Jessica,\n \nYou're making forced bodily resource donation mandatory for women and women only. That is advocating less rights for women. Forced childbearing also means that women will do less well career wise, are less likely to continue education (only 2% go on to college) meaning they have far fewer chances in life than men.\n\n Again, I would not restrict a woman anymore than I would restrict a man. I would prohibit them both from killing. \n \n Concerning a womans \"forced bodily resource donation\" one must look to the beginning. In most instances, the woman donates her resources to become pregnant. The woman (and man) take action that results in a symbiosis between the woman and a new human being. So the mother institutes this donation of bodily resources herself. \"Forced bodily resource donation\" is therefore not an apt description.\n \n \nThey're not living human beings and you have yet to prove otherwise.\n\n If they're not living human beings then I'd like to know what the heck they are. See my previous post that addresses this more thoroughly.\n \n \nActually, as most fertilised eggs fail to implant and the miscarriage rate is very high (especially in the first month) the \"natural\" place for a zef is in a toilet bowl.\n\n I have witnessed my wife miscarriage with an 8-10 week fetus in a toilet bowl. The doctors told her after repeated calls that everything was probably okay because she wasn't bleeding very heavily. So we stayed home. As she hysterically cried, I had to dig the fetus out of the toilet to find out if she had in fact miscarried because she thought she did but she couldn't tell for sure. It had a head, eyes, and discernible limbs. I don't think the toilet is the natural place for a \"zef.\"\n \n \nYes, I've known women miscarry. I have seen few that think it's a child and even those that do aren't as pained as people who lose a born child. You insult people who've gone through the agony of losing a child when you say a failed implantation is the same thing.\n\n I do nothing to dimish someone's grief in losing a child by stating that women who miscarry may go through something similar though less painful.\n \n \nBy women when they give birth, yes. Remember, they are voluntarily giving birth.\n\n Do you think this phenomenon would be entirely lost otherwise?",

It is estimated that 4,000 a day die from abortion? Since 1973 it is estimated that 45,366,554 babies have been killed. \n\n \n Killing babies is illegal. Contact the police if you see this happening.\n \n That aside, the WHO states that 1 480 000 under 5s died from vaccine preventable diseases in 2003 (see http://www.vaccinefund.org/default.aspx?page=preventable_disease.html&lang=en) and that's just the under 5s, and that's just vaccine  preventable diseases not easily  preventable diseases suhc as cholera. What's your opinion on the Global Gag rule?\n \n \nIt does show that the terrorism and death happening in Iraq pales in comparison to the terrorism that we commit on our own people each day in this country.\n\n \n And forced gestation would be terrorism against women. You do a great disservice to the people of Iraq who have died brutally and painfully when you compare them to a non-sentient mass of tissue: the two just don't compare.\n \n \nAnd who forced the woman to donate her bodily resources to making the \"zef?\"\n\n \n This is irrelevant. By *your* argument it doesn't matter if the woman consented to sex or not as you're against rape and incest pregnancies. Out of interest, where do you stand on pregnancy of minors (lets say 11 - rare but it does happen) given that 11 year olds are not physically ready for pregnancy?\n \n \nSo, is it accurate to say that you do not believe that one should be punished for attacking a mother and killing whatever it is that is growing inside of her?\n\n \n Post viability, I can see the argument. \n \n \nI think the choice should be made prior to creation of the being.\n\n \n This is irrelevant. In rape related pregnancies, the woman has not made what you consider a choice to \"create a human being\" yet you still condemn abortion. Therefore any choice is irrelevant.\n \n \nhttp://www.blackgenocide.org/photos.html \n\n \n The final 4 pictures are clearly of the same case. This looks far too large to be 24 weeks, and as it is intact, it doesn't look like an abortion. The amount of blood and the bruising suggests that this is an emergency caesarian that's gone wrong - and the poor family are now having their tragedy touted as an \"evil abortion\". \n \n 2nd down in the middle: I've seen this labelled as anything between 8-12 weeks. I believe the coin beside it is nearly an inch in size (I'm not familiar with american coins) which would make the fetus approx. 7 inches long which is waaay too big for 9 weeks. I'd also like to know how the head is miraculously in proportion to the rest of the body in these photos when this doesn't happen at all during pregnancy: a newborn babies head is far too big for it's body. These photos are fake. \n \n \nI will accept that there are some women who do not suffer the effects of post abortion trauma/stress if you will admit that there are some that do. \n\n \n No, you have to accept that the majority  of women don't suffer stress and long term psychological damage (most women report feeling relieved after an abortion). I'm well aware that a minority do suffer stress although this is not always because of the abortion (they are distressed at their partners reaction etc). More and better counselling is needed in clinics so that women don't make the wrong decision.\n \n \nHow can you tell that the website I provided is spinning stories and not giving true life accounts but you supply me with a website that you expect me to accept as not spinning? \n\n \n Tada! You got it! Your site and mine are both biased. \n \n \nThe statements I made that you are responding to in this quote were concerning the textbooks. The proof is in your textbooks.

But this doesn't happen.\n \n \nThey shouldn't have to go through the trauma of abortion\n\n \n To the woman aborting, the pregnancy is traumatic and the abortion is the ending of the trauma. \n \n \n They shouldn't have to make that decision in a rush during a time of despair, confusion, etc.\n\n \n \"In a rush\"? In the UK, a woman has to wait approx 3 weeks between her first doctors appointment and the TOP: hardly in a rush. Most of America doesn't have abortion providors so the wait can be even longer. You'rea lso forgetting what causes the \"despair and confusion\": pregnancy.\n \n \nAbortion is not a solution. Abortion never addresses the root of the problem which are those things I mentioned above.\n\n \n And how do you propose to solve these problems?\n \n \n Abortion never addresses the rejection, abandonment, loneliness, financial struggle, lack of education, unsupportive family, abusive family or boyfriend, etc. that a women might experienced when seeking abortion. \n\n \n I agree, there should be more options for a woman wanting to continue the pregnancy such as financial aid and so on. However, you can't make unsupportive families magically supportive, you can't wave a wand and make abusive boyfriends not abusive, you can't make a woman want a pregnancy if she just doesn't. \n \n \nSee the statement I made to Sigma earlier on the effect of legal actions on the mindset of society over the years in regard to the personhood of black people. \n\n \n You can't convince people that a zef is a baby. Even with all the pro-life lies around now America is pretty evenly split on the issue. Face it: a lot of people just don't and never will think a fertilised egg is a baby and/or that it has rights over the woman. Women have always aborted, and they always will.\n \n \nAbortion may not be totally stopped with a change in the law but it can be significantly reduced. I don't believe that 4,000 illegal abortions a day will occur if it is outlawed.\n\n \n Really. Do you honestly think women are just going to shrug and blissfully continue the pregnancy? They don't in any country where abortion is illegal, and they didn't before it was legal in the US. Abortion has always happened, and will always happen. I've seen no evidence that suggests that RvW significantly increased the abortion rate, and now with the advent of the internet the chances of it being reduced are even less.",

   "Jito and Jessica,\n So one must look to the proper interpreter of the Bible. That interpreter is the Catholic Church...\n\n \n It goes without saying that all other Christian denominations would disagree with this.\n \n \nThe Catholic Church has always taught that abortion is wrong though Jessica challenges this in the quotes below.\n\n \n Don't lie to me Max, I will get annoyed...the catholic churches stance has flip flopped on this issue.\n \n \n(As another side note to Jessica specifically, Catholics do not adhere to the doctrine of sola scriptura so just because the Bible does not contain something specifically does not mean that it isn't contained within the Revelation of Christ. The Church rests on a three legged stool: Scripture, Tradition, and the teaching authority of the Church (the Magisterium).)\n\n \n I'm aware of this. So you just invent things and go against what the Bible teaches. Men make rules about things in Gods name. That's blasphemous.\n \n \nIn spite of Jessica's specific challenges to scripture, the Bible unequivocally tells us that abortion is wrong and in stark contrast to the Christian message. \n\n \n Find me the specific passage that condemns abortion. You won't be able to because it isn't there.\n \n \nIt does that in the nativity of the Gospel of Luke and it does that in the Passion narratives of the four Gospels. The Christian story is about birth, creation, joy, and perseverance. It is also about sacrifice for others and giving life. \n\n \n Please cite specific verses to discuss.\n \n \nFather Frank Pavone\n\n \n Uh-oh. emoticon_frazzled \n \n \n... illustrates this by describing a remarkable contrast in thought on abortion between abortion supporters and Christ. \n \n Abortion supporters say, \"This is my body, I can do with it what I want. I can destroy others to preserve my life. I can destroy others so that I may live as I want. Do not interfere with me.\"\n \n Whereas, Christ says, \"This is my body, which is given up for you.\" \n \n \"This is my body\"--same words but much different in intent, in action, in charity, in love, in faith, in hope... Jesus gives his body away so that others live. Abortion proponents cling to their own bodies so that others die. \n\n \n Jesus was the son of God and part of the Holy Trinity: we aren't. Jesus was created to sacrfice his life for our sins: we weren't.\n \n \nThere is a profound difference. Christian abortion supporters perhaps miss the most basic and fundamental precept of Christianity. For as Jesus said, \"Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\" John 15:13\n\n \n Greater love: not that it is wrong to not do this\n \n \nFortunately, the Bible tells us a different story. That story is one of sacrifice for others, one of giving life to others, and one of celebrating birth and humanity.\n\n \n How conveniently vague. Also based on the false premise that a zef is a person.\n \n \nTo this, I must reply that sourcing Catholics for a Free Choice to explain the teachings of the Catholic Church is laughable.\n\n \n Because they dare to have a different interpretation? One that is in fact based on the Bible as opposed to vague suppositions about what Jesus and God might think about something?",

My pet godfish has both eyes and a heart, but that doesn't make it a person.\n \n \nAt 21 days the heart is beating and pumping blood through the body. By 28 days the arms and legs are growing. \n\n \n And? A person without arms and legs is still a person.\n \n \nBy 30 days a brain is present. \n\n \n Really. A fully functional brain is present? I advise you to think carefully before you answer that.\n \n \nEars, mouth, nose begin to come into form at 35 days and brain waves can be recorded at 40 days.\n\n \n Max, you are clearly getting your information off anti-abortion propoganda sites.

Do you really think I pine away beleiving this is second best?\n \n That relationship working out? It never could have been. It was more than the abuse - it was cultural differences - interest differences. How we ever connected is beyond me.

Is that what you hoped for?\n\n \n I don't know what I hoped for. But right now - I really like being single. My son is ten. I am 35 (today as a matter of fact). I am uninterested, unwilling and unable to have more children. I have a gypsy spirit and the urge to run - not settle (which I will do once my son is in college).

Would it have been father, mother, and child?\n\n \n Nope - what we have right now is awesome. I have become stronger than ever. I have two good jobs, a business, great friends, a thriving social life, hobbies, I bought a house, I make enough money, I am happy. None of this was the case when I was married, and none of it was accomplished until his chains were off of me.\n \n I have created a safe, secure loving world for me and my son. As far as the father role goes - the best man I have ever known in my life is his mentor. I could not ask for a better father for him.\n \n No - your Leave It To Beaver illusions don't hold me nor are they the measure of my success or joy.",

If I grow weary of parenthood, under your logic, I should simply be able to toss them in a gunney sack and drop them off the nearest bridge.\n\n \n False analogy. The circumstances surrounding pregnancy are not comparable to the circumstances of child-rearing. Your life-processes are not shared with anything inside you in child-rearing. You are not providing the body for something else in child-rearing. You can put a born child up for adoption, leave it under safe-haven laws, leave it with a relative, friend, stranger, orphanage, etc. None of these apply to a fetus in the womb. You cannot put a fetus down, another cannot care for a fetus. There is no comparison.\n \n \n\n No, there will always be people who prefer to kill for convenience regardless of the legality. The combination of things you need in order to pull this off make it pretty unappealing, though. First you need a pregnant woman who is willing to become a felon.. Then you need a doctor who is also willing to be a felon. In the past, when abortion was illegal, and doctors who performed them faced murder charges, you did not see a whole lot of illgal abortions. There were certainly some, but not many.\n\n \n And they will not benefit from modern surgical practises which will kill women. Surgical practises should not be driven underground. You do not need a doctor to have an abortion, groups of housewives used to do it. There is a thread here (you've posted there) of a girl who was hit in the stomache with a baseball bat to have a forced miscarriage. And this is with abortion being legal. \n \n You are deluding yourself thinking that the desire will go away. Look how many are performed. Women do not do this on a whim, that it is so prevalent now is not because they are brainwashed or are forced; this right has always been desired regardless of the law. Abortion recipes were written on ancient tombs, and that's just written recipes. How long were they \"women's secrets\" passed down from mother to daughter?\n \n The desire has always been here, the legality does not affect that. Making it illegal will only kill more women.\n \n \n\n What you are essentially saying as that since murder is still commited despite the fact that it is legal, we should legalize murder. Since bank robberies are still committed despite the fact that they are illegal, we should legalise those as well.\n\n \n No, we are saying that you will not stop abortions by making them illegal. Isn't that your goal? All you will do is kill more women. Which do you care more about, the fetus being killed by abortion or the women being killed by laws driving it underground? The women are the most important participant in the pregnancy relationship, imo.\n \n \n\n bull. babies born at 6 months have a survival rate in excess of 98%.\n\n \n Source? That seems awfully high. \n From the McGill University Health Centre Journal, June 2002: \n \n \n[A]t 24 weeks the [survival] rate is 50 percent; and at 22 weeks, two percent. At the MUHC the majority of parents of 24 week-old babies will opt for intensive care. The baby's condition is then reassessed on a daily basis to see if it is still appropriate to proceed. Barrington says most of the babies who are not going to survive die within the first 24 to 72 hours of being born. \n\n \n At 24 weeks (6 months) it is at 50%\n \n \n\n So when does personhood begin? Does it begin with a hearbeat? Brain waves? The ability to survive outside the womb?\n\n \n When it's life processes are independant of another living creature.\n \n \n\n Yet history proves you incorrect here. When abortion was illegal, right here in this country, abortion was almost non existant. It is very difficult to find statistics for this because it was such a non issue that it was largely overlooked. The only year I ever managed to find government statics for was 1958, when according to the Attorney Generals office there were an estimated 250 illegal abortions performed in this country.\n\n \n Illegal abortions were not tracked. There is no way to have any solid numbers because there was no way to track them. Any numbers are pure speculation.\n \n \n\n Unlike other things (guns, drugs, alchohol, etc....) where legality has been shown to have very little influence on bahavior, abortion has shown legality to have a huge impact. I would imagine that this is becuase a woman who is willing to wander down to the local abortion clinc and charge a D&C to her mastercard is not willing ot take substantial risks to her health, as well as risking a felony conviction, by having a bakc alley abortion done.\n\n \n You don't know what effect legality has had on it. There are no numbers besides speculation on the number of illegal abortions that occured, because they were done in private either alone or with close family/friends. They weren't reported. \n \n Given how many are performed today, we know that the desire was rampant. You would be deluded to think that all these women have it on a whim only because it's legal.\n \n \n \n\n Children in general are parasitic by nature. Many grown people are parasitic by nature.\n\n \n But none other besides a fetus is a literal parasite. None other will die if separated from woman as a fetus would in the time frame most abortions are performed.\n \n \n\n Nobody is making women slaves and walking incubators. Nature did that. Your sole biological purpose on this earth is to propogate, to pass your genes to another generation. Anything you accomplish along the way is secondary to that single biological imperative. If you die without having children, you have failed in life at the most basic level. You have failed as a biological entity. This is the way it is, and I don't think there is really any debate possible. As animals, nature intended for us to propogate.\n\n \n There is no law, there should be no law, enforcing \"nature\". \"natural = good\" is a ridiculous argument. It is up to each of us if we want to have children or not, regardless if it's \"natural\".\n \n \n\n I will admit that women kind of get screwed on this deal becasue pregnancy certainly looks like it is uncomfortable. Thats life. Quite your whining.\n\n \n Deformity? Born premature? Deflated lung? Anemic? You're SOL. Is that your argument?\n \n \n\n Maybe you could prove this for us. As I said before, it is difficult to find good numbers in regard to illegal abortions. Of course, we know that nearly 2000 women died last year due to complications of legal abortions, so it would seem highly unlikely that given the fact that in '58, when single pregnancy rates were actually up, and thre was quite a bit of social stigma attached to an unwed mother, that more than 2000 women were killed during the course of an illegal abortion, especially since, according to the attorney general, there were only around 250 performed that year. Even if we say the attorney generals number are off by a factor of 4, and everybody who recieved an illegal abortion died during the course if it, according to my calculation, more women are still dying form abortion today when it is legal.\n\n \n Your calculations are meaningless. Could you provide a source on \"2000 women died last year due to complications of legal abortions\"? Since 1970 more than a million abortions have been done in the Netherlands. Only one fatal complication occurred in one of the clinics, three fatalities were reported from hospitals, all due to complications of anesthesia. If all patients who underwent an abortion would have delivered a child the number of fatalities would have been 88, that is the maternal death rate for deliveries in the Netherlands\n \n \n\n What I don't understand is why this is such an issue. I'm sure we all remember several years ago when abortion clinics were being blown up. The number of doctors willing to perform abortions was cut in half after only 2 clinics were destroyed.

Nature did that. Your sole biological purpose on this earth is to propogate, to pass your genes to another generation. Anything you accomplish along the way is secondary to that single biological imperative. If you die without having children, you have failed in life at the most basic level. You have failed as a biological entity. This is the way it is, and I don't think there is really any debate possible. As animals, nature intended for us to propogate.\n \n I will admit that women kind of get screwed on this deal becasue pregnancy certainly looks like it is uncomfortable. Thats life. Quite your whining.\n\n \n I think the portrait you paint of a woman having an abortion here makes it pretty dang obvious that you are clueless about the circumstances of desperate women, and that your view of them is pretty danged poor over all.\n \n Bastards like you remind me why I am single.",

   "Except for parenthood in general. I am forced to donate my bodily resources to the service of my children constantly. Can I kill them? They are, after all, entirely parasitic. \n\n \n Really? They're growing off your body and causing you physical harm? I think not. You CLEARLY don't understand the medical meaning of the word \"parasitic\", but given the rubbish spouted in the rest of your post I'm not surprised.\n \n \nThey consume my food, water, \n\n \n These aren't bodily resources. Would you like this explaining to you?\n \n \nIf I grow weary of parenthood, under your logic, I should simply be able to toss them in a gunney sack and drop them off the nearest bridge.\n\n \n No, you can hand them to the authorities and as you advocate violence below, I think it's probably a good idea that you do this and give yourself a break, get some therapy and deal with your homicidal tendencies. Your children shouldn't be around a violent wannabe offender like you.\n \n \nThe combination of things you need in order to pull this off make it pretty unappealing, though. First you need a pregnant woman who is willing to become a felon.. \n\n \n Hardly. There's no body, there's no evidence, there's no conviction, she's not a felon. The only time that you are likely to get a conviction is if a woman goes to ER from a botched abortion and the doctor chooses to call the police: which many will not do as they will consider the womans health to be the priority.\n \n \nThen you need a doctor who is also willing to be a felon.\n\n \n No, you need to buy RU 486 over the internet (easily done), take large amounts of vitamin C, get a pointy object etc etc etc. Doctors aren't necessary for a woman to self-abort: she just needs the right implements. and that's of course before we look at Jane (you're clearly ignorant about this subject, so you won't have heard of them - you can start reading here http://search.eb.com/women/articles/Jane.html) and the fact that a heck of a lot of doctors were willing to perform abortions before RvW and will do again.\n \n [QUOTE=\"daewoo\" In the past, when abortion was illegal, and doctors who performed them faced murder charges, you did not see a whole lot of illgal abortions.[/QUOTE]\n \n Really. Please provide unbiased evidence of these many murder charges.\n \n \nThere were certainly some, but not many.\n\n \n Please explain how this is wrong http://eileen.250x.com/GerriS/numbers_sykes.htm maths has never been my strong point.\n \n \nWhat you are essentially saying as that since murder is still commited despite the fact that it is legal, we should legalize murder. Since bank robberies are still committed despite the fact that they are illegal, we should legalise those as well.\n\n \n Oh WOW this is totally new!!! Nobody's ever put it to me like this before!! I am now pro-life!!! [/sarcasm]\n \n Abortion is legal because it is necessary. Without it women die. \n \n \nbull. babies born at 6 months have a survival rate in excess of 98%. \n\n \n And what is your medical source for this?\n \n \nSo when does personhood begin? Does it begin with a hearbeat? Brain waves? The ability to survive outside the womb?\n\n \n Birth. \n \n \nI would imagine that this is becuase a woman who is willing to wander down to the local abortion clinc and charge a D&C to her mastercard is not willing ot take substantial risks to her health, as well as risking a felony conviction, by having a bakc alley abortion done.\n\n \n And here we go with the abortion opponent dismissal stereotyping: you know the propoganda's changes since the 1980's, right? now you pretend they're \"victims of the pro-abort media\" etc. You have just proved once again that you are entirely ignorant of abortion and womens issues. Want to stop abortion? why don't you help women continue the pregnancy instead of condemning them? Just an idea.\n \n \nmastercard is not willing ot take substantial risks to her health\n\n \n Now this is strange -further down you say that legal abortion is MORE dangerous than illegal abortion. Make up your mind.\n \n \nChildren in general are parasitic by nature. Many grown people are parasitic by nature.\n\n \n Nope. They are not attached to a host.\n \n \nNobody is making women slaves and walking incubators. Nature did that. Your sole biological purpose on this earth is to propogate, to pass your genes to another generation. \n\n \n Really. Then please explain to me why most women will live for 840 months plus but only be pregnant for less than 20. Now I may just be a walking incubator but that sure sounds odd if our sole purpose is to be pregnant. and let me guess - your job is to spread your seed to as many women as possible.\n \n \n As animals, nature intended for us to propogate.\n\n \n Funny. i thought we were above being animals - the way we farm them and control them you'd certainly think so. \n \n \nI will admit that women kind of get screwed on this deal becasue pregnancy certainly looks like it is uncomfortable. Thats life. Quite your whining.\n\n \n \"Uncomfortable\"? Heck, that doesn't even begin to cover it.You know that it involves the womans internal organs moving, right? and that's just for starters.\n \n \n As I said before, it is difficult to find good numbers in regard to illegal abortions. Of course, we know that nearly 2000 women died last year due to complications of legal abortions, \n\n \n Source? You can't just spew out random numbers, you have to provide a reliable source.\n \n \nEven if we say the attorney generals number are off by a factor of 4, and everybody who recieved an illegal abortion died during the course if it, according to my calculation, more women are still dying form abortion today when it is legal.\n\n \n and how exactly is an operation performed by a qualified practitioner MORE dangerous than one carried out by a knitting needle and a botle of vodka? Or by douching with hydrochloric acid? Which pro-lie site did you read this claptrap off?\n \n \nWhy doesn't the anti-abortion lobby get its act together and set up a charitable front like the palestenians and blow up some more clinics? \n\n \n Because it's murder, and they'll get the death penalty. \n \n \ndoctors are not generally courageous folks, pro choicers would have a tough time convincing your average doctor that it is worth it to risk their lives, and their families lives, to perfomr abortions.\n\n \n Yup, MUCH better that the woman dies doing it illegally.

   "Jessica,\n \nSo a molar pregnancy is a \"living human being\"?\n\n \"Types of Molar Pregnancy \n There are two types of molar pregnancy, complete and partial. Complete molar pregnancies have only placental parts (there is no baby), and form when the sperm fertilizes an empty egg. Because the egg is empty, no baby is formed. The placenta grows and produces the pregnancy hormone, called HCG, so the patient thinks she is pregnant. Unfortunately, an ultrasound (sometimes called a sonogram) will show that there is no baby, only placenta. A partial mole occurs when 2 sperm fertilize an egg. Instead of forming twins, something goes wrong, leading to a pregnancy with an abnormal fetus and an abnormal placenta. The baby has too many chromosomes and almost always dies in the uterus. Thus, molar pregnancies are \"accidents of nature\" that are not anyone's fault. They are not caused by behavior, but they are more common in older women and in certain geographic locations. Also, although most molar pregnancies occur after a miscarriage, some occur after an ectopic (tubal) pregnancy or even a normal delivery.\"\n \n From http://www.obgyn.net/women/articles/molarpreg_dah.htm\n \n The first type of molar pregnancy described is not a human being. The second is.\n \n \nThat aside, the WHO states that 1 480 000 under 5s died from vaccine preventable diseases in 2003 (see http://www.vaccinefund.org/default.aspx?page=preventable_disease.html&lang=en) and that's just the under 5s, and that's just vaccine  preventable diseases not easily  preventable diseases suhc as cholera. What's your opinion on the Global Gag rule?\n\n I don't think I know enough details about the global gag rule to state an opinion on it.\n \n \nAnd forced gestation would be terrorism against women. You do a great disservice to the people of Iraq who have died brutally and painfully when you compare them to a non-sentient mass of tissue: the two just don't compare.\n\n Forced gestation? You are coining so many new phrases. Mass of tissue? This description shows a rudimentary appreciation of biology. \n \n Does the fetus not die brutally and painfully?\n \n \nThis is irrelevant. By *your* argument it doesn't matter if the woman consented to sex or not as you're against rape and incest pregnancies. Out of interest, where do you stand on pregnancy of minors (lets say 11 - rare but it does happen) given that 11 year olds are not physically ready for pregnancy?\n\n \n \nThis is irrelevant. In rape related pregnancies, the woman has not made what you consider a choice to \"create a human being\" yet you still condemn abortion. Therefore any choice is irrelevant.\n\n Rape related pregnancies are a minority of the whole though one rape is too many and one abortion of a child resulting from rape is too many.\n You often try to deflect the focus to rape when we are talking about a woman's responsibility for her actions and her part in bringing about a child. The two are separate arguments to address two separate situations. Women (and men) should bear the responsibility for their actions--especially when it brings about another human life--as we are all required to do in other situations. Women who are raped should attempt to see the value of the human life outside of the horrible offense committed against her. I hope that she would not respond with the violence that she condemns.\n \n \nThe final 4 pictures are clearly of the same case. This looks far too large to be 24 weeks, and as it is intact, it doesn't look like an abortion. The amount of blood and the bruising suggests that this is an emergency caesarian that's gone wrong - and the poor family are now having their tragedy touted as an \"evil abortion\". \n \n 2nd down in the middle: I've seen this labelled as anything between 8-12 weeks. I believe the coin beside it is nearly an inch in size (I'm not familiar with american coins) which would make the fetus approx. 7 inches long which is waaay too big for 9 weeks. I'd also like to know how the head is miraculously in proportion to the rest of the body in these photos when this doesn't happen at all during pregnancy: a newborn babies head is far too big for it's body. These photos are fake. \n \n What would an abortion look like in an \"un-faked\" photo in your opinion? If the photos were real would they look less human? Have you ever seen abortion photos from any other source besides pro-life sources?\n \n \nNo, you have to accept that the majority  of women don't suffer stress and long term psychological damage (most women report feeling relieved after an abortion). I'm well aware that a minority do suffer stress although this is not always because of the abortion (they are distressed at their partners reaction etc). More and better counselling is needed in clinics so that women don't make the wrong decision.\n\n I have to accept that the majority of women don't suffer stress because of one study (http://eileen.250x.com/Main/Pass/PassStdy.htm)? A study that only measures effects on womens for 2 years post abortion? A study with a sample size of 882 out of 1.5 million abortions? I'm not sure that this is definitive.\n \n \nWorld Health Organisation: see http://www.who.int/reproductive-hea...s_04/index.html for more details. \n \n Also, I'm not sure WHO statistics are accurate especially when it comes to abortion. See this:\n \n http://www.realwomenca.com/newsletter/1999_Sept_Oct/article_10.html \n \n The WHO is after all, a biased, pro-choice group right? \n \n As for the abortion/breast cancer link, it is controversial as I said:\n \n \nThe breast cancer link doesn't exist. See here for starters: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3431817.stm which includes the quote:\n \n \"Christine Fogg, joint chief executive of Breast Cancer Care, said: \"Current research has consistently failed to show any link between induced or spontaneous abortions and breast cancer risk.\" \n \n She said \"scare stories\" which claimed to show a link increased the anxiety of many women. \n \n \"We want to reassure women that there is no proven link between abortion and the risk of breast cancer and that age remains the strongest risk factor for breast cancer.\" \" \n \n \n http://www.abortionbreastcancer.com/start/",

Exactly.\n\n Well each case is different so I'm not sure how you are going to measure this pain evidentially, as you are very keen on evidence. Do you have any evidence that a woman losing a born child grieves more than one who loses an unborn child? Of course, I believe it would be less painful if a mother or father spends more time with the child to bond. But less painful does not mean that it can't be extremely painful. Weren't you talking about keeping emotion out of this debate and then you introduce something like the feelings experienced by those who lose their children?",

   "Jess,\n \nOriginally Posted by maximus\n Jito and Jessica,\n So one must look to the proper interpreter of the Bible. That interpreter is the Catholic Church... \n \n \nIt goes without saying that all other Christian denominations would disagree with this.\n\n Yes, of course they would, that's why they are called Protestants. They protest against the Catholic Church. They broke away from the original Church after 1500 years. They broke away from the Church that edited, compiled, and preserved the Bible that all Christians now use (the New Testament that is). And their protest has led to 33,000 different denominations, each with its own version of Christianity.\n \n \nDon't lie to me Max, I will get annoyed...the catholic churches stance has flip flopped on this issue.\n\n I do not lie. The Catholic Church has always taught that abortion is wrong.\n \n \nOriginally Posted by max\n (As another side note to Jessica specifically, Catholics do not adhere to the doctrine of sola scriptura so just because the Bible does not contain something specifically does not mean that it isn't contained within the Revelation of Christ. The Church rests on a three legged stool: Scripture, Tradition, and the teaching authority of the Church (the Magisterium).) \n \n \nI'm aware of this. So you just invent things and go against what the Bible teaches. Men make rules about things in Gods name. That's blasphemous.\n\n That's a very strong accusation. If you could enumerate and elaborate on these things that we have invented it might be helpful.\n \n \nFind me the specific passage that condemns abortion. You won't be able to because it isn't there.\n\n Must everything be spelled out for you? Do you require this of all of your learning, all of your reading, all of your communication with others?\n \n \nPlease cite specific verses to discuss.\n\n One has only to read the nativity of Luke or the sacrifice of Jesus' life in the Passion stories of the Gospels.\n \n \nJesus was the son of God and part of the Holy Trinity: we aren't. Jesus was created to sacrfice his life for our sins: we weren't.\n\n Hey, you sure do sound like a Christian.\n \n \nHow conveniently vague. Also based on the false premise that a zef is a person.\n\n \n \n \nBecause they dare to have a different interpretation? One that is in fact based on the Bible as opposed to vague suppositions about what Jesus and God might think about something?\n\n One that is fact based on the Bible? Are you saying that CFFC's position is endorsed by the Bible? Are you saying that the Bible specifically endorses abortion? Is your assertion due to having read evidence of this in the Bible? Can you please provide chapter and verse as you are requiring of me?\n \n It is not because they have a different interpretation, it is because they have a wrong interpretation/because they are rabidly pro-choice. As you eliminate any pro-life site as a reliable source then I must do the same to any pro-choice site. \n \n Furthermore, these people cannot hold true to their Catholic faith while at the same time endorsing abortion. The Church teaches that, regarding a law permitting abortions, it is \"never licit to obey it, or to take part in a propaganda campaign in favor of such a law, or to vote for it\" (Evangelium Vitae 73) (Voting Guide for Serious Catholics)",

   "As for the abortion/breast cancer link, it is controversial as I said:\n \n\n \n It is only controversial among those who refuse to accept reality. The breast cancer/abortion link was addressed in this forum here .\n \n \nThe results should make it clear that studies which are properly designed show pregnancies that end in abortion don't increase the risk of breast cancer. \n\n \n -Professor Valerie Beral, Director, Cancer Research UK Epidemiology Unit, University of Oxford \n \n \nSome previous reviews on abortion and breast cancer have reached mistaken conclusions because they mixed together data from reliable and unreliable types of study.\n\n \n -Professor Sir Richard Peto, from the Cancer Research UK Epidemiology Unit in Oxford\n \n \nProfessor Valerie Beral and colleagues found out of the 83,000 women, only 44,000 had predicated in reliable studies. \n \n They were asked before they were diagnosed with cancer to tell researchers whether or not they had an abortion or miscarriage. \n \n Results from these women showed that for those who had miscarried there was no increased risk of breast cancer compared to the general population. \n \n The risk was actually slightly lower among those who had an abortion. \n\n \n \nthe only notice from the U.S. National Cancer Institute is to question the methodology of the studies that have found links between abortion and breast cancer. Many of them rely on women self-reporting abortions, creating the possibility that those who later developed breast cancer will admit to having had an abortion and those who have not developed breast cancer will not. Others used samples too small to be considered statistically valid.\n \n \"The relationship between abortion and breast cancer has been the subject of extensive research,\" according to a fact sheet distributed by the National Cancer Institute. \"However, evidence of a direct relationship between breast cancer and either spontaneous or induced abortion is inconsistent. Some studies have indicated small elevations in risk, while others have not shown any risk associated with either induced or spontaneous abortions.\"\n\n \n As for the Daling study:\n \nDaling's study also found that teenagers under age 18 and women over age 30 who have an abortion more than double their breast cancer risk. Those with a family history of the disease increase their risk 80 percent. Daling's most dramatic finding was that teenagers with a family history of breast cancer who procure an abortion face a risk of breast cancer that is incalculably high. All 12 women in her study with this history were diagnosed with breast cancer by the age of 45.\n \n Because the study relied on self-reports of abortions and because the risk did not vary consistently with the number of abortions, the woman's age or the length of pregnancy, a commentary published in the same issue of the journal said the evidence of an abortion-breast cancer link remained \"weak and inconsistent.\"\n\n \n http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/818/context/cover/\n \"Many researchers are troubled, however, by the trend because the weight of current scientific evidence does not seem to support a link between breast cancer and abortion\"\n \n http://www.breastcancer.org/research_abortion.html\n \"In February 2003, an expert panel at the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) reviewed all available studies on links between pregnancy, abortion, and breast cancer. The experts concluded, based on the evidence from all the studies, that there is no link between natural or induced abortions and breast cancer risk\"\n \n http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo/wyntk/breast\n -this one has tons of information about breasts in general and breast cancer in particular. Below I've highlighted important info found under 'risks':\n \nMuch research has been done to learn whether having an abortion or a miscarriage affects a woman's chance of developing breast cancer later on. Large, well-designed studies have consistently shown no link between abortion or miscarriage and the development of breast cancer. \n\n \n http://www.reproductiverights.org/crt_cen_brstcancerqa.html\n \n http://www.flnow.org/Abortion%20myths.htm\n -I admit, these two are most likely biased, but they still have factual information.",

It is surprising to most Catholics and others to discover that the date was not much earlier.\n\n I have previously discussed this in Post #173, page 85:\n \n \"The information you cite does not refute the fact that the Church has always condemned abortion. It does show that there has been some theological debate as to when a person was \"ensouled.\" This stemmed partly from the fact that the process of pregnancy was not fully known. Augustine chose the point of \"quickening\" or first movement as the point of ensoulment because that very well might have been the first evidence of life in the womb at that time.

It has been an area that has been enlightened by science and technology but the child in the womb has always been worthy of protection in the Christian view--at the time when it was known that life was present then the being was deemed worthy of protection.\"\n \n I'm not sure what you mean by \"repudiated\" but the Catechism of the Catholic Church states that the person should be protected from the moment of conception. Although the opinion may have differed on what the sin/\"crime\" of abortion should be labeled (homicide) or on what the penalty for abortion should be, the admonishment to protect those in the womb was there throughout Church history. \n \n CCC 2270  Human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person - among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life. \n \n Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you. \n \n My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately wrought in the depths of the earth. \n \n CCC 2271  Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law: \n \n You shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish. 74\n \n God, the Lord of life, has entrusted to men the noble mission of safeguarding life, and men must carry it out in a manner worthy of themselves. Life must be protected with the utmost care from the moment of conception: abortion and infanticide are abominable crimes. 75\n \n 74 Didache 2,2, etc.\n 75 Gaudium et Spes\n \n CCC 2272  Formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense. The Church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life. \"A person who procures a completed abortion incurs excommunication latae sententiae,\" \"by the very commission of the offense,\" and subject to the conditions provided by Canon Law. The Church does not thereby intend to restrict the scope of mercy. Rather, she makes clear the gravity of the crime committed, the irreparable harm done to the innocent who is put to death, as well as to the parents and the whole of society.\n \n Paragraphs 2273-2275 also concern abortion.",

In modern non-theological terms, that would be the equivalent of marking the difference between a \"life\" and a \"person\". These earlier Catholics clearly saw that the development of the fetus started at conception, but they did not think that the fetus was developed enough for a soul to enter. Again, this is the equivalent to a modern non-theological scientific point of view that the brain has to be developed enough for a mind to exist there. If anything, I would say that modern science would have pushed their idea of \"ensoulment\" farther on in the pregnancy, not earlier. After all, what is a \"soul\" if not at least a sense of self, some sense of mind, etc.?\n \n Yes, they concidered abortion even before ensoulment a sin, but not murder. I simply find that it is quite interesting that, before 1869, the Catholic church thought that a fetus had to be developed enough to be able to have a soul and that, after 1869, this was no longer the case. It would be interesting to see a list of the arguements made in the 1869 decision - perhaps the misinterpration of 17th century scientific findings mentioned in the quote I posted in my last message was a major reason. \n \n \nI'm not sure what you mean by \"repudiated\" but the Catechism of the Catholic Church states that the person should be protected from the moment of conception. \n\n Yes, certainly, the Catholic Church NOW and, apparently, since 1869 has considered abortion at all stages to be murder - I do not question that.

Vatican II was the pinacle of this change.\n\n Yes, as you say, the Catholic Church did many things in its history that were questionable and immoral (inquisition, crusades, etc.), but most of these lay along the lines of the grasp for political power, wealth and influence. Power often corrupts and, unfortunately, the corruption spread to the Catholic church as well. However, it seems that, for basic theologic issues unrelated to the grasp for political power and wealth, such as issues ranging from abortion to whether or not Christ carried money, they tried to make a real effort at arguing their reasons. Their knowledge, of course, was limited to the knowledge of the day and their views were influenced by the biases of the day. \n \n With regard to the issue of ensoulment, then, certain questions arise, which would have arisen in 1869 (if they had the knowledge of today) or at any time:\n \n 1) How would you define a \"soul\"? More specifically, does it need to include in itself the sense of \"mind\"? As a reference, I had found a religious link (not related to abortion) defining the soul which does incorporate mind as one of the parts of a soul:\n http://www.tripartiteman.org/definition/soul.html\n \n 2) When does \"ensoulment\" occur within the pregnancy?\n \n 3) If you think ensoulment occurs at conception and that a soul must include some level of mind, then how do you explain the discrepancy between that view and the scientific facts that the brain is not developed enough before the third trimester to allow for a mind? What, in your view, is the role of the physical brain compared to that of the soul in forming what we view as our minds?\n \n 4) Does a fetus need to have a \"soul\" for its abortion to be called murder? If not, then what is it exactly that you are murdering? If you simply say \" a life\" then what do you mean by that, if it does not contain a soul?\n \n The few sources that I have read so far imply that the decision in 1869 to say that the soul entered at conception was based on faulty understanding of the scientific progression of a pregnancy, where they thought that each sperm cell already contained a minuature human being. I will try to take more time to find more sources about the 1869 decision since it seems to be quite an important one.",

The first Crusade took place well over 400 years after the Muslims first began attacking Christian lands. Few acknowledge that if the Crusades had not been fought that we might today live in a Muslim world. And the oppression of Islam is much worse than the liberty of Christianity.",

   "Maximus, you do raise an interesting historical point in view of the respective timelines of the Christian Crusades (1095-1270 A.D.--dependant upon what one labels a \"Crusade\") and the Moorish invasion of Spain (mid-700s A.D., thereafter).\n \n I also found an interesting article on the history of Spain:\n \n http://www.xmission.com/~dderhak/index/moors.htm\n \n When you think of European culture, one of the first things that may come to your mind is the renaissance. Many of the roots of European culture can be traced back to that glorious time of art, science, commerce and architecture. But did you know that long before the renaissance there was a place of humanistic beauty in Muslim Spain? Not only was it artistic, scientific and commercial, but it also exhibited incredible tolerance, imagination and poetry. Moors, as the Spaniards call the Muslims, populated Spain for nearly 700 years. As you'll see, it was their civilization that enlightened Europe and brought it out of the dark ages to usher in the renaissance. Many of their cultural and intellectual influences still live with us today. \n \n Way back during the eighth century, Europe was still knee-deep in the Medieval period. That's not the only thing they were knee-deep in. In his book, The Day The Universe Changed, the historian James Burke describes how the typical European townspeople lived: \n \n \"The inhabitants threw all their refuse into the drains in the center of the narrow streets. The stench must have been overwhelming, though it appears to have gone virtually unnoticed. Mixed with excrement and urine would be the soiled reeds and straw used to cover the dirt floors.\n \n This squalid society was organized under a feudal system and had little that would resemble a commercial economy. Along with other restrictions, the Catholic Church forbade the lending of money - which didn't help get things booming much. \"Anti-Semitism, previously rare, began to increase. Money lending, which was forbidden by the Church, was permitted under Jewish law.\" (Burke, 1985, p. 32) Jews worked to develop a currency although they were heavily persecuted for it. Medieval Europe was a miserable lot, which ran high in illiteracy, superstition, barbarism and filth.\n \n During this same time, Arabs entered Europe from the South. ABD AL-RAHMAN I, a survivor of a family of caliphs of the Arab empire, reached Spain in the mid-700's. He became the first Caliph of Al-Andalus, the Moorish part of Spain, which occupied most of the Iberian Peninsula. He also set up the UMAYYAD Dynasty that ruled Al-Andalus for over three-hundred years. (Grolier, History of Spain). Al Andalus means, \"the land of the vandals,\" from which comes the modern name Andalusia.\n \n At first, the land resembled the rest of Europe in all its squalor. But within two-hundred years the Moors had turned Al-Andalus into a bastion of culture, commerce and beauty. \"Irrigation systems imported from Syria and Arabia turned the dry plains... into an agricultural cornucopia. Olives and wheat had always grown there. The Arabs added pomegranates, oranges, lemons, aubergines, artichokes, cumin, coriander, bananas, almonds, pams, henna, woad, madder, saffron, sugar-cane, cotton, rice, figs, grapes, peaches, apricots and rice.\" (Burke, 1985, p. 37) \n \n By the beginning of the ninth century, Moorish Spain was the gem of Europe with its capital city, Cordova. With the establishment of Abdurrahman III - \"the great caliphate of Cordova\" - came the golden age of Al-Andalus. Cordova, in southern Spain, was the intellectual center of Europe. \n \n At a time when London was a tiny mud-hut village that \"could not boast of a single streetlamp\" (Digest, 1973, p. 622), in Cordova \"there were half a million inhabitants, living in 113,000 houses. There were 700 mosques and 300 public baths spread throughout the city and its twenty-one suburbs. The streets were paved and lit.\" (Burke, 1985, p. 38) The houses had marble balconies for summer and hot-air ducts under the mosaic floors for the winter. They were adorned with gardens with artificial fountains and orchards\". (Digest, 1973, p. 622) \"Paper, a material still unknown to the west, was everywhere. There were bookshops and more than seventy libraries.\" (Burke, 1985, p. 38). . . .",

   "It is only controversial among those who refuse to accept reality. The breast cancer/abortion link was addressed in this forum here .\n \n -Professor Valerie Beral, Director, Cancer Research UK Epidemiology Unit, University of Oxford \n \n -Professor Sir Richard Peto, from the Cancer Research UK Epidemiology Unit in Oxford\n \n As for the Daling study:\n \n http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/818/context/cover/\n \"Many researchers are troubled, however, by the trend because the weight of current scientific evidence does not seem to support a link between breast cancer and abortion\"\n \n http://www.breastcancer.org/research_abortion.html\n \"In February 2003, an expert panel at the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) reviewed all available studies on links between pregnancy, abortion, and breast cancer. The experts concluded, based on the evidence from all the studies, that there is no link between natural or induced abortions and breast cancer risk\"\n \n http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo/wyntk/breast\n -this one has tons of information about breasts in general and breast cancer in particular. Below I've highlighted important info found under 'risks':\n \n http://www.reproductiverights.org/crt_cen_brstcancerqa.html\n \n http://www.flnow.org/Abortion%20myths.htm\n -I admit, these two are most likely biased, but they still have factual information.\n\n Sigma,\n As for the last two websites you cite, I'm sure that Jessica will not allow them into the debate due to their bias. (As she would disallow my following quotes and most of any other points I might make--is everything biased?)\n \n But concerning your other points...I only had a superficial dose of research in school and I am also not terribly familiar with the literature concerning the abortion/breast cancer link or lack thereof. Due to this, I forwarded your assertions to one more knowledgeable in this area. She responded thus:\n \n \nFive medical groups and a bioethics center recognize a cause-effect\n relationship between abortion and breast cancer. A seventh medical \n group, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, called on doctors to warn women of a \"highly plausible relationship\" between abortion and the disease.\n \n Additionally, Dr. David Stevens who heads the Christian Medical and \n Dental Association told a reporter in November that one abortion doubles a\n woman's risk for the disease and subsequent abortions further increase \n her risk.\n \n You can find his quote and quotes from \"pro-choice\" medical experts on \n our Quotes from the Experts page.\n \n Women have a right to know this.\n \n There are recognized and contested breast cancer risks of abortion.\n \n The recognized risks include reproductive risk factors for breast \n cancer, i.e. childlessness, delayed first full term pregnancy, small family \n size, and little or no breastfeeding. Valerie Beral and her colleagues (whom \n you quote and who denied that abortion raises breast cancer risk) conducted \n a review of 47 studies in 30 countries in 2002. Their results were \n widely reported in the press. They said that breast cancer rates could be\n reduced by more than 50% if women change their childbearing patterns by\n having more children and breastfeeding them longer.\n \n Scientists agree that the best way to prevent breast cancer is by \n having more children, starting at earlier ages, and breastfeeding them longer\n than we are now.\n \n Did you ever wonder why the cancer fundraising industry has never\n condemned Planned Parenthood for depriving women of the best known \n means of preventing breast cancer? How does a woman have more babies and abort her pregnancies? How does she breastfeed a dead fetus?\n \n Based on this, it's intellectually dishonest for cancer fundraising\n businesses to claim that abortion isn't responsible for surging breast\n cancer rates in the developed nations.\n \n This is especially true when scientists have known since the 17th \n Century that childbearing is protective against the disease.\n \n There is a sound biological reason for this. Only one process matures \n a woman's breast tissue into cancer-resistant tissue, and that's a third\n trimester process in pregnancy called \"differentiation.\" And cancer\n businesses have never told women this.\n \n This isn't theoretical. There's biological evidence for it, and you \n can visit our \"Dear Doctor Letter\" (home page, left column) to see breast\n tissue slides that confirm it.\n \n Scientists Irma and Jose Russo have published images of breast tissue\n slides in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute Monograph. \n They've studied the relationship between breast tissue maturation and the\n development of cancer for the last 24 years. [Russo J, Yun-Fu Hu Xiaoqi\n Yang, Russo I. Chapter 1. Developmental Cellular and Molecular Basis \n of Human Breast Cancer. J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr 2000; 27:17-37]\n \n Girls are born with primitive, immature, cancer-vulnerable Type 1 \n breast lobules. Type 1 lobules are TDLU's - terminal ductal lobular units -\n where cancers are known to arise. [Russo J, Rivera R, Russo IH. \n Influence of Age and Parity on the Development of the Human Breast. Breast Cancer Research and Treatment 1992;23:211-218]\n \n At puberty, some breast tissue matures into cancer-vulnerable Type 2 \n lobules.\n \n The contested breast cancer risk has to do with whether an abortion \n leaves women with more cancer vulnerable tissue than they had before their\n pregnancies began.\n \n One of the first signs of pregnancy that women often notice is that the\n breast tissue has grown. Estrogen, a recognized carcinogen, causes \n breast tissue growth by stimulating Types 1 and 2 lobules to multiply during \n the first two trimesters of pregnancy.\n \n Estrogen is so potent that it is measured in parts per trillion. Women\n are overexposed to more estrogen during a normal pregnancy (not a 1st\n trimester miscarriage) than at any other time in their lives. Estrogen\n increases 2000% by the end of the first trimester.\n \n At 32 weeks gestation, a new process kicks in - \"differentiation.\" \n Differentiation protects the woman against estrogen overexposure. It\n shuts off cell multiplication and matures the breast tissue into\n cancer-resistant, milk-producing Types 3 and 4 breast lobules.\n \n The woman who has a full term pregnancy is left with more \n cancer-resistant tissue than she had before she became pregnant. That's why women with more children, starting at an early age (before age 24) have a lower lifetime risk for the disease.\n \n On the other hand, the woman who has an abortion is left with more\n cancer-vulnerable Types 1 and 2 breast lobules than she had before she\n became pregnant. She has an increased number of TDLU's - more places \n for cancer to start.\n \n Angela Lanfranchi, MD, FACS, associate professor of surgery at the \n Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center, authored an article in a bioethics \n journal, Ethics and Medics in 2004 (published on our home page). She criticized the authors of a widely-publicized \"collaborative review\" of the\n abortion-breast cancer research published in the British journal Lancet \n in March 2004 - Valerie Beral and her colleagues. She identified the\n following flaws in their research: selection bias, statistical\n \"manipulations,\" assumption of a flaw called \"recall bias,\" and use of \n an improper comparison group.\n \n Lanfranchi accused the authors of using unscientific reasons to \n eliminate from their review 15 published, peer-reviewed studies reporting an \n average 80% risk increase. The Lancet's authors added 28 never- published, \n never peer-reviewed studies to their review representing a majority of the\n research in the article. Because the data from these studies are\n unpublished, scientists can never double check their work.\n \n Lanfranchi's article was followed by an editorial by Ed Furton, MA, \n Ph.D. in the December 2004 issue of Ethics and Medics. Furton leveled \n serious charges of impropriety against the Lancet and the scientific community in general. He likened our opponents to modern day \"inquisitors who know how to use tools that are as effective at silencing dissent as those wielded against Galileo.\"\n \n Furton said, \"The Beral study is therefore cause for alarm. When a\n leading scientific journal allows its pages to be used as a political\n platform, and sets aside objective standards of scientific research, we\n must begin to wonder whether the spirit of (Jacques) Derrida has \n infected even scientific discourse....Picking conclusions ahead of time, and\n arranging the evidence to support them, will only serve to undermine \n the respect that scientific inquiry deserves....The unwillingness of \n scientists to speak out against the shoddy research that is being advanced by those who deny the abortion-breast cancer link is a very serious breach...When the public learns that a causal link between abortion and breast cancer has been downplayed by the scientific community - for reasons that are\n ideological rather than factual - the feeling of betrayal will be \n strong.\"\n \n The abortion-breast cancer link is the scientific community's elephant \n in the closet. Privately, top experts have confided to our experts that \n they know abortion is a cause of breast cancer, but they refuse to say so\n publicly because it's \"too political.\" What they mean is they lack\n political courage. They fear for their jobs, reputations, good names,\n etc.\n \n If the tobacco industry could corrupt science and scientists 40-50 \n years ago, then what would prevent the abortion industry from doing so today?\n \n According to Dr. David Kessler, former head of the Food and Drug\n Administration, the tobacco industry corrupted science, scientists,\n leading cancer research centers in the U.S. (Harvard, UCLA, Sloan\n Kettering, etc.) and the American Medical Association. (See his book, A\n Question of Intent.)\n \n The Tobacco Industry Research Committee hired the head of the American\n Cancer Society, Clarence \"Pete\" Little (formerly in the leadership of \n the U.S. National Cancer Institute). Little was highly regarded by other\n scientists and medical experts. When he spoke, people believed \n whatever he said. The TIRC purchased his cache and put it to use. He became the TIRC's spokesman. He's the guy that used to say \"There's no proof,\" of a tobacco-cancer link - a very high bar to establish.\n \n If the government and the cancer establishment (which the government \n funds with its $5 billion/year budget) really wanted you to know about the\n abortion-breast cancer research, then why didn't they tell you in 1957\n about the first study whose authors found a 160% risk elevation among\n Japanese women who have abortions? [Segi et al. GANN 48 (Suppl.):1-63]\n \n Government scientists wrote to the British journal Lancet in 1986 and\n admitted that abortion causes breast cancer. Scientists from the \n Centers for Disease Control (Phyllis Wingo) and the National Institutes for \n Health (Bruce Stadel) and two other prominent epidemiologists wrote, \"Induced abortion before first term pregnancy increases the risk of breast cancer.\" [Feb. 22, 1986, p. 436]\n \n Did the government and cancer fundraising businesses tell you about it? \n Why believe them now?\n \n A cause-effect relationship was acknowledged in two editions of a \n medical textbook used by breast disease specialists. [Robert B. Dickson, Ph.D., Marc E. Lippman, MD, \"Growth Regulation of Normal and Maglignant Breast Epithelium,\" The Breast: Comprehensive Management of Benign and \n Malignant Diseases, edited by Kirby I. Bland MD and Edward M. Copeland III, MD; (1998) W.B. Saunders Company; 2nd edition; Vol 1, p.519]\n \n Did they tell the public about the first U.S. study in 1981 whose \n authors reported a 140% risk elevation? [Pike et al. (1981) Br J Cancer \n 43:72-6]\n \n Did they tell the public about a 1980 study on rats finding that more \n rats given abortions (77.7%) develop cancer after being exposed to a \n carcinogen than do virgin rats (66.7%) and rats with full term pregnancies (0%)? [Russo J, Russo IH. Susceptibility of the mammary gland to \n carcinogenesis. Am J Pathol 1980;100: 497-512]\n \n Why did government scientists study the abortion-breast cancer link\n extensively (and secretly) during the same decades that abortion was \n the most commonly performed elective surgical procedure in the country and \n as many as 1.5 million abortions were being performed every year?\n \n After word of this research started leaking out in the mid-1990's, a\n (seriously flawed) Danish study was published in 1997, and government\n scientists at the U.S. National Cancer Institute said THIS study was \n the final word on the subject. Abortion DEFINITELY doesn't increase breast\n cancer rates. If that's true, then what's the purpose of funding \n massive studies examining an abortion-breast cancer link in subsequent years? Shouldn't these facts be red flags?\n \n Sincerely,\n Coalition on Abortion/Breast Cancer\n www.AbortionBreastCancer.com\n response@abortionbreastcancer.com\n\n Being only minimally familiar with this topic, I believe I know enough to yet maintain my original point that the issue is controversial.

As for your quote on the Church forbidding lending of money(usury) and the implication that this hindered progress, I believe that the Muslims forbade that as well. They, instead, exacted a tribute from the people. Furthermore, we can see today that money lending and capitalism have done little to decrease the squalor of much of the world, although it may have done much to increase the standard of living for some and advance technology and trade. \n \n As to the enduring influence of Islam on our current culture and the richness of technology, academia, and lifestyle of the Muslims of the past, this cannot be denied. But was some of this do to taking hold of the torch of preservation of Greek and Roman works of antiquity which had previously been tended by the Christians? And we can also see looking at history that the Muslim world eventually declined and was supplanted in its material advancement, learning, political abilities, and military ability/technology.\n \n My original points stand: \n \n 1.The Crusades were a reaction to Muslim aggression. One may condemn the the abuse and recklessness of the Crusaders (teh sacking of Constantinople for example) but can one condemn their self-defense and attempt to preserve Christianity? And when the Crusades are so often condemned then where is the condemnation of the Muslims for their original aggression?  \n \n 2.We might be living in a Muslim world if it weren't for the Crusades.\n \n 3.The oppression of Islam is worse than the liberty of Christianity.  Would you disagree? (Especially in light of your thread in the religion forum concerning women's status in religion, etc.)",

At the time the Koran was created it was the most progressive--especially towards women--religious document in the world. It mentioned women as heirs of their father's estates--even though they were allowed only one-quarter of what a son would have inherited.\n \n Women in Christian culture were never accepted as heirs nor were they mentioned as possible heirs, estates were passed onto sons or to the closest male relative.\n \n Within Muslim society any gift of jewelry or other valuables to a wife remained her property to offer her economic security should the marriage dissolve.\n \n Muslim men had a moral obligation to support their wives--for as long as the marriage lasted--and their children.

   "Odd that Christianity also started out being violent and suppressiong others. Just because I am a Christian doesn't mean that I should ignore reality. \n \n Silly overgeneralizations like yours do nothing for comprehension and exploration of realisty.\n\n You do not go back far enough in Christianity if you say that Christianity started out being violent, that is if you use the meaning of inflicting violence or suppressing others. In one sense you are right but not in the sense you intended, because the Church suffered violence at its inception. \n \n Christianity started in violence because it sprang from the crucifixion of Jesus.\n Christianity had a founder who gave himself up to violence. He allowed himself to be crucifed. The founder of Christianity was peaceful but not a pacifist. (11 of the 12 apostles were also martyrs for the faith and the blood of many other martyrs was spilled in the early times)\n \n Islam, on the other hand, had a founder who conquered to convert. The starting points are not the same--they are much different. There is no overgeneralization or lack of reality there. \n \n To say that all of Christ's followers have upheld his teaching is another matter. But it may also be said that violence is sometimes necessary.",

   "The problem with Islam is that it has not progressed very much beyond the point it achieved at its inception. At the time the Koran was created it was the most progressive--especially towards women--religious document in the world. It mentioned women as heirs of their father's estates--even though they were allowed only one-quarter of what a son would have inherited.\n \n Women in Christian culture were never accepted as heirs nor were they mentioned as possible heirs, estates were passed onto sons or to the closest male relative.\n \n Within Muslim society any gift of jewelry or other valuables to a wife remained her property to offer her economic security should the marriage dissolve.\n \n Muslim men had a moral obligation to support their wives--for as long as the marriage lasted--and their children. No such provisions were made for women in Christian society. Within Christian society men had the absolute right to repudiate their wives and children.\n\n Simone,\n It seems like you drop off one of my points with each post. Now we are left with the third one and I beg to differ on this one as well.\n \n Was the Koran the most progressive religious document in the world considering women? Have you read the Gospels and considered Jesus' treatment of women?\n \n But to answer your point on men providing for their families: \n \n 2 Timothy 5:8 \"If any one does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his own family, he has disowned the faith  and is worse than an unbeliever.\"\n \n Ephesians 5  is also relevant. It instructs men on how to love their wives. I know this has been quoted on the religion thread. Do you understand how men are instructed to love their wives in Ephesians 5?\n \n More importantly, if one looks at religion, the inheritance of material things is not the main concern (although justice in this matter is a legitimate concern). Women are heirs to the same salvation as men in Christianity--everlasting life. Did you know that a woman is described as the most perfect disciple of Jesus  in Catholic teaching--Mary? Do you realize that the Catholic Church conveys sainthood on women just like men? Do you know that there are women who are classified as Doctors of the Church due to their esteemed teaching and piety?",

   "abortion is bad whether it be in the first trimester or the last\nHmm, because you say so? I don't see anything bad about it, so to me your claim is merely hyperbole. Can you tell us why it is bad? Certainly, the reason you provided has serious flaws:\n \n \n it is still a human being.\nNot really, as it is not even an individual until birth and certainly is not even sentient at the time of the abortion.\n \n \nthe baby...\nWhat baby? \"Baby\" is a developmental stage that begins after birth. As such, it is irrelevant to the issue of abortions.\n \n... does have one right no matter what and that right is the right to live.\nReally? Because you say so?

It would mean that you could be forced to give blood if it could save a life. It means that you could be forced to give your extra kidney to a person whose kidneys are failing (Which happens to 50,000 Americans who die every year because they can't find a kidney donor).\n \n Or are you saying that those who bleed to death or die from kidney failiure, they don't have a similar \"right to life\"?\n \n I am very interested in your answer here.",

   "1. She sought out a male role model for her son recognizing that a male influence is important. That is, a father figure is beneficial. But what is a father figure but a model of the father who should have been there.\n\n \n The father who conceived the child, wasn't there I suppose, for whatever reason. So Jito brought a male figure into her son's life. \n \n \nI didn't say that homosexual men thought maleness didn't matter (or that womanhood doesn't matter to be thorough). I said that the example they give is that maleness doesn't matter perhaps without even recognizing it. If a male can be with a male then what is the distinguishing factor?\n\n \n They are still males. You don't know that they are not valuing their maleness.\n \n \nI would not treat them badly or ridicule them. I would attempt to show them the truth of Christianity as it regards homosexuality.\n\n \n You won't call them names perhaps, but you won't accept them for being who they are. That's your opinion, and you are entitled to share it if they desire to listen to you.\n \n \nCould this person be a female and do the same things?\n\n \n However, this person wasn't a female, this person is a male. Please acknowledge the fact that this person is a whole male. You cannot say he is not a male, simply because he is gay.\n \n \nIf yes, then why did was a male sought and is there a need for a male? If no, what are the differences between males and females that drove her to seek a male mentor?\n\n \n She sought a male mentor, and she got one. \n \n \nMany traits are listed in the mentor that are normally associated with male parenthood--and it seems that the mentor was sought to specifically fulfill these roles. But the source of these traits is then abrogated by a lifestyle that contradicts the concept that maleness matters. And yes, an ability to have a relationship with a woman in a loving, sexual way is key.\n\n \n That is ridiculous. You are also saying a man who is celebate, has no maleness. Gay men can love women. There are many ways to show love and maleness without having sex. \n \n \nCan he be a good role model, yes. But only in a limited sense. He is not everything a father should be. He can never be. Because he withholds himself.\n He withholds the gift of life that is within him. This is an essential trait of being a father figure--that one's love not only be free, total, and faithful, but that it attempts to be fruitful and life-giving--for that is the model of God the Father that all fathers are seeking to emulate. Being a man  does have a lot to do with \"who you ....\" More importantly, being a proper male role model  and a proper father figure  has a lot to do with it.\n\n \n When you say \"life-giving\" you are only talking about breeding, nothing more. Being a man and being a father is not about being like breeding stock. It's not about whom you go to bed with. \n \n \nIn addition, perhaps more important than \"who you ....\" is whom you make love to. That may be the essential difference. I'm not certain that a homosexual man can do anything but \"....ing.\" But a married heterosexual male can make love to his wife and vice-versa because this love-making fulfills the four attributes described above as emulating the attributes of God's love.\n\n \n The only distinguishing factor you have high-lighted is the ability to breed, and with whom one goes to bed with. \n \n \nJito has found many of the traits of a good father in her friend. Yet he can never fully meet the definition of or fully perform the role of either male mentor or father. For a male mentor must emphasize masculinity--in the true sense of the word. He can never truly show her son how to be a father because he can never give life, never love fully and totally giving his entire self.\n\n \n Again, in \"giving life\", you are only talking about breeding. You are not talking about looking after and nurturing life, which is a much more important component of a good, successful life. Of course the mentor can love fully. Please tell me specifically how he cannot love fully? Or is that just the breeding and with whom you use your thing, thing again?\n \n \nJito has often truthfully said that her husband did not know how to be a father (or a husband). But I'm not sure the current male mentor does either. For he is not teaching her son what a family truly should be in its fullest sense and therefore her son may run into some of the same problems in the future with family that Jito did.\n\n \n How dare you. Who do you think you are making that kind of judgment?\n \n \n2. She further calls this male role model a co-parent that shares her duties in raising her child thus affirming that two people raising a child is a better situation than a single-parent household. It's too hard for one parent-the difficulty level itself is evidence of the inherent need of a two parent family.\n\n \n There are many reasons why things are difficult for single-parent families. Many times it's economic. There are also many places children of single parents can get role models. Aunts, uncles, etc. Single parents can sometimes also go to other family members for help. It would help if society gave sinlge parents better supports as well. \n \n \n3.Traditional male activities and roles are listed for her male mentor affirming another assertion of mine that women and men have distinct roles. Women and men are different yet equal-equal in dignity. Are we all the same? Equal in dignity does not mean indistinct in physical, parental, spiritual, nurturing, working traits. (although there are exceptions-but they are exceptions not the rule)\n\n \n This doesn't mean the mentor, is not a good mentor. This person may be able to perform those roles. \n \n \nNow to qualifications of what I have summarized above:\n \n I am not saying my family is better than Jito's or even that a traditional family is better than others in the sense of more holy, affluent, fun, productive, etc. I am not comparing specific families one to another. But the traditional family is the most stable and healthy situation if things are done with the best interest of all involved.\n\n \n If you are not saying the traditional family is better, then why are you saying it is the most stable and healthy situation? If things are done with the best interest of all involved? Oh, so there IS a variable. This means that a traditional family is not always better.",
