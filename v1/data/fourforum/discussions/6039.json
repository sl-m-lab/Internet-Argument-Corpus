Ice Age has an amazing script and dialogues and LOTR is a beautiful story full of suspence, friendish, love, trust, ambition...and overall, a meaningful plot that embraces life! emoticon_xlove",

A Bridge too Far, Connery, Fox, Hackman, Hopkins, Laurence Oliver, O'Neal...do you need more? Plus the movie is historical.\n 5.

   "I can't really give one here. I could maybe give one to each genra.\n \n Science Fiction: (Continual Story Line) Star Trek First Contact (or Star Trek IV The Voyage Home) And Sci-Fi drama would have to be Armageddon or ID4. I liked both because of the score. ID4 I liked because the entire world was united in one common interest. (Yes, I know, that kind of idea is totally fiction and could never really happen emoticon_rolleyes but still.) Armageddon had some cool actors (the only movie where I can really stand Ben Afflec).\n \n Action/Adventure: I would have to put the Indiana Jones Trilogy in here (and maybe the Jurassic Park Trilogy) Once again, I like the score in both of these. I love movies about Dinosaurs. But then, how can you not enjoy a story about an archiologist who can survive being chased down by a bolder only to wind up freaking out about a python (or some kind of snake) on his lap in a plane with in a matter of 5 minutes. Now if you want Super Hero movies, I would go with X2 X-Men United.\n \n Drama: Toss-up...Forrest Gump or Footloose. Once again, I like the music. (I will just say now that music is one reason for me to like movies so I don't keep using that.) I liked the plot in both. Forrest Gump is the life story of a man. Footloose is about a guy who has to go up against ustablised laws and prejudices based upon a forgon conclusion that music and dancing leades to sex, alchoal, and death.\n \n Animated Feature: Shrek 2. Why? Read \"Drama.\" Shrek 2 actually has a song in it from Footloose.\n \n Musical: Fiddler On The Roof (and maybe Man Of La Mancha.) First of all, read \"Drama.\" FOTR is one of those stories where you can change around the setting and the charicters backgrounds (like religion) and you still have the same story. It's universal (even though it was brought out by MGM :p .\" Man Of La Mancha is just a fun (and psychological) story to me.\n \n Comedy: Pretty much any movie done by Mel Brooks or any movie starring Leslie Nelson (Except for Forbiddion Planet, that's not a comedy, it's a B-rate Sci-fi drama from the 50's or 60's. Nothing wrong with that, it's just not a comedy.) Or maybe UHF, because it's a \"Weird Al\" movie.\n \n Family Movie: Daddy Day Care. (Read \"Drama\") Not to mention Cheap Trick sings \"Surrender\" Live. A man and his friend who get put out of a job decides to start a day care since their wives have to work. Then another guy comes in who is too high on Star Trek (Like I use to be.) You can guess from there if you haven't seen it.\n Is That a fare enough list? :)",
