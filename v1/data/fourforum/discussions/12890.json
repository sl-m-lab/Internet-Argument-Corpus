   "Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- one of the remaining bastions of sanity in Congress -- is circulating a petition for single payer health care. The petition reads as follows below, and can be signed at that link at his website. \n \n The website also features a video of Senator Sanders with a plea to sign the petition. If you wish, you can also submit your own health care story there, with some to be read by Senator Sanders on the Senate floor.\n \n ---------------------------------\n \n A PETITION TO CONGRESS\n \n Supporting Single-Payer Health Care\n \n &#8232;Whereas:\n \n &#8226; 46 million Americans are currently without health insurance;\n &#8226; 60 million Americans, both insured and uninsured, have inadequate access to primary care due to a shortage of physicians and other health service providers in their community;\n &#8226; 100 million Americans have no insurance to cover dental needs;\n &#8226; 116 million adults, nearly two-thirds of all non-seniors, struggled to pay medical bills, went without needed care because of cost, were uninsured for a time, or were underinsured in the last year;\n &#8226; The United States spends $2.3 trillion each year on health care, 16 percent of its Gross Domestic Product;\n &#8226; Americans spend $7,129 per person on health care, 50 percent more than other industrialized countries, including those with universal care;\n &#8226; The U.S. does not get what it pays for. We rank among the lowest in the health outcome rankings of developed countries, and on several major indices rank below some third-world nations;\n &#8226; The number of health insurance industry bureaucrats has grown at 25 times the growth of physicians in the past 30 years;\n &#8226; In 2006, the six largest insurance companies made $11 billion in profits even after paying for direct health care costs, administrative costs and marketing costs.\n \n And, whereas:\n \n &#8226; Medicare has administrative costs far lower than any private health insurance plan;\n &#8226; The potential savings on health insurance paperwork, more than $350 billion per year, is enough to provide comprehensive coverage to every uninsured American;\n &#8226; Only a single-payer Medicare-for-all plan can realize these enormous savings and provide comprehensive and affordable health care to every citizen.\n \n Now, therefore:\n \n &#8226; We, the undersigned, urge the United States Congress to pass a single-payer Medicare-for-all program which will provide quality, comprehensive health care for all Americans.\n \n U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders\n \n -----------------------\n \n The petition is also being hosted about the web on a number of websites and blogs, if you google around. For those who aren't familiar, Bernie Sanders introduced the Senate version of H.R. 676 (John Conyers' bill), with a few variations (e.g. requires citizenship and legal residency), but otherwise, mostly the same.",

   "Amy Goodman has published another one of her excellent articles, also reporting the Baucus campaign contributions reported by his native Montana newspaper, and as discussed earlier on these threads. \n \n Along with information concerning the campaign contributions received by other members of Congress who are currently involved in \"reforming\" our health care system. While you pay for THEIR socialized medicine, and they tell you the subject of YOURS is d.e.a.d.\n \n So even if you think it's hopeless, because most of our Congressional representatives are nothing more than paid you-know-whats, all the more reason to make your voice heard and sign Bernie's petition to Congress. And pass it along.\n \n The next forty-odd days are going to be critical in the health debate, so if you fancy yourself an agent of change, who cares about the lives of your fellow Americans and future generations, now is the time to speak up, folks.\n \n Excerpts from Goodman article:\n \n --------------------\n \n \n Mike Dennison, a reporter for The Montana Standard, found that Baucus has received more campaign money from health and insurance industry interests than any other member of Congress. Dennison told me, We're talking about the health insurance industry and ... HMOs, hospitals, physicians, pharmaceutical companies - that's probably where the bulk of his money has come from ... out of about almost $15 million he's raised in the last six years, both for his campaign and his leadership PAC, 23 percent of that came from insurance and health interests ... which we believe is probably more than any other member has received.\"\n \n (snip)\n \n \n Recent Congressional financial disclosures show that many key members have major investments in the health care industry. The Washington Post reported this week that almost 30 members of Congress who hold key committee memberships that will impact the health care debate also have significant investments in health care companies. The bipartisan group of investors includes Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.; Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H.; the family of Rep. Jane Harman, D-Calif.; Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga.; Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.; Sen. Michael Crapo, R-Idaho - in all, amounting to between $11 million and $27 million (the number is imprecise, since the disclosure forms allow some ambiguity).\n \n According to the Associated Press, Jackie Clegg Dodd, wife of Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., serves on the boards of four health-related companies and earned more than $200,000 last year. Sen. Dodd is sitting in as chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, in place of Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.\n \n Congress will soon break for its summer recess,\" with members going back to their home districts to raise money, of course, and, perhaps, to visit their hometown health care provider - paid for by their publicly funded congressional health care plan.\n \n (snip)\n \n (full article at link)\n \n t r u t h o u t | Congre$$, Heal Thyself\n \n -------------------------",

Single payer is supported ACROSS left and right, ACROSS parties:\n \n ------------------\n \n In fact, people with Medicare currently have the choice of public health insurance or private plans that contract with Medicare. About eighty percent of the 44.8 million older and disabled Americans who have Medicare coverage-about 35.4 million people-choose the government-run public plan over the private Medicare plans.\n \n It is the choice 73 percent of voters want, including Democrats (77 percent), Independents (79 percent), and Republicans (63 percent). They want this choice because:\n \n 61 percent think a public health insurance plan will be better able to control health care costs by using its purchasing power to drive competition. Only 25 percent believe a public health insurance plan will shift higher costs onto the privately insured.\n 61 percent agree that millions of people are already losing their coverage every year, and a choice of private or public health insurance plans will make sure that Americans always have quality, affordable care. Only 27 percent believe the claim that a public health insurance plan will cause millions of people to be dumped from their private coverage.\n \n 66 percent agree that a public health insurance plan will provide a choice with a standard, comprehensive package of benefits and a wide choice of doctors. Only 26 percent believe a public health insurance plan will force people into lower quality care including rationing and long waits.\n \n It's time we all had the choice of public health insurance!\n \n Who Prefers a Public Health Insurance Option? | OurFuture.org\n \n --------------\n \n And notice who loves their socialized medicine, as long as it's them and their families gobbling it up FOR LIFE at the taxpayers' expense -- RIGHT WING REPUBLICANS!!\n \n -------------\n \n For all the false alarm ringing over \"socialized medicine\" when a choice of public health insurance is discussed, little is said about the tens of millions of people in the United States who are currently-happily-getting their health care through a public health plan of one kind or another, and the tens of millions more who want to have that choice available to them.\n \n That fact was highlighted this week by stories about how veterans are reacting to the Obama administration's proposal to require veterans who have private health insurance, have their insurance cover their treatment for combat- and service-related injuries.\n \n This headline speaks volumes: \"Veterans blast Obama plan to cover injuries via private insurance.\" [see additional link below, Arizona Daily Star article] Veterans want the public health coverage to which they are entitled! In fact, they want the socialized medicine to which they are accustomed.\n \n Health services provided by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) are truly socialized medicine, because the doctors and other health care providers who serve veterans work for the government and the government owns and runs the hospitals and other health care facilities where veterans get treatment. The VHA treats over 5 million veterans a year. (PDF)\n \n It may surprise you to know that in the U.S. members of Congress and Presidents have a long history of also enjoying the socialized medicine taxpayers provide for them. In fact, members of Congress have the choice many of them want to deny you. They can choose a private health insurance plan through the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program or they can get top-notch medical care at government facilities, like the Bethesda Naval Medical Center in Maryland.\n \n Many regularly choose the public option. For example:\n \n When John McCain (R-AZ) found a discolored blotch on his left temple he headed to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda to have the spot checked out.\n \n Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) had his heart bypass surgery at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda.\n Former Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) went to Bethesda Naval Medical Center in Maryland complaining of fatigue and subsequently got a new heart valve there.\n \n U.S. Presidents also have a long history of using the socialized medicine provided to them by taxpayers, including George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan.\n \n [see link above]\n \n -------------------\n \n How much do the American People pay out in taxes just for the lifetime health coverage of EVERY single representative (and their families!) who passes through Congress?\n \n Add to that the cushy retirement plans the American taxpayer supports for these temporary employees bought by the insurance ghouls as they sell us out down the river!\n \n As 101,000 Americans have died unnecessarily in the United States every year for the past five years due to INSURANCE DENIALS OR LACK OF INSURANCE!!!\n \n This is not a \"left\" or \"right\" issue! This is an American issue!\n \n Listen to Rep.
