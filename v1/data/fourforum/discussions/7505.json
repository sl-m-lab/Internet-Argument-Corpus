   "From the Wall Street Journal:\n \n How Muslim Clerics Stirred Arab World Against Denmark\n Newspaper Cartoons Unite Religious, Secular Forces; Dossier Fans the Flames\n By ANDREW HIGGINS \n Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n February 7, 2006; Page A1\n COPENHAGEN - When Flemming Rose, the cultural editor at Denmark's leading newspaper, published cartoons of the prophet Muhammad late last September, he got an angry telephone call from a local Muslim news vendor who said he had removed the paper from his shelves in protest.\n \n The complaint didn't cause much alarm. \"We get calls every day from people complaining about something,\" recalls Mr. Rose. Anger over the cartoons, he figured, would flare out in \"two or three days.\"\n \n Today, the 47-year-old editor has a security-service escort when he appears in public. He has received death threats and gets insulted by strangers on the street. His newspaper, Jyllands-Posten, evacuated its offices twice last week after anonymous bomb threats.\n \n Across the Muslim world, Denmark, a nation of just 5.4 million, has been hit by a tsunami of rage. Protesters rally daily from Iraq to Indonesia. Mobs over the weekend stormed its diplomatic missions in Syria and Lebanon. Demonstrators yesterday attacked its embassy in Iran, and security forces in Afghanistan opened fire on demonstrators, killing at least four. A boycott of Danish products has hammered some of Denmark's biggest companies.\n \n \"The reaction is totally surrealistic,\" says Mr. Rose, whose wife has started reading the Quran to try to understand what has happened. Mr. Rose himself has consulted with experts on Islam and now says he regrets that he \"didn't know more beforehand\" about Islamic taboos on depictions of the prophet.\n \n The cartoon uproar has fed on wider racial and economic tension in Europe between Muslim immigrants and native citizens. Also at play is America's policy of promoting democracy, which has helped unleash a struggle within the Arab world between largely secular regimes and increasingly powerful Islamist groups.\n \n In this volatile environment, a group of Danish Islamic clerics angered by the cartoons succeeded in enlisting help from Egypt's secular government, which has been struggling to contain a potent Islamist opposition. Secular forces in the Arab world, eager to burnish their image as defenders of Islam, provided an important initial impetus for the protests, but now are scrambling to control the fury.\n \n From his office at the Islamic Faith Society in Copenhagen, Ahmed Abu-Laban, a fundamentalist Palestinian cleric, has been at the forefront of a campaign to force an apology from the paper. \"This was the last drop in a cup of resentment, disappointment and exploitation,\" he says.\n \n Jyllands-Posten, a center-right newspaper, first waded into these treacherous waters last fall. Mr. Rose, alarmed by what he considered a rise in self-censorship relating to Islamic issues, invited Danish cartoonists to \"draw Muhammad the way that they see him.\" Twelve submitted drawings.\n \n One mocked a far-right Danish leader, putting her in a police line-up with a turban, and another ridiculed Mr. Rose and his newspaper, labeling it a \"reactionary provocateur.\" Others, though, poked fun at Islam. One depicted Muhammad in a turban shaped like a bomb. Another showed a turbaned figure in heaven telling ascending suicide bombers to stop because \"we've run out of virgins,\" a reference to a reward said to await Islamic martyrs.\n \n The cartoons were published Sept. 30, which Mr. Rose and his colleagues were unaware coincided with the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Soon after the angry newspaper vendor called, a second-generation immigrant phoned the paper to make threats against the cartoonists. The caller, who was quickly found by police, turned out to be mentally ill.\n \n After a few days, Mr. Rose thought the worst was over. Then clerics in Copenhagen and elsewhere used their sermons to denounce the paper. Ambassadors from Egypt, Saudi Arabia and nine other Islamic countries requested a meeting with Denmark's center-right prime minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen. Mr. Rasmussen declined, saying the state had no right to interfere with the country's free press. Angry local Muslim leaders organized protest rallies, demanding an apology. The paper refused.\n \n In Aarhus, Denmark's second-largest city, a radical cleric gave an interview denouncing Mr. Rose and reminding him of \"what happened\" to Theo Van Gogh, a Dutch filmmaker murdered in 2004 by a Dutchman of Moroccan descent. Mr. Rose got a security briefing from police and had his telephone number and address de-listed.\n \n (More)",

   "Under pressure from young radicals for results, Mr. Abu-Laban, the Copenhagen cleric at the forefront of the campaign, and several others formed the \"European Committee for Honoring the Prophet,\" an umbrella group that now claims to represent 27 organizations across a wide spectrum of the Islamic community. (Moderate Muslims dispute this and say the group has been hijacked by radicals.)\n \n Frustrated by the Danish government's response, the committee decided after a series of meetings in October and November that \"our only option was take our case outside Denmark,\" Mr. Abu-Laban says. There was growing interest from Muslim ambassadors in Copenhagen and their home governments, including Egypt.\n \n Mr. Abu-Laban, who grew up in Egypt and was arrested there in the early 1980s after being expelled from the United Arab Emirates for his preaching, took charge of writing statements for the group and communicating with Muslim ambassadors. He denies holding extremist views, but acknowledges hosting visits to Denmark by Omar Abdel Rahman, before his arrest in New York, where the blind sheik now is serving a life sentence in connection with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.\n \n Mr. Abu-Laban began working closely with Cairo's embassy in Copenhagen, holding several meetings with Egypt's ambassador to Denmark, Mona Omar Attia. \"Egypt's embassy played a fundamental role,\" he says. Egypt and other Arab regimes saw the furor as a good opportunity \"to counteract pressure from the West\" and \"to show people they are good Muslims,\" he says.\n \n Ms. Attia, the ambassador, says she wasn't motivated by political concerns but by personal outrage. \"I was very angry. I was very upset,\" she says, describing the cartoons as an unacceptable insult to all Muslims. She acknowledges meeting with the Danish clerics several times but denies coordinating strategy with them.\n \n Keen to \"globalize\" the crisis to pressure the Danish government, Mr. Abu-Laban and his colleagues decided to send delegations to the Middle East. They prepared a dossier to distribute during the travels. The document, which exceeded 30 pages, featured copies of the published cartoons and Arabic media reports about the controversy. It also contained a group of highly offensive pictures that had never been published by the newspaper, including a photograph of a man dressed as a pig, with the caption: \"this is the real picture of Muhammad.\"\n \n Ahmed Akarri, a 28-year-old Islamist activist involved in the committee, says the photographs had been sent to Danish Muslims anonymously and were included as examples of Denmark's anti-Muslim sentiment. He denies any attempt to mislead the Arab public about what had been published in Jyllands-Posten. Mr. Rose, the editor, describes it as a clear attempt at \"disinformation.\"\n \n The first delegation left for Cairo in early December. As that nation was about to hold the final round of the first democratic election in modern Egyptian history, the government was battling accusations from some quarters of insufficient piety. Ms. Attia, the ambassador, denies that authorities tried to manipulate the cartoon issue as an electoral ploy.\n \n One member of the Danish delegation, Ahmed Harby, an Egyptian who runs a cleaning business in Copenhagen, says the trip wasn't designed to stir hatred against Denmark. It was intended, he says, to appease hotheads in Copenhagen and elsewhere who might take violent action if Jyllands-Posten wasn't forced to apologize. He says he didn't realize the dossier contained pictures the newspaper had never published.\n \n The delegation met with a special assistant to the foreign minister, with the head of al-Azhar, the Muslim world's oldest university, and with the Egyptian head of the Arab League, Amr Moussa. During a meeting with Cairo's senior Muslim cleric, Mr. Harby says, a fatwa, or religious opinion, was drafted calling for a boycott of Danish goods. The order was never formally released, he says.\n \n Later in December, a second delegation traveled to Lebanon to meet with religious leaders and appeared on television. Mr. Akarri, the Copenhagen activist, later traveled alone to Syria to deliver the dossier to Syria's senior Sunni cleric.\n \n (More)",

   "Back in Denmark, the pressure on Mr. Rose mounted. He was warned that a security-service informant had reported that some Muslim radicals were spreading word that killing him was halal, meaning sanctioned by Islam. \"It was the only time I felt cold running down my spine,\" he says.\n \n Denmark's government began to reach out to Muslim ambassadors and others it had earlier rebuffed. In a New Year's speech, the prime minister retreated slightly from previously strong support for Jyllands-Posten. Egypt promptly claimed credit for the modest shift and suggested in a foreign ministry statement it was ready to drop the matter.\n \n Protests elsewhere were intensifying, fanned by both Islamists and secular forces eager to prove their Islamic credentials. In Jordan, a pro-Western monarchy, Parliament condemned the cartoons as \"racist and evil.\" Tunisia and Libya, where police regularly arrest Islamist activists and block protests, also denounced them.\n \n Late last month, influential clerics in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere called for a boycott of Danish goods. Arab consumers began to shun Danish products en masse.\n \n \"Our business in the whole Middle East is at a total standstill,\" says Finn Hansen, head of international operations for Arla Foods, a big Danish dairy company. The chairman of Dansk Industri, a trade organization for Danish businesses, issued an open letter calling on the newspaper to explain its position, and appeared in a television debate with Mr. Rose.\n \n Last week, Jyllands-Posten apologized for causing offense, and Mr. Rose appeared on al-Jazeera and other Arab television stations in an effort to persuade viewers that the newspaper never intended to insult Islam. Its intent, he said, was to join a domestic Danish debate about free speech.\n \n Protests escalated. Returning late one night to his Copenhagen apartment, Mr. Rose slumped in a leather sofa with his wife to watch the news. It showed protesters waving signs that read \"Behead Those Who Insult Islam.\" \"This whole thing is crazy, totally crazy,\" he groans. \"I had no idea anything like this would happen.\"",

   "From the Wall Street Journal:\n \n Bonfire of the Pieties\n By AMIR TAHERI\n February 8, 2006; Page A16\n \"The Muslim Fury,\" one newspaper headline screamed. \"The rage of Islam sweeps Europe,\" said another. \"The clash of civilizations is coming,\" warned one commentator. All this refers to the row provoked by the publication of cartoons of the prophet Muhammad in a Danish newspaper four months ago. Since then a number of demonstrations have been held, mostly -- though not exclusively -- in the West, and Scandinavian embassies and consulates have been besieged.\n \n But how representative of Islam are all those demonstrators? The \"rage machine\" was set in motion when the Muslim Brotherhood -- a political, not a religious, organization -- called on sympathizers in the Middle East and Europe to take the field. A fatwa was issued by Yussuf al-Qaradawi, a Brotherhood sheikh with his own program on al-Jazeera. Not to be left behind, the Brotherhood's rivals, Hizb al-Tahrir al-Islami (Islamic Liberation Party) and the Movement of the Exiles (Ghuraba), joined the fray. Believing that there might be something in it for themselves, the Syrian Baathist leaders abandoned their party's 60-year-old secular pretensions and organized attacks on the Danish and Norwegian embassies in Damascus and Beirut.\n \n The Muslim Brotherhood's position, put by one of its younger militants, Tariq Ramadan -- who is, strangely enough, also an adviser to the British home secretary -- can be summed up as follows: It is against Islamic principles to represent by imagery not only Muhammad but all the prophets of Islam; and the Muslim world is not used to laughing at religion. Both claims, however, are false.\n \n There is no Quranic injunction against images, whether of Muhammad or anyone else. When it spread into the Levant, Islam came into contact with a version of Christianity that was militantly iconoclastic. As a result some Muslim theologians, at a time when Islam still had an organic theology, issued \"fatwas\" against any depiction of the Godhead. That position was further buttressed by the fact that Islam acknowledges the Jewish Ten Commandments -- which include a ban on depicting God -- as part of its heritage. The issue has never been decided one way or another, and the claim that a ban on images is \"an absolute principle of Islam\" is purely political. Islam has only one absolute principle: the Oneness of God. Trying to invent other absolutes is, from the point of view of Islamic theology, nothing but sherk, i.e., the bestowal on the Many of the attributes of the One.\n \n The claim that the ban on depicting Muhammad and other prophets is an absolute principle of Islam is also refuted by history. Many portraits of Muhammad have been drawn by Muslim artists, often commissioned by Muslim rulers. There is no space here to provide an exhaustive list, but these are some of the most famous:\n \n A miniature by Sultan Muhammad-Nur Bokharai, showing Muhammad riding Buraq, a horse with the face of a beautiful woman, on his way to Jerusalem for his M'eraj or nocturnal journey to Heavens (16th century); a painting showing Archangel Gabriel guiding Muhammad into Medina, the prophet's capital after he fled from Mecca (16th c.); a portrait of Muhammad, his face covered with a mask, on a pulpit in Medina (16th c.); an Isfahan miniature depicting the prophet with his favorite kitten, Hurairah (17th c.); Kamaleddin Behzad's miniature showing Muhammad contemplating a rose produced by a drop of sweat that fell from his face (19th c.); a painting, \"Massacre of the Family of the Prophet,\" showing Muhammad watching as his grandson Hussain is put to death by the Umayyads in Karbala (19th c.); a painting showing Muhammad and seven of his first followers (18th c.); and Kamal ul-Mulk's portrait of Muhammad showing the prophet holding the Quran in one hand while with the index finger of the other hand he points to the Oneness of God (19th c.).\n \n (More)",

   "Some of these can be seen in museums within the Muslim world, including the Topkapi in Istanbul, and in Bokhara, Samarkand and Haroun-Walat (a suburb of Isfahan). Visitors to other museums, including some in Europe, would find miniatures and book illuminations depicting Muhammad, at times wearing his Meccan burqa (cover) or his Medinan niqab (mask). There have been few statues of Muhammad, although several Iranian and Arab contemporary sculptors have produced busts of the prophet. One statue of Muhammad can be seen at the building of the U.S. Supreme Court, where the prophet is honored as one of the great \"lawgivers\" of mankind.\n \n There has been other imagery: the Janissaries -- the elite of the Ottoman army -- carried a medallion stamped with the prophet's head (sabz qaba). Their Persian Qizilbash rivals had their own icon, depicting the head of Ali, the prophet's son-in-law and the first Imam of Shiism. As for images of other prophets, they run into millions. Perhaps the most popular is Joseph, who is presented by the Quran as the most beautiful human being created by God.\n \n Now to the second claim, that the Muslim world is not used to laughing at religion. That is true if we restrict the Muslim world to the Brotherhood and its siblings in the Salafist movement, Hamas, Islamic Jihad and al Qaeda. But these are all political organizations masquerading as religious ones. They are not the sole representatives of Islam just as the Nazi party was not the sole representative of German culture. Their attempt at portraying Islam as a sullen culture that lacks a sense of humor is part of the same discourse that claims \"suicide-martyrdom\" as the highest goal for all true believers.\n \n The truth is that Islam has always had a sense of humor and has never called for chopping heads as the answer to satirists. Muhammad himself pardoned a famous Meccan poet who had lampooned him for more than a decade. Both Arabic and Persian literature, the two great literatures of Islam, are full of examples of \"laughing at religion,\" at times to the point of irreverence. Again, offering an exhaustive list is not possible. But those familiar with Islam's literature know of Ubaid Zakani's \"Mush va Gorbeh\" (Mouse and Cat), a match for Rabelais when it comes to mocking religion. Sa'adi's eloquent soliloquy on behalf of Satan mocks the \"dry pious ones.\" And Attar portrays a hypocritical sheikh who, having fallen into the Tigris, is choked by his enormous beard. Islamic satire reaches its heights in Rumi, where a shepherd conspires with God to pull a stunt on Moses; all three end up having a good laugh.\n \n Islamic ethics is based on \"limits and proportions,\" which means that the answer to an offensive cartoon is a cartoon, not the burning of embassies or the kidnapping of people designated as the enemy. Islam rejects guilt by association. Just as Muslims should not blame all Westerners for the poor taste of a cartoonist who wanted to be offensive, those horrified by the spectacle of rent-a-mob sackings of embassies in the name of Islam should not blame all Muslims for what is an outburst of fascist energy.\n Mr. Taheri is the author of \"L'Irak: Le Dessous Des Cartes\" (Editions Complexe, 2002).",

   "Muslims are in the wrong place in EU\n \n I think that's disgusting! They're going to forbid French language teaching in Azerbaijan schools and colleges. Also they threaten by suspending of diplomatic relations with France and to embargo import of French goods. And that's just because France at last had formally recognized that Armenians suffered genocide at the hands of Ottoman Turks during the First World War. Turkey and its henchman Azerbaijan up to now deny it. That fact that a million and a quarter Armenians were massacred after 1915 as they were forced out of Turkey towards Syria is nothing for them. Of course those are no Muslim lives but dirt for them.\n Such attitude grates on me deeply. For I'm of Armenian ancestry and many of my family had suffered from this calamity. And living here in France I see every day outrage made by those Muslims immigrants. Sometimes it is frightful to go in the street in Marceilles.\n And how could EU Council let such barbarian islam country aim for EU membership? They've never been really civilized and never admit non-Muslims equal to \"true believers\". No Turks are pretending to be leaders in islam world and using their authority and blackmailing sometimes they make other Muslim countries support their interests. And their thankless lickspittles Azerbaijanis are still worse! They dare yapping to EU country representing nothing in fact. How would they feel if ECHO and IOM etc. would stop helping them? Maybe we should embargo THEIR goods as answer?",
