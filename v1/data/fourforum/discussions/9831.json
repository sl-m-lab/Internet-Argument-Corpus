   "My point is simple - No man is created equal. Simple. Literally and figuratively true. And yet we have people who take Jefferson's words as holy writ and try and MAKE PEOPLE EQUAL! The mind set im taking issue with is the one you find exemplified in the society in Ayn Rand's novel \"We the Living.\" (I think thats the one; whichever one was the dysutopian novel) The idea that a society has to make everyone equal. I think Jefferson's point in the American Declaration of Independence was that all men, SHOULD, in THIS country be held as equals in a legal sense. He was not actually trying to claim that they were all equal in a fuzzy, nondefined socialist sense. \n \n \nReading Nietschze doesn't make you wise, and one-line quotes from him don't carry any real weight.\n\n \n Reading Nietzsche does not necessarily make you wise. Reading a biology text book does not necessarily educate you. As with everything else in life, your passion, intelligence, patience, and humility (<--I know you randists hate that one) figure prominetly into how wise or how knowledgable you become as a result of reading any book. However, some one liners from Nietzsche do, in my estimation, carry A LOT of weight. This is one of them.\n Also, need I remind you randians, that there are different forms of writing than the romantic novel (snicker!) - Nietzsche often wrote (outside of \"Thus spake..\") in the form of short paragraphs. I learned that these are called \"Apothgems\" or something. Its kinda unfair to dismiss my use of \"one-liners\" (implying in my mind that they are out of context) when he very frequently used the form of one liners and short paragraphs to express himself.\n \n BTW, Ripskar totally didn't get the reference! What do you expect from somebody who likes Waaaah shouted in his ear?",
