   "I've heard the phrases 'religious belief' and 'religious values' bandied about. What are religious beliefs, and how do they differ from beliefs in general? Same with religious values. What are they?\n\n I'll take a stab at this. Beliefs refer to claims concerning reality; values claim not what is, but what is right or wrong, what is valuable and what lacks value. Religious means derived from a tradition of approach to the sacred, so religious beliefs are claims about reality derived from a tradition of approach to the sacred, and religious values are claims about right and wrong derived from a tradition of approach to the sacred.",

   "Kind of a large subject- everything from Taoism through to Islammic Jihad covered there. \n Personally I decided to cut through the bumf and went back to source.\n Earlyest stuff related to religeon as such goes back 20,000 years but stays pretty much stable to about 2950BC. The evidence is rock art (cave paintings) which leads us to Shamannic beliefs which are usually based on Oral Traditions. These are fairly consistant across the planet even today.\n \n From these it is possible to track the development of the world's pantheistic beliefs showing the evolution and adaptation. The change is triggered by the writen word which tends to bring the authors to the fore as well as being more detailed.\n Monotheism Relies upon a Prophet to kick off the religeon whose word usually is not allowed to be questioned by the people. Typical Tyrrany...\n Of course everyone believes different stuff which leads to the inevitable 'debates'.",
