   "The Crucifixion is the focal point of the Christian faith. It is the central event of Jesus' earthly mission, and according to the doctrine of substitutionary atonement, the means by which we are saved from hell and given admission into heaven. But only through a conditioned attitude of unquestioning faith can the whole thing fail to be seen as profoundly absurd. \n \n Assuming God created us, it's clear we were created imperfect. That's something God should have known. But rather than conclude that God's ultimately responsible for our imperfection and the consequences thereof, Christians all to eagerly proclaim - as doctrine demands - that we are all utterly depraved, somehow. \n \n We're trained to accept that God damns us to hell for this imperfection (and rarely realize that the punishment in no way fits the \"crime\"). And we're told that the only way the Almighty could rectify the problem was to send himself down in human form, as a sacrifice to appease his own wrath. Wrath, we must remember, over the imperfection he himself created in us. \n \n If the Crucifixion were merely God's way of punishing himself for doing such a lousy job making us, the whole thing would make better sense than it does. \n \n The concept of substitutionary atonement, as Thomas Paine pointed out, is based on pecuniary justice, the defect of which is best illustrated by an analogy. Suppose, as Paine suggested, a man owed a sum of money, and another man came and paid the debt out of his own pocket. That would be an act of generosity that could properly settle the first man's debt. But contrast that with the case of a vile, despicable felon. Could justice be served if an innocent man offered to serve his sentence, or accepted execution in his place? Clearly not, for an innocent man would be punished, while a detriment was left scot-free to continue wreaking evil. Thus the principle behind Christ dying for us sinners is proven, based on logic, to be deeply flawed. \n \n Another problem with the Crucifixion is that, all things considered, it wasn't such a big deal after all. According to one gospel, Jesus was on the cross for three hours, a mercifully short period compared to the days most crucified men suffered before dying of dehydration and exhaustion. What's more, if Jesus really was God, he went to the cross knowing he wouldn't really die. Sure, his mortal shell would expire, but his eternal spirit would continue, better off than before, since our frail physical shells are the principal conduit for suffering in this world. Only if someone were to go to his execution not knowing the outcome would it begin to approach a genuine sacrifice. Or conversely, if his purpose were to suffer, then he should have gone on living. Dying early is taking the easy way out. \n \n The prize and the price both need to be placed in the balance here. Weigh three hours of suffering versus the everlasting bliss of heaven, and we should all be willing to be crucified. Yet three hours was supposedly sufficient to atone for everyone of Earth? Compare the magnitude of the sins committed by everyone who ever lived, and the amount of punishment this might call for, and its clear that the only way three hours can cover it all is by a flat declaration to that effect. As if flat doctrinal declarations become reality upon utterance. \n \n Yet Jesus paid it all, as the hymn goes. His death somehow cancels out all our sins for us. I've already shown that this is an erroneous notion of justice, and it must now be seen that it cannot possibly be the case. Because despite the atoning work of Jesus, many of us are going to hell anyway, or so say the Christians. And why will people go to hell, despite Christ's much-vaunted sacrifice? Not for anything they've actually done wrong - -Pauline doctrine has us all hell-bound totally without reference to our actual sins. It's our intrinsic state, prior to and irrespective of our offenses. No, we are to be sent to hell simply for not believing in Jesus! We can be living paragons, but still condemned, just for not believing this story on demand, without proof. \n \n Now why God would make this the crucial test of all existence defies explanation. I have yet to see even the feeblest attempt to explain it. But as far as I'm concerned, if Christ's death on the cross was to atone for the sins of the world, then we should all be saved whether we believe it or not. (Why should it matter if we don't? Or more importantly, why is it so vital that we do?) And if some go to hell anyway, then the sacrifice was not sufficient, and Christ's mission was a failure. \n \n How can we reasonably be expected to believe this tale, anyway, when the only accounts of it are so discrepant? The four gospels differ in so many details that were they taken as objectively as any other account, they would not be accepted as credible testimony in any court of law. When you consider their divergences, as well as the inherent absurdity of it all, we cannot be blamed for rejecting it as nonsense, based on the intelligence and reason God gave us. It merely reflects poorly on those who believe it just the same. Perhaps believing in the face of abundant contradiction is part of the devious little test that God sees fit to put us to, but such a notion only makes him seem more clod than God, and not at all worthy of our devotion",

   "No. There is ample biblical basis for it. However, it is interesting how the devil and his clansmen are identified. . .\n \n Many Christians believe that the Devil, also known as Satan or Lucifer, to be a fallen angel who attempted to overthrow God and was expelled from heaven, along with the rest of the fallen angels. They credit them with being able to tempt mankind towards sin, have the power possess the minds and bodies of humans, and inflict physical and mental illness. He rules over Hell and uses the other demonic angels to assist him in corrupting humanity. He's also oversees the eternal torment of sinners who have been condemned by God to Hell. \n \n Unfortunately for hard-line evangelical Christians this entire fabrication is exclusive to the New Testament and cannot be based on any factual evidence in any of the Old Testament scriptures. \n \n They've adapted their Devil from that of the Jews who were acquainted with the demonology of the surrounding nations such as Babylon and who adopted the notions regarding the power of these demons. The existence of these demons, who had the power of possessing and influencing human beings, was recognized among the Jews. Some of the demons were combined to create the Christian Devil.\n \n There is no mention of a demonic nature about Baal-Zebub, just Ahaziah's sin of consulting with a Philistine god rather than with his own Jewish god. \"No other Gods before Me\", and all that. \n \n 2) Asmodeus, the prince of revengeful demons.

   "Assuming God created us, it's clear we were created imperfect. That's something God should have known. But rather than conclude that God's ultimately responsible for our imperfection and the consequences thereof, Christians all to eagerly proclaim - as doctrine demands - that we are all utterly depraved, somehow. \n\n God created man with a free will and therefore the possibility to choose to be imperfect. there is a difference\n \n \nWe're trained to accept that God damns us to hell for this imperfection (and rarely realize that the punishment in no way fits the \"crime\"). And we're told that the only way the Almighty could rectify the problem was to send himself down in human form, as a sacrifice to appease his own wrath. Wrath, we must remember, over the imperfection he himself created in us. \n\n see above\n \nIf the Crucifixion were merely God's way of punishing himself for doing such a lousy job making us, the whole thing would make better sense than it does. \n \n The concept of substitutionary atonement, as Thomas Paine pointed out, is based on pecuniary justice, the defect of which is best illustrated by an analogy. Suppose, as Paine suggested, a man owed a sum of money, and another man came and paid the debt out of his own pocket. That would be an act of generosity that could properly settle the first man's debt. But contrast that with the case of a vile, despicable felon. Could justice be served if an innocent man offered to serve his sentence, or accepted execution in his place? Clearly not, for an innocent man would be punished, while a detriment was left scot-free to continue wreaking evil. Thus the principle behind Christ dying for us sinners is proven, based on logic, to be deeply flawed. \n\n nothing is wrong with either analogy. there are many times a parent will take the responsibility for an offense the child did and bear the consequence to spare the child. in fact, there have been times when a parent had plaeded guilty to a crime that his child commited for the same reason. there is nothing that far-fetched about cases like these, even though that spared child still has the option of being ungrateful for the sacrifice the parent made\n \nAnother problem with the Crucifixion is that, all things considered, it wasn't such a big deal after all. According to one gospel, Jesus was on the cross for three hours, a mercifully short period compared to the days most crucified men suffered before dying of dehydration and exhaustion. What's more, if Jesus really was God, he went to the cross knowing he wouldn't really die. Sure, his mortal shell would expire, but his eternal spirit would continue, better off than before, since our frail physical shells are the principal conduit for suffering in this world. Only if someone were to go to his execution not knowing the outcome would it begin to approach a genuine sacrifice. Or conversely, if his purpose were to suffer, then he should have gone on living. Dying early is taking the easy way out. \n\n its funny you should say that, considering that Im sure you would rather live than die by crucifixion, wouldnt you? besides, the crucifixion took place on the eve of an important jewish holiday, so the crucified persons (the 2 thieves included) would not have been left for longer than sunset. in fact, the theives that didnt die fast enough had their legs broken to speed up the process\n \nThe prize and the price both need to be placed in the balance here. Weigh three hours of suffering versus the everlasting bliss of heaven, and we should all be willing to be crucified. Yet three hours was supposedly sufficient to atone for everyone of Earth? Compare the magnitude of the sins committed by everyone who ever lived, and the amount of punishment this might call for, and its clear that the only way three hours can cover it all is by a flat declaration to that effect. As if flat doctrinal declarations become reality upon utterance. \n\n didnt you just say that the punishment for sin (hell for eternity) didnt suit the the crime? now you are saying the price was not enough for the crime. which is it: first the crime (sin) is too petty, now it is too grave? the suffering on the cross itself was not the price for the attonement of the sin anyway, because there is no such thing as the worst way to die, neither did Jesus set out to die in the worse way (although at the time crucifixion was up there with the relatively worst). the point is that he died. dying itself is the penalty of sin. that is the penalty Jesus innocently paid\n \nYet Jesus paid it all, as the hymn goes. His death somehow cancels out all our sins for us. I've already shown that this is an erroneous notion of justice, and it must now be seen that it cannot possibly be the case. Because despite the atoning work of Jesus, many of us are going to hell anyway, or so say the Christians. And why will people go to hell, despite Christ's much-vaunted sacrifice? Not for anything they've actually done wrong - -Pauline doctrine has us all hell-bound totally without reference to our actual sins. It's our intrinsic state, prior to and irrespective of our offenses. No, we are to be sent to hell simply for not believing in Jesus! We can be living paragons, but still condemned, just for not believing this story on demand, without proof. \n\n see, it wouldnt even matter if 1 single person accepted salvation in the timespan of these last 2000+ years after Jesus' visit on earth, the option would be made open, and the mission of His death would have been justified. it may seem like a waste of time, but to God perhaps now that the option for salvation is available, it was a fruitful mission nonetheless. besides, if the concept is so simple, then why wouldnt people get themselves saved?\n \nNow why God would make this the crucial test of all existence defies explanation. I have yet to see even the feeblest attempt to explain it. But as far as I'm concerned, if Christ's death on the cross was to atone for the sins of the world, then we should all be saved whether we believe it or not. (Why should it matter if we don't? Or more importantly, why is it so vital that we do?) And if some go to hell anyway, then the sacrifice was not sufficient, and Christ's mission was a failure. \n\n like I said before, the mission was not to get all men saved (although that was certainly the hopeful outcome). the mission was to make the option of salvation available to those that seek it. as far as I see, mission accomplished\n \nHow can we reasonably be expected to believe this tale, anyway, when the only accounts of it are so discrepant? The four gospels differ in so many details that were they taken as objectively as any other account, they would not be accepted as credible testimony in any court of law. When you consider their divergences, as well as the inherent absurdity of it all, we cannot be blamed for rejecting it as nonsense, based on the intelligence and reason God gave us. It merely reflects poorly on those who believe it just the same. Perhaps believing in the face of abundant contradiction is part of the devious little test that God sees fit to put us to, but such a notion only makes him seem more clod than God, and not at all worthy of our devotion\n\n the problem is not the Gospels. it seems like the problem is your perspective. why is it that some people are awed by the apparent seamless agreement of the gospels while others are stumped by the endless perceived discrepancies? it comes down to how you look at it. objectively, the gospels cannot be right or wrong without the readers' perspected projected onto it. otherwise its just some books with words, and onlyy when the gospels are read and undergo the subjective view of the reader will it make sense or not. if you dont get it then you dont get it. if you do then you do. even the very Bible itself says that the gospel wont be accepted by everyone, even if it is intended for all minkind",

I am not presenting religious bias on these issues because I dont have to, and because religious bias is irrelevant\n 1. I believe people ARE born gay as we were born NOT gay. 2.

   "Jehovah's Witness leaders for over 100 years have claimed to be God's only living \"prophet\" on the face of the earth. However, if one looks at their record, the documented evidence proves they are what Jesus described as \"false prophets!\" Most Jehovah's Witneses have no clue about the true history of their organization. Remember what Jesus said: \"And many false prophets will arise, and will mislead many.\" (Mat 24:11) \n ________________________________________\n Check out the documented evidence listed by year. I didn't print the entire calendar. . . .much too lengthly. This will give a basis for my statement. This info is found in one of the official publications of the church...WatchTower.\n ________________________________________\n 1877 'The End Of This World; that is the end of the gospel and the beginning of the millennial age is nearer than most men suppose; indeed we have already entered the transition period, which is to be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation Dan. 12:3.\" (N.H. Barbour and C.T. Russell, Three Worlds, and the Harvest of This World, p. 17). \n \n 1879 \"Christ came in the character of a Bridegroom in 1874.... at the beginning of the Gospel harvest.\" (Watchtower, Oct 1879, p. 4) \n \n 1880 \"We need not here repeat the evidences that the \"seventh trump\" began its sounding A.D., 1840, and will continue until the end of the time of trouble, and the end of \"The times of the Gentiles,\" A.D., 1914, and that it is the trouble of this \"Great day,\" which is here symbolically called the voice of the Archangel when he begins the deliverance of fleshly Israel. \"At that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince (Archangel) which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation.\" Dan. xii. 1. Nor will we here, again present the conclusive Bible proof that our Lord came for his Bride in 1874, and has an unseen work as Reaper of the first-fruits of this Gospel Age. (Zion's Watchtower November, 1880 p. 1) \n \n 1886 \"The outlook at the opening of the New Year has some very encouraging features. The outward evidences are that the marshaling of the hosts for the battle of the great day of God Almighty, is in progress while the skirmishing is commencing. ... The time is come for Messiah to take the dominion of earth and to overthrow the oppressors and corrupters of the earth, (Rev. 19:15 and 11:17, 18) preparatory to the establishment of everlasting peace upon the only firm foundation of righteousness and truth.\" (Zion's Watchtower, January, 1886;Watchtower reprints I, p. 817) \n \n 1888 \"In this chapter we present the Bible evidence proving that the full end of the times of the gentiles, i.e., the full end of their lease of dominion, will be reached in A.D. 1914; and that the date will be the farthest limit of the rule of imperfect men. And be it observed, that if this is shown to be a fact firmly established by the Scriptures, it will prove; Firstly, that at that date the Kingdom of God, for which our Lord taught us to pray, saying, Thy Kingdom come, will obtain full, universal control, and that it will then be set up, or firmly established, in the earth, on the ruins of present institutions.\" (The Time Is At Hand, 1888, p. 76, 77) \n \n 1889 \"Be not surprised, then, when in subsequent chapters we present proofs that the setting up of the Kingdom of God is already begun, that it is pointed out in prophecy as due to begin the exercise of power in A.D. 1878, and that the 'battle of the great day of God Almighty (Rev. 16:14) which will end in A.D. 1914 with the complete overthrow of earth's present rulership, is already commenced.

They centre around the\n interpretations of the leadership and submissive and\n unquestioning acceptance of these is essential to be a member\n of good standing. This acceptance includes what we consider\n non-essential doctrines e.i. not salvation issues (such as\n the Person and Work of Christ.) The key is that they will be\n using mind control or undue influence on their members. \n \n An excellent book on this subject is \"Churches that Abuse\" by\n Dr Ronald Enroth. \n \n Using these guidelines of definition, Bible-based,\n Psychological, Educational and Commercial aberrations can\n easily be identified.",

Infact we don't even encourage the person to come back. If you look at ours statistics more people leave than other religions. In fact we actively disfellowship (kick out) people. Sure maybe this is some weird reverse psychology to gain new membership (you can't handle the truth :p), but our organization is like some religious sieve. I remember a talk given by Brother Herd a member of the governing body he said something to the effect we would be a lot bigger if we didn't disfellowship so many people, we would be even larger if we told them to stop going out in field service.\n \n The practice of actively trying to include non-Jehovah's witnesses while blacklisting those that leave (by them sending in a letter of disassociation or being disfellowshiped) makes us unique. People that just hang around the oraginzation like bystanders, but not a part of it are not dealt with (like my sister for example).\n \n EF brainwashing and kidnapping is rare in any cult it is also it is illegal. Those are things you see on TV. What you may be trying to say is cults are organizations that demand sole allegiance. Like the Nazi's, the former communist block, or old school Catholicism.

   "DrD,\n \nThe concept of substitutionary atonement, as Thomas Paine pointed out, is based on pecuniary justice, the defect of which is best illustrated by an analogy. Suppose, as Paine suggested, a man owed a sum of money, and another man came and paid the debt out of his own pocket. That would be an act of generosity that could properly settle the first man's debt. But contrast that with the case of a vile, despicable felon. Could justice be served if an innocent man offered to serve his sentence, or accepted execution in his place? Clearly not, for an innocent man would be punished, while a detriment was left scot-free to continue wreaking evil. Thus the principle behind Christ dying for us sinners is proven, based on logic, to be deeply flawed. \n \n Do you think justice could be served if the detriment, seeing the willful gift of the other man, changed his life and began doing good rather than evil? (Your scenario assumes that the detriment will be unaffected by the actions of the other).\n \n Must \"justice\" be served in this event if the donation of the first man was a willful gift anyway?\n \n \nAnother problem with the Crucifixion is that, all things considered, it wasn't such a big deal after all. According to one gospel, Jesus was on the cross for three hours, a mercifully short period compared to the days most crucified men suffered before dying of dehydration and exhaustion. What's more, if Jesus really was God, he went to the cross knowing he wouldn't really die. Sure, his mortal shell would expire, but his eternal spirit would continue, better off than before, since our frail physical shells are the principal conduit for suffering in this world. Only if someone were to go to his execution not knowing the outcome would it begin to approach a genuine sacrifice. Or conversely, if his purpose were to suffer, then he should have gone on living. Dying early is taking the easy way out. \n \n The Crucifixion may have not been \"a big deal after all.\" The Resurrection was.\n \n By the way, Catholics do not believe in the utter depravity of man. They believe that he is existentially fallen, not essentially depraved. Perhaps a theological tight rope walk but an important distinction nonetheless.\n \n \nAnother problem with the Crucifixion is that, all things considered, it wasn't such a big deal after all.

Dying early is taking the easy way out. \n \n The prize and the price both need to be placed in the balance here. Weigh three hours of suffering versus the everlasting bliss of heaven, and we should all be willing to be crucified. Yet three hours was supposedly sufficient to atone for everyone of Earth? Compare the magnitude of the sins committed by everyone who ever lived, and the amount of punishment this might call for, and its clear that the only way three hours can cover it all is by a flat declaration to that effect. As if flat doctrinal declarations become reality upon utterance. \n \n Being a seminary student, I know you are familiar with the traditional Christian doctrine that though Jesus was fully God, he was also fully man. Therefore, he suffered as a man. He felt as we would have felt. Add to the crucifixion the scourging, the crowning of thorns, the carrying of the cross. More poignantly add to that the abandonment he felt when everyone but a few followers fled. Add the spitting, the curses, the screams, the insults, etc. from his own people. I would not want to feel that. Can we measure the suffering? I'm not sure.",
