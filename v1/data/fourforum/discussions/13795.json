Such a system already exists in Scotland for dealing with unworked crofts, and communities have common grazings that are shared by the crofters in that community. \n \n Which has nothing to do with your left wing being mass murderers more than any rightie ever though about.\n \n As for congress's healthcare plan (the result of their petty squabbling can hardly be called Obama's now), public opinion is hard to measure. Particularly on single issues people tend to believe the last thing they're told, and given the commentariat has been railing about death panels and fining people for not having health insurance for months now, it's not a surprise that opinion polls aren't favourable. No democracy I know of governs by opinion poll. The US elected a President and congress who were offering healthcare reform. What do you want, a line item referendum?\n\n \n Obama is the fearless leader with a democratic house and senate and its not his? Surely you jest. Only two times before in our history have these events occured. Under FDR and LBJ and we got disasters both times. Under FDR untold millions spent and after 8 years 20% unemployment. Under LBJ we got the war on poverty and spent trillions there. We could have snuffed poverty easier by giving huge checks directly to the people. Yet we still have poverty. Public opinion is rather easy to measure unless like a far left wing nutjob you are trying to ignore it. The democrats do as evidenced by clintoon. ",

That's what the Bible actually says.\n \n Let's look at the Scriptures and see what you're trying to sweep under the rug in order to try to justify your illicit gay sex sin:\n \n Leviticus 18:22 - 'You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.'\n \n Leviticus 20:13 - \"If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.\"\n \n Romans 1:26-27 - \"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - \"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n \n 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - \"But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine...\"\n \n Jude 7 - \"In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.\" \n \n There's no gay marriages in the Old Testament; No gay marriages in the New Testament; no gay sex approved anywhere in the Bible. Just the opposite - gay sex is condemned in both testaments. God is consistent on that.\n \n And to close:\n \n \"Whosoever shall be guilty of Rape, Polygamy, or Sodomy with man or woman shall be punished, if a man, by castration, if a woman, by cutting thro' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least.\" - Thomas Jefferson\n \n Amendment VIII: Thomas Jefferson, A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments",

You just barked out what you heard at a San Francisco gay pride parade. \n \n YOU'RE BUSTED AGAIN!\n \n (Still)\n\n \n What a pathetic sideways move!\n \n You got left crying in the corner in a fetal position calling for mama and as soon as you think it is safe you get all butch.\n \n This wasn't even a good try. \n \n What did the Pharisee's have a problem with? Was it the food being eaten or the unwashed hands of the Disciples? Answer their hands.\n \n How does Jesus rebuke them? By saying they honor tradition before God's law. \n \n Dietary LAWS not tradition. What tradition was being refered to? The one that Jews held that food could be made no longer kosher from evil spirits on the hands. \n \n Why does Mark 7 explain\n \n 3(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders. 4When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles.a)\n \n Does God not specifically name among others shellfish as being an abomination and that the Jews are not to eat them? Yes he does. Does he not say this a total of 3 times? Yes he does. \n \n Why do you make Jesus now say no longer are they an abomination? Now these things may be eaten as any other thing.\n \n You are making God change his mind. God doesn't do that does he?\n \n Why does Matthew 15 end the story by explaining himself\n \n 19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: 20 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.\n \n If it was food he was referring, why say unwashed hands? Shouldn't he have said to eat unclean food defileth not a man? Did Jesus make a mistake? Did Matthew?\n \n But Gentiles like bacon, sausage, crab and lobster so the dietary laws just don't work for them. That is why you can go from unwashed hands and tradition to food and laws. \n \n Like Jesus said the blind leading the blind. Better watch your step that cliff is coming up.",
