   "The percentage. of people who call themselves in some way Christian has dropped more than 11% in a generation. The faithful have scattered out of their traditional bases: The Bible Belt is less Baptist. The Rust Belt is less Catholic. And everywhere, more people are exploring spiritual frontiers - or falling off the faith map completely.\n \n These dramatic shifts in just 18 years are detailed in the new American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS), to be released today. It finds that, despite growth and immigration that has added nearly 50 million adults to the U.S. population, almost all religious denominations have lost ground since the first ARIS survey in 1990.\n \n \"More than ever before, people are just making up their own stories of who they are. They say, 'I'm everything. I'm nothing. I believe in myself,' \" says Barry Kosmin, survey co-author.\n \n Among the key findings in the 2008 survey:\u0095 So many Americans claim no religion at all (15%, up from 8% in 1990), that this category now outranks every other major U.S. religious group except Catholics and Baptists. In a nation that has long been mostly Christian, \"the challenge to Christianity ... does not come from other religions but from a rejection of all forms of organized religion,\" the report concludes. \n \n \u0095 Catholic strongholds in New England and the Midwest have faded as immigrants, retirees and young job-seekers have moved to the Sun Belt. While bishops from the Midwest to Massachusetts close down or consolidate historic parishes, those in the South are scrambling to serve increasing numbers of worshipers.\n \n \u0095 Baptists, 15.8% of those surveyed, are down from 19.3% in 1990. Mainline Protestant denominations, once socially dominant, have seen sharp declines: The percentage of Methodists, for example, dropped from 8% to 5%. \n \n \u0095 The percentage of those who choose a generic label, calling themselves simply Christian, Protestant, non-denominational, evangelical or \"born again,\" was 14.2%, about the same as in 1990.\n \n \u0095 Jewish numbers showed a steady decline, from 1.8% in 1990 to 1.2% today. The percentage of Muslims, while still slim, has doubled, from 0.3% to 0.6%. Analysts within both groups suggest those numbers understate the groups' populations.Most religious groups in USA have lost ground, survey finds - USATODAY.com\n \n I find this fascinating.\n Unfortunately, the poll doesn't inquire as to reason for the drop, although I think that can be seen from other articles.\n There are other articles that show the younger generation as seeing the church as being antagonistic. Too involved in attempts to denigrate and discriminate against gays and other groups.\n \n One could say that it is having a problem of not appearing very \"Christ-like\"...",

But this growth is glaringly absent over time, and the numbers are considerably static, demonstrating your claim without foundation ...\n \nPolitical science professor George Bishop of the University of Cincinnati published a paper in 1998-AUG listing and interpreting 1997 poll data. \"Bishop notes that these figures have remained remarkably stable over time. These questions were first asked about 15 years ago, and the percentages in each category are almost identical. Moreover, the profiles of each group has been constant. Just as when these questions were first asked 15 years ago, creationists continue to be older, less educated, Southern, politically conservative, and biblically literal (among other things). Women and African-Americans were more likely to be creationists than whites and men. Meanwhile, younger, better educated, mainline Protestants and Catholics were more likely to land in the middle as theistic evolutionists.\" 1\n\n Beliefs of the U.S. public about evolution and creation\n \n I realize it's natural for the Christian apologetic mentality to create excuses and reasons out of thin air, but in instances like this we can actually do some research to determine the truth, or falseness, of a claim.\n And your claim rings incredibly hollow...\n \n ==========================================================\n \n On the flip side, here's an article documenting what I'm talking about...\n \n Pensito Review Poll: Intolerance of Gays Drives Up Christianity&#8217;s Negatives among Young People\n \n Interestingly, the study discovered a new image that has steadily grown in prominence over the last decade. Today, the most common perception is that present-day Christianity is &#8220;anti-homosexual.&#8221; Overall, 91 percent of [16- to 29-year-old] non-Christians and 80 percent of young churchgoers say this phrase describes Christianity.\n \n As the research probed this perception, non-Christians and Christians explained that beyond their recognition that Christians oppose homosexuality, they believe that Christians show excessive contempt and unloving attitudes towards gays and lesbians.\n \n One of the most frequent criticisms of young Christians was that they believe the church has made homosexuality a &#8220;bigger sin&#8221; than anything else. Moreover, they claim that the church has not helped them apply the biblical teaching on homosexuality to their friendships with gays and lesbians. \n \n ....\n For instance, a decade ago the vast majority of Americans outside the Christian faith, including young people, felt favorably toward Christianity&#8217;s role in society. Currently, however, just 16 percent of non-Christians in their late teens and twenties said they have a &#8220;good impression&#8221; of Christianity.\n\n \n That is SOLID statistics on people's perceptions of Christianity and a definitive show of a real \"shift\".\n \n Amusingly enough, some people on this message board fight the very perceptions which DOMINATE these youth's opinions.",

This literal reading of genesis is just plain nuts. It was even talked about in early CHristianity as being stupid (Read some Saint Augustine of Hippo's essays)\n Here is a quote from him\n \n Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he hold to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men. If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods and on facts which they themselves have learnt from experience and the light of reason? Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion.\n \n \n It is not a coincidence that fundamentalist Christianity is flourishing the most in the least educated states.",

   "The Christian Science Monitor made a prediction about evangelical Christianity.\n I am not sure I buy it, but here is the article.\n \n The coming evangelical collapse | csmonitor.com\n \n \n The coming evangelical collapse\n An anti-Christian chapter in Western history is about to begin. But out of the ruins, a new vitality and integrity will rise.\n \n \n\n Oneida, Ky. - We are on the verge - within 10 years - of a major collapse of evangelical Christianity. This breakdown will follow the deterioration of the mainline Protestant world and it will fundamentally alter the religious and cultural environment in the West.\n \n Within two generations, evangelicalism will be a house deserted of half its occupants. (Between 25 and 35 percent of Americans today are Evangelicals.) In the \"Protestant\" 20th century, Evangelicals flourished. But they will soon be living in a very secular and religiously antagonistic 21st century.\n \n This collapse will herald the arrival of an anti-Christian chapter of the post-Christian West. Intolerance of Christianity will rise to levels many of us have not believed possible in our lifetimes, and public policy will become hostile toward evangelical Christianity, seeing it as the opponent of the common good.\n \n Millions of Evangelicals will quit. Thousands of ministries will end. Christian media will be reduced, if not eliminated. Many Christian schools will go into rapid decline. I'm convinced the grace and mission of God will reach to the ends of the earth. But the end of evangelicalism as we know it is close.\n \n Why is this going to happen?\n \n 1. Evangelicals have identified their movement with the culture war and with political conservatism. This will prove to be a very costly mistake. Evangelicals will increasingly be seen as a threat to cultural progress. Public leaders will consider us bad for America, bad for education, bad for children, and bad for society.\n \n The evangelical investment in moral, social, and political issues has depleted our resources and exposed our weaknesses. Being against gay marriage and being rhetorically pro-life will not make up for the fact that massive majorities of Evangelicals can't articulate the Gospel with any coherence. We fell for the trap of believing in a cause more than a faith.\n \n 2. We Evangelicals have failed to pass on to our young people an orthodox form of faith that can take root and survive the secular onslaught. Ironically, the billions of dollars we've spent on youth ministers, Christian music, publishing, and media has produced a culture of young Christians who know next to nothing about their own faith except how they feel about it. Our young people have deep beliefs about the culture war, but do not know why they should obey scripture, the essentials of theology, or the experience of spiritual discipline and community. Coming generations of Christians are going to be monumentally ignorant and unprepared for culture-wide pressures.\n \n 3. There are three kinds of evangelical churches today: consumer-driven megachurches, dying churches, and new churches whose future is fragile. Denominations will shrink, even vanish, while fewer and fewer evangelical churches will survive and thrive.\n \n 4. Despite some very successful developments in the past 25 years, Christian education has not produced a product that can withstand the rising tide of secularism. Evangelicalism has used its educational system primarily to staff its own needs and talk to itself.\n \n 5. The confrontation between cultural secularism and the faith at the core of evangelical efforts to \"do good\" is rapidly approaching. We will soon see that the good Evangelicals want to do will be viewed as bad by so many, and much of that work will not be done. Look for ministries to take on a less and less distinctively Christian face in order to survive.\n \n 6. Even in areas where Evangelicals imagine themselves strong (like the Bible Belt), we will find a great inability to pass on to our children a vital evangelical confidence in the Bible and the importance of the faith.\n \n 7. The money will dry up.\n \n",

   "That is not what I said at all...\n Nowhere even close...\n\n \n Well it follows from what you said. You responded by saying the Bible tells Christians to go out and preach to others, which carried the implication you mean that they AREN'T living up to doing that. You say that in the context of declining #s of Christians, so it's not like it's unreasonable to take your comments that way. If that's not what you mean, then by all means clear it up for us and better explain what you meant exactly by the point that the Bible says to preach the gospel. \n \n \nSo if a person were to antagonistically \"share the gospel\", driving people away from being Christian, that would be in keeping with God's word to you?\n\n \n Is there any way to truly share the gospel without it being taken as \"antagonistic\" in a culture where it's frowned upon for religion to publicly share its beliefs? I think much of the problem is that people like yourself are too easily \"antagonized\" when people share their religious beliefs. At least that's part of the equation that shouldn't be left out.\n \n \nTo me, the command on sharing the Gospel wasn't just about opening your mouth and saying words, not caring about the after-effect.\n\n \n Heh, you know, it's always ironic when people who basically reject Christ for all practical purposes invoke his teaching on others. It always comes across as pretty hollow, actually. Sort of like someone who doesn't have a thing to do with eastern mysticism trying to tell Zen practitioners what they need to be doing. I guess your seeming concerns for all these Christians follow Christ's commands might carry more weight if you were speaking from a perspective that really gave a rat's *** about Christ's teachings in any genuine way to begin with.\n \n \nThe real point, as I made it clear, was the following:I don't care how high the Christian numbers there are...\n It's the actions of some people who HAPPEN to be Christian that I find objectionable.\n\n \n And yet you post an article about declining #s in the WHOLE religion. :) So in point of fact, you weren't posting about \"some people who HAPPEN to be Christian\". emoticon_rolleyes Not anything about declining anti-gay Christians, but just Christians at large. \n \n \nThat's interesting.\n The bible has a variety of examples of people who would die rather than renounce their faith.\n The martyrs are supposedly revered. A source of inspiration.\n But you take pride in putting the person before the belief. The belief itself (as in spreading it) is sacrificed for the sake of the person and presumably the person's individual wishes.\n\n \n You don't seem to understand what I'm saying here at all. Putting people first IS a Christian thing to do. It's what Christ did and taught others to do. You're trying to create a false dichotomy here when in fact caring about people IS a big part of what Christ taught to do. Christian martyrs died because they were being imposed upon by people who wouldn't let them live out their faith, and wanted to force them to take on another religion or renounce the one they had. That's a rather poor and telling example on your part of faith versus putting people first. It's rather an example of faith versus throwing away their faith. Giving in to someone who is saying \"renounce or die\" has nothing to do with 'putting people first.' \n \n \nYou shouldn't give us all the credit.\n The actions of \"Christians\" have had more to do with it than the victims of some Christians' intolerance.\n\n \n I think most everyone knows that, and I think most Christians know that. In my experience Christianity tends to be its own bigest critic anyway. Certainly it's been a horse beaten ad nauseum in these forums to the point where it's probably more needed to bring up the way society is less and less tolerant of religion. That's also an unfortunate problem with society, not JUST religion. I have no problem with the something so obvious as the fact Christians have brought some of this on themselves--anyone is going to know that. But I suspect you would rather swallow brass tacks than be willing to admit that society isn't always fair to religion either, and that people who are more secular-minded sometimes don't really give it a fair shake in pluralistic society. If you don't think so, compare sometime the reaction of people to a street preacher (who would be engaging in what you claimed was your idea of obedience to the Bibles' commands) to their reaction to something that is more politically correct, like an anti-war group, or People will sometimes say \"that guy should be locked up\" when all he's doing is speaking his beliefs (at the very least, they'll try to get away from him as quickly as possible) but they'll cheer the guy on that's talking about more PC ideological matters like global warming or anti-war views. And if you do admit it, you won't be able to do so in any degree that won't involve a 'Christians-brought-it-on-themselves' approach.\n \n \nI mean, in the bible people DIED rather than renounce their faith...\n And the \"cultural and political baggage\" in today's society, which threatens no Christian, somehow drives people away from Christianity??? Or admitting they are Christian???\n\n \n Who said anything about society driving people away from their beliefs? I certainly didn't say that. Who are you responding to here?\n \n \nQuite frankly, THAT sort of change in willingness to abandon a faith over something as \"cultural and political baggage\" is amazing to me. My life would be a heck of a lot simpler if I were straight. If I abandoned the REAL \"cultural and political baggage\" of homosexuality and just denied who I am.\n While it's not possible to change sexual orientation like a person can change religion, I could still just say I'm somebody I'm not ...\n Gays, who experience REAL persecution and REAL discrimination, have got more courage than the \"Christians\" you hypothesize about here...\n I refuse to give in to \"cultural and political baggage\", cause that would be cowardly and denying who I am...\n\n \n Well this isn't the first time you've indicated you think of \"Christians\" in the united and pride-based sense that you likely think of categories like \"gays.\" It really is apples and oranges in that sense; I'm simply saying that some people may not much want to wear their Christianity on their sleeve--it may be a deeply personal thing for them. That shouldn't be something that \"amazes\" you; I COMPLETELY understand such feelings if people have them, even to the point of just saying whatever needs to be said to get off the phone with the annoying survey 'telemarketer-type' person who called them during dinner and who's probably going to try to and get them to sign up for something after the survey. (Can't exactly be the best way to form data for a survey, now can it?) Society really always wants to paint people into a box--to put them into categories, and that's really what this is about. It's not about shame of sharing faith, or denying faith, or whatever other red herring you're bringing to the table here. I think you're leaving out an important aspect of people--that they don't always want to be put in a box. The fact that I don't particularly want to be categorized in the sense that our society today has stigmatized \"christian\" doesn't mean I don't ultimately hold to what are Christ-taught ideals, or at least want to do so. \n \n Another aspect to this that just occurred to me is that people are always in different phases of their lives, and this is often a case when it comes to religion. It's very common for people to go years avoiding or even putting aside religion, only to later take it back up--Anne Rice is a one well-known example of this. \n \n The point here is that there are many factors that can contribute to the results of surveys like this. And that needs to be kept in mind with this sort of thing.\n \n \nHeaven help that type of \"Christian\" if they ever encounter real problems in life...\n\n \n I have no idea what that is supposed to mean. Christians are everyday people and encounter 'real problems' in life all the time. They do live life.\n \n \nSo by \"theist\", you wouldn't even classify yourself as \"Christian, generic\"?\n Not a Christian?\n\n \n Well, of course I do consider myself a \"Christian\" in the sense of wanting to abide by Christ's teachings and ideals. Again, I don't really understand the point of what you're asking.",

   "Well it follows from what you said. You responded by saying the Bible tells Christians to go out and preach to others, which carried the implication you mean that they AREN'T living up to doing that. You say that in the context of declining #s of Christians, so it's not like it's unreasonable to take your comments that way. If that's not what you mean, then by all means clear it up for us and better explain what you meant exactly by the point that the Bible says to preach the gospel.\n\n To repeat what I have already made clear...\n I don't see this as an issue of \"not preaching\".\n \n ARCHIE \"preaches\", doesn't he?\n But at the same time, his preaching methodology is COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE to a desire of converting people to Christianity.\n My point, stated throughout my posts, has been that Christians are doing OTHER THINGS that are not only counter-productive to converting people, I see them as against the biblical dogma itself.\n \n Keep your \"implications\" and READ what I said.\n \n \n \nIs there any way to truly share the gospel without it being taken as \"antagonistic\" in a culture where it's frowned upon for religion to publicly share its beliefs?\n\n It's a hyperbole to believe we are in such a culture to begin with.\n There have been some antagonistic Christians who have classified me as \"hating\" Christianity, which is false.\n The truth is that a lot of what I learned about the bible I learned by talking to some Christians I still admire and respect.\n They live their beliefs in THEIR life, and they are sincere in their approach.\n \n \n \nI think much of the problem is that people like yourself are too easily \"antagonized\" when people share their religious beliefs. At least that's part of the equation that shouldn't be left out.\n\n I'm sorry, but no.\n You really don't appreciate the mentality that some people bring across when they \"share their religious beliefs\" in a denigrating and dishonest way.\n \n Quite frankly, considering your position on \"voting for atheists\", I would not cast any stones on this area for intolerance. You've got your own issues and your own presumptions upon others...\n \n \n \nHeh, you know, it's always ironic when people who basically reject Christ for all practical purposes invoke his teaching on others.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n Okay. Ladies and gentlemen. I invite you to view what ACTUALLY just happened.\n Jyoshu just criticized me for being \"too easily antagonized\" when people share their religious beliefs.\n But when I try to discuss his religion with him, HE SHUTS ME OUT.\n \n This is part of what I'm talking about when I say people aren't \"sharing their religious belief\" in an intellectually honest way.\n \n \n \nIt always comes across as pretty hollow, actually.\n\n What is more hollow is people who claim to accept Christ, but reject his teachings.\n I wouldn't have brought up that passage if we weren't discussing Christian's actions.\n \n If we were discussing homosexuals and Harvey Milk was found to only be sleeping with women and never men, that would be pretty darn important.\n \n \n \nI guess your seeming concerns for all these Christians follow Christ's commands might carry more weight if you were speaking from a perspective that really gave a rat's *** about Christ's teachings in any genuine way to begin with.\n\n Again, I can't help but laugh.\n You were accusing me of being too easily antagonized, but when I try to discuss Christian beliefs you shut me out.\n I think you've got it backwards as to who is \"too easily antagonized\" here...\n \n \n \nAnd yet you post an article about declining #s in the WHOLE religion. :) So in point of fact, you weren't posting about \"some people who HAPPEN to be Christian\". emoticon_rolleyes Not anything about declining anti-gay Christians, but just Christians at large. \n\n This gets back to your misunderstanding at the first part of the post.\n You still refuse to recognize this is NOT ABOUT the religion.\n My point in this is the REASON WHY Christian numbers are declining, which has to do with the approach some Christians are using.\n \n Maybe if I repeat that a few more times, it will sink in.\n This isn't \"anti-Christian\", but rather against the actions of some Christians which are outside the teachings of their bible (yet they claim a basis for their actions in the bible).\n \n \n \nYou don't seem to understand what I'm saying here at all. Putting people first IS a Christian thing to do. It's what Christ did and taught others to do.\n\n You're trying to rephrase the issue to ignore my point.\n My issue is about people putting themselves BEFORE their religion, which is demonstrated when people put their own desire to act a certain way BEFORE a goal of converting people to Christianity.\n \n Suppose John could act in one way, which is more likely to convert Paul and Zach.\n But instead, John acts in another way which is more likely to alienate Paul and Zach.\n Now, in the second scenario Paul and Zach are not Christian.\n An act of \"putting the person first\" in this scenario would be to act in the interests of SAVING Paul and Zach, at the expense of sacrificing the desire to expose an egotistical and pompous heart.\n \n \n \nChristian martyrs died because they were being imposed upon by people who wouldn't let them live out their faith, and wanted to force them to take on another religion or renounce the one they had. That's a rather poor and telling example on your part of faith versus putting people first.\n\n Only if you are completely clueless as to what I was saying in the first place.\n Try to stop and think.\n WHAT was my point in the first place???\n \n Wasn't my point about how people can put faith ahead of their personal goals, like survival???\n \n \n \nIt's rather an example of faith versus throwing away their faith.\n\n \"throwing away their faith\" is turning your back on the Hebrew God's conversion command by acting in a way contradictory to converting people.\n Nobody is asking you to renounce your faith. Nobody is asking anybody to stop saying they are Christian.\n The REASON for the decline is based on people seeing behavior that is quite frankly against Christ's teachings.\n People are throwing away their faith for political gain and personal desire.\n \n \n \nGiving in to someone who is saying \"renounce or die\" has nothing to do with 'putting people first.'\n\n Yeah. You really had no clue as to why I brought up that example.\n I was not intimating that they should renounce.\n \n The point was that they sacrificed a LOT MORE to act Christ-like than any Christian is asked to give up today...\n And yet, some Christians today have a harder time with it...\n \n \n \nI have no problem with the something so obvious as the fact Christians have brought some of this on themselves--anyone is going to know that.\n\n Considering that has been my point all along, and the real message that you demonstrated a misunderstanding on earlier, I can't help but wonder why you are having such a difficult time with me pointing it out.\n \n \n \nBut I suspect you would rather swallow brass tacks than be willing to admit that society isn't always fair to religion either, and that people who are more secular-minded sometimes don't really give it a fair shake in pluralistic society.\n\n If you want to go back to a couple threads and discuss that issue, I am more than game.\n Perhaps this thread, where it was discussed all the PERKS that religion gets...\n http://www.4forums.com/political/religion-debates/12337-exemptions-grow-religion-outweighs-regulation.html\n Would you \"rather swallow brass tacks than be willing to admit that society\" habitually bends over backwards to accomodate and pamper religion???\n \n Or possibly this thread, where you tried to espouse \"anti-religious bigotry\" and I questioned the validity of your classification.\n http://www.4forums.com/political/religion-debates/7861-anti-religious-bigotry-here-forum-9.html#post341313\n \n \n \nIf you don't think so, compare sometime the reaction of people to a street preacher (who would be engaging in what you claimed was your idea of obedience to the Bibles' commands) to their reaction to something that is more politically correct, like an anti-war group, or People will sometimes say \"that guy should be locked up\" when all he's doing is speaking his beliefs (at the very least, they'll try to get away from him as quickly as possible) but they'll cheer the guy on that's talking about more PC ideological matters like global warming or anti-war views.\n\n Wow you have an active imagination.\n Repeatedly, people prove to me that their greatest victimization is in their own mind.\n \n \n \nWho said anything about society driving people away from their beliefs? I certainly didn't say that. Who are you responding to here?\n\n I never said you said that.\n I was tying the issue BACK TO THE TOPIC OF THIS THREAD.\n Trying to show you the context of your claim, and its thorough irrelevance to the issue.\n \n \n \nWell this isn't the first time you've indicated ...\n\n I indicated nothing of the sort and I'm not going to let you detract from my point with meaningless nonsequiturs...\n \n \n \nI'm simply saying that some people may not much want to wear their Christianity on their sleeve--it may be a deeply personal thing for them.\n\n And I have no problem with that.\n What I DO have a problem with is a hypothetical contradiction whereby a person does not want to \"wear their Christianity on their sleeve\", but then they want to legislate it.\n \n The ultimate issue here is the negative reaction to enforced beliefs.\n \n \n \nThat shouldn't be something that \"amazes\" you\n\n Considering I never intimated that it \"amazes\" me, it should come as no surprise to you that it does not \"amaze\" me at all...\n \n \n \nI COMPLETELY understand such feelings if people have them, even to the point of just saying whatever needs to be said to get off the phone with the annoying survey 'telemarketer-type' person who called them during dinner and who's probably going to try to and get them to sign up for something after the survey.\n\n People identify themselves and their purpose when they call for polls like this.\n At the start of the conversation, the person is asked \"Do you have time\", to which a person can easily answer no.\n \n An answer of \"I am a Christian\" doesn't get them off the phone any faster than an answer of \"I have no religion\".\n \n We have moved firmly from the issue of \"not wanting to wear their Christianity on their sleeve\" and FIRMLY into the realm of \"I will lie about my beliefs to complete strangers who I just started talking to on the phone, and there is no rational reason to believe I would ever talk to them again afterwards\".\n \n Unless you think that Peter was just \"not wearing his beliefs on his sleeve\" when he lied about whether or not he knew Jesus???\n In which case, I'm sure that Christianity repeats that story with the moral that Peter did nothing wrong, right???\n \n \n \nSociety really always wants to paint people into a box--to put them into categories, and that's really what this is about.\n\n Are you seriously OBJECTING to people being \"categorized\" as \"Christian\"????????????\n Are you seriously trying to EXCUSE people who would want to refuse to admit that they fall under such an obvious definition???? \n It's not rocket science.\n \n What's next? Black people who don't want to admit they are black cause it would \"put them in a box\"???\n \n \n \nIt's not about shame of sharing faith, or denying faith, or whatever other red herring you're bringing to the table here.\n\n I should just start a counter for each time you demonstrate that you don't understand what is being said in plain English...\n \n \n \nI think you're leaving out an important aspect of people--that they don't always want to be put in a box. The fact that I don't particularly want to be categorized in the sense that our society today has stigmatized \"christian\" doesn't mean I don't ultimately hold to what are Christ-taught ideals, or at least want to do so.\n\n An atheist CANNOT get elected to president, yet it's \"christians\" who are \"stigmatized\".\n This nation is 75% Christian, yet it is \"christians\" who are \"stigmatized\".\n We live in a CHRISTIAN NATION (according to some people), yet it is \"christians\" who are \"stigmatized\".\n I posted a thread on how Christianity and religion are pampered by the law, yet it is \"christians\" who are \"stigmatized\".\n \n You should thank god that you were born a white male in the U.S., cause if you were in a minority you probably couldn't be coaxed out of the closet for fear of all that \"stigma\"...\n \n And before the inevitable obfuscation, I AM NOT criticizing Christians with this.\n I am talking about a person's belief in how the modern world treats Christians, which is NOT dogma.\n \n \n \nAnother aspect to this that just occurred to me is that people are always in different phases of their lives, and this is often a case when it comes to religion. It's very common for people to go years avoiding or even putting aside religion, only to later take it back up--Anne Rice is a one well-known example of this.\n\n That same issue would have existed in the 1990's when the earlier poll existed.\n Unless you've got some reason to believe it is more prominent today, that's a wash...\n \n \n \nI have no idea what that is supposed to mean. Christians are everyday people and encounter 'real problems' in life all the time. They do live life.\n\n I'm not talking about the \"problems\" of \"the toaster is overcooking the toast and it's a little dry for my taste\".\n I'm talking about REAL DISCRIMINATION PROBLEMS.\n \n You claim Christians are \"stigmatized\".\n I'm talking about REAL groups who are REALLY stigmatized.\n Blacks, gays, women who experience REAL discrimination. Losing out on a job opportunity cause the employer wanted somebody who wasn't that characteristic.\n \n Having a right, like gay marriage, removed from you IS \"stigmatized\".\n Christians? Feh. The typical reality is that they bring it upon themselves.\n I remember a story a while back about a high school Christian group that claimed \"discrimination\". They were told they could have a classroom to meet like other extra-curricular groups, yet they wanted to meet in the common area (where no group was allowed to meet).\n And without any surprise, WND rushes to their vocal defense proclaiming \"discrimination\".\n \n \n \nWell, of course I do consider myself a \"Christian\" in the sense of wanting to abide by Christ's teachings and ideals. Again, I don't really understand the point of what you're asking.\n\n The point was to get an actual account.\n \"Theist\" wasn't on that poll list.\n \n Ultimately, for the \"don't want to be put in a box\" claim, it boils down to pragmatism.\n There are a variety of options for Christian including \"Christian, generic\". The total for the Christian category shrank.\n The category that GREW was the \"No Religion + Don't Know / Refused\" category.\n So, if people opted for a different \"box\", what they went with was to put themselves in THAT category.\n Both easily invoke Peter's denial of Christ story.\n \n But hey. If you want to insist there are a significant number of Christians who lack the conviction or courage to say \"I am a Christian\", that's your choice.\n No matter how you try to dress it up and put a pretty bow on it, that is ultimately what it boils down to.\n Lacking conviction or lacking courage.",

   "No. It does not have \"so many different meanings\".\n It's a scientific theory. Not something that morphs around just cause other people look at it. \n\n \n Things are what they are in reality, not in theory. Imperfect humans use the word evolution in many different ways. How it is ideally defined is not reality. \n \n \n \nThe only \"weapon against Christianity\" regards anybody who takes an extreme literal interpretation of the bible. And even then, other scientific tools like carbon dating easily prove Christianity wrong. \n\n \n Well yes, the extreme literal positions of things like original sin, the need for Christ, etc. (see post #20) Take away that kind of extreme literalism, and atheists love that kind of Christianity, and have no issues with it. It should be enough to make those kind of non-literal Christians nervous, especially in light of many warnings in the Bible about it. \n \n \nI can't help but think this is a clear demonstration of the absurdity of your position.\n It is a SCIENTIFIC THEORY, but you try to contradict SCIENTISTS who tell you something about its application.\n \n The hubris of you trying to tell science how science is, contradicting scientists, is amazing!\n Might as well be a hair-dresser trying to lecture a mechanic on how a car runs. \n\n \n It's almost like carbon dating lovers telling Christians how Christianity is, isn't it? \n \n \"It is better to trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in man.\" Psalm 118:8\n \n Especially men who claim to have observed evolution. But they claim they have - they've watched.....flowers grow! (it's that definitions thing again)\n \n \n\"gaps\" declared by people who typically have no real rational understanding of the theory, pretending to tell scientists what they see in the scientific theory...\n\n \n No, you yourself said that evolution \"does not speak to how those earliest forms came into being\" but it's an undisputable fact that life came into being some way. \n \n \nIs that what this is really about to you? CONTROL ????\n\n \n YES. The first amendment is all about the avoidance of lopsided control. \n \n \nI'm sorry, but RELIGION can control RELIGION.\n Religion does NOT get to control science. Such attempts stunt science and prove counter-productive for societal good. \n\n \n And science does not get to control society. Atheism shouldn't get to control science. If atheism politically opposes religion, it is the same as religion. Atheism is covered by the first amendment to the same extent religion is. \n \n \nSounds like there are a variety of arguments in favor of evolution which you just plain do not understand...\n\n \n I understand that a variety of arguments = a variety of definitions, in the case of evolution. \n \n \nIs this an absurd lie, or are you not reading correctly?\n My link showed the following positions from scientists:\n * 05% God created man pretty much in his present form at one time within the last 10,000 years.\n * 40% Man has developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life, but God guided this process, including man's creation.\n * 55% Man has developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life. God had no part in this process.\n \n There is no \"99.86%\" in my link.\n ABOVE is what it ACTUALLY says.\n\n \n I see there has been a lot of discussion on that, but the percentages aren't all that important. The main point is, my 99.86% vs your 55% is a far cry from the 10% of the general public, isn't it? People who study science are clearly less Christian than the general public - I'm sure everyone can agree on that. The question is, did they study science because they were already that way as they chose that field, or were they no different than anyone else when they started studying it? - were they converted to unbelief by studying science? I think they are converted by it in most cases, not because of the science itself, but because of the way it is taught to them. Their influence in society can be significant, because science isn't completely separate from politics, with abortion, stem cell research, and other aspects of human behaviour that science studies. If percentages of Christianity are slipping, the way science is taught could be a contributor. If Christians are shut out by bent courts, it's not their fault!\n \n \nWhen people like you insist that it has to be evolution, which has a basis, or the bible, whereby a literal translation is disproven by science in SOOOO many ways, then it is your fault.\n\n \n Not if I believe Psalm 118 actually means what it says. That's the problem, if Genesis is wrong, maybe it's wrong too. That would help explain why theistic evolutionists agree politically with atheists far more than they do with \"fundies\" like me. \n \n \nOh great.\n More conspiracy theories?\n \n I'm sorry, but your claim is absurd.\n There is no \"intense marketing of atheism\". \n\n \n The books and websites I mentioned above have stepped it up greatly in the last few decades, you're in denial if you can't see that. \n \n \n1) I'm not an atheist. \n\n \n Oh no, another one! :xbanghead You just post from a lofty position of neutrality, right? That way you can flip flop around a little easier. If you're not an atheist, then what belief do your posts portray? Have you ever heard the expression, \"if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck....\" ? What do you disagree with Richard Dawkins on? \n \n \nYou repeatedly miscategorize things, which is consistent with your failure to recognize the real problem with Christianity's decline. \n\n \n What catagory are you in, if not atheist? \n \n \n2) Do you seriously think a book like \"The God Delusion\" can convince people that God does not exist? \n\n \n I seriously think that, yes. People of all ages, but especially young people who may be newly horny, or newly rebellious. There are testimonies on the internet of people who lost their religion as they studied science.\n \n \nIf the religion had any true strength, it could stand to a challenge.\n\n \n Not taxpayer funded challanges, that the first amendment prohibits!\n \n \nIn a lot of ways, your approach is like blaming the \"winner\" for winning, while ignoring how the loser fumbles the ball.\n\n \n I'm not approaching it like a game, because that's not what it is. Society is better with liberty and tolerance, not forceable victories for atheism or Christianity. I'm not worried about any forceable victory for Christianity, because it's not going to happen - it's not established in government. I'm not so sure about science/evolution, and therefore atheism. \n \n \nFirst you want to blame \"evolution\".\n Now, when that has been proven, you change your tactic and try to blame \"militant atheists\" instead.\n \n And quite frankly, \"militant atheists\" are few and far between.\n I will admit Richard Dawkins and Bill Maher are decidedly in that category.\n But they are the exception and not the rule.\n \n The real problem is that today's kids ARE QUESTIONING the claims of religion more, and found them wanting. \n\n \n Rebellious ones, yes. And they're inspired to question them more, inspired from people like Dawkins and Mahr. People like them did not have the public spotlight two or three decades ago. Do you still refuse to give them ANY CREDIT AT ALL for the slipping ranks of Christianity in the U.S.? Dawkins and Mahr are very popular. \n \n \nThe youth KNOW gay people, and realize that they aren't the boogeyman.\n In the past, people LIED (or told their delusional accounts) about gays and people didn't know any better.\n Anita Bryant is a perfect example with her campaign against gays in teaching positions.\n \n But today, kids are questioning the justness of Christianity. It's not atheisms fault that Christianity isn't competitive unless you already believe...\n It isn't atheism's fault that Christianity gives itself a bad name, behaving badly.\n \n \"intolerance of Christianity\"? NO religion should be taught in school. That's not \"intolerance of Christianity\".\n Why do I suspect your remedy to this would be to FAVOR Christianity.\n\n \n I'd like to see Christianity favored in exactly the same way it was favored before 1947, the date church and state were seperated by an activist Supreme court. Bofore 1947, you know, before the U.S. was drowning in debt. \n \n \n\"strawmen accusations\"? Any elaboration on this one?\n\n \n Yes, boogeyman accusations on people like Anita Bryant, James Dobson, Ken Hamm, Jerry Falwell, William Dembski, etc.",

   "My point, stated throughout my posts, has been that Christians are doing OTHER THINGS that are not only counter-productive to converting people, I see them as against the biblical dogma itself.\n\n \n Fine. The \"Christians-bring-it-on-themselves\" theme is one that you bring up quite a bit, in my observation. Again, no one is saying they don't proverbially pollute their own well. But I do maintain they are often also their own most stringent critic as well.\n \n \nI'm sorry, but no. You really don't appreciate the mentality that some people bring across when they \"share their religious beliefs\" in a denigrating and dishonest way.\n\n \n I have read a number of comments made in these forums of people saying they feel Christians should never try to proselytize--with no caveat they they only mean cases of denigration. (And no, I don't have time to go searching for them to provide a link; sorry.) There really are a significant number of people out there who find the idea of Christians 'sharing the gospel' to them to ANY degree to be inherently insulting. IMO that's a form of irrational prejudice. I don't care if you think Christians brought that on themselves--if people are open to hearing ideas pertaining to other areas and yet aren't open to hearing about religion, I believe that is a double standard. If an atheist came up to me, and I had time to sit down with him at that time, I would be glad to hear him out. But my experience is that all too often that's not the case the other way around. (and yes, I know there are plenty of Christians who wouldn't listen to an atheist.\n \n \nQuite frankly, considering your position on \"voting for atheists\", I would not cast any stones on this area for intolerance. \n\n \n There should be no more problem with that position than anyone not willing to vote for someone who is very different in ideology than what that given voter feels is one of the (if not the) most important issues there is. To expect devout religious people to willingly vote for an atheist is being pretty unreasonable, IMO. What you're doing is like calling an gay-rights advocate intolerant because he wouldn't vote for candidate who went emphatically on record saying he doesn't really believe homosexuals exist at all.\n \n \nROFLMAO!\n Okay. Ladies and gentlemen. I invite you to view what ACTUALLY just happened.\n Jyoshu just criticized me for being \"too easily antagonized\" when people share their religious beliefs.\n But when I try to discuss his religion with him, HE SHUTS ME OUT.\n\n \n !!!! emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Foundit, seriously, who do you think you're kidding? I can't imagine that there is any person here who really believes you genuinely are out to discuss my religion in any sort of open friendly way from the standpoint of genuinely wanting to learn about the ideas of someone else. You're debating, and you're looking for 'gotcha moments' just like you often do. \"Discuss his religion with him\" ..... yeeeeeaah. I guess I should have mentioned that genuineness in discourse makes a big difference there.\n \n \nThis gets back to your misunderstanding at the first part of the post.\n You still refuse to recognize this is NOT ABOUT the religion.\n My point in this is the REASON WHY Christian numbers are declining, which has to do with the approach some Christians are using.\n\n \n But you really have nothing to prove your causality argument. On the other hand, I've given you numerous other possible factors now. No, not proofs, but then yours isn't either.\n \n \nThe REASON for the decline is based on people seeing behavior that is quite frankly against Christ's teachings.\n\n \n Proof of causality?\n \n \nThe point was that they sacrificed a LOT MORE to act Christ-like than any Christian is asked to give up today...\n And yet, some Christians today have a harder time with it...\n\n \n A harder time with WHAT?? Wanting to be labeled \"christian\"? Look, I agree, we don't live under the Roman empire here with Christians being thrown to the lions or being burned at the stake. Sure, persecutions historically tend to be a unifying, shoring factor for any group. Good grief, you're obviously going to find fault rain or shine, here. But I'll take the less harmful sunshine for Christians, thank you, even if some aren't self-identifying as Christians at this point in their lives.\n \n \nIf you want to go back to a couple threads and discuss that issue, I am more than game.\n Perhaps this thread, where it was discussed all the PERKS that religion gets...\n http://www.4forums.com/political/religion-debates/12337-exemptions-grow-religion-outweighs-regulation.html\n Would you \"rather swallow brass tacks than be willing to admit that society\" habitually bends over backwards to accomodate and pamper religion???\n \n Or possibly this thread, where you tried to espouse \"anti-religious bigotry\" and I questioned the validity of your classification.\n http://www.4forums.com/political/religion-debates/7861-anti-religious-bigotry-here-forum-9.html#post341313\n\n \n Well you've just made my point. instead of admitting what I asked you to, you do the very opposite and bring up threads where you made an issue of religion doing just the opposite.\n \n \nPeople identify themselves and their purpose when they call for polls like this. At the start of the conversation, the person is asked \"Do you have time\", to which a person can easily answer no. An answer of \"I am a Christian\" doesn't get them off the phone any faster than an answer of \"I have no religion\". We have moved firmly from the issue of \"not wanting to wear their Christianity on their sleeve\" and FIRMLY into the realm of \"I will lie about my beliefs to complete strangers who I just started talking to on the phone, and there is no rational reason to believe I would ever talk to them again afterwards\".\n\n \n Frankly, I don't think you take into account how pervasive telemarketers and info-getting calls are becoming these days. I doubt there are too many other people than you who would consider it un-Christian to not give time or cut short a company or organization calling someone's home for these purposes interrupting family time or meals, or whatever. This is yet another example of you looking for anything you can to find fault with Christian people. Good grief. No one is saying anyone should \"lie\" to people. I'm talking about not wanting to be put in a box, wear religion on one's sleeve, or accomodate survey and survey. I think you're really grasping at straws here.\n \n \nI'm not talking about the \"problems\" of \"the toaster is overcooking the toast and it's a little dry for my taste\".\n I'm talking about REAL DISCRIMINATION PROBLEMS. You claim Christians are \"stigmatized\".\n I'm talking about REAL groups who are REALLY stigmatized.\n\n \n Er ... well, yeah. I admit it ... I've haven't had to be beaten for being a Christian, or sit at the back of the bus, or whatever other things you can dredge up in terms of \"real\" things that groups have experienced. Sorry to disappoint you! (shrug)\n \n Anyway, calm down here. I certainly didn't say Christians were persecuted or abused. I think you would do well to realize the distinction and to stop arguing as if I did. You may not realize this, but you really don't exactly own the issue of discrimination or stigmatization, even though you may think you do.\n \n (You really needn't worry, Foundit. The status gay people hold as being a persecuted group is completely intact, and isn't in any danger of being one-up'ed by those darn Christians. Rest easy, now. emoticon_rolleyes)\n \n \nBut hey. If you want to insist there are a significant number of Christians who lack the conviction or courage to say \"I am a Christian\", that's your choice.\n\n \n I've made clear a number of possibilities on this that have nothing to do with \"courage\" or \"conviction\". Again, at this point, you're just looking for any excuse, it seems, to paint this in whatever way is most negative on the Christians. Even to the point of holding up examples of historical times of persecution as comparison. If it's that important to you to try and say Christians are being weak and are cowards (basically what your 'courage' point amounts to) you've made your intentions clear. You've done fine with trying to make this survey into as bad a light as possible for Christians, when in fact the survey says simply what it says, that numbers are declining. It does not necessarily mean, at all, that people have no courage. Geez, have some consideration on this. People go through crises of faith. Besides, I would think you'd prefer they WOULD trade faith in for non-faith (if that's what's happening), but you still turn it into a basis for finding fault by essentially questioning their character. :xbanghead On one hand people want Christians to question their dogma, then if anyone does that and decides against it, it's STILL held against them as a flaw. emoticon_rolleyes",

But as one holding to the view of theistic evolution, I am still a creationist in the sense that I believe God is the creator. I just don't consider those verses as a literal accounting of the process. (not unlike a number of places in the Bible which are considered figurative by many people.)",

Do you somehow think that a theistic evolutionist is somehow a creationist in disguise?\n\n I'm sorry, you just claimed my position was \"irrelevant\".\n And now you ask all these really stupid questions, which should be obvious by now?\n Like I said, I am NOT saying \"45%\" are creationists.\n I never said that.\n \n My point is that it is NOT \"95%\" who \"excludes a possibility of God's presence\".\n Can you kindly make up your mind as to whether or not my position is \"irrelevant\", or whether you want me to elaborate.\n \n If what I said was irrelevant, then stop complaining about it.\n If what I said was relevant enough to complain about, then at least GET IT RIGHT as to what I am actually saying.",

They all work at the same office.\n John claims that Rich created and runs the company.\n Martha thinks that Rich did not do all that.

   "It was only a matter of time before somebody started asking the questions as to \"Why the change in religious group affiliations?\"\n \n As I thought, the hypocrisy and power attempts of some Christian churches was a major reason...\n And also as I thought, the whole \"science disproves religion\" excuse was not that popular...\n \n \nThe reasons people give for changing their religion - or leaving religion altogether - differ widely depending on the origin and destination of the convert. The group that has grown the most in recent years due to religious change is the unaffiliated population. Two-thirds of former Catholics who have become unaffiliated and half of former Protestants who have become unaffiliated say they left their childhood faith because they stopped believing in its teachings, and roughly four-in-ten say they became unaffiliated because they do not believe in God or the teachings of most religions.1 Additionally, many people who left a religion to become unaffiliated say they did so in part because they think of religious people as hypocritical or judgmental, because religious organizations focus too much on rules or because religious leaders are too focused on power and money. Far fewer say they became unaffiliated because they believe that modern science proves that religion is just superstition.\n\n Pew Forum: Faith in Flux: Religious Conversion Statistics and Changes in Religious Affiliation in the U.S.",

   "And now for something else I was talking about.\n How the YOUTH would recognize the current \"activity\" ( emoticon_rolleyes ) of the \"church\" (or at least the more vocal members of it) and be turned off by it...\n \n \nNew research shows young Americans are dramatically less likely to go to church -- or to participate in any form of organized religion -- than their parents and grandparents. \n \n \"It's a huge change,\" says Harvard University professor Robert Putnam, who conducted the research.\n \n Historically, the percentage of Americans who said they had no religious affiliation (pollsters refer to this group as the \"nones\") has been very small -- hovering between 5 percent and 10 percent. However, Putnam says the percentage of \"nones\" has now skyrocketed to between 30 percent and 40 percent among younger Americans.\n \n Putnam calls this a \"stunning development.\" He gave reporters a first glimpse of his data Tuesday at a conference on religion organized by the Pew Forum on Faith in Public Life.\n \n The research will be included in a forthcoming book, called \"American Grace.\" \n \n This trend started in the 1990s and continues through today. It includes people in both Generation X and Y.\n \n While these young \"nones\" may not belong to a church, they are not necessarily atheists.\n \n \"Many of them are people who would otherwise be in church,\" Putnam said. \"They have the same attitidues and values as people who are in church, but they grew up in a period in which being religious meant being politically conservative, especially on social issues.\"\n \n Putnam says that in the past two decades, many young people began to view organized religion as a source of \"intolerance and rigidity and doctrinaire political views,\" and therefore stopped going to church.\n \n This movement away from organized religion, says Putnam, may have enormous consequences for American culture and politics for years to come. \n\n Young Americans Losing Their Religion - ABC News\n \n The church will learn the error of their ways, when it starts hitting them harder in their pocket books.\n When they can no longer afford to fund movements of intolerance, their intolerant positions will flounder and die off.\n \n As with prejudice before, it changed when the youth didn't adopt the prejudices of the parents. I have no doubt that church membership MAY start to climb back up when the intolerance dies off.\n \n But by the same token, people should think about the WAY that church membership seats are refilled.\n I don't know of any statistics, but I would LOVE to know the statistical make-up of church membership along the lines of \"My parents told me to believe a certain way since I was born, therefore I do\" as opposed to \"A friend told me about Jesus, and I came to believe as an adult despite my parents not raising me a Christian\".\n Cause if the \"youth\" don't raise their kids in the church, how else are people going to \"come to believe\"?\n I suspect proselytizing is not that significant of a contributor....\n \n emoticon_rolleyes\n Oh well. It's the church's own actions which are bring about its own problems, so I can't really feel sorry for them.",
