Was decent other than dropping at the end where the next movie is to take place...some time in the distant future.\n \n I looked hard to find something Christians would be upset at in this 1st movie, being aware of what they loath, and beyond calling little familiars attached to their owners like souls 'demons' and using a device to tell the truth and having friendly witches (anyone remember Wizard of Oz), it seemed like a generic movie made to capitalize on the sales generated by Narnia, Rings Trilogy and the Potter series. And from previews shown, there are several more movies coming out that will do the same.\n \n My 10 year old was restless during the film but the dozens of other children in the theater were treated to some veiled athiesm it seems that was almost as intense as the athiesm they learn in church.\n \n A better anti-evangelical nutter movie was Mist (based on the Stephen King story) where you can't help but scream at the screen 'SHOT THAT NUTTER IN THE FACE!'",

That doesn't show how they can both be true, and not conflict.\n\n Poor, poor marc. Unable to grasp the idea of allegory. Just because you can't comprehend someone else's viewpoint doesn't invalidate it. You just have the right to disagree.\n \n \nI cannot answer that question - you hide in the invisibe mode.\n\n Translation: I cannot disagree with your logic on this one, elec.\n \n \nYet unfulfilled prophecies do not discredit the mounds of evidence for Christianity.\n\n Please start a thread on the \"mounds of evidence for Christianity.\"\n \n \nThen why is it not logical for evolution to address ORIGINS?? Why is there a double standard?\n\n There are unfulfilled prophecies about origins? Really?! Care to show me where?\n \n \nCertain persons here have said that God doesn't need to exist because all life on earth can be traced back to one simple, common ancestor.\n\n I'll acknowledge that, as worded, this is a non-sequitur for anything besides the argument that God created life forms in their current state. Common ancestry is not disproof of God. There are plenty of other, better arguments against the existence of the Christian God.\n \n \nHow much longer do we have to wait for evolution to come up with something for origins, before we can actually reach the conclusion that evolution is true?\n\n We don't. Evolution is true regardless of the origin of the first life. If you're interested in research about the origin of the first life, check out the RNA World hypothesis and Wachterschauser's deep sea model.\n \n \nNot all Christians say that - I don't say it.\n\n I didn't say that all do, or that you do. But some do, even some here, even some particularly outspoken, self-assured ones who run away from their challenges.\n \n \nSome prophecies may need more time.\n\n Then we're back to arguing whether such a prophecy means anything. Does the name Nostradamus ring a bell?\n \n \nIs evolution batting .900 without origins? I'd say it's more like .200. Why does it need the freebie?\n\n When did I say that evolution is batting .900? Evolution hits a grand slam every time it's tested. Maybe you need to be reminded of Tiktaalik? or the TTSS?\n \n \nI know the answer to the above questions - it's now time to do the big switcharoo on the definition of \"evolution\"! Evolution doesn't have a THING TO DO WITH ORIGINS!!! emoticon_cry\n\n Check any reputable source before you let yourself turn into a big crybaby.\n Here's a thought experiment you could try, if you have the brainpower: suppose God created the first life on earth, a bacterium. Does this disprove our information about how life has since developed? (Answer: no.)\n \n \n(then evolutionists don't have ANY BUSINESS putting down creation, do they? emoticon_xangel )\n\n When creation contradicts known facts, then you're damn right we do.",
