   "This is the pinnacle of reasoning behind the, at least on this forum, anti-gay rights movement:\n \n We think consenting adults of the same sex, who want to get married should be denied the right to marry (and forfeit any rights/benefits granted by such marriage), because:\n \n Becase there are some locker rooms and bathrooms designated as women only, or men only.\n --------------------------------------------------\n \n This is not a reason for denying human rights. It's a completely irrelevant statement. It's like saying \"rabbits eat lettuce, therefore, we should invade Iraq\".\n \n There exist bathrooms intended for men, and for women (only)\n Therefore:\n Adult, consenting gays should be legally restricted from getting married to one another, despite their protest that it's discrimination and unconstitutional.\n \n It's that absurd.\n \n If someone can show me how this is reasonable justification, please do. It doesnt' even get entered into evidnece, it's a joke..but we'll entertain the joke since I know there are some jokesters out there..\n \n \n \n 2. Different sex bathrooms are a result of what amounts to collective bargaining between the owners of public space, and the citizens/customers.\n \n You construct bathrooms. Women want privacy from men (and many men from women), and request women-only facilities. The owner/manager must also provide such facilities for the opposite sex (so that no one is denied access to a public bathroom). They do so, now they have men and women facilities.\n \n Who's rights are being violated here?.....\n Are the urinals protesting and asking for equal rights to enjoy use from both women and men?? Would answers to any of these questions be a sufficient condition for not allowing two consenting adults of the same sex, already in life-long comitted relationships, to be legally married? Of course not. To suggest they requires you to justify your position...which has yet to be done.\n =========================\n \n - In reality, some women want access to men's rooms so they don't have to wait in line. I'm also sure there are some guys out there who want to enter women's bathrooms. Why are they denied this \"right\"?\n \n Because it's the least restrictive of rights, and as the most fair to all parties involved.\n \n Women and men have a right to privacy, they waive this right for same-sex, but ask for enforcement with the opposite sex. All people have bathroom facilities provided, so:\n \n 1. Most people's rights are upheld (i.e. privacy), and the desire to have different rest areas from both parties.\n 2. The rights that are violated are fewer, and of less consequence.\n The only \"right\" being violated is access to one facility, and not another, yet both provide the same function. What's the justification for demanding people to give up their right to privacy and their desire for different gender bathrooms when your only argument FOR netural bathrooms is your desire for neutral bathrooms? You lose, every time.\n \n ====================\n \n Let's examine restricting gay rights in contrast:\n \n Two men in a comitted relationship want to get married (and get the rights provided by marriage):\n \n They are denied based on the \"desire\" for others, to live in a country where gay marriage doesn't exist.\n \n So, you are weighing:\n \n 1. Human rights with regards to legal classifcation and the benefits therein.\n 2. A contract between two consenting adults.\n 3. A contract that does not violate anyone's legal rights.\n \n vs\n \n 1. Your desire to limit another person's rights.\n \n *YES, IT'S THAT OBVIOUS*\n \n Please join the living and start thinking.\n \n -Mach",

Losing the debate. I realize winning and losing..i.e. being right and being wrong are not concepts found in religion, where anything goes...but out here in the real world actions have consequences, and words...yes, imagine that, have specific meanings. You verbally support a movement that restricts human rights, yet won't give us reasons for your position. I find that appalling. Yet you are content with labeling me as \"playing games\". How ironic.\n \n -Mach",

   "Alright, I'll bite. I doubt this will last long because you've already shown a propensity to regress into ad hominem all too easily, but we'll see.\n Yet you seem to be enjoying attacking me with that very sentence :)\n \n Please recongize two things:\n \n #1 all of your questions/attempts at refutation are immediately understood if you google search for 5 minutes, then spend a little time reading. \n #2 this is ala-montalban, so note neither the volume, nor the source, is my justification. My reasons do not require quoting or citation from \"authorities\", but you demand alternate sources, so I'll comply, and when they are given (below), you can no longer make your claim that I am the only one using this term, and that it is not used in legal issues with regards to sex and/or gender. It is not only important, but essential when discussing freedom and the law.\n \n Note: This goes from pro-gay, to anti-gay, to adoption, to general state involvement in the bedroom. Not just one side, and not just one topic. It took ~ 10 minutes...no time to throw together...although the entire post took longer :/\n \n \n#1 and 2: where in the constitution does the term and criteria \"consenting adults\" come into play? Even in court cases, the issue was often about men and women marrying, such as in Loving v. Virginia. \"Consenting adults\" as opposed to a \"man and woman\" isn't a legal criteria laid down anywhere--it is something you came up with. \n \n \n http://www.humanismbyjoe.com/Leave_Consenting_Adults_Alone.htm\n A different result occurs, however, when government attempts to control the activities of consenting adults. These people do not interfere with the liberty of others or risk harm to anyone (other than possibly themselves). They only make a personal choice of how they - and they alone - will live.\n \n (no surprise it's southern states in these next two)\n http://www.ageofconsent.com/louisiana.htm\n ...and criminalize what they are doing, even between consenting adults  in private with no one watching and nobody paying for anything...\n \n http://www.ageofconsent.com/arkansas.htm\n Now, only three states - Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas - have gay-specific sodomy laws and just 12 others still criminalize certain sex acts for both gay and non-gay consenting adults.  \n \n http://www.fff.org/comment/com0301q.asp\n It is certainly a tenet of any free society that the consensual sexual conduct of its adult citizens be left outside the purview of the state.\n \n http://www.divorceinfo.com/lovinglawyer.htm\n  is a matter of sex between two consenting adults. But what is consent? Consent requires both the right to say no and the power to say no. It requires roughly equal power.\n \n http://adoption.about.com/od/adoptionrights/a/adopteerights.htm\n (5) Just as two consenting adults  have the right to form a legally-recognized marital relationship through marriage, thus two consenting adults have the same right to establish a legally-recognized parent/child (filial) relationship with each other through adult adoption.\n \n \nRights are not given to groups, but individuals--it just so happens that for an individual to receive these particular benefits, they have to be married. Even marriage benefits are individually given. From the govt standpoint, everyone has the same rights now. You have the same right to a marriage license with an opposite sex partner as I do. You even have the right to simply marry a same-gender partner if you want, you just can't get a license for it. (outside of Mass. anyway)\n\n \n Irrelevant. And more: The right of marriage is realized only as a couple. An individual cannot get married to no one, else, we would not be having this debate. Gay couples are legally not allowed, restricted, from getting married, and restricted, from obtaining the same rights that a hetero couple has access to. \n \n An individual woman cannot marry a woman. An individual man CAN marry a woman. That's an individual restriction of rights. \n \n \nWith around 3% of the population being gay? I don't think so. I think it seems that way because the media is obsessed with it. Gay marriages in Massachusetts have diwndled to something occassional, now that the fad wore off with gay people.\n\n \n 8,850,000 people in the U.S. alone is not a lot of people?\n \n 192,000,000 world-wide if the percentage is statistically applicable?\n If all the gays in the world moved to America that would be 2/3 of our population. That's not a substantial number of human lives? \n \n Where do you hail from that over eight million people is \"not a lot of people\"?\n Even worse, I'm not sure what country you're living in, but we have something called minority rights. The needs of the many, outweigh the needs of the few, yet the few, even the one, has legal rights and the protection of the consititution. To trounce on those rights without justification is wrong, unconstitutional, and frankly, evil.\n \n \nYou see, your entire premise is wrong. You've not shown how human rights are being restricted.\n\n \n Really.\n \n Restricted from adopting\n http://archive.aclu.org/issues/gay/mothers.html\n The case, which went to trial today before state Circuit Court Judge John Frusciante in Fort Lauderdale, challenges a 1977 Florida statute that says \"no person eligible to adopt under this statute may adopt if that person is a homosexual.\" The trial is expected to last through the week.\n \n Restricted from having visitation or custody of own biological son\n http://archive.aclu.org/news/n050797c.html\n Judge Buford M. Parsons Jr., of the Henrico County Circuit Court, affirms the custody transfer, saying that lesbians are never fit to be parents\n \n < Home < HRC < Issues < Marriage \n \n Rights and Protections Denied Same-Sex Partners\n http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Section=Center&CONTENTID=14698&TEMPLATE=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm\n \n Because same-sex couples are denied the right to marry, same-sex couples and their families are denied access to the more than 1,138 federal rights, protections and responsibilities automatically granted to married heterosexual couples. Among those are:\n \n The right to make decisions on a partner's behalf in a medical emergency. Specifically, the states generally provide that spouses automatically assume this right in an emergency. If an individual is unmarried, the legal \"next of kin\" automatically assumes this right. This means, for example, that a gay man with a life partner of many years may be forced to accept the financial and medical decisions of a sibling or parent with whom he may have a distant or even hostile relationship. \n The right to take up to 12 weeks of leave from work to care for a seriously ill partner or parent of a partner. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 permits individuals to take such leave to care for ill spouses, children and parents but not a partner or a partner's parents. \n The right to petition for same-sex partners to immigrate. \n The right to assume parenting rights and responsibilities when children are brought into a family through birth, adoption, surrogacy or other means. For example, in most states, there is no law providing a noncustodial, nonbiological or nonadoptive parent's right to visit a child - or responsibility to provide financial support for that child - in the event of a breakup. \n The right to share equitably all jointly held property and debt in the event of a breakup, since there are no laws that cover the dissolution of domestic partnerships. \n Family-related Social security benefits, income and estate tax benefits, disability benefits, family-related military and veterans benefits and other important benefits. \n The right to inherit property from a partner in the absence of a will. \n The right to purchase continued health coverage for a domestic partner after the loss of a job.\n \n \n \n The only thing you've made clear is that you'd like to change the standard of marriage in this country to an more 'anything-goes' standard.\n\n \n On the contrary, your claim is false. I think it's quite clear that:\n \n Your choice to oppose equal rights is based on:\n 1. nothing (which ecnompasses the below)\n 2. your religion\n 3. your personal desire to restrict human rights\n \n Where I have given clarity and reasons, you give none.\n \n \nYou told why you think it is supposedly unconstitutional to not allow gay marriage, now what justification do you have for changing the marriage standard in this country?\n\n \n Is this your newest reason? That it's the status quo? Shall we start a new thread on exactly how absurd a \"reason\" that is or will you take my word for it? Please?\n \n Slavery is legal. Why change the status quo?\n England rules us. Why change the status quo?\n The earth is flat. Why change the status quo?\n Paganism rocks. Why change to christianity?\n I'm fat and my doctor tells me I'll die if I don't lose weight. Why change the status quo?\n People die from cancer and heart disease. Why change the status quo?\n Children die from treatable diseases every second... Why change the status quo?\n \n Why?\n \n Because it's the right thing to do. Because it's the American thing to do. Because it's the empathetic thing to do. Because it's the human thing to do. Because it's the reasonable thing to do. Because it's the constitutional thing to do. Because gay couples WANT equal rights, and are being denied them.\n \n Your only reason you choose not to, is because of your religion, which is the WRONG thing to base any beliefs with realtion to reality on, both constitutionally, and rationally.\n \n -Mach\n \n I hope I avoided ad hominem as requested.",
