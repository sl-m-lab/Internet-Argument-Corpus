   "November 6, 2005 \n \n BY MARK STEYN SUN-TIMES COLUMNIST \n \n \n \n \n Ever since 9/11, I've been gloomily predicting the European powder keg's about to go up. ''By 2010 we'll be watching burning buildings, street riots and assassinations on the news every night,'' I wrote in Canada's Western Standard back in February. \n \n \n \n Silly me. The Eurabian civil war appears to have started some years ahead of my optimistic schedule. As Thursday's edition of the Guardian reported in London: ''French youths fired at police and burned over 300 cars last night as towns around Paris experienced their worst night of violence in a week of urban unrest.'' \n \n ''French youths,'' huh? You mean Pierre and Jacques and Marcel and Alphonse? Granted that most of the \"youths\" are technically citizens of the French Republic, it doesn't take much time in les banlieus of Paris to discover that the rioters do not think of their primary identity as ''French'': They're young men from North Africa growing ever more estranged from the broader community with each passing year and wedded ever more intensely to an assertive Muslim identity more implacable than anything you're likely to find in the Middle East. After four somnolent years, it turns out finally that there really is an explosive ''Arab street,'' but it's in Clichy-sous-Bois. \n \n The notion that Texas neocon arrogance was responsible for frosting up trans-Atlantic relations was always preposterous, even for someone as complacent and blinkered as John Kerry. If you had millions of seething unassimilated Muslim youths in lawless suburbs ringing every major city, would you be so eager to send your troops into an Arab country fighting alongside the Americans? For half a decade, French Arabs have been carrying on a low-level intifada against synagogues, kosher butchers, Jewish schools, etc. The concern of the political class has been to prevent the spread of these attacks to targets of more, ah, general interest. They seem to have lost that battle. Unlike America's Europhiles, France's Arab street correctly identified Chirac's opposition to the Iraq war for what it was: a sign of weakness. \n \n The French have been here before, of course. Seven-thirty-two. Not 7:32 Paris time, which is when the nightly Citroen-torching begins, but 732 A.D. -- as in one and a third millennia ago. By then, the Muslims had advanced a thousand miles north of Gibraltar to control Spain and southern France up to the banks of the Loire. In October 732, the Moorish general Abd al-Rahman and his Muslim army were not exactly at the gates of Paris, but they were within 200 miles, just south of the great Frankish shrine of St. Martin of Tours. Somewhere on the road between Poitiers and Tours, they met a Frankish force and, unlike other Christian armies in Europe, this one held its ground ''like a wall . . . a firm glacial mass,'' as the Chronicle of Isidore puts it. A week later, Abd al-Rahman was dead, the Muslims were heading south, and the French general, Charles, had earned himself the surname ''Martel'' -- or ''the Hammer.'' \n \n Poitiers was the high-water point of the Muslim tide in western Europe. It was an opportunistic raid by the Moors, but if they'd won, they'd have found it hard to resist pushing on to Paris, to the Rhine and beyond. ''Perhaps,'' wrote Edward Gibbon in The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire, ''the interpretation of the Koran would now be taught in the schools of Oxford, and her pulpits might demonstrate to a circumcised people the sanctity and truth of the revelation of Mahomet.'' There would be no Christian Europe. The Anglo-Celts who settled North America would have been Muslim. Poitiers, said Gibbon, was ''an encounter which would change the history of the whole world.'' \n \n Battles are very straightforward: Side A wins, Side B loses. But the French government is way beyond anything so clarifying. Today, a fearless Muslim advance has penetrated far deeper into Europe than Abd al-Rahman. They're in Brussels, where Belgian police officers are advised not to be seen drinking coffee in public during Ramadan, and in Malmo, where Swedish ambulance drivers will not go without police escort. It's way too late to rerun the Battle of Poitiers. In the no-go suburbs, even before these current riots, 9,000 police cars had been stoned by ''French youths'' since the beginning of the year; some three dozen cars are set alight even on a quiet night. ''There's a civil war under way in Clichy-sous-Bois at the moment,'' said Michel Thooris of the gendarmes' trade union Action Police CFTC. ''We can no longer withstand this situation on our own. My colleagues neither have the equipment nor the practical or theoretical training for street fighting.'' \n \n What to do? In Paris, while ''youths'' fired on the gendarmerie, burned down a gym and disrupted commuter trains, the French Cabinet split in two, as the ''minister for social cohesion'' (a Cabinet position I hope America never requires) and other colleagues distance themselves from the interior minister, the tough-talking Nicolas Sarkozy who dismissed the rioters as ''scum.'' President Chirac seems to have come down on the side of those who feel the scum's grievances need to be addressed. He called for ''a spirit of dialogue and respect.'' As is the way with the political class, they seem to see the riots as an excellent opportunity to scuttle Sarkozy's presidential ambitions rather than as a call to save the Republic. \n \n A few years back I was criticized for a throwaway observation to the effect that ''I find it easier to be optimistic about the futures of Iraq and Pakistan than, say, Holland or Denmark.\" But this is why. In defiance of traditional immigration patterns, these young men are less assimilated than their grandparents. French cynics like the prime minister, Dominique de Villepin, have spent the last two years scoffing at the Bush Doctrine: Why, everyone knows Islam and democracy are incompatible. If so, that's less a problem for Iraq or Afghanistan than for France and Belgium. \n \n If Chirac isn't exactly Charles Martel, the rioters aren't doing a bad impression of the Muslim armies of 13 centuries ago: They're seizing their opportunities, testing their foe, probing his weak spots. If burning the 'burbs gets you more ''respect'' from Chirac, they'll burn 'em again, and again. In the current issue of City Journal, Theodore Dalrymple concludes a piece on British suicide bombers with this grim summation of the new Europe: ''The sweet dream of universal cultural compatibility has been replaced by the nightmare of permanent conflict.'' Which sounds an awful lot like a new Dark Ages.\n \n \n http://www.suntimes.com/output/steyn/cst-edt-steyn06.html\n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1350\n Islam is not a religion of peace \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1349\n \n Islamist way or no way \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1336\n \n 1,400 years of Islamic Imperialism and Colonialism: The Forbidden History \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1321 \n \n Tolerance and Pluralism: Indonesian Muslims call for death for Christians \n \n \n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1113\n Comparing the Rhetoric of Jihadism and Nazism\n \n \n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/718\n Islamic concept of Al-Taqiyah to infiltrate and\n destroy kafir countries\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/713\n Exclusivism and multiculturalism in Islamic society\n \n \n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/380\n The Imperialism of Khilafists: Their grand designs to\n conquer the west\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/363\n New Book Calls Europe 'Province of Islam'\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/23\n The Agenda of Islam: A War Between Civilizations\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/2\n The Clash Of Civilizations And The Great Caliphate",

   "The Quran and Haddiths are replete with exhortations to die in the name of Islam. There is no concept of unconditional love of Allah in the Quran. Allah's love is predicated on killing in the name of Islam or dieing in the name of Islam.\nMany, if not all, religions expect their followers to be willing to die in their names. Almost all also demand to kill in their names, although Christianity is at least scripturally an exception. But suicide is considered sinful by most religions, including Hinduism. The nearest thing to a suicide bomber in Abrahamic scripture is Samson, who pulled the temple pillars down to kill himself and the Philistines. He is never mentioned in the Qu'ran or adopted by the Muslims, despite the many references to many other Old Testament prophets. \n \n The centre of Islam is the five pillars:\n \n 1. To bear witness that there is none worthy of worship save Allah and that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the Messenger of Allah.\n \n 2. To observe Prayer (Salat).\n \n 3. To Pay Zakat (Alms giving)\n \n 4. To perform the Pilgrimage to the House of Allah (Hajj).\n \n 5. To Observe fasting during Ramadhan.\" (Bukhari)\n \n These are principles of communion with and submission to God, with a strong social consciousness (alms giving, and the fasting is intended to both create identification with the hungry, and free up money to give to them. Someone unable to fast can instead feed the hungry).\n \n \nCorrect. Bukhari is a Haddith. However, the Quran is an incomplete book. Many central tenets of Islam are found in the Haddiths. Without the Haddiths, a Muslim would not even know how to pray. Very few Muslims subscribe only to the Quran and not the Haddiths and Sira.

I just find it curious that you use a quote to attack a religion without even getting its source right.

You were comparing Islam to other religions. Let's remind ourselves.\n \n \nNowhere in the Bible is suicide looked at as a means of assuring a good afterlife. It can be found in Islamic teachings, however.\nThe example of Samson shows a prophet doing the nearest thing to suicide bombing in his time.

The time has come to purify and consolidate all the messages delivered by God's prophets into one message, and to proclaim that henceforth, there is only one religion acceptable to God - \"Submission\" (Quran 3:19, 85). \n\n \n The word Islam translates as \"submission\" in English, so the translation of the Quran quote above would read \"there is only one religion acceptable to God- ISLAM\"",
