Even considering emotions changed at whims and slight influences, such as happiness or sadness, science does not claim that these emotions do not exist.\n\n i dont mean that emotions dont exist, because they do. i'm saying that from a scientific perspective, emotions are useless as evidence\n \n \nAlthough it may not be officially agreed upon (and probably never will be), measuring sexual orienation, like any other sensation, can be scientifically measured by guaging the body's physical reaction, observing behavior, and even by asking individuals.\n\n right. this observable phenomenon is the only thing that science can work with. the intangibles like feelings and intentions are beyond the scope of science",

And it is true that each of our minds interpret evidence differently. But it is not true that the interpretation of that evidence which results is caused by a concious decision. An individual cannot choose what to believe and not to believe, just as you yourself cannot choose to believe that grass is purple.\n \n Regarding \"faith\", the term is used to mean many different things. Sometimes it is used to mean \"belief without reason\", which can happen, but although someone may hold a belief without reason, I don't believe an individual can hold a belief by choice. Religious people are also often described as having \"faith\", though in that case, the terminology is used incorrectly, for most religious people will tell you that they do indeed have real reasons for believing in God. Sometimes faith is confused with hope. And sometimes, faith is actually belief with good reason, for example, I might say \"I have faith that Joebrummer will get the job done.\" In this case, I may believe Joebrummer will get the job done because I know him to be a hard worker and have noted his successes in the past.\n \n But none of these things indicate that an individual is able to choose his own beliefs.\n \n I am never coerced or sucked into believing something not because I choose against it but because no good logic or evidence was provided against it. And I know a better explanation. But take someone who has no opinion, take a child and teach him some belief. When learning that belief, he doesn't make a concious choice, he believes it because that's all he knows; he has no reason to believe otherwise.\n \n People cannot just choose to believe something. In order to have a belief, you must actually have reasoned that what you believe is reality. You cannot simply choose to believe that which does not appear to be reality.\n \n \nBut these things do not have thousands of years-worth of genuine belief from millions, no billions, of people.
