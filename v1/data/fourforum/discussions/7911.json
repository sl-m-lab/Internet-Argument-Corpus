   "\n In the meantime, I am chewing on what the devil \"intrinsic evil\" is.\n\n \n I see two ways to approach this, humanistic and theistic. To a humanist, evil is strictly a human invention. Something can only be evil in relation to how it interacts with people, so obviously nothing can be \"intrisicly\" evil. A theist, on the other hand, would believe that good and evil are defined by God. Since God is making the definitions, he can say that such-and-such a thing is, and always will be, evil. So the way I see it, the only way that intrinsic evil makes sense as a concept is if you accept the idea of an outside agency which sets the definitions of good and evil.",

   "Thank you, Kronus, I arrived at somewhat the same opinion, though it was achieved in rather a twisted way.\n \n I will return to the beginning argument of Noonan's book, Newman and \"intrinsic evil.\"\n \n Newman was responding to a post by Thomas William Allies, a lecturer on history at Oxford University, dated October 26, 1863.\n \n Allies sent Newman a draft of a lecture in which he pronounced slavery to be intrinsically evil. Newman cautiously replied that he did not \"materially differ from you , though. . . \"\n \n Newman's argument:\n \nThat which is intrinsically and per se evil, we cannot give way to for an hour. That which is accidentally evil, we can meet according to what is expedient, giving different rules, according to the particular case. St. Paul would have gotten rid of despotism if he could. He could not, he left the desirable object to the slower working of Christian principle. So he could have gotten rid of slavery, if he could. He did not, because he could not, but had it been so intrinsically evil, had in be in se a sin, it must have been said to Philemon, liberate all your slaves at once.\n\n Spending a bit of time with my dictionary and other references I discovered a new word, extrinsic. Haven't quite assimilated that yet--this is beginning to sound like that derivative business that tricky folks do with stocks and such. That whole argument sounded like something William F. Buckley would rattle off, setting off my hackles instantly. I just don't trust folks who pepper their rhetoric with these teeny tiny Latin things that dictionaries don't generally explain.\n \n But, at any rate, old Newman didn't think slavery was evil in and of itself--and I found myself exclaiming, \"Well, why the hell not?\" and the business about not tolerating intrinsic evil for an hour, what's the matter with stomping it out of existence on the instant? Possibly to folks in the 19th century an hour was an instant.\n \n But, out of this whole rigamarole, I came out with a jimdandy argument of why God simply doesn't exist--even though a lot of folks like having a god around to blame or weakly explain why things are lousy.\n \n If a danged thing is evil, it's evil. Now, you can do the tricky Jesuitical thing and say, \"Well, it's not the slavery itself, it's what slavery causes.\"\n \n But, slavery is a damned miserable state for anyone to be under and it's wrong to impose it on anyone in any century. Now, the human condition is such that us humans have only very recently figured out that BINGO! \n \n SLAVERY IS BLOODY WRONG! We just weren't smart enough to know that before.\n \n Soooo, if there really was a god and the things that are good and the things that are evil have been exactly so forever and eternity, then, why didn't we know way back when?\n \n And, why didn't God tell us and make it plain to us?\n \n My next post will be a boring remembrance about how I arrived at my present state of relative morality.",

If there's no point in telling people that slavery or despotism shouldn't ever be used, if the masses simply aren't ready to extend their morals that far yet, then he calls it an incidental evil, which he'll let slide for the time being. I don't think that's what he meant to say, but from your quote that sounds like what he was actually thinking. He was rationalizing why evils weren't being challanged, even though they were known to be evil. He was playing word games to avoid any fingers of blame being pointed. I'm extrapolating alot here of course, but based on the one paragraph you supplied that's my interpretation.",

   "Intrinsic evil refers to an absolute moral quality of an institution or practise. In other words, it means that in any abstract scenario you place that institution or practise, it will aways be evil. This does not mean that there can be no exceptions, which do not do but confirm the rule. For example, murder is intrinsicly evil (it is an absolute moral evil in all possible abstrract scenarios), but it can be justified in cases such as self-defence. \n \n The institution of slavery is a very complex one, on one hand because it is so ancient, and on the other because it came to be an integral part of Western society for a long time. The Church has always considered slavery as a negative thing, it has, however, distinguished between different brands of slavery. The most basic form of slavery (\"chattel\" slavery) is the one in which a human person is placed in a condition of involuntary servitude, being regarded as an object, and thus susceptible of being someone's property. Ths is an intrinsically evil practise, because it violates the dignity of the human person, making them less than what they are.\n \n There are other forms of involutary servitude, however, that are not intrinsically evil, because they respond to more complicated casuistic circumstances. For example, the limited servitude of POWs or crimminals. \n \n The one we are discussing is of course chattel slavery, possibly one of the most barbaric practises in human history. Slavery was widespread in the Western world when Christianity was born. During the 300 or so years before it became the official religion of the Roman Empire, it is scarcely convincing that the Church would have been in a position that would allow them to force the complete abolition of slavery. After all, during this period, Christians were pursued and enslaved themselves. This circumstance (and the enslavement of Christians) does not mean the Church agreed with slavery. It simply did not have the power to enforce its doctrine. However, the problem was more deep. The institution of slavery was so profoundly embedded in Western civilisation that a complete abolition would have caused a severe social and economic trauma of grand proportions. This is why when the Church became official under Emperor Constantine, that slavery ws not banned altogether. This time also coincides with a moment of enormous expansion of the Roman Empire: there were millions of saves across all the known world, sustaining the economy of the Earth and serving as a security barrier in society's fine cloth. Of course, the Church made efforts to help slaves. The vast majority of churches across the Empire bought and freed slaves, and also encouraged the faithful to free their slaves, or at least treat them humanely.\n \n We must remember that the \"grip\" the Church had on society was never so great that it could simply decree a complete ban on slavery and expect the world to continue normally. If the banning of slavery in the 19th century caused so much death and sorrow (although it was for a just cause), in the 4tth and 5th centuries, when slavery sustained the West, it would have probably caused a complete collapse of our civilisation. This does not mean the government of the Church did not make errors, etc., but it does mean that there never has been a Catholic endorsement of slavery.",

I would like to read the entire letter or make sure that we are reading the entire portion that is relevant. Perhaps someone else can find it here:\n \n http://www.newmanreader.org/index.html\n \n I just couldn't pinpoint my search enough to come up with anything or this site doesn't contain that letter.\n \n Here is Newman's writing on Development of Doctrine if anyone is interested. This may not be his complete writing on the subject:\n \n http://www.newmanreader.org/works/oxford/sermon15.html\n \n Here is relevant information from the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) on the subject:\n \n 1750 The morality of human acts depends on: \n - the object chosen; \n - the end in view or the intention; \n - the circumstances of the action. \n The object, the intention, and the circumstances make up the \"sources,\" or constitutive elements, of the morality of human acts.\n 1751 The object chosen is a good toward which the will deliberately directs itself. It is the matter of a human act. The object chosen morally specifies the act of the will, insofar as reason recognizes and judges it to be or not to be in conformity with the true good. Objective norms of morality express the rational order of good and evil, attested to by conscience.\n \n 1752 In contrast to the object, the intention resides in the acting subject. Because it lies at the voluntary source of an action and determines it by its end, intention is an element essential to the moral evaluation of an action. The end is the first goal of the intention and indicates the purpose pursued in the action. The intention is a movement of the will toward the end: it is concerned with the goal of the activity. It aims at the good anticipated from the action undertaken. Intention is not limited to directing individual actions, but can guide several actions toward one and the same purpose; it can orient one's whole life toward its ultimate end. For example, a service done with the end of helping one's neighbor can at the same time be inspired by the love of God as the ultimate end of all our actions. One and the same action can also be inspired by several intentions, such as performing a service in order to obtain a favor or to boast about it.\n \n 1753 A good intention (for example, that of helping one's neighbor) does not make behavior that is intrinsically disordered, such as lying and calumny, good or just. The end does not justify the means. Thus the condemnation of an innocent person cannot be justified as a legitimate means of saving the nation. On the other hand, an added bad intention (such as vainglory) makes an act evil that, in and of itself, can be good (such as almsgiving).\n \n 1754 The circumstances, including the consequences, are secondary elements of a moral act. They contribute to increasing or diminishing the moral goodness or evil of human acts (for example, the amount of a theft). They can also diminish or increase the agent's responsibility (such as acting out of a fear of death). Circumstances of themselves cannot change the moral quality of acts themselves; they can make neither good nor right an action that is in itself evil.\n \n 1755 A morally good act requires the goodness of the object, of the end, and of the circumstances together. An evil end corrupts the action, even if the object is good in itself (such as praying and fasting \"in order to be seen by men\"). \n The object of the choice can by itself vitiate an act in its entirety. There are some concrete acts - such as fornication - that it is always wrong to choose, because choosing them entails a disorder of the will, that is, a moral evil.\n \n 1756 It is therefore an error to judge the morality of human acts by considering only the intention that inspires them or the circumstances (environment, social pressure, duress or emergency, etc.) which supply their context. There are acts which, in and of themselves, independently of circumstances and intentions, are always gravely illicit by reason of their object; such as blasphemy and perjury, murder and adultery. One may not do evil so that good may result from it.\n \n 1757 The object, the intention, and the circumstances make up the three \"sources\" of the morality of human acts.\n \n 1758 The object chosen morally specifies the act of willing accordingly as reason recognizes and judges it good or evil.\n \n 1759 \"An evil action cannot be justified by reference to a good intention\" (cf. St. Thomas Aquinas, Dec. praec. 6). The end does not justify the means.\n \n 1760 A morally good act requires the goodness of its object, of its end, and of its circumstances together.\n \n 1761 There are concrete acts that it is always wrong to choose, because their choice entails a disorder of the will, i.e., a moral evil. One may not do evil so that good may result from it.\n For a quick and easier to understand summary of intrinsic evil see this website:\n \n http://www.ascensionhealth.org/ethics/public/issues/intrinsic_evil.asp\n \n Some of the things the Catholic Church would consider intrinsically evil--meaning so evil in essence or nature that the good that may come of it, if any, cannot be justified (according to my understanding)-- rape, masturbation, homosexual marriage, abortion, euthanasia, cloning, fetal stem cell research, lying, etc.\n \n Just war and capital punishment would not fall in the intrinsic evil categories. \n \n As for Newman's statements on slavery there are two possibilities that I can see:\n \n 1. He was alluding to the slavery of biblical times that involved indentured servitude as was mentioned in a recent post in the Catholic Church and slavery thread in the religious forum. This would not be intrinsically evil because the person serving has some consent in the matter-paying a debt of some sort.\n 2. He was in opposition to the official Church teaching which was also discussed in the same thread on the religious forum. Objectively evil is synonymous with intrinsically evil:\n \n Then you had the discovery of the New World in 1492 and the Spanish conquering the Aztecs and more of the same. Pope Paul III made it excommunication \"latae sententiae\" for a Catholic to be involved in slavery or the slave trade. In the Papal Bull \"Sublimus Deus\" of June 2, 1537, he taught the universal Church that forced and unjust slavery is objectively evil and from the Devil and he had already reiterated that it was an excommunicable offense in his \"Pastorale Officium\" of May 29th of the same year of 1537.",

   "Actually, the Nazis didn't give choice to Ayrans whether to kill Jews: the weren't arguing for the right to kill Jews in certain circumstances.\n \n There is a relation, as there is between almost any moral dilemmas. I suppose you could see the famous violinist as the Jew leeching off the German Reich. But as the Nazis hunted down Jews rather than killing them if they wouldn't leave, or cutting off their supplies, that doesn't really apply.\n \n Of course, there's also the small issue of what we call a 'human being'....",

   "Maximus, thank you for joining in.\n \n I've referred to Noonan's notes and this is his source for the letters between Allies and Newman:\n \n John Henry Newman, Letters and Diaries, ed. Charles Stephen Dessain (London: Thomas Nelson and Sons, 1976) Vol. 20, 554-556.\n \n Furthermore, when I was a child--and I was a mere child when I heard all these sermons--I was surrounded by a Christian culture that continuously defamed Jews, African Americans, anyone who was not nicely blond, European, etc., etc., sort of the milieu that Hitler grew up in save that my milieu was more Protestant than Catholic, my milieu happened to be in the heartland of the United States. I don't remember at any time any Christian minister or priest speaking out against racism, anti-Semiticism, the evils of calling other ethnic groups by despicable names, I knew them all, by the way as a child--and there was no one there to tell me that this all was wrong.\n \n Let us remember Father Coughlin (Wikipedia):\n \n \n \n Coughlin, sorry that you conveniently forget this, was as profoundly an influence upon the thoughts and minds of Americans as Limbaugh is in this day and age.\n\n I thought we were discussing Newman and intrinsic evil but the debate has spiraled into something else. I don't know Father Coughlin and I have already contributed what I know on Newman and intrinsic evil.",
