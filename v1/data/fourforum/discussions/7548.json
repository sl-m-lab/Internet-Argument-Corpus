Read my dad's article and find out.:) \n \n Here is a link: \n \n http://www.commentarymagazine.com/Production/files/schoenfeld0306advance.html\n\n \n I plowed through most of your father's article. I'm not a lawyer and unable to judge his case law. \n \n For the sake of discussion, let's say the Times did knowingly break a law. It took them one year to break the news, which, as a former corporate officer, would mean the finest legal talent money can buy had opined on releasing it.\n \n If a law had, in fact, been broken, I'd assume the risk of prosecution was deemed favorable, that's first amendment and SCOTUS material, when compared to serving the public by publishing that a standing US president was breaking a well-defined law claiming executive power, or facing possible forced impeachment?. \n \n Is SCOTUS now stacked in Bush's favor or will it ever get there? The attorney general of my country refusing to give sworn testimony to the congressional oversight committee responsible for that AG's adherence to US law? This is almost as hard to swallow as invading a sovereign nation on suspicion of possessing WMDs.",

   "trebor--\n yes, opinion is definitely divided on that question,\n however, the President regularly briefed members of Congress of both parties\n about the program and not one of them objected. So while there can be debate about that, the issue is unclear at best. But what the Times did is not\n unclear--it is an obvious violation of the Espionage Act.",

I bet\n that if you sent in a letter raising those issues, they might publish the\n letter and my dad would answer. \n \n Is that okay?\n \n I'm really sorry because I know that when people ask questions on here, they expect them to be answered on here. But honestly I am not very well equipped to answer your questions, and if you would like to have them answered, my dad would be happy to do so.",
