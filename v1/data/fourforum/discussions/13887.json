   "Thanks for proving my point and giving us just the irrational and dishonest rant which we expected from you.\n\n \n I gave you nothing. You came to this conclusion because it is what you wish to believe in disparity.\n \n \n \n \n As usual you have taken my admission that I was unaware of this specific instance in the NH school because my daughters are grown adults now, to imply that I have admitted somehow that I have no insights at all regarding this very serious issue of the homosexual agenda to indoctrinate our children on a national scale THROUGH OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM.\n\n \n No Archie you stated that you have perceived knowledge of this so called \"indoctrination\". You clearly have none as you post yet again another biased, twisted form of propaganda to demonize gays as a threat to children, or rather to insight such undertones in your post.\n \n \n \n \n Of that issue I am very well qualified to discuss and have started threads about it long before you crawled out of your hole and ended up here.\n\n \n I for one am not a hobbit. And also, you are not qualified. You post biased links, to people who have a deep prejudice and ignorance of gay people, and you clearly have no idea what you are talking about, nor the damage these types of lies you imply have on people.\n \n \n \nHere Jason, educate yourself from a discussion which pitted me against the entire homosexual contingency here, combined, and see if you can defend against the poison and venom which your militant and rabid community represents in its agenda to destroy the innocence of our youth.\n\n \n In your very post you give the true nature of your mindset toward gays.. You find that we are poison, that we are militants, and that we are rabid like some cancer that is spreading.\n \n You also think we have some sort of agenda. So clearly your view has to be backed up by similar links to justify such a stance. And your fringe ideals of gays exactly compliment the very link you provided.\n \n \n \n \nhttp://www.4forums.com/political/gay-rights-debates/10139-gay-agenda-solid-evidence-indoctrination-children-school.html\n\n \n Exactly. Biased. Twisted. Stigma. \n \n \n \n \nAnd I repost my previous post for those who wish to hear first hand recordings of homosexuals saying these things to 14 years olds in class room settings.\n\n \n For one thing Archie not all gays would agree with this even if it were true. You cannot indoctrinate a young person to be gay anymore than you can teach them to be strait. Yet you grasp at some fallacy and some false reality to compliment your underlying prejudice.\n \n \n \n \n Notice the bolded above, that in spite of this undeniable real world evidence, Jason has called me a liar and claimed I am saying things which never happened. \n\n \n Archie you do lie. You distort and twist to serve your ultimate view. The undertones and your tone in the post clearly show your motives behind it.\n \n \n \n \n \nHe constantly proves that he can jam his fingers in his ears up to his knuckles as he rants and refuses to hear the evidence which proves our assertions and very justified concerns are absolutely factually TRUE and UNDENIABLE.:xbanghead\n\n \n Archie I jam nothing in my ears and I have hung upon every single misguided false word in that link provided. The same jargon was played on film in my church during the yes on 8 campaign by the FRC to scare the congregation into thinking their very children were at risk due to gay people.\n \n \n The point being, is you know these things are false, and yet you still propagate it to aid your narrow minded bitter views on gay people. Just like you attack the validity of my faith, you attack the very presence of gays around children and attempt to revive ignorance and distrust to your own pleasure and advantage.",

You still don't get it society and the schools as low as preschool already teach about heterosexuality. Open you freakin eyes preshcoolers are learning about hetero sex every day.
