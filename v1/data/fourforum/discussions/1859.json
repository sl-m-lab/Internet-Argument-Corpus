Either you are being poetic or you fell asleep during the watchtower study. You are a drama queen or a liar. \n \n Now I know this is semantics, but are you disfellowshiped or did you just fade away. Also what is wrong with being the malevolent elitist you claim the watchtower is? People are free to do all kinds of things with their lives and money why does it bother you so? \n \n I swear if one more person tells me about how sweet and jolly God is I and going to be nauseous. He is your God not Santa Claus. Why would anyone get angry at God, when the world is oh so much more tangible?",
