Where are we going there?\n\n I think you pretty much have a picture of what's going on. The Wolfowitz Doctrine and the policies of the Project for the New American Century\n \n http://www.newamericancentury.org/\n \n are still the guiding forces on which the administration bases its actions. However, things are rapidly falling apart and the administration is having a hard time coping with the realities on the ground. They did not plan and the parties involved did not react in the fashion which Wolfowitz predicted (a moribund Arab world rallying around the torch of freedom burning in Iraq) and now we are struggling to formulate a rational course of action. Maybe its time for a fresh prediction\n \n Zac (doesn't think Kerry is that great either)",

   "I long ago reached a point of understanding that there's little difference between politicians regardless of their party affiliations. My only concerns are how they spend my money and what I get in return for it. I've seen nothing but out-of-control spending by this administration, which I voted for, primarily on programs related to their desire to suppress the possibility of unification of nations not supporting our foreign policies. That's been a big backfire by further unifying EC, facilitating China's trade agreements with former USSR States to secure natural resources that provide additional stability to their economic growth and weakening the dollar with deficit spending and tax cuts that effectively reduce tax revenue and frighten any fiscal conservative. I won't get into terrorist victories regarding our civil rights and bleeding us with Homeland Security.\n \n We do need a new plan. I can't see our futile efforts in the Middle East doing anything but continuing the drain on our national wealth. Since the current administration has based their re-election campaign platform on Bush as a war president, that's not going to go away anytime in the near future. This time, IMO, it looks like economics may well determine our direction regardless of who happens to be in office.",
