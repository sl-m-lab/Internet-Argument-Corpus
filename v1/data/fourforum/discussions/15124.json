   "Documents point to ATF \"gun running\" since 2008 - CBS Evening News - CBS News\n \n \nA controversial operation in which U.S. agents were allegedly ordered not to intervene as American guns flowed to Mexican gangs may have been going on for many years, reports CBS News investigative correspondent Sharyl Attkisson.\n \n A photograph obtained by CBS News shows an astonishing display of high-powered weapons put up for suspected Mexican drug cartel gun buyers. It's a rare glimpse into ATF's controversial undercover operations.\n \n The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allegedly let gun runners walk off with weapons - thousands of them - to see if they'd end up in the hands of the cartels. The Justice Department and ATF have denied it ever happened.\n \n Special Agent John Dodson works in ATF's Phoenix office and has blown the whistle on the controversial strategy, known as letting guns \"walk.\"\n \n Dodson believes there are other ATF operations going on that have done the same thing.\n \n Multiple sources now tell CBS News the questionable tactics were used in more than one operation, and date back as far as 2008 in the Tucson area. One case was called \"Wide Receiver.\"\n \n Sources tell CBS News licensed gun dealers often wanted no part of selling to suspicious characters who could be supplying the cartels.\n \n But, sources say, ATF enlisted the gun dealers as paid Confidential Informants and encouraged them to sell even more.\n \n \"ATF has asked me to assist in an official investigation,\" reads one agreement.\n \n Gun salesmen closed the deals, and ATF watched and listened with recording devices.\n \n \"ATF Special Agents conducted surveillance...and identified the dates and times that the conspirators... crossed the international border,\" says one court document.\n \n Dodson argues that something that should never be done. \"A lot people are going to get hurt with those firearms between the time we let them go and the time they're recovered again in a crime.\"\n \n Sources tell CBS News these ATF operations involved about 450 weapons. Despite the risk, two years later the same strategy was expanded to include thousands of guns.\n\n \n This issue is like an onion. The more layers you peel back in the ATF mismanaging the issue, the more it stinks and casts doubt on the validity of the ATF's existence.\n \n Perhaps those you criticized the NRA for trying to cut the ATF's budget through congressional means should apologize for their baseless accusations.\n \n Even Mexico is seeing the light and noting it's the federal government's agents that are responsible.\n \n http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/03/08/ap/latinamerica/main20040828.shtml\n \n \n(AP) MEXICO CITY (AP) &#8212; Legislators from all of Mexico's three major parties in congress are calling for a joint U.S.-Mexico working group to examine accusations that U.S. federal agents allowed hundreds of guns to flow into Mexico.\n \n Congressman Humberto Trevino estimated Tuesday that 150 shooting injuries or deaths have been linked to guns that were allowed to proceed into Mexico as part of a U.S. effort to build cases against traffickers.\n \n Two of those weapons were involved in the killing of a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent in December in southeastern Arizona.\n \n Mexican drug cartels frequently pay straw purchasers to buy weapons at U.S. gun stores and smuggle them south to avoid stringent gun-control laws in Mexico. \n",

   "ATF, DOJ Launch Damage Control Effort Over Growing Project Gunrunner Scandal - FoxNews.com\n \n \nA major scandal is developing around a signature U.S. effort to track and stop the flow of illicit weapons to Mexico, as officials at the Department of Justice close ranks, hoping to cover up an investigation critics say is responsible for an untold number of dead.\n \n The investigation was known as Project Gunrunner -- a joint task force headed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the Department of Justice -- that took place in 2010. \n \n It was conceived after the bureau was criticized for not conducting more complex investigations on straw buyers -- people who were allowed to purchase guns legally in the U.S.-- who illegally transport guns into Mexico and sell them to cartels.\n \n So rather than just take down low-level straw buyers here and there, the agency hoped by &#8216;letting the guns walk&#8217; the sales would lead investigators to cartel members higher up in the organization. \n \n However, whistle-blowers say that never happened.\n \n Already we know the weapons used to kill Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry were being tracked by Gunrunner, but new documents reveal a much bigger problem. \n \n The questions this morning in Washington are how high does this go and will Congress call for a formal investigation of its own.\n \n \"I'm still asking questions and we're getting the runaround from the Justice Department,\" Sen. Charles Grassley told Fox News. \n \n \"They're stonewalling. And the longer the wait, the more they fight, the more egg that they're going to have on their face.\"\n \n Grassley and others say Gunrunner was a dismal and deadly failure, with ATF intentionally allowing thousands of weapons to be illegally trafficked to Mexico. \n \n Here is how sources say it worked: Arizona gun stores sold weapons to suspected straw buyers -- in some cases - 10 - 20 - 30 - AK-47s to the same person over just a few months. \n \n ATF could have said no, or later seized the guns in an arrest. Instead, owners were urged to sell, even though agents often knew the buyer was a straw for the Mexican cartels. \n \n Records show Gunrunner was aware of more than 1,000 weapons sold from 10 Arizona gun stores to roughly 50 straw buyers. More than two-thirds of those guns have already been recovered at crime scenes in the U.S. and Mexico.\n \n \"What people don't understand is how long we will be dealing with this,\" ATF agent and whistle-blower John Dodson said Tuesday. \n \n \"Those guns are gone -- gone. You can't just give the order and get them back. There is no telling how many previous crimes will be committed before we get to them.\"\n \n Privately, ATF agents say Gunrunner &#8220;was out of control&#8221; and deserved to be shut down. But the mistakes made were not intentional and they say there are no limits to the number of long guns (as opposed to pistols or revolvers) a person is allowed to buy. \n \n Therefore, while gun stores had the freedom to sell as many guns as they wanted to any single buyer, at no time did agents tell owners to &#8216;break the law.&#8217;\n \n Already sources say those guns can be traced to hundreds of robberies, rapes and murders. Critics say ATF knowingly allowed those sales to take place and failed to make arrests of known smugglers, thereby intercepting the guns before they crossed the border.\n \n \"They would tell us -- we would say -- 'do you want us to stop selling?&#8230;is there something we should do here? and they would say \"No, no, no -- continue selling -- just tell us after the fact,\" said Brad Desaye, owner of J & G Gun Sales in Prescott, Ariz. \n \n J&G sold 60 guns to alleged straw buyers. ATF agents told him on the phone and in person to let the sales happen. \n \n Dodson, one of seven agents on the Gunrunner task force, confirms that ATF knowingly allowed the sales and did not actively track the weapons, as in a traditional investigation. Instead, it allowed the guns to go south, where they were used in crimes or seized by Mexican police during raids.\n \n Until now, administration officials blamed Mexico's drug violence on Arizona and border state gun shops, repeatedly making the false claim that 90% of the guns recovered in Mexico were sold in the U.S.\n \n Now Desaye, paraphrasing Second Amendment activist Jeff Knox, says, \"the truth is coming out. It's becoming obvious the largest supplier to Mexican gun violence is ATF, not the dealers. And they are using us as scapegoats.\"\n \n Carolyn Terry, the stepmother of murdered Border Agent Brian Terry also blames the ATF. \n \n \"I think they put those guns out there and they lost them and now one of our own has got killed with one and they have made a big mistake and the government hates to make mistakes,\" says Terry. \"You would think such a murder and killing would make an impact and that they would revise their policy or at least review their policy and we have no indication that is the situation.\"\n \n Sen. Grassley says ATF isn't the only guilty agency. He says Department of Justice lawyers and agents from Homeland Security also watched this debacle unfold, often hand in hand with ATF.\n \n Grassley has lengthy correspondence and numerous documents he wants to post on the Senate Judiciary website, but sources on the Hill say Judiciary Chairman Pat Leahy won't allow it, refusing to call for an independent congressional investigation.\n \n \"The only reason this is going to be fair, the only way the Terry family is going to get the explanation that is owed to them is if there are independent hearings,\" says Dodson.\n \n \"I'm not satisfied with the inspector general there doing the investigation; to me it looks like a fox guarding the hen house,\" echoes Grassley.\n \n As the scandal began to draw more media attention, the chief of Public Affairs at the ATF in Washington issued this memo February 28 to media relations staff throughout the agency. Critics say it's evidence the agency is trying to hide, or at least distract the media, from reporting on Project Gunrunner.\n \n \"ATF needs to proactively push positive stories this week in an effort to preempt some negative reporting, or at a minimum lessen the coverage of (Project Gunrunner) in the news cycle by replacing them with good stories about the ATF.\"\n \n On Wednesday, the National Rifle Association also called for expedited congressional hearings on firearms trafficking enforcement tactics used by the ATF. In a letter to Grassley and Sen. Patrick Leahy it stressed the need for investigation into the responses by the ATF and DOJ about the Gunrunner program.\n\n \n Article\n \n \nWASHINGTON &#8211; Senator Chuck Grassley today said that he did not have confidence that the Justice Department Inspector General&#8217;s office could produce a report that the public would view as frank and unbiased in its investigation of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) policy of letting guns &#8220;walk&#8221; along the Southwest border&#8212;a policy that may have contributed to the death of a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agent. \n \n In a letter today to Kevin Perkins, the head of the Integrity Committee of the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, Grassley cited several conflicts that lead him to believe that the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Justice cannot be seen as completely disinterested and independent.\n \n &#8220;There are certainly better and more independent ways to conduct this investigation. To have an acting Inspector General&#8217;s office lead an investigation like this one just won&#8217;t pass the smell test,&#8221; Grassley said. &#8220;The fact that the Inspector General did not take this whistleblower&#8217;s allegations seriously enough to even call him back raises a lot of red flags for me.&#8221;\n \n Grassley&#8217;s concerns outlined in his letter are:\n \n 1. The Inspector General position at the Justice Department is currently vacant. Any acting Inspector General is ill-equipped to take on an entrenched bureaucracy and challenge senior officials with tough questions.\n \n 2. The Justice Department Inspector General&#8217;s office was made aware of the allegations brought forward by ATF Agent John Dodson shortly after Customs and Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry&#8217;s death. The Inspector General failed to respond to Dodson&#8217;s numerous attempts to contact the office until Grassley&#8217;s staff notified the office.\n \n 3. ATF officials have cited an Office of the Inspector General report as one of the factors that prompted the shift to a riskier strategy of letting guns be trafficked rather than arresting straw buyers.\n \n Grassley began looking into allegations brought forward by Dodson, and more than a dozen other ATF agents, after the Justice Department Inspector General failed to investigate. The agents indicated that their supervisors kept them from stopping gun traffickers with the normal techniques that had been successfully used for years. They instead were ordered to only watch and continue gathering information on traffickers instead of arresting them as soon as they could. In the meantime, the guns were allowed to fall into the hands of the bad guys even as agents told supervisors that it could not end well. Many of the guns have subsequently been found in firefights along the border, including a December 14, 2010 firefight where Terry was killed. \n \n Grassley&#8217;s requests for information have gone unanswered about what transpired at the ATF and the Department of Justice during the time when Terry was killed and the policies instituted during Project Gunrunner that allowed guns to be sold to known straw purchasers and moved across the border without intervention.\n\n \n Perhaps the ATF fan boys should apologize to Agent Terry's family for not allowing this corrupt organization to be dismantled earlier on. Maybe the Brady Campaign can supply Terry's family with funding to help cover the expenses his death has resulted in.",

   "Oh this is just getting better. The feds have busted a police chief and a mayor for taking part in trafficking firearms to Mexico. The fox is really guarding the hen house alright.\n \n Federal gun raid leaves border town without mayor, police chief - CNN.com\n \n \nThe mayor, police chief and a village trustee in the New Mexico border town of Columbus have been charged along with eight other defendants with buying firearms for illegal export to Mexico, federal authorities said Thursday.\n \n An 84-count indictment accuses the 11 of being what authorities describe as a gun-trafficking ring. The ring bought guns \"favored by the Mexican cartels,\" such as American tactical 9 mm pistols and the so-called \"AK-47 pistols,\" which are weapons resembling AK-47 rifles but with shorter barrels and without rear stocks, U.S. Attorney Kenneth J. Gonzales of New Mexico told CNN.\n \n In a phone interview, Gonzales said authorities seized 200 such firearms, allegedly purchased illegally using \"straw\" buyers, and intended for sale in Mexico. He added that 1,500 rounds of ammunition were also seized.\n \n Authorities say much of the Mexican drug cartel violence is carried out with weapons originating from the United States.The indictment alleges that 12 firearms previously purchased by the defendants were found in Mexico and were traced back to them, authorities said.\n \n \"I couldn't tell you for sure that the firearms would ultimately be put in the hands of people who were going to hurt other people, but because we believe the firearms were destined for Mexico, we feel we made a big difference today,\" Gonzales told CNN.\n \n Arrested Thursday were Columbus Police Chief Angelo Vega, 40; Mayor Eddie Espinoza, 51; and village trustee Blas Gutierrez, 30, said Gonzales, who added the town's population was about 2,000 people.\n \n As of late Thursday, no attorneys had entered appearances for any defendants, who all were in the custody of the U.S. Marshal, said spokeswoman Elizabeth Martinez of the U.S. Attorney's office in New Mexico.\n \n They and seven other defendants were arrested by federal and local authorities Thursday, and all but one of them were arrested in Columbus, Gonzales said. The 11th defendant, Ignacio Vallalobos, 24, of Columbus, remained a fugitive and is facing two counts of firearms smuggling and a conspiracy charge, authorities said.\n \n \"Presumably these folks are engaging in this activity because there is money to be made,\" Gonzales said. \"We're very disappointed that we have among these 11 people three people in government positions -- a police chief sworn to protect the public and a mayor sworn to lead and provide for the public safety and a village trustee that has that duty as well.\"\n \n Authorities also conducted searches at eight residences, a business and even the Columbus Police Department, authorities said.\n \n \"That was part of the tragedy here -- we're actually having to search a police department,\" Gonzales said. He didn't know what was seized from there Thursday.\n \n Because the small town of Columbus has only a four-member police force, including the chief, Luna County Sheriff Raymond Cobos told CNN Thursday that his deputies were now providing police patrols.\n \n But the sheriff has told Columbus officials that their police department could no longer use the same radio frequency as the county, to ensure the integrity of local law enforcement.\n \n Sheriff Cobos said the remaining three members of the village board were now running the town, and he was in negotiations with them to take over police protection.\n \n \"It's right across the border from Puerto Palomas (Mexico) and they have a history of street violence down there that include daylight assassinations, kidnappings, shootings and one of the last incidents down there was finding three heads in a gazebo in the town plaza,\" Cobos said.\n \n When asked about how the federal raid left the small town without several top officials, the sheriff said: \"I haven't seen anything like this before. Whatever comes up, we take care of it the best way we can. We're meeting with other state officials to see what we can come up with\" regarding public safety in Columbus.\n \n Between January 2010 and March 2011, the defendants allegedly bought about 200 firearms from Chaparral Guns in Chaparral, New Mexico, which is owned and operated by Ian Garland, 50, who was also arrested and is facing several charges, authorities said.\n \n The defendants allegedly claimed they were the actual purchasers of the firearms, when in fact they were acting as \"straw purchasers\" who were buying the firearms on behalf of others, authorities said.\n \n The indictment came after a year-long federal investigation and was part of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force, a program targeting the most serious drug trafficking, weapons trafficking and money laundering organizations, and those responsible for the nation's illegal drug supply, authorities said.\n \n During the investigation, law officers also seized 40 AK-47-type pistols, 1,580 rounds of 7.62 ammunition, and 30 high-capacity magazines from the defendants before they crossed the U.S.-Mexico border, authorities said.\n \n No weapons were knowingly permitted to cross the border, authorities said.\n \n \"Identifying and arresting individuals involved in criminal activities, especially weapons and drug trafficking, in our homeland is a national security priority for ICE,\" Manuel Oyola-Torres, special agent in charge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in El Paso, Texas, said in a statement.\n \n All 11 defendants are charged with one count each of conspiracy to smuggle firearms from the United States to Mexico. If convicted of this charge, each defendant could receive a sentence of five years of imprisonment and a $250,000 fine, authorities said.\n \n Some of the defendants also are charged with making false statements in connection with the acquisition of firearms. Conviction carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine, authorities said.\n \n Some of them are charged with unlawfully concealing and facilitating the transportation of firearms knowing that the firearms were intended for exportation from the United States, authorities said. The maximum penalty for that offense is 10 years of imprisonment and a $250,000 fine, authorities said.\n",

   "ATF, Mexico, guns: Mexico lawmakers demand answers on guns smuggled on ATF's watch - latimes.com\n \n \nReporting from Seattle and Mexico City\n Lawmakers in Mexico are demanding an investigation into a U.S. law enforcement operation that allowed hundreds of weapons to flow into the hands of Mexican drug cartels amid claims from a ranking legislator that at least 150 Mexicans have been killed or wounded by guns trafficked by smugglers under the watch of U.S. agents.\n \n U.S. authorities say manpower shortages and the high number of weapons sold resulted in their losing track of hundreds of guns, from pistols to .50-caliber sniper rifles, though a federal agent deeply involved in the Phoenix-based operation said it was \"impossible\" that U.S. authorities did not know the weapons were headed for Mexico.\n \n The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has acknowledged that at least 195 weapons sold in Arizona under Operation Fast and Furious have been recovered in Mexico, traced as a matter of routine via serial numbers after their recovery from crime scenes, arrests and searches.\n \n The Mexican lawmaker did not say how the new casualty statistics were calculated. But the estimates, which could not be independently confirmed, provide troubling new fallout from an investigation in which guns sold to suspected smugglers in the U.S. already have been linked to the deaths of two U.S. law enforcement agents.\n \n Humberto Benitez Trevino, a federal deputy who chairs the justice committee in the lower chamber of Congress, the Chamber of Deputies, said in comments released by Congress this week that \"we have 150 cases of injuries and homicides with arms that were smuggled and passed illegally into our country.\"\n \n Benitez said the figure came from \"sources,\" but he did not specify who the victims were or where shootings took place.\n \n \"This was an undercover program that wasn't properly controlled,\" Benitez said.\n \n A U.S. law enforcement official on the border, who is a defender of the ATF program, said he didn't know how Mexican officials came up with the casualty figure. \"It's probably just a good political thing to say, and how are you going to refute it?\"\n \n Nevertheless, the new information is bound to complicate U.S.-Mexico relations at a rocky time. Mexican President Felipe Calderon is already upset at U.S. Ambassador Carlos Pascual over a series of leaked diplomatic cables citing shortcomings in Mexico's 4-year-old war against drug cartels.\n \n Mexican politicians have criticized the ATF program as a violation of Mexico's sovereignty and evidence of U.S. arrogance toward its southern neighbor.\n \n Lawmakers from all of Mexico's main political parties have demanded to know whether Mexican authorities were aware of the program.\n \n \"This is a serious violation of international law,\" said lawmaker Carlos Ramirez Marin, a member of the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party and president of the Chamber of Deputies. \"What happens if next time they need to introduce trained assassins or nuclear weapons?\"\n \n The Mexican Senate wants the nation's ambassador to the U.S., Arturo Sarukhan, to return from Washington to discuss the matter.\n \n The new claims came amid growing demands for an independent investigation in the U.S.\n \n In Washington, Senate investigators are trying to determine whether the gun used in the attack that killed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jaime Zapata in February - purchased at a Texas gun store in October - was smuggled into Mexico by buyers who were under investigation by ATF agents.\n \n U.S. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has asked the ATF why the purchasers of the gun used in the attack on Zapata were not arrested in November, a month after they bought the weapon.\n \n \"After the delivery of the illegal weapons, the three men were stopped by local police. Why were these traffickers not thereafter arrested in November?\" Grassley said in a letter to the agency, which asked whether the gun made its way into Mexico after this initial contact with law enforcement agents.\n \n \"Naturally, this raises questions about whether the ATF strategy of allowing [smugglers] to continue to operate in hopes of making bigger cases may have contributed to the shooting of ICE Agent Jaime Zapata.\"\n \n Thomas Crowley, ATF spokesman in Dallas, said it was not known when the gun was transferred to Mexico.\n \n But John Dodson, an ATF agent in Phoenix who worked on the Fast and Furious effort and became alarmed enough to alert Senate investigators, said in an interview that the number of guns sold to known traffickers under the eyes of the ATF was so large that it was \"impossible\" the agency didn't know the weapons were going to Mexico.\n \n \"The day I started, there were 240 guns they had let ... out of Fast and Furious,\" he said. \"Guns they were purchasing were showing up on both sides of the border already.\"\n \n \"I mean, ... a guy comes in and purchases 10 AK-47s, and four of them he purchased last time have already shown up on the other side of the border? And you keep going?\" Dodson said.\n \n Dodson said the operation was based on a strategy change ordered by Washington in September that directed agents to go after not just low-level purchasers but high-level buyers in the cartels.\n \n A copy of the strategy, obtained by The Times, specifies that the operation was to mainly involve sharing of intelligence across a wide variety of U.S. law enforcement agencies along with specially vetted units of Mexican law enforcement. But it envisioned the movement of weapons across the border.\n \n \"The controlled movement of firearms, ammunition, explosives, explosives devices, and/or components or non-functional 'props' of such items across the U.S.-Mexico border from the United States shall be coordinated with and approved in advance by Bureau headquarters and the MCO.\"\n \n Dodson said the number of guns sold under the investigation grew dramatically - exceeding 1,500 by October - and none of the traffickers were being arrested.\n \n \"You keep hearing, 'It was a sting operation gone bad.' Or, 'We lost some guns.' That's not it. It was intentional and deliberate,\" Dodson said.\n \n \"We watched these people,\" he said. \"We knew before they were going, we watched them get the money, go buy the guns, we watched them take them out of one vehicle and put them in another one in a parking lot, and we watched one guy go home and the other guy go south. And we couldn't do anything about it.\"\n \n Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said Thursday he was taking \"very seriously\" the concerns expressed by some ATF agents over the investigation and has asked the inspector general to \"get to the bottom of it.\"\n \n \"I've also made clear to people in the department that letting guns walk ... is not something that is acceptable,\" Holder said in response to questions from Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) at an appropriations subcommittee hearing. \"Guns are different than drug cases, or cases where we're trying to follow where money goes.\"\n",

   "Are our governments becoming a real problem?\n \n   Is it gun shops, gun shows or government that is 'chief source of weapons?' \n Yesterday, a federal grand jury indicted Mayor Eddie Espinoza, Police Chief Angelo Vega, Trustee Blas Gutierrez, all of Columbus, NM, (<== That would be the state of New Mexico) and eight others including Gutierrez' wife, Eva on charges of gun trafficking. Court documents obtained by this column allege that approximately 200 firearms were purchased by the suspects over a 14-month period, running from January 2010 to this month, and that several of those firearms have been recovered by authorities in Mexico. Authorities in that country are \"distancing themselves\" from the growing scandal over gun trafficking, as reported by the McAllen, TX Monitor\n \n To keep this in perspective, that pales in comparison to perhaps 2,500 guns allegedly allowed to enter the illicit gun trade under the Project Gunrunner/Fast-and-Furious operation in Arizona, an operation that has become the center of a scandal now under investigation by Iowa Sen. \n \n Still, the press seems content to focus on the myth of \"American guns flooding Mexico\" rather than the facts about how a lot of them apparently got there. \n\n \n Seems to me that if we can get governments and the ATF out of the gun running business, then gun owners would have a pretty good name.

   "Things just keep getting worse.\n \n Mexico guns: Mexico says U.S. never told it tracked guns were passing border - latimes.com\n \n \nReporting from Mexico City --\n Mexican authorities say they were aware of the U.S. anti-gun operation that allowed smugglers to buy weapons under the watch of agents in the United States, but that they had no idea that the program allowed weapons to be smuggled into Mexico.\n \n In a statement issued late Thursday, Mexico's federal attorney general's office said Mexican officials were advised of operations north of the border against suspected traffickers. But the Mexican agency said it \"had no knowledge of the existence of an operation that might include the transgression or controlled trafficking of arms to Mexican territory.\"\n \n The attorney general's statement said Mexico would never have given permission for weapons to enter the country as part of Operation Fast and Furious, under which U.S. agents permitted the purchase of weapons to build more sweeping criminal cases against crime bosses.\n \n \"The government of Mexico has not given nor will it give its authorization, tacit or express, under any circumstance, for that to occur,\" the agency said in the most extensive comments the government has offered on the matter so far.\n \n A statement issued by the U.S. Embassy here Thursday said American officials had kept Mexican counterparts informed \"as plans unfolded on operations in the United States\" through Jan. 25, when 20 suspected weapons traffickers were arrested in Arizona. On Friday, the embassy said there was \"no contradiction\" between the Mexican statement and information provided by American officials.\n \n The 15-month operation, carried out by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, became public after guns sold to suspected smugglers in the U.S. turned up at the scene of the fatal shooting in December of a Customs and Border Protection agent, Brian Terry.\n \n Some ATF agents were already alarmed as evidence mounted of weapons making their way into the hands of drug cartels in Mexico.\n \n At least 195 weapons sold in Arizona have been recovered in Mexico, and one ranking Mexican congressman claims the smuggled guns have been tied to the injuries or deaths of as many as 150 people.\n \n Angry Mexican politicians from across the spectrum have blasted the U.S. effort as a violation of their country's sovereignty. Lawmakers have called for investigations and hearings into whether Mexican officials were aware of the program.\n \n The Mexican statement praised U.S. Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. for launching an investigation into the operation. Holder said that \"letting guns walk ... is not something that is acceptable.\"\n \n But in the United States, there are concerns about Holder's decision to delegate to the Justice Department's inspector general responsibility for conducting the probe, already underway. One of the key ATF whistle-blowers to have complained about the gun-running operation was ignored when he originally sought the inspector general's intervention.\n \n In a letter this week to the integrity committee of the Council of Inspectors General, U.S. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who is probing the Fast and Furious operation as the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the Justice Department's own role in supervising the operation must also be part of the investigation.\n \n \"Given that the [inspector general's office] initially failed to follow up, it might have an incentive to minimize the significance of the allegations in order to avoid the appearance that its own inaction contributed to the problem in the last few months,\" Grassley wrote.\n",

   "And things just keep getting worse...\n \n \"Gunwalking\" scandal final straw leading to resignation of U.S. ambassador to Mexico - CBS News Investigates - CBS News\n \n \nThe U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Carlos Pascual, has resigned under pressure.\n \n In recent weeks, Mexico's President Felipe Calderon has said in public he doesn't trust Pascual (seen at left). Several sources close to diplomatic circles inside Mexico tell CBS News that from Mexico's viewpoint, the ATF \"gunwalking\" scandal was the final straw in a series of controversies.\n \n First, Pascual has been dating the daughter of a mistrusted and alleged cartel-linked opposition legislator.\n \n Second, Pascual's critical views of Mexico in secret U.S. diplomatic cables were leaked on WikiLeaks several weeks ago. In one cable, Pascual said Mexico had turned a blind eye to U.S. leads on how to capture drug lords.\n \n More recently, Mexico has demanded information from the U.S. on the ATF controversy revealed by CBS News, in which ATF agents allegedly allowed thousands of weapons to cross the border, supposedly in a failed attempt to gain intelligence to take down a major drug cartel. Some Mexican legislators have publicly said ATF agents who crafted and carried out the strategy could be extradited to Mexico and arrested. The legislators quote ATF agent John Dodson, as interviewed in our report.\n \n Published reports, including one in the Miami Herald, quote the White House as recently having said U.S. officials thought the tiffs would blow over.\n\n \n Justice Memo to Self: No Gunwalking Allowed - CBS News Investigates - CBS News\n \n \nCBS News has obtained an internal message sent from the Justice Department to Southwest Border US Attorneys last week.\n \n It reads, in part: \"We should not design or conduct undercover operations which include guns crossing the border. If we have knowledge that guns are about to cross the border, we must take immediate action to stop the firearms from crossing the border, even if that prematurely terminates or otherwise jeopardizes an investigation.\"\n \n Holder: Gunwalking is wrong\n \n The proclamation is important because agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms claim that in recent years, they were ordered to do exactly what the message says should not be done: let thousands of guns \"walk\" across the border into the hands of Mexican drug cartels in an attempt to gain future intelligence.\n \n A CBS News investigation revealed that numerous ATF agents in Phoenix, Arizona vehemently objected to the gunwalking strategy over the course of a year, saying it was unprecedented and extremely dangerous; but they say they were rebuffed. Some of them believe they were transferred or lost their jobs because of their objections.\n \n Gunrunning scandal at the ATF\n \n Initially, ATF leaders and the Justice Department appeared to deny that any gunwalking ever happened. Then, ATF Special Agent John Dodson spoke to CBS News on camera and gave details of the gunwalking he says he took part in and witnessed \"almost daily for months\" as part of Operation \"Fast and Furious.\"\n \n Agent: I was ordered to let U.S. guns into Mexico\n \n The Justice Department touts \"Fast and Furious\" as a successful counter-trafficking operation that ultimately indicted 20 defendants. However, the round-up of the Fast and Furious defendants whom ATF had been watching for many months only happened after the murder of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry last December. Two assault rifles that ATF allegedly let \"walk\" a year before were found at Terry's murder. Hours after Terry was gunned down, police rushed to arrest the suspected trafficker who they knew had purchased the rifles and had been under ATF surveillance for over a year. Shortly thereafter, they arrested other suspects in the case. However, the ATF press conference and indictment in Fast and Furious made no mention their connection to Terry's murder, or that ATF had allegedly watched weapons \"walk.\"\n \n It was Agent Dodson and other insiders who blew the whistle on ATF's connection to the Brian Terry murder case.\n \n AK47s vs. bean bags in border drug war\n \n Attorney General Eric Holder has now referred the controversy to the Justice Department Inspector General for an investigation. Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) has asked the investigation be moved to another body, citing conflict of interest. Sen. Grassley's ongoing information requests from ATF and the Justice Department dating back to January have gone unanswered. The House Judiciary Committee has also sent the Justice Department a letter asking for more information. And the government of Mexico has asked for a full briefing from the U.S.\n \n Sen. Grassley asks for investigation\n \n DOJ responds to Sen. Grassley\n \n Several insiders reacted to the Justice Department's directive on gunwalking by telling CBS News they found it stunning that the Department is iterating a policy that should go without saying, and should be as intuitive as \"don't rape or murder.\"\n \n When answering questions from Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) last week, Holder said, \"The mission of ATF is to stop the flow of guns into Mexico and to people who shouldn't have guns here in the states. ATF has served greatly here and in Mexico... Letting guns 'walk' is not something that is acceptable. Guns are different than drugs or money when we are trying to follow their trail. That is not acceptable. We cannot have a situation where guns are allowed to walk. And I made that clear to the US Attorneys and to the agents in charge of various ATF offices.\"\n\n \n ATF gunwalking scandal: Second agent speaks out - CBS Evening News - CBS News\n \n \n(CBS News) \n \n WASHINGTON - South of El Paso, Texas, on Mexico's side of the border, lies Juarez - the most dangerous city in the world. CBS News investigative correspondent Sharyl Attkisson reports ATF Special Agent Rene Jaquez has been stationed there for the past year, trying to keep U.S. guns from being trafficked into Mexico.\n \n \"That's what we do as an agency,\" Jaquez said. \"ATF's primary mission is to make sure that we curtail gun trafficking.\"\n \n Video: Mexico assignment \"most dangerous in the world\"\n \n Video: ATF agent describes dangers of \"gunwalking\"\n \n That's why Jaquez tells CBS News he was so alarmed to hear his own agency may have done the opposite: encouraged U.S. gun dealers to sell to suspected traffickers for Mexico's drug cartels. Apparently, ATF hoped that letting weapons \"walk\" onto the street - to see where they'd end up - would help them take down a cartel.\n \n Gunrunning scandal uncovered at the ATF\n \n Jaquez is so opposed to the strategy, he's speaking out. \"You don't let guns walk. I've never let a gun walk.\"\n \n Yet ATF agents told us they were ordered to let thousands of weapons walk. Two of them, assault rifles, were later found at the murder scene of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in Arizona last December. Another gunrunning suspect under ATF surveillance was linked to the shooting of Customs Agent Jaime Zapata. And sources say many more \"walked\" weapons turned up at Mexican crime scenes.\n \n Agent: I was ordered to let U.S. guns into Mexico\n \n Jaquez said, \"I think this incidence is probably one of the darkest days in ATF's history.\"\n \n But ATF wasn't working alone on the case known as \"Fast and Furious.\" Documents show ATF had conference calls with \"DHS\" (Homeland Security). \"USMS\" (U.S. Marshals) and DEA. An \"ICE,\" or Customs agent, was on ATF's Fast and Furious team. They were advised by an \"AUSA,\" or Assistant U.S. Attorney under the Justice Department.\n \n AK47s vs. bean bags in border drug war\n \n Justice Department head Eric Holder said the inspector general is investigating. \"The aim of the ATF is to try to stop the flow of guns. I think they do a good job in that regard. Questions have been raised by ATF agents about the way in which some of these operations have been conducted. I think those questions have to be taken seriously, and on that basis, I've asked the inspector general to look at it.\"\n \n Holder: Gunwalking is wrong\n \n Jaquez is second sitting ATF agent to come forward and speak out to CBS News on the controversy.\n \n Jaquez says one of the most difficult things for him is believing that his own agency inadvertently put innocent lives at risk. Jaquez has family - uncles, aunts, father and sister - living in Mexico. \"Any one of us could have been shot with one of those guns.\"\n \n Video: NRA members \"outraged\" over \"gunwalking\" reports\n \n Jaquez says he's left wondering whether runaway violence in Mexico can be partly blamed on the agency tasked with stopping it.\n\n \n How much more are we going to take before we stand up and say enough already? How much longer is the ATF going to receive federal funding for breaking the law?",

   "NRA reacts to CBS News investigation on ATF \"gunwalking\" - CBS News Investigates - CBS News\n \n \nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) has asked Congress to investigate allegations that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) allowed thousands of weapons to cross the US border into Mexico, knowing they were likely to be acquired and used by Mexico's drug cartels.\n \n Wayne LaPierre, Executive Vice President of the NRA, told CBS News that his group has heard from many of its law enforcement members who are outraged at the so-called \"gunwalking\" by ATF.\n \n \"They wanted to prove that there were guns flowing to Mexico, so they set up an illegal pipeline to send guns to Mexico,\" speculates LaPierre. \"When does it stop being law enforcement and start being a criminal enterprise? To prove there's islamic terrorists are they going to start manufacturing and selling explosives? It just makes no sense.\"\n \n It was ATF agents from the agency's Phoenix office who blew the whistle on the controversial practice to CBS News, to Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), and on blogs such as \"Clean Up ATF\". The gunwalking was allegedly allowed in a case known as \"Fast and Furious\" out of Phoenix, and also allegely allowed in a case known as \"Wide Receiver\" out of Tucson and supervised by Phoenix.\n \n Phoenix ATF executive Bill Newell is quoted as having told reporters \"Hell, no\" when asked if he had ever allowed or approved gunwalking. Since then, ATF and the Department of Justice which oversees the agency have not repeated the firm denial. Justice Department Chief Eric Holder told Congress two weeks ago that the idea of gunwalking is wrong and said he's asked the Inspector General to investigate.\n \n As to why guns would be allowed to walk, something that is normally strictly forbidden, agents say there seemed to be an idea among supervisors that the strategy of letting guns walk to see where they'd end up in Mexico would somehow help them build a big case and take down a major cartel. They were never able to take down a cartel, but the weapons began showing up at crime scenes all over Mexico. Two of them were found at the murder of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in December. Authorities are looking for possible links to the death of Customs Agent Jaime Zapata.\n",

   "Stop putting guns into hands of 'narco-terrorists' - The Hill's Congress Blog\n \n \nThe United States/Mexico border is a lawless warzone controlled by violent drug cartels. More than 34,000 people have been murdered in Mexico since the narco-terrorists began their reign of terror in 2006. Drugs and people are smuggled north into the United States and guns and money are flowing south, enabling the drug cartels to continue to wage their violent war.\n \n Weapons from the United States reach the outlaws in Mexico, mostly because Mexico does not protect its own border any better than we do. Recent whistleblower allegations claim that tactics of the United States government, through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), may be contributing to the problem of delivering weapons to the criminals in Mexico, rather than trying to fix it. I am deeply concerned about this.\n \n Part of ATF's mission is to protect American communities from \"the illegal use and trafficking of firearms.\" Put simply, part of ATF's duty is to make sure guns don't end up in the hands of the bad guys. Through the program \"Project Gunrunner,\" ATF uses electronic tags to trace gun movements on both sides of the border. What has been alleged, however, is that while the program has been successful in apprehending weapons and criminals, too many guns have been intentionally let go into the hands of Mexican drug lords when it is almost guaranteed that the guns will be used in violent crimes.\n \n We know about these allegations through a whistleblower, an ATF agent who recently came forward with troubling allegations that he was ordered by his superiors not to intercept weapons that were sold to \"suspicious characters,\" including well-known gun suppliers for Mexican drug cartels. And that's not all -- the whistleblower alleges that ATF's Phoenix Field office knowingly allowed and facilitated the sale of over 2,500 firearms in 'straw man purchases' destined for Mexico. According to these allegations, one well-known trafficker, Jaime Avila, was allowed to purchase 3 assault weapons in Glendale, Arizona on January 16, 2010. It is also alleged that at least one of the gun dealers tried to stop selling to Avila; however, ATF asked him to continue selling guns to this criminal.\n \n What happened next is deeply troubling. Avila went back to Mexico with the guns he had purchased and sold them to the drug cartels. The weapons travelled freely through the streets of Mexico for nearly a year. During that time, Avila continued to purchase more weapons, sending them from the United States into Mexico. We have since learned that 2 of the 3 weapons purchased by Avila were recovered at the murder scene of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. Apparently ATF let 2 guns get sent down into Mexico, and as a result an American citizen and federal government employee was murdered.\n \n The murder of Brian Terry is concrete proof that ATF's system is flawed and dangerous. While Jaime Avila was arrested the day after Brian Terry's murder, the question is, why wasn't he apprehended during the 11 months before when we knew he was up to no good? Project Gunrunner is a sting operation with no sting. Guns are handed to the criminals when we know they will be used for harm. It seems that the ATF just sits back and waits to see what happens.\n \n If these allegations are true, we have much cause for concern. It is my understanding that ATF has denied these allegations. Senator Grassley of Iowa has requested more information from the various agencies involved in investigating Agent Terry's murder. I've been told that one letter that the Senator received back denied that ATF \"knowingly allowed the sale of assault weapons to a straw purchaser\" and stated that ATF makes \"every effort to interdict weapons that have been purchased illegally and prevent their transportation into Mexico.\" However, the documentation provided to Senator Grassley, including copies of ATF's national tracing center records, seem to tell a different story.\n \n As this investigation continues, we are left with a murdered Border Patrol Agent and his grieving family who is searching for answers. Carolyn Terry, mother of Brian Terry said, \"I truly feel that our son's death is a cover-up and they hope that we will go away. That will not happen. We want to know who allowed the sale of that gun that murdered our son.\" The Terry family deserves to know the truth. As members of Congress, it is our job to demand a full investigation of this murder since the Department of Justice is blissfully silent about whether or not they will investigate the ATF. Agent Terry is one of many unsolved American murders in the ongoing Drug War along the Third Front, the border.\n \n The Judiciary Committee should look into this matter to see if the ATF is contributing to the gunrunning problem in Mexico or not. Congress needs some answers. One murdered agent is one too many. In my opinion, the ATF is playing with fire.\n \n And that's just the way it is.\n",

   "ATF gunwalking: Who knew, and how high up? - CBS News Investigates - CBS News\n \n \nSince our first report in which ATF agents told us they allowed thousands of weapons to cross into Mexico, one crucial question has been: Who knew -- how high up? This week for the first time, President Obama addressed the controversy. It was in an interview Tuesday evening with the Spanish language network Univision.\n \n \"Well first of all I did not authorize it. Eric Holder the Attorney General did not authorize it. He's been very clear that our policy is to catch gun runners and put 'em into jail,\" Mr. Obama said of the controversial ATF operation called \"Fast and Furious.\"\n \n \"You were not even informed about it?\" asked Univision reporter Jorge Ramos.\n \n \"Absolutely not,\" said Mr. Obama. \"There may be a situation here which a serious mistake was made and if that's the case then we'll find out and well hold somebody accountable.\"\n \n But who? In an exclusive interview with CBS News, the lead ATF official in Mexico at the time Darren Gil says somebody in the Justice Department did know about the case. Gil says his supervisor at ATF's Washington D.C. headquarters told him point-blank the operation was approved even higher than ATF Director Kenneth Melson.\n \n \"Is the director aware of this,\" Gil asked the supervisor. Gil says his supervisor answered \"Yes, the director's aware of it. Not only is the director aware of it, D.O.J.'s aware of it... Department of Justice was aware of it.\"\n \n Gil goes on to say senior Justice official Lanny Breuer and several of his deputies visited Mexico amid the controversy last summer, and spoke to ATF staff generally about a big trafficking case that they claimed was \"getting good results.\" Gil says Melson, ATF's Acting Director, also visited Mexico City. Gil's Deputy Attache and his Analyst questioned Melson about the case that surrounding all the weapons showing up in Mexico. \"His response was 'it's a good case, it's still going on,'\" recalls Gil, \"and we'll close it down as soon as we possibly can.\"\n \n As to what Melson, Breuer and the other officials knew, Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) has been asking. Among other things, he has told the State Department to turn over notes and records from any Breuer visits to Mexico City in summer of 2010. But his repeated requests have so far been denied. And the officials mentioned would not speak with CBS News.\n \n The whole controversy was exposed last month when ATF agent John Dodson and others blew the whistle to CBS News. They told us they were ordered to let assault rifles and other weapons \"walk\" into the hands of Mexican drug cartels in a failed attempt to take down a cartel.\n \n But if Justice Department officials knew, it's even more incredible when you find out who didn't: ATF's own agents in Mexico.\n \n Gil first found out something was amiss in early 2010 when serial numbers from a flood of guns used in cartel crimes were all tracing back to the same case in Phoenix: \"Fast and Furious.\" But when Gil's analyst checked ATF's computer files to find out more, he hit a brick wall.\n \n \"Not only did he not have access, I as the attache, the head agent in Mexico for ATF operations, did not have access,\" says Gil. He was locked out.\n \n That was a red flag because Gil says as the senior ATF official in Mexico, it was his job to approve any ATF operation involving Mexico; and he didn't approve this one.\n \n In fact, Gil specifically emailed his staff on Jan. 25, 2010 that no firearms would be allowed to cross into Mexico for a case without his approval. The email also stated that if he ever approved such an operation, he'd make sure the weapons were \"stopped on the Mexican side of the border.\" They'd never be allowed to \"walk\" or reach the streets.\n \n Gil didn't know it but even as he wrote that email, ATF agents in Phoenix have told CBS News they were already letting traffickers move weapons to Mexican drug cartels without stopping them. The idea was apparently to see where the guns would end up and try to build a big case.\n \n Faced with the flow of guns and the serial number evidence tracing to Phoenix, but locked out of the computer case files, Gil says he repeatedly questioned his supervisor in Washington. He says some of the conversations became screaming and shouting matches. He says he was instructed not to tell his Mexican counterparts about the case. Gil said he inquired, \"when is this case gonna shut down? The Mexicans are gonna have a fit when they find out about it.\" Gil says he also noted \"at some point, these guns are gonna end up killing either a government of Mexico official, a police officer or military folks, and then what are we gonna do?\"\n \n Gil is the second ATF agent to tell CBS News that he specifically warned of such an outcome. Agent John Dodson says he told his superiors in Phoenix much the same.\n \n \"I specifically asked one time, 'are you prepared to go to the funeral of a Border Patrol agent...are you prepared for that fact because it's only a matter of time before that happens,\" Dodson told CBS News.\n \n That's exactly what happened. Two of the weapons, AK-47 variant assault rifles, were eventually found at the murder of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry last December. Officials are looking into possible connections to the murder of Customs Agent Jaime Zapata in February.\n \n Gil retired from ATF in December, in part over his objections to Fast and Furious and the way it was handled. He says he's speaking out because nobody else in charge has stepped up to explain that ATF agents in Mexico were never part of it. Yet they're now facing threats of prosecution from some Mexican politicians.\n \n \"The (Mexican) government's looking at (ATF agents) potentially bringing weapons into their country, which in many cases is an act of war.\" Gil says by not explaining that ATF agents in Mexico weren't part of Fast and Furious, ATF executives are putting the agents in danger. \"They're leaving my guys out in Mexico alone, and they're not doing the right thing.\"\n",

   "  Mexican attorney general says \"full force of law\" to be used in ATF gunwalking scandal investigation\n \n The Office of Mexico's Attorney General has issued strong, new comments in response to ATF Gunwalking allegations exposed in an ongoing CBS News investigation. \n \n As we have reported, agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms say over the course of a year and a half, superiors ordered them to allow thousands of weapons to cross into Mexico as part of a failed plan to gain intelligence and take down a major drug cartel. \n \n Over the weekend, the Mexican attorney general stated: \"The controlled trafficking of weapons is not authorized under the Mexican national legislation. An operation that would contemplate this would not have been acceptable to the Mexican government, and it will never be under any circumstance.\" The Mexican Attorney General also stated that it's conducting its own investigation to identify \"the crimes that could have been carried out on Mexican territory.\"\n\n I can't say that I blame them. If the Mexican government did that to us, I would want some butts too. And I would also be willing to do down to Mexico to collect them personally! This is really bad, and the antis are trying to lay all of this on our doorstep!!!",

Nothing worse than a corrupt gov't agency and even worse when it is associated with law enforcement.\n \n What did the administration know and when did they know it!\n \n Also, Mr. Trump wants to see Mr. Obama's bona fides...",
