   "There are several characteristics of the series presented in this release that limit their suitability for some types of economic analyses. (1) The denominator for the weekly earnings series is the number of private nonfarm production or nonsupervisory worker jobs. This number includes full-time and part-time jobs as well as the jobs held by multiple jobholders in the private nonfarm sector. These factors tend to result in weekly earnings averages significantly lower than the corresponding numbers for full-time jobs. (2) Annual earnings averages can differ significantly from the result obtained by multiplying average weekly earnings times 52 weeks. The difference may be due to factors such as turnovers and layoffs. (3) The series are the average earnings of all production or nonsupervisory jobs, not the earnings average of \"typical\" jobs or jobs held by \"typical\" workers. Specifically, there are no adjustments for occupational, age, or schooling variations or for household type or location. Many studies have established the significance of these factors and that their impact varies over time.\n\n \n LT\n you should also keep in mind that the 1982 dollars are a normalization and the relative change measured between the two latest years.\n look at table 2 comparing Mar05 to that of 04, the average hourly changed from $8.23 (04) to $8.19 (0.5). thus the analysis would be\n 1. cannot assess actual buying power without additional information, especially back to 82.\n 2. as the economy expand and more jobs are created, newer jobs would be lower paying than high paying ones (as managements tend not to lay themselves off during lean times, and will rehirelower wage earners when times are better)\n \n i don't think that report can really say much about either the over all state of the US economy or the plight of labor, and not nearly as much as the over all employment figure because even a poorly paid job is still better than no jobs at all.\n \n i shudder to think what the numbers would be for Europe or Canada.\n \n edit: lo and behold, found this after i posted.\n \n \nThe American job market may finally be catching up with the economy's growth.\n \n The Labor Department reported Friday that U.S. nonfarm payrolls grew by 274,000 jobs in April, beating prognosticators' average forecast by nearly 100,000, according to a Dow Jones Newswires/CNBC poll. That wasn't all. Job gains for March were revised to 146,000 from an initial estimate of 110,000 and payrolls for February were revised to show an increase of 300,000, better than the 243,000 reported earlier. The average monthly payroll gain so far this year is 211,000, about what the U.S. economy needs to add to show the recovery remains on track.\n \n In addition, the unemployment rate, which comes from a smaller survey of households, held steady at 5.2%. And inflation pressures in the jobs report were mild: average hourly earnings rose five cents, or 0.3%. to $16.00, counterbalancing concerns after Thursday's report on worker productivity showed rising labor-cost pressures in the first quarter.\n \n All in all, it's the best job-market news we've had in a while.\n \n The payroll data are considered the tail-end indicator of growth. Basically, jobs are about the last thing companies want to add, just as payrolls tend to be the first thing cut in a downturn. As a lagging indicator of where U.S. growth stands, the payroll numbers point to recent corporate optimism and necessity. There is only so much a company can do in terms of cutting costs and boosting productivity before it needs to hire more people to meet projected demand.\n \n The report may help vindicate Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's decision to focus on inflation worries instead of recent indications of a soft patch in the economy. But the question remains whether demand can be sustained at a healthy job-creating pace in the face of persistently high energy costs and rising interest rates. That falls largely on the shoulders of U.S. consumers, whose spending is a pillar of the economy that continues to hold steady.\n",

The US employment rate has steadily dropped from 74,1% in 2000 to 71,22% in 2003. From an international perspective, this is still a (very) good figure, but I wouldn`t call it job gain. Perhaps the labour market has recovered some in 2004 though (I couldn`t find any figures).\n \n Edit: Part time employment as a percentage of total employment rose from 12,64% to 13,32% (not a dramatic shift).

However, in order to better under understand this one has to examine the national debts of each nation to the GDP of each. And then one has to examine the deficits and the rate of increase from year to year. \n\n \n Naturally. Decifits as well as governmental debt must be viewed in relation to the size of the economy. GDP is an adequate tool to gauge this size IMO (even though should bear in mind the flaws of this tool when making corss-country comparisons).\n \n \n And do not forget that the U.S. lost nearly 1/10 of its GDP following 9/11 as that amount of economic fallout ensued coming on the heels of the recession that had just gotten under way. \n\n \n Every country suffer from recessions and economic schocks from time to time. Germany has for example been in one since the re-unification of eastern- and western Germany. Allthough I strongly doubt that \"US lost 1/10 of it`s GDP\" following 9/11... I actually think US GDP grew in 2001...\n \n \n\"France and Germany have significant problems with unemployment. It is nearly twice that of the U.S.\n\n \n This is true. Germany have had a stagnating employment rate around 65% for more than a decade. France has had a very slow increase in employment rates since 1990 (also end up around 65%). Unempoloyment figures are close to 10% in both countries.\n \n \n Much of Europe is modeled after the socialist or welfare states or the \"cradle to the grave\" strategy of looking out for its citizens. Many believe that is the correct way of governance. However, the statistics give strong evidence that that string has just about played out especially with Germany's recent performance.\n\n \n Not really. Statistics say very little about the economic success in maintaining comprehensive \"wellfare states\". A comparison between USA and France might yield a certain result, but a comparison between Chile and Norway would yield a completly different.\n \n But as for Europe vs USA\n During the 90-ies, USA had a very strong economic performance while many countries in europe experienced grave schocks to their economies (for example; the re-unification of Germany, the economic downfall of Soviet Union and later Russia, the liberalisation of international monetary trade and the death of the monetary snake). Between WWII and the 90ies, Europe was on average catching up to US productivity and GDP/capita and had many countries with substantially higher employment rates/lower unemployment rates than the US. A shift occurred while Clinton was president.\n \n It is also interesting to note that the size of the government and ambition of the \"wellfare state\" is correlated to economic \"success*\" if making a comparrison between european countries alone. But this is really another topic I guess (but interesting nonetheless).\n \n * by success I mean low unemployment, high productivity/capita and international competativity",

Between WWII and the 90ies, Europe was on average catching up to US productivity and GDP/capita and had many countries with substantially higher employment rates/lower unemployment rates than the US. A shift occurred while Clinton was president.\n\n in an economic race/competition. one that allows deficit speding to get out of a rough spot could provide a lead that the other cannot make up later.\n \n \n \nFor commerce, yes, all that counts is the margin spread. When you have some time, perhaps you can explain how a government with a GDP composition exceeding 80% of public and consumer spending, internal transactions with no value added, a substantial trade imbalance and doesn't reduce that public spending number by annual public debt can display real growth. And you also seem to be overlooking massive debt service on deficit accumulation that produced no real growth now clocked as public spending. That type of analysis would jail a corporate officer of any public corporation. \n\n you are fixated on outcome measurements of an economy that is evolving.\n we have moved past an agrarian economy through an industrial economy into one that values human service rather than material constructions and sales.\n the biggest threat to the economy is the growing personal debt at bad rates rather than the federal deficit.\n sure the federal deficit ties up resources and capital but this is more theoretical than has been the practical reality as the economy continues to hum along, at least using the same set of criterias we have been using.\n but i'd like to know more about \"debt service on deficit accumulation that produced no real growth now clocked as public spending\" . provide a link or is that too much to ask.\n afaik debt payment and other mandatory outlays are not counted in the public spending sector of the budget\n \n \nI normally don't respond to your posts because you seemingly support current administration policy to a point of blindness, but this issue covers administrations back to the 1980s.\n\n the feeling is mutual actually. you seem to fail to address the points raised beyond calling others brainwashed, and simultaneously refuse to provide evidence of your stance and ultimately come accross as countering the administration policies out of blind spiteness.",

   "Naturally. Decifits as well as governmental debt must be viewed in relation to the size of the economy. GDP is an adequate tool to gauge this size IMO (even though should bear in mind the flaws of this tool when making corss-country comparisons).\n \n \n \n Every country suffer from recessions and economic schocks from time to time. Germany has for example been in one since the re-unification of eastern- and western Germany. Allthough I strongly doubt that \"US lost 1/10 of it`s GDP\" following 9/11... I actually think US GDP grew in 2001...\n \n This is true. Germany have had a stagnating employment rate around 65% for more than a decade. France has had a very slow increase in employment rates since 1990 (also end up around 65%). Unempoloyment figures are close to 10% in both countries.\n \n Not really. Statistics say very little about the economic success in maintaining comprehensive \"wellfare states\".

   "Georged\n \n let me take this opportunity to clarify my words, then we'll get on with the argument.\n firstly.\n federal debt is divided into two part, that held by the government and that held by the public. government debt is an internal matter, as when the government takes money from unspent social security taxes to use for non social security functions. this debt only affect the future when it has to be paid. if social security intake exceed that of intake, this repayment can be put off. as far as i know this is not being repaid at the moment. the second part of the federal debt is referred to as public debt. this exist in the form of treasury bills primarily, in essencec an IOU by the government to the holder of the bills. \n as of 2004 the total deficit is 7.379 trillions, 3.072 of which is held by the government and 4.307 of which is held by the public. The feds have had a deficit since 1835.\n when i said \"public debt\" i was not referring to the ownership of IOU from the government by the public, i meant that the public, as in consumers, owed with regard to credit cards and other personal loans. i should have more accurately referred to this as \"consumer debt\".\n so lets then look at the concern regarding federal debt own by (not owed by) the public. and by public it also include banks, corporations, state and local governments, and the average citizen investors. the concern here is that instead of spending money on ways to stimulate the economy, the money is \"locked\" into the deficit. however, lets also consider that many, individuals as well as financial investment companies, treat this as the preferred investment as a guaranteed of future return is very reassuring. this money is would not have gone into the general economy as it was not heading that way anyway. secondly about 20-25% of the \"public\" debt is held by foreign entities and they do so also because of reliability of a future return. would they have invested in US companies instead? why didn't they do so to begin with?\n \n certainly it would be better to opperate without a deficit.\n but as to its actual impact on the economy is still theoretical for the following reasons.\n 1. 180 years of deficit and we are still growing. afaik there has been little direct correlation between a high deficit and poor economic growth. most periods of high deficits were during wars, the civil war, ww1, the depression, ww2, vietnam, WoT.\n 2. would the public actually put money into the economy instead, rather than say precious metals or beneath the mattress? theoretical at best.\n \n  it is interesting that by \"privatizing\" social security, even a portion of it, more money is directed to the economy and less is available for the government to \"borrow/steal\" from\n \n but \"consumer debt\" is a horrible thing because a massive lost of personal wealth is at risk, as well as financial viability of the financing institutions.\n \n LT\n the portion of spending by the US government toward repaying debt is <10% of its budget",

   "certainly it would be better to opperate without a deficit.\n\n \n That's not inherently true. A deficit means that gov't is spending more then it takes in. Even if the MPC was .1 that would mean for every $100 billion spent by the gov't, $110 billion is actually added to spending. Of course we likely have something close to .6-.8, which at .8, the multipler becomes 5, meaning evert $1 billion spent by the gov't leads to $5 billion in consumer spending. Good way to stimulate the economy. Of course this can easily lead to inflation.

   "Forgive me for my ignorance, but how do you estimate actual production?\n\n \n As I recall, you take nominal GDP and remove inflation from the base year and a number of other factors.\n \n \n\n Ok. If you say so. I thought the theory of crowding out effects regarding decifits was generally accepted.\n\n \n Definitely. At a point crowding out will occur. There's no doubt about that. The private sector almost always produces much better stuff with funds then the public sector does. But at what point does that occur? I'm not arguing that the theory is wrong, I'm just saying that it occurs as a certain threshold. We might just see that in our lifetimes with the way this adminstration and Congress is going. Hopefully some real evidence of crowding out can be found. If I had to bet, I'd say there are some signs of it now, seeing how the deficit is around $600 billion when you remove SS IOUs. \n \n \n\n And therefor decifit spending is inherantly bad, no?\n\n \n Deficit spending is inherently bad during times of neutral or good economies. But during times of recession? I don't know about that. \n \n \nHmmm.. Keep in mind that english is not my first language. Our notations and abbrevations are rather different from yours :p \n\n \n Sorry, SAS is short run supply, LAS is long run supply. \n \n \n\n With words I can always find out by looking up the definitions. I can`t do that with combinations of letters ;)\n\n \n lol. alright. \n \n Okay let my try it this way. The Long run aggregate supply is usually seen as a vertical line somewhere on a graph where the Y axis is price level and X is GDP. (for some reason economists are sadistically and label GDP as Y). Anyways, the AD curve and Short run aggregate supply intersect with the LAS line at point. That is known as the for this purpose, as the polential GDP. Now, often the SAS and Ad intersect somewhere else, either to the right or left to the LAS line. If they intersect at somewhere on the left, the gov't can deficit spend to push both of the curves (SAS indirectly) to intersect at one pt on the LAS line. Deficit spending can move the economy (which is real GDP), which has a unemployment rate higher then the natural, to polential (the intersection of all three lines). Then we get natural unemployment and the economy is right where it wants to be. This is good for the country. I can see deficit spending there as a good idea.\n \n HOWEVER, there's a huge problem with that. It assumes that you know where the LAS line is. If the gov't spends too much they may cause a rise inflation. If they spend to little, they won't achieve the result they want. That is why IMO, fisical policy as a means of getting out of a recession is for the most part, a huge load of ****.",

It takes industrial expansion to create that demand and the US is a mature, declining industrial power migrating to a service economy. National debt service capability and inflation will be major issues long before the US standard of living declines to a point where demand for private capital can be generated.",
