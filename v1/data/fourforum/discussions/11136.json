That humans have inherent dignity and value at every stage of life. \n \n This is transcendent of whether they are conscious or unconscious and it is why we treat 24 week premies who have no real conscious existence and a 30 year old automobile accident victim in a coma on a respirator and you and me the same. So strongly do humans recognize this inherent dignity that even in death a person is dignified with a funeral ceremony recognizing their life had inherent meaning and value. We build memorials to those who were victimized in life.",

Would you be willing to discuss such ideas?\n\n \n I've had debates with pro-choicers who have insisted that the soul doesn't enter into a baby until it breathes its first breathe. Can you see from a statement like that why it's so hard to respect the opinions of people with such shallow and vacuous opinions? They also believe somehow that until a child breathes its first breathe, it can't be called or considered a PERSON. They also believe that until a baby breathes its first breathe, it isn't alive.\n \n These beliefs are not only vacuous and illogical but are completely ignorant and without any merit from a rational or common sense perspective. It is totally reasonable to believe and understand that not only is a fertilized egg ALIVE, but that it contains the SOUL of the individual it will become, from its very conception when it starts to grow into the unique individual it will one day grow into. \n \n If this weren't true then children would be virtual clones of their parents rather than unique and independent individuals. They would reflect exactly half of each of their parents and they would show no new traits apart from what their parents have between them. But in reality, 2 very simple people can give birth to a genius and 2 Physicists can birth a simpleton. Just as 2 criminals can birth a future cop, and 2 laborers can birth a future Professor.\n \n So, yes; I believe that the soul enters the new life at fertilization when the egg starts to grow into a unique human being. And that is why I belief it is a life with value as a human being even though it hasn't fully developed enough yet to live outside the womb on its own. The argument that it doesn't qualify for personhood because of that fact is totally bogus and irrelevant to me because it doesn't speak to the person that the child is in reality. \n \n I mean, if a 4 month old fetus is dismissed as a non living being based on its state of current development and what it can do by itself; then what more can a newborn baby do that the 4 month old fetus can do apart from breathe on its own? Beside that one ability, the newborn is no more independent than the fetus. Yet none here, hopefully, will deny the newborn the right to life as they would so easily, the 4 month old fetus. \n \n That's why considering the potential of the unborn fetus is valid, because if we will reject that as a consideration, then why would we invest so much into the future potential of our born children? How shallow is it to limit our ability to love our children only after birth while considering them nothing more than lumps of tissue while they are developing and growing into the people they will be?",

I understand discussing this issue is important, and I understand that both sides of the issue have deeply felt beliefs. So, in my estimation, it would help to be as respectful as possible (even if/when the respect isn't returned). Some people do really want to discuss this important issue. Some, unfortunately, do not.\n \n Can I give you an example of what I am talking about? You posted the following:\n \n \nWhat's a ZEF? Is that another secular humanist term that's intended to marginalize the unborn babies that pro-abortionists endorse killing to the tune of 1.4 million a year?\n\n It seems to me that the initial question was fine. But you added that second question which was rhetorical (rather than interrogatory) and unnecessary, and came across as inflammatory. You added the second part before the OP even had a chance to answer. So right away the conversation is established on somewhat disrespectful and downright silly grounds.\n \n \nI mean, have you ever heard of the word ZEF?\n\n It is short-hand for zygote/embryo/fetus. I think the Colonel should have answered your question, and the fact that he didn't might indicate that he is not really interested in discussing the issue with you. And, given the rest of the responses made in this thread, I think it just might be the case that he is not really interested in discussing the issue at all. That is, of course, his prerogative. You don't necessarily make yourself or the pro-life \"side\" look well by continually engaging him with what amounts to nothing short of name calling.\n \n Now, personally, I think this thread should be kept on topic. No one is prohibited from starting their own thread discussing whatever they like. It would be interesting to have a discussion about the thread's topic, which is eloquently and succinctly stated in its title: \"How important is the soul to pro-life views?\"\n \n I maintain that it is not important to the pro-life argument.",
