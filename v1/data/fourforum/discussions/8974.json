   "Voting against gay marriage is not the same as beating gay people or telling them they are inferior.\n\n To be explicit, I wasn't saying that at all.\n \n I was actually personally thinking (and I know I've said this before) about the issues of gay adoption, gays in the military, gay employment, gay housing, etc...\n Personally, on the specific \"gay marriage\" front, if somebody votes against gay marriage and ALSO refuses to allow gays a similar means like \"domestic partnership\", then it is an example of \"telling them they are inferior\".\n It's the same as saying \"Straight relationships deserve recognition, based only on the request of the straight couple (getting married), while gay relationships do not deserve that opportunity\".\n \n If you see another possibility of that scenario which doesn't boil down to that, then please explicitly explain.\n \n \n \nThat may make a good political tool to give that impression, but it doesn't mean it really flies.\n\n Again, I wasn't saying what you replied to.\n \n \n \nPeople should vote their conscience. It's part of our democratic process. Doesn't mean they hate you.\n\n I never said that means they \"hate\" me.\n You keep trying to work the word \"hate\" into the conversation. It would be more accurate if you would avoid that, as I am not using that word.\n \n And more to the point, you didn't answer my questions...\n (And as an acknowledgement, I took off \"violence\" because I think you were getting confused on the implications of that word in that phrase...)\n \n \n In your opinion, what does \"lead to discrimination\"?\n \n Why do some people go the extra step from just \"not agreeing\" to actively campaigning and voting against gay equality?",

   "No - but those who vote against gay marriage and are against housing/adoption/employment protection and who use violence all use the same justifications. It's immoral, abhorrant, unnatural, against God, etc.\n\n \n I don't see that it matters regarding \"justification.\" It's the action that matters. If I choose not to shop at a store because the clerk ticked me off, I may be using the same justification for that as a guy who torches the store and burns it down. That doesn't mean I've done anything wrong by not shopping there just because my justification happened to match the one the arsonist had. Justification isn't an issue.\n \n \nShould it? I really question whether your personal conscience should be what drives your vote for things that do not impact yourself.\n\n \n So you think people shouldn't be involved in anything that doesn't affect them?

   "Can you give me an example of \"misunderstanding\" that doesn't involve bigotry?\n\n \n I was using misunderstanding and bigotry as interchangeable. I have no problem with your view and concern that some things can lead to discrimination. I just think that we need to be careful not to assume any form of disagreement whatsoever will do so. And frankly even if it does (though it can't be proven), that's tough. People have to be free to have their views, and when those views are bigoted it's ok even if there's the possibility that those NON-bigoted views might lead others down the road to think discrimination might be ok in some cases. What others do with the fact I disagree isn't my problem, it's theirs. They're responsible for that, not me. So, take your blame game to the people that need to hear it.\n \n \n1) Jyoshu. Even the \"bigotted\" ones can be said to \"see the situation differently than I\".\n\n \n Yes but that's not the same as saying those who see the situation differently are bigots. Do you see the difference? Bigotry is disagreement, but disagreement isn't necessarily bigotry.\n \n \n2) Regarding NON-marriage issues, where people want to discriminate against gays, do you see any situations where it's NOT a case of bigotry and just a case of \"see the situation differently than you\". If the latter, please elaborate.\n\n \n No, in cases where they want to discriminate (at least in your view of what's discrimination in this case), I'd say marriage is the only such example. However I do believe that people can disagree with you, that's not bigotry, and who also wouldn't want discrimination put into place. For instance, you well know that I believe gay sex is immoral, but it's not bigotry that is behind that belief (rather religion) and I have no desire to see you discriminated against via, say, sodomy laws.\n \n Stances on these issues can get complicated.\n \n \n \n3) I have admitted that the marriage issue has some complexity in it regarding perspectives. And that is why I allow for some who do not want gay marriage, but want to give \"domestic partners\" or some similar means for gay marriage under a different name.\n\n \n Well, that's me. :) \n \n \nRegarding those who do not want gay marriage, and actively campaign and legislate against civil unions, do you see any situations where it's NOT a case of bigotry and just a case of \"see the situation differently than you\".

Bigotry is disagreement, but disagreement isn't necessarily bigotry.\n\n Actually, although I probably would have phrased it slightly differently (quibbling over using a different word than \"is\" for the first part), that was key to my point.\n \n Regardless, just to make plain my position, I don't define bigotry based on JUST disagreement. To me, bigotry involves a step significantly larger than just disagreement. Bigotry exists when one group of people want to discriminate against another group of people whereas their rights and privileges are restricted.\n \n \n \nI'm not sure about this one. I know for a fact there are plenty of people that oppose gay marriage out of non-bigotted views. I'll have to think some more on that one.\n\n In a LOT of the anti-gay marriage legislation, the wording crosses a line in saying that not only will \"gay marriage\" be not legally recognized, but ALL OTHER FORMS of gay unions will not be legally recognized.\n \n I also recognize that this \"legislation\" is written by some people, and that different versions of the legislation are not up to \"popular vote\". Ergo, John Q Public can't vote between the above, and a different legislation that just says \"gay marriage\" will not be legally recognized.\n \n I say this to acknowledge the existence of a gray area for John Q Public.\n \n But for the \"some people\" who support the legislation as excluding BOTH gay marriage AND gay unions, AND they don't want people to have a choice between the two versions, THAT is something I do see as bigotry.\n And moreover, it should be noted that writing the legislation against \"recognizing\" gay unions has much debate as to whether or not it could be used to invalidate things like a gay couple's \"living will\", created independently of any \"union\". That some have argued the legislation should be used to invalidate ANY sign of recognizing the EXISTENCE of the relationship, even if the \"sign\" is something promulgated by the COUPLE and not the state...\n \n I may be digressing...",
