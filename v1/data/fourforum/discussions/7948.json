   "I have been busy lately. I picked up a USA Today from weeks ago. It said and I quote from the Iranian President, \"The United States, The Worlds only Superpower, continues to bully us and is keeping us from achieving nuclear power.\"\n We are a bully? I don't think so. We might have bullied a country once or twice. Cough Cough.\n But, we are trying to use diplomacy, inspectors, and every other thing right now to get the truth out of Iran. We are trying to make sure Isreal is safe. For god sake, Iran said Israel should be blown off the map. This makes me suspicious.\n America is maybe a bully with countries sometimes. In my view, we control the world pretty much. We have a pretty good grip on every country. We solved the North Korea standoff with sanctions, Iran is under the threat of a strike on it's nuclear plants, and so on. We just have a grip on the world. We might bully some countries, but some of the time, our intentions are good and have clear reason.\n Iran said we are the only superpower. Well, duh. No effin duh. When the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics began to crumble, the former communist states began to declare their independance. Kazakastan, Ukraine, and Georgia all gave up their nuclear weapons to Russia, (my home and native tongue) and we had less nuclear influence.\n Russia has been dismantling half of it's stock since Bush and Putin signed that reduction thing. Russia does not have the capability to nuke every country in the world like the Amerikans do.\n The Amerikans can strike any country in the whole world, shoot a nuke into space, and fire a nuke under water. But most of all, they can fire a nuke at any country in the world. This applies to the term super power. Also, a suerpower has world influence and a huge block of allies.\n Russia when the soviets lost their grip, lost this title.\n The Iranians on the other hand, wonder why we are depriving them of the future of nuclear research, bomb making, or even nuclear power production. Well, doesn't take Einstein to figure that out. Iran has had problems for years. Iran has supported terrorism for years, and in my opinion is Isreals worst enemy. I along with many fear their weapons production could lead to a nuclear war if not taken care of before they produce a bomb.\n See, Iran talked about blowing Israel off the map. Theoretically, if Iran nuked Israel, this would probably lead to nuclear war. Israel is very small. If a nuke was dropped on it, half if not more would be dead. This would make the Amerikans and some of the European nuclear powers retaliate against Iran.\n I got this pretty figured out in theory, but if the Iranians stopped and thought for one second, they would realize our reasons for ban.\n I understand this is a big step for them. The exploration of anything nuclear is a huge step for any country.",

However, I must say I think what you said in your third paragraph to be really foolish.\n \n Book: The Arab-Israeli Wars by Chaim Herzog\n \n pg. 151\n \"The morning of 5 June 1967 found Israel's armed forces facing the massed Arab armies around her frontiers. Israel's citizen army had been quietly and efficiently mobilized over several weeks to defend the country against the impending Arab attack which every Arab medium of mass communicaton announced was imminent.\"\n \n pg. 340\n \"In November 1980, Israeli diplomats in the UN annouced that Israel now supported Egypt's proposal with regard to establishing a nuclear-free-zone in the Middle East as expressed in a debate during the 29th UN General Assembly session.\"\n \n \"The New York Times, reporting from Vienna, added: 'Although Iraq has renounced nuclear weapons by signing the [Non-Proliferation] Treaty, western officials have expressed growing concern in recent months that it may be secretly attempting to develop an atomic bomb.'\"\n \n You are very correct in how Israel attacked first in the Six Days War, but they were going to be attacked and they were very sure of it. Instead of waiting for the enemy aircraft to become airborne they made sure they never got into the air. In fact pilots for the enemy aircraft were en route vie bus and other transportation in order to begin an operation to attack Israel.\n \n You are also correct about the 'offical nuclear power plant' However, I cannot believe that Sadamn would have just let it be a nuclear power plant. I could quote some more entries from this book about the reaction of both sides, but I'm kinda tired and have assignments due tomorrow for college.",

That is a land feud. However, Israel is there now and there is no turning back from them occupying that land. However as to that estimate of a 1000 to one thats a bit over the top and exagerated. I do agree with you that if Israel went to withdraw to their *natural* borders they would still be attacked. However, Israel isn't committing a genocide on the palestinian people, thats just an exageration. I could just as easily say the whole Arab world is commiting a genocide on the Israel people. But I don't say that. emoticon_xangel \n \n Also I can see your point about the information given on Areil Sharon and Hamas. However, the palestinians leaders have allowed terroist attacks for years and have been linked to many weapon trades. emoticon_xkill",

   "[QUOTE=MTKnight]They illegally invaded and are now illegally occupying land? That is a land feud. However, Israel is there now and there is no turning back from them occupying that land.

However, Israel isn't committing a genocide on the palestinian people, thats just an exageration. I could just as easily say the whole Arab world is commiting a genocide on the Israel people. But I don't say that. emoticon_xangel [/qoute]\n \n The actual number is 1074-1. In the not too distant past, israel was routinely carrying out massaces where 40,000 or more palestneians were killed in a single incident. \n \n Hopefully you didn't say that the entire Arab world was commiting genocide against the israeli people because it woudl be an absolutly rediculous claim. Every nation in the Middle East has offered Israel normalized relations in return to them withdrawing back to their leagle borders, and israel has refused. They prefer to fight their war, which they can use as an excuse for their complete and utter failure as a nation.\n \n More Jews were killed by zionist terrorists during the formation of israle than have been killed by palestnains since. \n \n To put things in perspective, when adjust fro scale (population size) what the israelis have done to the palestnians makes what hitler did in his death camps look like nothing.\n \n \nAlso I can see your point about the information given on Areil Sharon and Hamas. However, the palestinians leaders have allowed terroist attacks for years and have been linked to many weapon trades. emoticon_xkill\n\n \n So we should support Sharon and paint him as some kind of unifying force, despite the fact that he as the bloods of literally tens of housands of palestenian civilians on his hands, but point at Hamas and claim that they are devisive and unreasonable beacause they,. as an organization, have been responsible for possibly as many as 3000 israeli deaths?",
