No. At the very least, they should have written such sentiments to leaders in Washington rather than the soldiers. \n \n Kids are extremely impressionable.

Are you kidding me? Do we just say \"there was a disagreement between the north and the south and they decided the south should stay part of the union? How do you teach history without teaching wars? I think school should be a place where kids are presented with different opinions. If you want to bring in a soldier or former soldier to present that point of view, that's great. As long as you don't say that war is bad or war is necessary. As long as you stick to the facts (war is where people kill other people, some use it as a means for solving disputes, etc) and state opinions as such (some believe we should never go to war no matter what and others think war is fine as a means of solving a dispute) then I think they should be presented with both. Opinions are a necessary part of school just as I think that if schools were truly religion-free people would be much less prepared for the world. As long as opinions are presented as such and they are given different points of view, I think kids should be presented with opinions, that's how their own opinions form and how they grow intelectually.",

I am currently in 10th grade. Up to 12th grade is as far as a person has to go, and it's important that they know about war because they will encounter the topic on a daily basis. Wars happen and people need to know why, how they are started, the results, and differing opinions based on war (some are pacifists, some believe war is a common problem-solving technique between countries). People need to not only learn facts but how to think in school. The way to do that is to present them with all sides of the topic and allow them to decide for themselves.",
