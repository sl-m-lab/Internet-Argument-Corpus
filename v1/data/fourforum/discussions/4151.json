   "Martha Stuart is in prison because she is a fealon. She did something stupid, and is paying the price. \n \n From a practical standpoint, insider trading, especially on the scale we are talking, is no big deal. If she had admitted what happened and played the \"I didn't know it was wrong\" game, she would have paid a fine (probably less than the money she had made) and that would have been the end of it, except that she may have had to testify against her broker (insider trading fro a broker is a little bigger deal). \n \n It was not he action that got her in trouble, it was the coverup. I have no idea what in the world she was thinking. All that existed was a little storm to be ridden out, and instead she tried to lie her way out of it and got caught (apparently because her lies were pathetically transparent).\n \n She was correct when she said that the whole thing was just a \"small, personal matter\". That is all it was to start with. Unfortunatly, SHE turned it into a major federal case.",

   "It does seem thought that Stewart was more serverly punished then other corporate leaders who have committed fraud, or other quasi legal activities.\n\n \n \n That is because she crossed the line from \"quasi legal\" to entirely illegal, and she did it in such a manner that she handed the evidence to the prosecution on a silver platter.\n \n In the US, personal responsibility has disapeared from corporate officers. Unless you can prove an overt criminal act, personally carried out by the officer in question, there is really no hope of a conviction. It is the \"just a cog in the bigger machine\" defense.\n \n Corporate officers know this, and generally avoid personally doing anything illegal (i.e they send somebody else out to dump the toxic waste on the schoolyard). I think that when they actually DO catch a corporate officer in the middle of something they can prosecute them for, it gives the prosecutors and the judges a woody.\n \n Also, I think in this case the relatively small scale of the thing worked against her. If she had admitted to it up front, apologised and played \"gee, I really didn't think that classified as insider trading\", she would have paid a fine of around $10,000.00, had to do some community service, and that would have been it. she would have still made/saved $40,000.00, even with the fine. I think that to the prosecutros and the judge, the fact that somebody who has millions of dollars was willing to obstruct justice and lie to investigators in order to save 10 grand showed a pretty low level of respect for the law.",
