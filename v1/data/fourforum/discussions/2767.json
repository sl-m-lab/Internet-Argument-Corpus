   "REPUBLICANS' ABOLITION PLATFORM\n \n In the mid-1800's the Republican National Convention makes the abolition (elimination) of slavery a key plank of the newly-created party's platform. Republican Abraham Lincoln is the first President to meet with a group of African-American leaders. Shortly afterwards, Republican Joseph H. Rainey becomes the first African-American congressman\n \n \n DEMOCRATS FORM CONFEDERACY AFTER LINCOLN ELECTED \n \n In 1860, Abraham Lincoln becomes the first Republican President of the United States. In response, many Democrats abandon their citizenship in the United States. Democrat politicians form a rebel pro-slavery government called the 'Confederacy', similar to the modern European Union in distribution of power and structure. The Democrats' Confederate government sought to rebalance the power between the States and Federal Government so as to provide States greater autonomy. During the Civil War, Republicans took advantage of the absence of many Democrats to pass the 13th Amendment, outlawing slavery. The Republican Congress next passed a Civil Rights Act in 1866 recognizing African-Americans as U.S. citizens. Soon after, Republicans passed the 15th Amendment, which guaranteed African-Americans voting rights, over Democratic opposition.\n \n \n REPUBLICANS SUPPORT WOMEN'S RIGHT TO VOTE\n \n Republicans were the first major party to favor women's suffrage. While the vast majority of the state legislatures that voted to ratify the 19th Amendment were Republican-controlled, 88% of the state legislatures voting against the 19th Amendment were Democrat-controlled. Only Republican-controlled states gave women the right to vote prior to the 19th Amendment. A Republican soon became the first woman to be elected to Congress. \n \n \n THE GREAT DEPRESSION\n \n In 1929, the Wall Street Crash in the United States proved the last straw for a struggling world economy. After World War I, French politicians had demanded ruinous reparations be paid to the French by Germany. Woodrow Wilson, the liberal Democrat President of the United States, had bowed to the French demands in order to get French support for the failed 'League of Nations'. These payments prevented Germany's war-ravaged economy from recovering and doomed the newborn democracy imposed on Germany by the victorious allied military coalition. French reparation demands sent the value of the German currency plunging to lows similar to those of the Soviet Union just prior to its collapse - turning Germany into a fertile recruiting ground for extremists like the Nazis and eventually leading to the second World War. In the meantime, the lack of German economic activity had a depressing effect on all the economies of Western Europe, leaving only the United States to be the 'economic engine' of the world. When that engine faltered, economic disaster swept over the industrialized world in the form of a massive economic depression. The Wall Street crash itself can be traced to lending policy of 'buying stock on the margin'. Margin sales are buying stock on credit - a policy now tightly restricted. At the time, however, it was possible for an average citizen to pay a tiny downpayment for stock, often 10% of the value. Then, if the stock went up, he was able to use that increased 'imaginary' value to borrow money to buy more stock. When the stock market collapsed, lenders began demanding payment from citizens who had very little cash assets. Those citizens couldn't pay, so the lenders were forced to sell the highly-devalued stock for whatever they could get to recover at least some of their losses. This in turn sent the price of those stocks plummeting down even further.\n \n \n THE UNITED NATIONS\n \n The United Nations was an extension of the wartime alliance of World War II. Those countries which fielded the majority of the military forces in that conflict (Britain, China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and France) were each given the power to unilaterally veto actions by the United Nations. One of the reasons for the veto was the assumption that these countries would not allow their military forces to be 'conscripted' into enforcing U.N. actions against their will. These countries also represented more than 3/4ths of the entire world's population at the time. In the final vote on the veto power, 33 nations supported it, two (Cuba and Colombia) voted against it, and 15 countries chose to abstain. Initially, membership in the U.N. was limited to countries that had declared war on the Axis powers (Germany, Japan, Italy) by March 1, 1945. The French colonies of Syria and Lebanon both rebelled while the United Nations was being formed and were subsequently unilaterally bombed until diplomatic pressure forced France to abandon such efforts. On July 28, 1945, the United States Senate approved the U.N. Charter. Like all international treaties, the Charter was considered to be merely 'equal to' any U.S. Congressional legislation and would be overridden partly or completely by any subsequently passed conflicting U.S. Congressional legislation. Like all international treaties, both the U.S. President and Congress retained the power to unilaterally annul the treaty under the authority given to them by the U.S. Constitution. \n \n \n DEMOCRATS FINANCE FRENCH CAMPAIGN IN VIETNAM\n \n In the mid-1900's, Vietnam became a colony of France. During WWII Vietnam temporarily fell under the control of Imperial Japan. The French officials who remained obeyed the authority of Vichy France (The French puppet government installed by the Nazis during WWII) and many assisted the Japanese in their occupation. A communist organization took advantage of the brief opportunity between the military defeat of Japan and re-occupation by France to seize control of part of North Vietnam. France made the mistake of trying to set up a new puppet government (a monarchy) rather than working towards the development of a true democracy in Vietnam. Picking ineffective but controllable officials, the French were unable to stop the growth of the Communist forces in North Vietnam. The French appealed to the U.S. for support and the Democrats in congress agreed. By some estimates, the Democrats voted to pay as much as 80% of France's war costs in their attempt to pacify Vietnam during the French Indochina War. However, despite this financial support, the French military proved ineffective and they were defeated. The Geneva settlement that followed France's military defeat divided Vietnam between the Communist-controlled north and a monarchy in the south. The Geneva settlement included an election clause that was never signed by either of the Vietnam governments or the United States. After the settlement was signed, France abandoned their former colony, leaving the United States to deal with the problems they left behind. \n \n \n DEMOCRATS' \"GRADUAL ESCALATION\" MILITARY STRATEGY \n \n Since the start of the Cold War, the Republicans embraced the concept of the ability to fight a 'Two Front War\" as the basis for their military strategy. The idea was simply that the United States Military should be funded and structured so as to fight engagements against two enemies simultaneously - for instance in both Afghanistan and Iraq. When the Democrats came into power, they wished to significantly cut military expenditures. However, by doing so, they would render the \"Two Front War\" strategy impossible. To justify the military cuts, they needed to come up with their own military strategy. The Democrats' strategy became known as \"Gradual Escalation\". The premise behind \"Gradual Escalation\" was not victory but simply containment. Instead of the traditional military goals of seeking to destroy an enemies physical ability to fight or shatter their will to fight with a display of overwhelming strength, the \"Gradual Escalation\" theory held that military forces in a conflict region should be slowly gradually increased in small steps, with pauses between each step to gauge the reaction of the Soviet Union and China. \n \n \n \"GRADUAL ESCALATION\" FAILS IN VIETNAM\n \n The Democrats \"Gradual Escalation\" military strategy was put to the test in Vietnam by Democrat president John Kennedy. In May 1961, the Democrat President sent 400 U.S. Army Special Forces. By 1962, the Democrat President had slowly increased the force size to 9,000. By the close of 1964 U.S. personnel sent to Vietnam by a Democrat President numbered over 23,000. This increased to 184,300 by the end of 1965. The Democrat strategy proved fatally flawed. North Vietnam was an agricultural economy, yet because of political concerns, their agricultural production was deliberately spared. Throughout the war, it would have been simple to bomb the fragile dams that North Vietnam was completely dependent upon for food-production. For far less cost and far fewer lost lives, food could have been brought in to prevent starvation. Weapons were steadily brought in to arm the North Vietnamese by China and the Soviet Union, making the bombing of local military production facilities ineffective. Neighboring countries provided safe-haven for the Communist soldiers and secure fall-back positions. The longer the conflict went on, the more effective the North Vietnamese's adaptation to it became. The United States could have quickly won the war by destroying the enemy's physical ability to fight as the U.S. did against Germany in World War II. The United States might also have won the war by shattering the enemy's will to fight in the intial stages of the conflict with a massive quick-moving campaign, similar to the \"Shock & Awe\" campaign that proved highly effective in Iraq. But the Democrats \"Gradual Escalation\" strategy proved incapable of providing victory.\n \n Mark Harm\n Candidate for State Representative - Michigan\n http://www.markharm.com",
