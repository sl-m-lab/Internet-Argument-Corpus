   "In his essay \"Gay Marriages: Make Them Legal,\" Thomas B. Stoddard argues that marriage can help fufill emotional and financial needs. It helps the couple by giving them shared rights and privilleges. He says that we should not ban gay marriages just because it has been the \"tradition\" to do so. If gay marriages were to be banned because of tradition, so would interracial marriages, which is obviously not right. Stoddard is right in arguing that gay marriages should not be banned only because of tradition--nothing should be. But should they actually be made legal? That is a different question. \n \n Lisa Schiffren states in another essay entitled \"Gay Marriage, an Oxymoron\" that marriage is a mutual covenant between a man an a woman who commit themselves to monogamy and the \"creation and nuture of offspring.\" While it has been traditionally held that marriage is only between a man and a woman, I cannot support the latter half of her assertion. It is true that many married couples have children, but some choose not to have children, and others are never able to have children. Does this make them less human? Certainly not.\n \n Let's define it: Marriage is an institution made to help fufill emotional and sexual needs and protect those who enter into it. Marriage creates a family, whether or not children are involved. It encourages couples to have children and to raise them accordingly. People often get married because they do want to have children (along with everything that leads up to that...) And if you want to define it by nature, one could say that marriage is a coventant between two people made due to chemical attraction presenting itself as \"love,\" causing two people to usually pass on their genes.\n \n Even so, it cannot be argued that gay marriages are the same as heterosexual marriages. They obviously aren't, or there wouldn't be any gay marriages. Homosexual marriages lack the natural elements of a marriage. Instead of two complementing minds working together from different persepctives, you have two men working together (or two women.) This is totally different than trying to sort out matters with someone of the opposite sex. They see things the other gender overlooks, they like things the other gender couldn't care less for. Their bodies, health, and emotions are all different in a heterosexual relationship. They are drastically different psychologically due to hormonal secretions which occur from before birth on to the end of their entire lives. When properly pursued, this makes for a stronger couple than any homosexual relationship can. Time has made men and women to complement each other. A gay marriage has two people who cannot raise children, or even relate the way they are meant to. A daughter cannot relate the same way to two fathers as she could to a mother and father. \n \n Homosexual marriages should not be supported because they are self-destructive and viciously defy the natural order. If one were to argue that they are born homosexual, it is no better. Their habits ensure the extinction of their sexual preference. Natural selection has chosen them for elimination. Their poor genetic make-up has made them resort to non-reproductive activities. With technology advancing as it is today, we are now able to create a genetic child of two individuals--of any gender. By taking DNA from a cell of one man and of another, we are able to make a genetic son of two men. We cannot allow them to pass their bad genes on to infest the entire future humanity. This does not mean that we oppress those who have a worse gene pool. We should pity them. \n \n We cannot forbid homosexual practices (that would be just barbaric), but the government cannot support them. It is the duty of mankind to ensure that their race survives. This means not only producing more people, but also preventing people with corrupt genes from polluting future generations. The real question is not whether or not homosexual marriages should be legal, the real question is: Should we prolong a decaying, self-destructive sub-species of humanity? The obvious answer is no. When we see a mutated or deformed creature, we do not encourage it to produce more young, but we don't kill it. Such are homosexuals--deformed humans on the road to destruction. Homosexuals cannot raise children as well not just because they are a lop-sided marriage, but also because natural selection has chosen them to be extinct for a reason. Their sexuallity is merely the manifestation of a highly corrupt genetic code.",

No, becuse animals arn't addicted to those kinds of things. \n\n \n \nAddiction to controlled substances is rare among nonhumans, but it does occasionally occur. Birds, such as the sapsucker, that subsist on the sap of trees will often find themselves too drunk to fly right, and fruit-eating birds such as thrushes have also been observed staggering about in a stuporous condition. This happens when the bird imbibes plant juice that has fermented, or feasts on overripe fruit and berries. Birds who fly under the influence frequently wind up as a meal for a hungry, cold-sober predator. Large mammals of Africa have been filmed after they gorged themselves on overripe fallen fruits. Antelopes observed lurching and zigzagging, bleary-eyed, show all the familiar signs of being drunk. A tipsy ostrich is a sight to behold, crossing its legs as it walks, stumbling and tottering, with its long neck wobbling after a meal of alcoholic fruits. These drunken sprees are not actually addictive, even though the participants in such wildlife bacchanalia return to the place where they found the liquored-up food until it's all gone. Catnip has often been considered an intoxicant or stimulant for cats. Cats are fascinated not by the taste but by the odor, so catnip toys are as effective as the plant itself. A mild nerve stimulant, catnip produces a \"high\" feeling and does little more than stimulate valuable exercise for lazy and bored cats. Rather than being habit forming, it serves as a vitamin pill for cats that engage in nothing more strenuous than changing positions during naps. Less harmless is the locoweed, a weedy legume of the bean family native to western North America. It causes a type of poisoning called locoism in livestock animals, including horses, cattle, sheep, and goats. Although the animal must consume large quantities of the plant to be poisoned, this happens easily because once the animal starts eating locoweed it develops a preference for the plant. Signs of poisoning are loss of weight, irregular gait, loss of muscular control and sense of direction, and violent reactions when disturbed. There being no effective treatment for locoweed poisoning, killing off locoweeds or keeping animals off ranges where locoweeds occur are the only preventives of this addictive, usually fatal, condition. Elephants are not immune to intoxication from overripe fruits, and a tipsy elephant is a sight not soon forgotten. In India the wild elephants have discovered a substitute for seasonal fruit binges: beer. Residents of small villages find that turning their crops into beer is financially quite rewarding. The problem, of course, is that elephants from the nearby forests pay regular visits in search of brewing barrels of beer. The owner of the brew wisely allows them to drink a barrel or two without interfering. But in 1991, the elephants went too far. Beer was mass-produced in a small village in central India, where the residents had become quite proficient in beer-making and brewing was the livelihood for many families. In spring 1991 a fair was scheduled in a nearby city where the villagers planned to market their product. The smell of the fermenting beer was too much for a passing herd of elephants. They stormed the village, knocking over anything in their paths as their nostrils led them to the many barrels of beer. By the time they were finished they had drunk every barrel of beer in sight. They were quite intoxicated, and the villagers were able to drive them off with torches. For the remainder of the night the unsteady trumpeting of the elephants echoed through the forest as the pixilated herd acted out their binge. They slept off their elephant-sized hangovers the next day. Later the village headman related, \"You don't know what trouble is until you've been surrounded by 25 drunken elephants.\" The elephants remembered only the good time they had drinking and returned in less than two weeks for a repeat performance; they were quite perturbed that no beer was to be found. The villagers, safely hidden, were much relieved to see them stagger off; not surprisingly, beer brewing is no longer the occupation of choice in this village. Near the Queen Elizabeth Reserve in Uganda, Africa, a group of (people) had finished making several barrels of beer in preparation for a festival the next day. Just as they were storing the brew, four old elephants grazing nearby got a whiff of their favorite beverage. They decided to start the celebration immediately and charged onto the scene. The brewmasters fled as the elephants began to tank up. After the barrels were empty, the elephants went on a drunken rampage, chasing everyone in sight, overturning cars, uprooting gardens, and tearing down (their) houses. They finally retreated into the jungle, but throughout the night and into the next day their muffled groans and trumpeting rang through the village. Their hangovers were some comfort to the villagers, who had canceled their own celebration. \n\n \n If the fact that animals don't do it is the only reason not to do something, I suppose that makes drunken binges all good then.\n \nAnimals don't have gay sex \n\n \n How many times do we have to have this discussion, Parcum? Of course animals engage in same-sex sexual behavior, especially the primates closest to us, such as bonobos. Animals don't get married, and they do have gay sex. So I guess if animals do it, that makes it ok, hmmm? I guess noone should get married then, hmmm?\n \n \nor i'm just crazy.... courage and folly go hand in hand.\n\n \n What's hilarious is witzelcheck getting all excited and agreeing with you.

   "Mizmaxx, it seems you're confusing youthful sexual behavior with homosexuality. In earlier human times, there was no such thing as \"homosexual\" and \"heterosexual\", but \"active\" and \"passive\". In other words, if you had sex a lot, most likely you were of youth, and had sex with both women and men. Of course it is normal for the youth to be extremely sexual- which is why it's stupid to define your sexuality during your adolescence, as you don't really have a clear idea what it is since your body is so sexual. Animals as well are very active sexually at young ages, but it isn't permanent. They don't only have sex with the same sex, and never have sex with females. The reason why they are sexually attracted to the same sex is not because they are gay, but because they want to release their sexual energy. It doesn't matter to them- male or female- just as long as they have sex. Homosexuality is different- homosexuals have relationships with ONLY men, because their find their same sex attractive. This is disordered and highly immoral. \n \n As a separate issue, homosexuals are EXTREMELY sexual. They aren't like most straight people. Whenever I go to gay areas, I see homosexual pornography, prostitutes, sexual theatres, gay bars, et cetera. Homosexuals are OVERLY sexual!

So comparisons between animals and our sexual relationships are baseless.\n\n \n  \"Bonobos curry favor by performing oral sex on others of the same gender. even though they also seize every opportunity to mate with those of the opposite sex.\"\n \n \"One clue to a more subtle theory is that other primates, including close relatives like the bonobos, often engage in homosexual behavior, apparently as a way of forming alliances.\"\n \n From a NYT article\n \n That's irrelevant. You're throwing in a completely different concept. Besides the fact that many homosexuals NEVER have sex with the opposite sex, you never see a Chimpanzee only have sex with males, or even have sex with males the majority of the time. It simply does not happen. The Chimpanzee's natural instinct is to produce children from the female. MY point is not that the Bonobo has long term relationships or marries females, but that the Bonobo instinctually has relationships with females. Sure, they may have sexual relations with males, but this is simply a youthful phenomenon in Chimpanzee sociology. \n \n Bruce Bagemihl is the man who came up with the theory that homosexuality is common in something like 500 animal species, but his problem is that he is extremely biased. As a matter of fact, half of his book was attacking heterosexuality. He says that there is no \"ultimate goal\" to procreate, but that reproduction happens merely because of attraction to sexual pleasure, and that homosexuality is not unique because it doesn't lead to procreation. However, he's completely wrong. As a matter of fact, heterosexuality in animals is essential in evolutionary theory. As a matter of fact, as I've stated in our abortion debates, having the ability to reproduce is a requirement for life. Remember- A) Metabolism, B) Growth, C) Stimuli, D) The ability to Reproduce. If any living being misses one of these basic characteristics, it's not a life.\n \n If mother nature's goal was not to reproduce when creating sexuality, then we would all be extinct. All animals are concieved with the ability to reproduce- it is essential that they do. Bagemihl's statements that pleasure is the only goal for sex is simply ignorant. He fails to realize that if sex was only for pleasure than there would only be protein in the semen, and no sperm. Look at lions- they spend only a few hours a day hunting. Following Bagemihl's logic, lions hunting is merely a coincidence, and not an ultimate goal. Further, many lions don't participate in hunting, just like not all of the bonobos participate in sex with the opposite gender. Does that mean these lions are \"different\"? Of course not. The ultimate goal is ALWAYS reproduction. Every organism dies- this is an undeniable fact. So if the goal isn't to reproduce, then our population would never grow. Further, many amphibians and fish have sexual relations WITHOUT pleasure.

   " \"Bonobos curry favor by performing oral sex on others of the same gender. even though they also seize every opportunity to mate with those of the opposite sex.\"\n \n \"One clue to a more subtle theory is that other primates, including close relatives like the bonobos, often engage in homosexual behavior, apparently as a way of forming alliances.\"\n \n From a NYT article\n \n That's irrelevant. You're throwing in a completely different concept. Besides the fact that many homosexuals NEVER have sex with the opposite sex, you never see a Chimpanzee only have sex with males, or even have sex with males the majority of the time. It simply does not happen. The Chimpanzee's natural instinct is to produce children from the female. MY point is not that the Bonobo has long term relationships or marries females, but that the Bonobo instinctually has relationships with females. Sure, they may have sexual relations with males, but this is simply a youthful phenomenon in Chimpanzee sociology. \n \n Bruce Bagemihl is the man who came up with the theory that homosexuality is common in something like 500 animal species, but his problem is that he is extremely biased. As a matter of fact, half of his book was attacking heterosexuality. He says that there is no \"ultimate goal\" to procreate, but that reproduction happens merely because of attraction to sexual pleasure, and that homosexuality is not unique because it doesn't lead to procreation. However, he's completely wrong. As a matter of fact, heterosexuality in animals is essential in evolutionary theory. As a matter of fact, as I've stated in our abortion debates, having the ability to reproduce is a requirement for life. Remember- A) Metabolism, B) Growth, C) Stimuli, D) The ability to Reproduce. If any living being misses one of these basic characteristics, it's not a life.\n \n If mother nature's goal was not to reproduce when creating sexuality, then we would all be extinct. All animals are concieved with the ability to reproduce- it is essential that they do. Bagemihl's statements that pleasure is the only goal for sex is simply ignorant. He fails to realize that if sex was only for pleasure than there would only be protein in the semen, and no sperm. Look at lions- they spend only a few hours a day hunting. Following Bagemihl's logic, lions hunting is merely a coincidence, and not an ultimate goal. Further, many lions don't participate in hunting, just like not all of the bonobos participate in sex with the opposite gender. Does that mean these lions are \"different\"? Of course not. The ultimate goal is ALWAYS reproduction. Every organism dies- this is an undeniable fact. So if the goal isn't to reproduce, then our population would never grow. Further, many amphibians and fish have sexual relations WITHOUT pleasure. Obviously, they have a goal other than having fun. \n \n Darwin's basic teachings are that survival and reproduction shape the species. Why aren't you and Bagemihl following this? \n \n \n \n I've said it once- maybe twice.\n \n \n \n No, that would be a logical fallacy.

The thing is, almost ALL homosexuals have problems. Why? Obviously there's some disorder.\n\n \n Communication is so much richer when argument is at least partially grounded in personal life experiences. You seem to rely heavily on what you have read about homosexuality and sexual behavior in general rather than on your own experiences with heterosexual intercourse or on in depth conversations with a wide cross section of homosexuals (to include lesbians). Therefore, you simply do not have the frame of reference to make these arguments. You do not know all homosexuals or even almost all homosexuals so your argument is nothing more than ill informed conjecture. \n \n The most important element missing from this discussion is that of emotion. Homosexuality is not purely a sexual behavior. Homosexuals fall in love with members of their own gender. Most heterosexuals I know who are in longterm relationships do not have the same sexual intensity at 10 years that they did at 6 months. The same goes with most of the homosexual couples I know in longterm relationships. What keeps people together when the sexual energy has waned as it inevitably will? Love, respect, integrity, obligation? There are two ladies in my church who look to be in their late seventies. They have been together for over 40 years and are both severly stricken with arthritis. They appear to all who see them, to be very much devoted to each other. Why would two aged lesbians whose physical ailments have long diminished the drive to have sex, cling to each other? I have seen elderly homosexual male couples do the same thing. If sex were all that homosexuality were about, then you would see no long term gay relationships. \n \n An availaible binding legal contract acts as an inducement and provides structure and continuity. The legal contract of marriage makes it easier to maintain monogamous committment in society. The fact that gay people pursue longterm monogamous relationships despite the fact that they receive none of the protections or benefits heterosexuals get when they permanently commit, says volumes.",

Firstly, the point isn't HOW they produce, but the mere fact that they do produce. Actually, your argument supports mine! Those lizards produce without any sort of sexual contact- and yet they still reproduce. Why? Obviously there's still a goal. Secondly, we're speaking of a different sort of reproduction, where the sperm fertilizes the egg. Bagemihl is trying to say that animals ONLY reproduce because of attraction to sex. But since an overwhelming amount of animals reproduce WITHOUT sexual stimulation, it's obvious that isn't the only reason. \n \n The reason why the worker bee isn't fertile is because it wasn't raised like that. The queen just lays the eggs- but the workers give the food. If the larvae gets the Queen's Jelly, then the larvae will grow to have the ability to reproduce. Right at conception, the larvae has the ability to reproduce, but is basically fed a diet that spays the female. Many men who have prostrate cancer lose their sexual ability. This obviously doesn't mean that they're not alive, but it simply means they've lost one of their requirements for life. From conception, they've had the ability to reproduce. If they didn't have this ability, it goes against evolution. \n \n \n Naturally, at the beginning of human life on this planet, there was a need to \"grow\" the human population. However, we are now facing the exact opposite situation, with overpopulation being the problem. We can't simply move forward along a path of multipling the population forever. Population control is an important part of our faithful stewardship of the resources of the planet.\n\n \n I assure you, the world is not over populated. The world in many locations is actually losing population- especially in Europe and the United States. The populating peoples are the Africans, Hispanics, and Arabs, and the Africans are losing their population because of AIDS, so Hispanics and Arabs are the only ones reproducing. Did you know that the entire world can fit very comfortably in Texas, with each person getting 1600 square feet of space? The entire world can spread out into every single continent and live very comfortably- with roads, parks, et cetera- in an area the size of Liberia (approximately 40,000 square miles)? Further, the population by 2050 is only expected to be 9 billion. We have plenty of resources as well- with new developments such as sky-scraper greenhouses. Obviously, we have the resources, and we have the space. The world is not over populated. Further, having gay sex isn't going to solve it. \n \n \n Communication is so much richer when argument is at least partially grounded in personal life experiences.

I was making 3 separate points. In your eagerness to respond, you failed to absorb any of them. \n \n Point #1: When I communicate with someone who is making an argument based at least in part on personal knowledge and life experience rather than solely on what they have read in the Encyclopedia, their contribution to the discourse is much more meaningful. You have obviously read a lot of material and are very intelligent, however, book knowledge alone does not make for intriguing discourse or thoughtful argument. Your arguments on this topic have been largely pedantic. That is not to say that the only way to obtain personal knowledge is by being a homosexual.

Tell me this is normal behavior- quite obviously, it's not..\n\n \n This is exactly what I am talking about. Again you are quoting from something you have read. Your argument is weakened because it is based on another person's study. As you did not personally conduct nor participate in the study, you cannot say with certainty that the statistics you quote are even accurate. Furthermore, the information you present brings with it more questions than data. For example: Does the group of \"all homosexuals\" include women? Is this a worldwide study that includes all homosexual ethnic groups and nationalities (Do Arab homosexuals fornicate at the same rate as British homosexuals?) What about religion. Does it make a difference? Do Hindu homosexuals fornicate at the same rate as Baptist homosexuals? Was the study done in San Francisco where the homosexual population tends to be more liberal or in Dallas where the homosexuals tend to be more conservative? Did the person conducting the study actually speak with all homosexuals? The gay community is far more diverse and complex than you have contemplated. Thus,we are not easily pidgeonholed. Think outside of the box.\n \n \n \nSimply because you know homosexuals and heterosexuals with that sort of behavior does not make it fact, that's simply a hasty generalization. Although your argument above was simply based on hasty generalizations, I do understand that many homosexuals probably have long term relationships- but this is unusual. 70% of all homosexuals have had at the very least 500 partners! This is obviously not normal behavior. [/\n\n \n You actually understand very little. Unfortunately you seemed not to have grasped the main point of my post. Human homosexuality is not simply a sexual behavior. It also involves love, loyalty and intense emotional attachments which often but not always lead to longterm relationships between gay people. This is not arguable. Humans as a whole tend to seek relationships for numerous reasons. Homosexuals are no exception. This is not to say that all gay people are monogamous or that many gay people are not promiscuous. However, you were catagorizing the behavior of all or almost all gay people and ignoring the element of love and the implications of homosexual monogamy in your analysis. \n \n If you think about it, it makes sense that gays in longterm monogamous relationships are likely to be less visible, therefore less likely to be counted or questioned in a study. If I did a survey in New York city and questioned every twenty year old girl about her sexual history would that study provide me with an accurate picture of how many men your grandmother and her female friends have bedded in their lifetime?\n \n Just another thought. Lets presume for arguments sake, that gay men do have a higher instance of different sexual partners than straight men. Correct me if I am wrong, but based on the men I have known, it seems that males in general are pretty fixated on sexual release. It is just a hunch, but I would venture to guess if heterosexual women were as interested and willing to have unencumbered sex as heterosexual men that the rate of sexual partners among heterosexual men would be pretty darned high. Be honest Parcum. Assume almost weekly a different, beautiful, intelligent, young woman runs her delicate hands across your chest, breathes softly in your ear, all the while marveling at your brilliance. Are you tempted? Even as a virtuous young man, how many times would you say no before you succumbed to temptation? I imagine the average red blooded male would say yes as often as he was asked. Therefore it would seem that promiscuity is really related more to testosterone and availability than same gender attraction. Besides, the unwilling female what else inhibits promiscuity for most straight men?Marriage ---a legal binding committment.\n \n The irony is that legal contracts of committment clearly are intended to promote monogamy and stability among heterosexual couples. I would bet money that unmarried heterosexuals are more promiscuous than married heterosexuals. Yet society makes these legal committments off limits to homosexuals. Ironically, society intentionally blocks homosexuals from legal committments that tend to inhibit promiscuity, then hypocritically scream, \"look at how promiscuous the homos are.\" They then use that as a basis for further discrimination. I wonder how promiscuous heterosexual males would be if there were no legal institution of marriage and women were as sexually focused as men?",

   "The problems with that 1970's Bell and Weinberg study Parcum cites....\n \n 1) The sampling of the homosexuals in the study was not random, and they admit as much. The heterosexual sample was random, using census data and land tracts to ensure a random sample, and going to exhaustive lengths to make sure those samples were truly random. While they did go to great lengths to get a large sample group of homosexuals, and I don't doubt that their data is representative of the sample they were testing, their data is absolutely not generalizable due to the clear fact that their sample was not a random sample. \n \n 2) Another reason why their data is not generalizable is that they while they did a survey of heterosexuals as well as homosexuals, for some reason they didn't include the heterosexual data. For example, while they claim that one homosexual respondent claims to have had sex with over 10,000 people, and a large percentage of their sample claim to have had sex with over 500 people, they do not give correlative data on the heterosexual sample. For all we know the heterosexual sample may have had a greater number of sexual partners than the homosexual sample. Without this control group, we cannot generalize their sample to the population at large, because we do not know that their population represents national norms since we have no heterosexual control group. It is possible that the heterosexual statistics were equally high, and could have shown that the data does not represent promiscuity specifically among gays, but of the sexually active single person in San Francisco in the 1970's. \n \n 3) A third problem, still relating to the heterosexual sample, is that it did not represent a true control group. Apart from the fact that the homosexual sample was not random and the heterosexual sample was, the homosexual samples were taken from the following places: singles bars (22%), gay baths (9%), public places (=guys hanging out in parks to find sex partners; 6%), private bars (=sex clubs; 5%), personal contacts (people that the bar people, public place people, bath house people, etc, knew personally and referred; 23%), public advertising + organizations + mailing lists (29%).The heterosexual sample, on the other hand, were people in residential areas, admittedly including married people. These two samples are not parallel, and even if they had included the heterosexual data, they would not be comparable. In order for this data to have been generalizable, they would have had to go to heterosexual singles bars, sex clubs, bookstores, etc, to get their population. \n \n 4) They used Kinsey 2-6 for their inclusion of homosexual population. Their sample does not represent only homosexual persons, but also includes bisexual persons.",

Basing your arguments on feeling and meanings is simply illogical and silly. \n \n \n \nYour arguments on this topic have been largely pedantic. That is not to say that the only way to obtain personal knowledge is by being a homosexual.

I was educated by them!), that still is irrelevant and an ad hominum. I don't knoq if you're making this a requirement- that I MUST base my arguments on personal experiences with homosexuals, but either way, that is very dangerous and causes us to generalize and make assumptions. That's what caused many of the European wars, the Indians-American wars, the civil war, et cetera. \n \n \n I did not say your argument was void, I said it was ill informed conjecture for you to talk about the experiences of \"almost all homosexuals\" because you clearly do not know \"almost all homosexuals.\"\n\n \n Of course I don't know almost all homosexuals. However, if 70% of all homosexuals have at least 500-1000 partners in a lifetime, they obviously have a problem. It is in no way generalizing. \n \n \n This is exactly what I am talking about. Again you are quoting from something you have read. Your argument is weak because it is based on another person's study. As you did not personally conduct nor participate in the study, you cannot say with certainty that the statistics you quote are even accurate. \n\n \n Firstly, the study was made by two very prestigious sociologists- so prestigious, that the studies in the book are often used by homosexuals. Further, other studies such as  Journal of Sex Research, where 1000 surveyed said 21% had 100 to 500 sex partners- this was only the most common response, where other statistics were made. Genre (study of over 2 thousand) found that 24% had over 100 sex partners. Only 2% said they had sex with one partner. Finally,  Western Sexuality: Practice and Precept in Past and Present Times, said \"few homosexual relationships last longer than two years, with many men reporting hundreds of lifetime partners.\" Obviously, there are problems. \n \n \nFurthermore, the information you present brings with it more questions than data. For example: Does the group of \"all homosexuals\" include women? Is this a worldwide study that includes all homosexual ethnic groups and nationalities (Do Arab homosexuals fornicate at the same rate as British homosexuals?) What about religion? Do Hindu homosexuals fornicate at the same rate as Baptist homosexuals? Was the study done in San Francisco where the homosexual popoulation tends to be more liberal or in Dallas where the homosexuals tend to be more conservative? Did the person conducting the study actually speak with all homosexuals?\n\n \n Of course these studies, the Journal of Sex Research was done on random Australian men. Those other two studies were done across the nation. I don't know where the earlier was done, but I can assure you it isn't biased, as the statistics in that book are often used by homosexual organizations. \n \n \n You actually understand very little. Perhaps with a some seasoning this will change. Unfortunately you seemed not to have grasped the main point of my post. Human homosexuality is not simply a sexual behavior. It also involves love, loyalty and intense emotional attachments which often but not always lead to longterm relationships between gay people. This is not arguable. This is not to say that all gay people are monogamous or that many gay people are not promiscuous. However, you were catagorizing the behavior of all or almost all gay people and igoring the element of love and the implications of homosexual monogamy in your analysis.\n\n \n You see, sexuality and love are not always one and the same, especially in modern society. If we think about it more, modern sex is simply using another person as an object to release sexual pleasure. You call that love? I call it disgust. If it were truly love, a major portion of the homosexual population would not be having hundreds of partners in a lifetime. What love? This isn't love! This is sexual addiction! There's a center in San Francisco called GLBT- that stands for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender. Transgender? That's automatically putting homosexuals at \"I want sex\". \n \n \n If you think about it, it makes sense that gays in longterm monogamous relationships are likely to be less visible, therefore less likely to be counted or questioned in a study. If I did a survey in New York city and questioned every twenty year old girl about her sexual history would that study provide me with an accurate picture of how many men your grandmother and her female friends have bedded in their lifetime?\n\n \n I obviously don't know, but can assure you that those statistics are NOT biased, but very true. I challenge you to show me a statistic like that. Go ahead. \n \n \n The irony is that legal contracts of committment clearly are intended to promote monogamy and stability among heterosexual couples. I would bet that unmarried heterosexuals are more promiscuous than married heterosexuals. Yet society makes these legal committments off limits to homosexuals.

I wonder how promiscuous heterosexuals would be if there were no legal institution of marriage?\n\n \n So because nobody is married, automatically they can have a bunch of relationships? Well firstly, marriage doesn't mean much anymore. It's like sex. It used to have meaning, now it doesn't and people just do it all the time for fun. So to use that excuse is ridiculous, as already 2/3 of all marriages end in divorce.\n \n Simple summary; Don't base your arguments on ad hominum tu quoques and hasty generalizations. They are logical fallacies. \n \n Jake, the study I showed is often used by homosexuals, and I gave a link to prove it. I'll go more in depth with your post tommorrow, but I can assure you that you mistook the statistic for another.",

   " The Journal of Sex Reasearch is not the most respected source. And what were the numbers for the other 79% of those who responded? You give us snipets without knowing anything about the sample, when it was done, and without corresponding heterosexual numbers. Genre surveyed its readers. Genre is a magazine that deals frankly with gay sexuality. It would be like surveying readers of Maxim magazine, and using those results to make generalizations about the entire straight community. Only two percent had sex with one partner? Would that be over a lifetime? More snipets from the other study without even specific numbers, see the rest of my reply above.\n\n \n How do you know if the Journal of Sex Research is not the \"most respected source\"? I'de say it most definitely a respected source, perhaps not \"most' respected, but neither is Zogby. I'd say Gallup is more respected than Zogby. So what? The 79% of the rest had different responses, so there wasn't a majority. But that's not the point- the mere fact that 21% have had hundreds of partners tells us that obviously they have problems. What do you think the rest of the respondents would say? \"Don't listen to the 21% because they're lying\"?\n \n \n The term transgendered has nothing to do with wanting sex.\n\n \n It has a lot to do with having sex. Why else would a man want to be a woman, or vice versa? Obviously, they want a different kind of sexuality. \n \n \n Don't bother. I did not mistake anything. Just because this particular centre uses that statistic on suicide does not mean it is often used by gays and lesbians. Even if it is, that does not make your point about promiscuity. It does not address how the researchers got their statistics on promiscuity.\n\n \n Jake, so far you havn't given me ANY sources. You've just been saying \"No that's wrong\".

   "GE, the thing is that if you base your arguments on life experience, it's a hasty generalization and ad hominum tu quoque. As stated earlier, of course it's nice when making an argument to give real life experiences, but it is most definitely not necessary. Basing your arguments on feeling and meanings is simply illogical and silly. \n\n \n Let me suggest that the overuse or misuse of a word or expression that you believe sounds impressive, actually diminishes the expression's impact and lends your argument an amateurish quality. Beyond that, if you are going to use a word repeatedly, you should definitely understand its meaning. \n \n \n Parcum, surprisingly, it seems that you do not know what the word generalization means. A generalization is a sweeping statement or an over simplification like, \"70% of \"all homosexuals\" have at least 500-1000 partners in a lifetime.\" You should pick up a book on logic it might help your arguments. How do you prove that 70 percent of \"all homosexuals\" have had 500 to 1000 partners in a lifetime without asking all homosexuals about their sexual history? To make a pronouncement about all homosexuals without questioning all homosexuals is a sweeping statement. At best your authors can only state that 70 percent of the people interviewed had 500 to 1000 partners in a lifetime. \n \n Let me make it easier to understand. If there are 25 people in a room and I ask 10 of them, \"are you happy\" and five of them say \"yes\", what percentage of all of the people in the room are happy? Well I cannot say with accuracy because I did not ask all of the 25 people in the room, I only asked 10. So the only answer that would not be speculative is that 50 percent of the people I asked said they were happy. \n \n \n Life experience enhances critical thinking and often provides empirical evidence and not just anecdotal evidence. An excellent argument depends on clarity, accuracy, precision, consistency, relevance, sound empirical evidence, good reasons, depth, breadth and fairness. All of which are lacking in your posts on this topic. Building your case primarily on someone else's questionable statistics weakens your argument.\n \n \n So it is your assertion that my observations were hasty. Well, I guess that depends on what your definition of hasty is. I have been observing people with great curiosity for many years. I have been socializing with other homosexuals for 23 years. Most of my best friends are gay. I have been aware of my attraction towards my own gender since 3rd grade. I attend a church filled with Christian gays, many of which I have spent hours discussing morality with one on one and in group settings. The church has numerous loving monogamous gay couples and virtuous gay singles. I have also spent considerable time in gay clubs. I have known many elderly gay people (over 60). My gay friends are both male and female alike. I have personally been in a relationship with the same woman for almost 10 years. I love her with all of my heart. I have known countless other gay couples in love over the last 23 years. Most but not all of the gay women I know and have known have had a limited number of sexual partners and are seeking a lifetime relationship if they do not already have one. Still sound hasty? If so, you disappoint me. I have high expectations of you Parcum.\n \n \nAlthough I most certainly have had in depth conversations with homosexuals (I live in San Francisco! I was educated by them!), that still is irrelevant and an ad hominum. \n\n \n There you go with \"ad hominum\" again. Take care or you'll start sounding like the guy who is obsessed with \"semen in the digestive tract.\" \n \n \nI don't knoq if you're making this a requirement- that I MUST base my arguments on personal experiences with homosexuals, but either way, that is very dangerous and causes us to generalize and make assumptions. That's what caused many of the European wars, the Indians-American wars, the civil war, et cetera. \n\n \n So it is your position that basing an argument on personal experience and/ or on personal observations or conversations caused the European Wars, Indian American Wars and the Civil Wars??? emoticon_confused I won't even touch that one. I can see you gave that a lot of thought before you posted it. :( \n \n \n \nOf course I don't know almost all homosexuals. However, if 70% of all homosexuals have at least 500-1000 partners in a lifetime, they obviously have a problem. \n \n \n \n It is in no way generalizing. \n\n \n \n Is too. :) \n \n \n \n \nFirstly, the study was made by two very prestigious sociologists- so prestigious, that the studies in the book are often used by homosexuals. Further, other studies such as  Journal of Sex Research, where 1000 surveyed said 21% had 100 to 500 sex partners- this was only the most common response, where other statistics were made. Genre (study of over 2 thousand) found that 24% had over 100 sex partners. Only 2% said they had sex with one partner. Finally,  Western Sexuality: Practice and Precept in Past and Present Times, said \"few homosexual relationships last longer than two years, with many men reporting hundreds of lifetime partners.\" Obviously, there are problems. \n\n \n How do you know these sociologists are prestigious? Let me guess... you read it somewhere. emoticon_smile \n \n More quotes from other peoples studies. Parcum, come on you can do better. How about a little original thought? \n \n And while I appreciate your presumption that any study relied on by a homosexual must be prestigous, I think your confidence may be misplaced. Yes, I know it is shocking ... and I cannot believe I am going to admit it, but gay people are sometimes mistaken. emoticon_ic \n \n \n \n \nYou see, sexuality and love are not always one and the same, especially in modern society. \n\n \n You are absolutely correct. Sometimes homosexuals and heterosexuals have sex just for the fun of it with no strings and no love. \n \n Other homosexuals and heterosexuals love those they are intimate with. Many homosexuals that I know prefer the latter and frown on promiscuity. \n \n \nIf we think about it more, modern sex is simply using another person as an object to release sexual pleasure.\n \n \n This is a very excellent example of generalization. By not limiting your argument, you made a sweeping statement about all modern sex. While I agree that a large segment of society now treats God's wonderful gift with disrespect, I cannot agree that all modern sex is \"simply using another person as an object to release sexual pleasure.\" Furthermore , you have provided no study for that assertion. So does that mean that you are basing your argument on your own life experience, feeling and meanings? emoticon_ic \n \n I once heard a great philosopher say, \"Basing your arguments on feeling and meanings is simply illogical and silly.\" \n \n \nYou call that love? I call it disgust.\n \n \n Your argument is really getting gelatinous here. I never equated \"simply using another person as an object to release sexual pleasure.\" with love.\" What I said was in my life, I have known innumerable gay people in love and in longterm relationships. \n \n \nIf it were truly love, a major portion of the homosexual population would not be having hundreds of partners in a lifetime. What love? This isn't love! This is sexual addiction! \n\n \n \n So are you trying to argue that homosexuals are incapable of loving other homosexuals because only heterosexuals fall in love? Because if you are, you must have gotten your information from the library of the Forrest Gump School of Philosophy and Analytical thought. Critical thought requires that if any portion of the homosexual community has loving monogamous longterm relationships, then you cannot ignore this segment in analyzing the group of \"all homosexuals.\" \n \n \n \n \nThere's a center in San Francisco called GLBT- that stands for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender. Transgender? That's automatically putting homosexuals at \"I want sex\". \n\n \n Thus far your content has been flawed and boring but it has at least been articulate. Well that seems to have just gone out the window with this phrase. How do you know that transgender automatically put, \"homosexuals at I want sex?\" Must be more of that \"silly illogical\" feeling and meanings stuff you are so fond of. \n \n \n \nI obviously don't know, but can assure you that those statistics are NOT biased, but very true. \n\n \n Oh really, exactly how do you propose to do that? Quote more studies of studies of homosexuals? \n \n \n \nI challenge you to show me a statistic like that. Go ahead. \n \n\n \n When pursuing a thoughtful argument, I try to avoid sucking off of the intellectual pursuits of others whenever possible. \n \n \nSo because nobody is married, automatically they can have a bunch of relationships? Well firstly, marriage doesn't mean much anymore. It's like sex. It used to have meaning, now it doesn't and people just do it all the time for fun. So to use that excuse is ridiculous, as already 2/3 of all marriages end in divorce.\n\n \n There you go again making my argument for me. If you are arguing that marriage no longer provides stability or discourages promiscuity for heterosexuals, then maybe it is time for the straight community to do a little introspective soul searching. Your statement certainly does not explain why some heterosexuals think it appropriate to deny legal contractual rights of committment to gay people when they themselves obviously don't take the institution of marriage seriously anymore? Perhaps 2/3 of all your marriages end in divorce, but we haven't had a go at it yet.",

I'm simply stating fact- and the fact is you were by definition making an ad hominum tu quoque, as taught in my logic classes, and that is a logical fallacy. This is an undeniable fact. \n \n \n Parcum, surprisingly, it seems that you do not know what the word generalization means.

If Gallop was to take a poll to see how many people would vote for Bush in 2004, and 50% said yes, would it be wrong in saying \"50% of all Americans want Bush in 04\"? No. Why? Because polls represent a group of people. That is the purpose of polls. If you don't like this purpose, I suggest you ignore polls altogether. Your second point on how the survey I showed you was \"illogical\" or what not, is so ignorant I'm baffled. You obviously have no idea how how surveys are taken, especially this specific survey which homosexuals condone. Finally, your statement \"You should pick up a book on logic it might help your arguments\" is in itself a logical fallacy!\n \n \n Let me make it easier to understand. If there are 25 people in a room and I ask 10 of them, \"are you happy\" and five of them say \"yes\", what percentage of all of the people in the room are happy?

So the only answer that would not be speculative is that 50 percent of the people I asked said they were happy.\n\n \n Actually- assuming this is a larger number- it would still work. Even if you asked one percent, it would still work. If I were to get 10 thousand random people in a room, and asked 4 thousand random people how many relationships they had in a lifetime, the statistic would still be accurate. I didn't need to ask 10 thousand people, I could, if I wanted to, only ask 4 thousand people. So of the 4 thousand respondents, I would make a statistic. So let's say 3 thousand out of the 4 thousand said \"15\" and 1 thousand said other amounts. That would mean 75% of the surveyors had 15 relationships in their lifetime. No this isn't inaccurate, it's a perfectly good statistic. Further, we're not asking 10 people, we're asking a much larger amount. \n \n \n Life experience enhances critical thinking and often provides empirical evidence and not just anecdotal evidence.

You tend to rely too much on emotion and that I personally need to know or have conversations with homosexuals to make assumptions. You have the knowledge to argue the subject, but rely too much on this ad hominum. I don't need to know homosexuals to base my belief. I don't need to have conversations with homosexuals to support my argument. \n \n \n So it is your assertion that my observations were hasty. Well, I guess that depends on what your definition of hasty is. I have been observing people with great curiosity for many years. I have been socializing with other homosexuals for 23 years. Most of my best friends are gay. I have been aware of my attraction towards my own gender since 3rd grade.

You weren't making a hasty generalization, but you were asking me to, in this statement:\n \n \"You seem to rely heavily on what you have read about homosexuality and sexual behavior in general rather than on your own experiences with heterosexual intercourse or on in depth conversations with a wide cross section of homosexuals (to include lesbians). Therefore, you simply do not have the frame of reference to make these arguments. You do not know all homosexuals or even almost all homosexuals so your argument is nothing more than ill informed conjecture.\" \n \n Although your last statement is correct- I don't know all homosexuals, the entire paragraph is incorrect, because you're telling me that I need experience with homosexuals before I can make an argument. The \"wide cross section of homosexuals\" is what surveys do. That is the point of surveys, so we know what a large amount of people do. \n \n \n There you go with \"ad hominum\" again. Take care or you'll start sounding like the guy who is obsessed with \"semen in the digestive tract.\"\n\n \n Girl, I suggest you work on your maturity. You seem to be having some problems. \n \n \n So it is your position that basing an argument on personal experience and/ or on personal observations or conversations caused the European Wars, Indian American Wars and the Civil Wars??? I won't even touch that one. I can see you gave that a lot of thought before you posted it. \n\n \n What are you talking about? Hasty generalizations are what caused war. It causes racism. If I were to ask 50 Hispanics their GPA, and they all said 4.0, would that mean that the average GPA for Hispanics is a 4.0? No! This is what caused miscommunication and conflicts throughout history! \n \n \n \n Is too.\n\n \n So, by your logic, surveys are logical fallacies and more specifically generalizations? LOL.\n \n \n More quotes from other peoples studies. Parcum, come on you can do better. How about a little original thought?\n\n \n GE, so far you have given me NO statistics. I have given you four. You want more statistics? Wait, but, according to you, only the statistics you post are logical, and mine are just generalizations, correct? Hahaha.\n \n \n And while I appreciate your presumption that any study relied on by a homosexual must be prestigous, I think your confidence may be misplaced. Yes, I know it is shocking ... and I cannot believe I am going to admit it, but gay people are sometimes mistaken. \n\n \n It isn't just that one homosexual site that did it- several websites do it. Further, I searched this book up on the San Francisco Public Library section, and the only place If found it was in the Eureka Valley \"Gay Culture\" library. You tell me that this is a biased book...\n \n \n There you go again making my argument for me. If you are arguing that marriage no longer provides stability or discourages promiscuity for heterosexuals, then maybe it is time for the straight community to do a little introspective soul searching. Your statement certainly does not explain why some heterosexuals think it appropriate to deny legal contractual rights of committment to gay people when they themselves obviously don't take the institution of marriage seriously anymore? Perhaps 2/3 of all your marriages end in divorce, but we haven't had a go at it yet.\n\n \n It's not that homosexuals are promiscuous, it's that homosexual behavior is immoral! It has nothing to do with commitment, although I do disagree with abusing divorce laws as well.\n \n \n Point #1: When I communicate with someone who is making an argument based at least in part on personal knowledge and life experience rather than solely on what they have read in the Encyclopedia, their contribution to the discourse is much more meaningful. You have obviously read a lot of material and are very intelligent, however, book knowledge alone does not make for intriguing discourse or thoughtful argument.\n\n \n The problem is that you cannot base your arguments on personal experience. It's good to support your argument by writing about personal experiences, but basing it \"in part\" on them is dangerous and contraire with logic. \n \n \n Your arguments on this topic have been largely pedantic. That is not to say that the only way to obtain personal knowledge is by being a homosexual. That is why I said \"You seem to rely heavily on what you have read about homosexuality and sexual behavior in general rather than on your own experiences with heterosexual intercourse or on in depth conversations with a wide cross section of homosexuals (to include lesbians).\" I don't recall you mentioning that you have had a good many heart to heart talks with gay couples or gay singles about their personal sexual needs or ethics.\n\n \n Mainly because I was never asked to, or felt obligated to mention my experiences with homosexuals. Yes I do know homosexuals- four of my uncles are homosexuals, some of my friends in school are homosexuals, and my dad works with homosexuals in his psychology firm. Once again, I live in San Francisco. \n \n \n I did not say your argument was void, I said it was ill informed conjecture for you to talk about the experiences of \"almost all homosexuals\" because you clearly do not know \"almost all homosexuals.\" Neither have your authors studied, \"almost all homosexuals\"\n\n \n Is that absolutely nessecary? No. So let's not say 1 billion people in the world are Catholic. We don't know a billion people, so we really don't know.\n \n \n Essentially, I was saying your argument is boring and speculative because it contains no original thought and is based almost entirely on statistics obtained from books and discussions of animal sexual behavior rather than on your own personal knowledge and/or your own conversations with a wide cross section of homosexuals ( to include lesbians). \n Sorry if that hurts your feelings, but you forced me to be blunt. By the way living in San Francisco does not make you an expert on homosexuals, anymore than living in Texas makes me an expert on horses.\n\n \n \n Oh don't worry, my feelings aren't hurt. You're changing your argument now, but that's fine. \n \n Although I don't know everything about of homosexuals, living in San Francisco does definitely make me have very much knowledge about homosexuals, and certainly more knowledge than Arkansas white girls.",

   "Let's not get into personal attacks. I'm simply stating fact- and the fact is you were by definition making an ad hominum tu quoque, as taught in my logic classes, and that is a logical fallacy. This is an undeniable fact..\n\n \n \n Parcum, I am just stating fact and unfortuantely the facts seem to have wounded you. However, keep in mind, if you are going hold forth in public you must be prepared for criticism. emoticon_cry \n \n \n \n \n No, you're incorrect. If Gallop was to take a poll to see how many people would vote for Bush in 2004, and 50% said yes, would it be wrong in saying \"50% of all Americans want Bush in 04\"? No. Why? Because polls represent a group of people. That is the purpose of polls. If you don't like this purpose, I suggest you ignore polls altogether. Your second point on how the survey I showed you was \"illogical\" or what not, is so ignorant I'm baffled. You obviously have no idea how how surveys are taken, especially this specific survey which homosexuals condone. Finally, your statement \"You should pick up a book on logic it might help your arguments\" is in itself a logical fallacy!.\n\n \n Mon petite, the biggest joke in the world is that polls are in anyway accurate. Only sheep folow them. Be a leader Parcum step and think for yourself. BTW, I do ignore polls because they have no value. \n \n \n Your second point on how the survey I showed you was \"illogical\" or what not, is so ignorant I'm baffled.!. \n\n \n Oh how quickly you lapsed into hypocrisy. Wasn't it just the last paragraph in which you chided me for personal attacks? Unlike you, I can take it as well as dish it. :) \n \n \n \n \n Certianly, but it's not lacking in my post either. You tend to rely too much on emotion and that I personally need to know or have conversations with homosexuals to make assumptions. You have the knowledge to argue the subject, but rely too much on this ad hominum. I don't need to know homosexuals to base my belief. I don't need to have conversations with homosexuals to support my argument. \n\n \n There we go with the word of the day again. Well Parcum, it is to be expected, I am after all a woman. You know how emotional we tend to be. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \"Hasty Generalization\" is a logical term, meaning that the sample is too small to make an assumption. You weren't making a hasty generalization, but you were asking me to, in this statement:\n \n \"You seem to rely heavily on what you have read about homosexuality and sexual behavior in general rather than on your own experiences with heterosexual intercourse or on in depth conversations with a wide cross section of homosexuals (to include lesbians). Therefore, you simply do not have the frame of reference to make these arguments. You do not know all homosexuals or even almost all homosexuals so your argument is nothing more than ill informed conjecture.\" \n \n Although your last statement is correct- I don't know all homosexuals, the entire paragraph is incorrect, because you're telling me that I need experience with homosexuals before I can make an argument. The \"wide cross section of homosexuals\" is what surveys do. That is the point of surveys, so we know what a large amount of people do. \n\n \n Tell me Parcum is there any reason for your posts to be so mind numbingly obtuse? You can make any argument you like based on whatever info you have. It is done all the time. But if you want to capture the imagination, it would help if you relied on your own orignal thought rather than on someone elses. Your arguments on this topic have felt ... mmm I dunno... somewhat one dimensional, shallow and boring, boring, boring. Quoting from books and statistics you did not collect will do that. \n \n \n Girl, I suggest you work on your maturity. You seem to be having some problems. \n\n \n I will give your suggestion some serious consideration. emoticon_xclown \n \n \n \n [/QUOTE]What are you talking about? Hasty generalizations are what caused war. It causes racism. If I were to ask 50 Hispanics their GPA, and they all said 4.0, would that mean that the average GPA for Hispanics is a 4.0? No! This is what caused miscommunication and conflicts throughout history! [/QUOTE]\n \n They also cause homophobia and gay bashing. That is why your own hasty generalizations are so dangerous.",

   "Definition: (3) ad hominem (tu quoque): this form of attack on the\n person notes that a person does not practise what he\n preaches.\n\n \n Actually, she was just using the circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem. \nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent's particular circumstances. For example:\n \n \"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food. How can you argue otherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\n \n This is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent's argument.\n\n \n Ad hominem tu quoque is something else entirely. \nTu quoque\n This is the famous \"you too\" fallacy. It occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it. For instance:\n \n \"You're just being randomly abusive.\"\n \n \"So? You've been abusive too.\"\n \n This is a personal attack, and is therefore a special case of Argumentum ad Hominem.\n\n \n I hope you don't have an upcoming logic exam, or else I would suggest you get off the internet and hit the books ;). \n \n \nTheir thesis is wrong- their support may or may not be wrong, however. GE's thesis was \"Because you don't know homosexuals, your argument isn't good\". That argument was proven wrong because it's a logical fallacy. \n\n \n Her argument may be ad hominem, that doesn't mean it is \"wrong\". Using a logical fallacy as support for an argument doesn't make the person's argument wrong, it's just not a valid dismissal of your arguments in and of itself. \n \n \nMizmax, stop making insults. \n\n \n It was conjecture, not at all insult.\n \n \nDavid Morrison, a homosexual, is an excellent writer, and very truthful. I suggest you read his book \"Beyond Gay'.\n\n \n I doubt this book would be helpful to someone who isn't feeling guilty or bad about their healthy sexual desires and/or deep love for another person. Morrison is just a \"kinder, gentler\" version of the \"reparative therapy\" types, and he even admits that there is no evidence to support the idea that homosexuality can (or should) be \"cured\".\n \n I would refer you instead to this site- Dignity.",
