   "Indeed Dsa, let's look at what the founder's thought about the idea that \"the people should choose whom they please to govern them.\" (Powell v. McCormack)\n \n \"...state practice immediately after the ratification of the Constitution refutes the majority's suggestion that the Qualifications Clauses were commonly understood as being exclusive. Five States supplemented the constitutional disqualifications in their very first election laws, and the surviving records suggest that the legislatures of these States considered and rejected the interpretation of the Constitution that the majority adopts today.\" (Thornton. Thomas, J. dissenting)\n \n Thomas goes on to provide proof that the Qualification Clause was not a limitation upon the State's right to imposed additional requirements as they saw fit. Even today there are many qualifications imposed by the States on the Federal Legislators. I think that a serious look into the history books shows that the Qualification Clause was not meant to be a restriction on the right of a State to impose any additional requirement it felt was necessary.",

The basic logic at the bottom of this debate is simple: If the States can impose one qualification, why not two? or If a State cannot impose a certain qualification, why should it be allowed to impose others?",

   "You and Thomas both, as usual commit the naturalistic fallacy of assuming that just because something is (or in this case, was), thats how it ought to be. I don't care if the legislatures decided it was ok before, the fact is it should have been ok then, and it definitely isn't ok now (I'm not an original intentist, remember?). The point is especially invalid because states don't \"consider and [accept or] reject\" constitutional interpretations, that isn't their function. The courts do that.\n \n States shouldn't be allowed to impose qualifications, especially ones that are specifically targeted at someone who already has shown popular approval.\n \n Finally, because you so love the quotations of the founders, here is one in Steven's opinion:\n \"The qualifications of the persons who may choose or be chosen, as has been remarked upon other occasions, are defined and fixed in the Constitution, and are unalterable by the legislature.\" (Alexander Hamilton, Fed #60)",

   "Dsa,\n \n So you believe that \"the people of each State must leave open the possibility that they will trust someone with their vote in Congress even though they do not trust him with a vote in the election for Congress\"? (Thomas) The \"living Constitution\" interpretation finds no basis in history (forget original intent at this point).\n \n The problem with Thornton is that the facts contradict the judgement. The cases was decided on the idea that \"the people should choose whom they please to govern them,\" (Powell v. McCormack) yet Amendment 73 was adopted, not by the State legislators, but by the people of Arkansas. Thornton finds no footing in the Constitution.\n \n Interesting quote by Hamilton, until you look at the context. \"But this forms no part of the power to be conferred upon the national government. Its authority would be expressly restricted to the regulation of the TIMES, the PLACES, the MANNER of elections. The qualifications of the persons who may choose or be chosen, as has been remarked upon other occasions, are defined and fixed in the Constitution, and are unalterable by the legislature.\" Hamilton is talking about the Federal Legislature, not those of the States.",

   "Thorton deals with the federal legislature as well. States are currently free to adopt termlimit laws for state elections (and many have).\n \n Thorton finds plenty of footing in the constitution. A mere majority vote can't impinge on the democratic values of a minority, for the same reason why we can't vote to deny all folks with \"Henry\" as their name the right to vote. In federal elections (constitutionally), and in state elections (morally), there can be no qualifications outside those expressly put in by the constitution.\n \n The \"dead\" constitution theory (AKA, \"founding fathers are idols\") doesn't find any basis in history either. At least a living document has some basis in common sense, as the founders most likely didnt consider themselves Gods, and the constitutions purposeful difficultly in amending makes it seem likely that it is designed to be able to adapt and evolve somewhat to new time periods and eras.\n Thomas is probably not the best person to keep on citing... :)",

   "Dsa,\n \n Thornton says basically that an Amendment to a State Constitution is not a valid way to impose term limits because it goes against the will of the people. The Court goes on to say that the only way term limits can be imposed is through a Federal Amendment. There are two main problems with Thornton: 1) extra qualifications on Federal legislators, as imposed by States, were perfectly acceptable to the framers. 2) The Court said that it was preserving the right of the people to choose whom they please while completely ignoring the fact that it was the people who did not want to vote for a two or three term incumbent. I have not read the whole majority opinion in a while, but if I remember correctly the Court does not use the Const. as its basis for the ruling. If I am wrong about that please quote the majority opinion for me.",

   "Apparently the people DO want to vote for 2 or 3 term incumbants because...2 or 3 term incumbants keep getting re-elected. Furthermore, because termlimits are a statewide imposition on a districtwide election, basically even if the people in NW arkansas liked their 7 term rep and wanted to keep him and DID vote against the amendment, little rock voters who liked the idea of term limits (even though they continue to vote for their 5 term incumbant again :) ) are preventing them from doing so. Outside group saying who you can and cant make your representative = undemocratic.\n You know what I am going to say about the framers, so I won't repeat it again. :)\n From US Term limits (Stevens) \"If there is one watchword for representation of the various states in Congress, it is uniformity. Federal legislators speak to national issues that affect the citizens of every state. . . . The uniformity in qualifications mandated in Article 1 provides the tenor and the fabric for representation in the Congress. Piecemeal restrictions by State would flyin the face of that order.\" His opinion was based on article I of the constitution.",

   "Dsa,\n \n A \"Democratic Republic\" is where the people elect the people that make the laws, but also have direct influence in some laws. It goes without question that certain people will not get their way, but the majority should always prevail. Such was the case in Thornton. By a vote of 60% to 40% the people of Arkansas adopted Amendment 73, this is a huge majority in modern days. Saying that Amendment 73 shouldn't stand because the people in NW Arkansas don't like it, is the same as saying that Amendment 20 of the US Const should not have been adopted because not every State wanted Presidential term limits.\n \n Stevens forgot to consult history when he made the statement you quote. Never have the qualifications of federal legislators been \"uniform\" throughout all of the States. Even today there are many and diverse qualifications imposed by States upon their federal legislators that are not questioned as to their Constitutional basis. Why then should term limits be treated any different than those qualifications already in place?",

   "\"Today's decision also means that no State may disqualify congressional candidates whom a court has found to be mentally incompetent, who are currently in prison, or who have past vote-fraud convictions. Likewise, after today's decision, the people of each State must leave open the possibility that they will trust someone with their vote in Congress even though they do not trust him with a vote in the election for Congress.\" (Thomas, dissenting) (citiation omited)\n \n Amend 20 had to be a Federal Amendment because the President is the only person who represents the nation as a whole. The federal Congressmen are representing their respective State, and it should be the right of each State to impose such limitations and qualifications on their legislators, State or Federal, as it feel are necessary to protect the integrity of the post.",
