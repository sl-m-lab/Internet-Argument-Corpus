How will allowing more people to marry the person they love destroy it?\n\n I tend to think the whole marriage thing is more of a religious union and the 'institution of marriage' does not belong to any one church to decide what that is for anyone other than it's own members. As such, the government should not license or perform any marriages (seperation of church and state), only civil unions. Churches should still be free to perform marriages or unions in holy matrimony but they should not be regulated by the government, only recognized by the government as a civil union for legal purposes like taxes. If a gay church wants to marry gay people that should be up to the church, not the government. Then again, I'm a straight, atheist, hetero so it doesn't effect me one way or the other.",
