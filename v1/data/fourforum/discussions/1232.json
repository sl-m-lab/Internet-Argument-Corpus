So, that means that up til the 17th century (A period when the Church was at its greatest power and control) there were more Muslims holding more land in the world? What parts of the new world were Islamic?\n \n Islam is the fastest growing belief system in the world now, though. 1.8 billion (adjusted) Christians to 1.3 billion Muslims.

   "Really? I know that you'd like to believe that, but by the looks of it, you are wrong, but then again they aren't using Christianity's favorite method of \"conversion\". Believe or die!\n \n Here is a comparison between Islam and Christianity.\n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/comp_isl_chr.htm\n\n \n Did you know that web-site is Islamic? Why are you openly pushing a Muslim interpretation of Christianity? (I suggest this because they say \"Jesus (pbuh)\" which means 'peace be upon him' which is they way Muslims write about 'prophets'.\n \n Earlier you said that Islam is where Christianity was 300 years or so ago. Do you realise the implications of the logic in this statement? It suggests that Judaism, an older religion should be even more 'liberal' than Christianity, and that Scientology (debateable if it is a religion at all) is even more reactionary than Islam.\n \n Tell me, how has Islam 'progressed' to the point where they are still 300 years behind us... that is, how has the treatment of women changed between when Muhammed first declared that hell was full of them, to now.\n \n I have come across the (small 'l') liberal-educated person before who wishes that there would be peace harmony and understanding betwixt Islam and Christianity. Unfortunately this is projecting the thinkers own liberal idealogies onto the two faiths. Does Islam actually accord itself to liberal ideas?\n \n One of these liberal notions, encouraged by Isalmic people is that Islam is progressive, because it enshrined rights for women. Further, that men and women are equal in Islam. There is a germ of truth in this, but it is such a superficial treatment that it's not worth repeating by liberals.\n \n Are women equal in Islam? \"Men have fear of your Lord, who created you from a single soul. From that soul He created its mate and through them He bestrewed the earth with countless men and women\" (Sura 4:1). This clearly suggests that men and women were created from the same substance. Muslims will point to this as 'proof' that men and women are considered equal in Islam. However, Sura 2:228 states \"Women shall with justice have rights similar to those exercised against them, although men have a status above women.\" However this difference in status runs much deeper. In legal testimony, \"Call in two male witnesses from among you, but if two men cannot be found, then one man and two women whom you judge fit to act as witnesses\" (Sura 2:282), in other words a woman's testimony is worth half of a man's.\n \n Can Muslim women be beaten? \"Good women are obedient. They guard their unseen parts because God has guarded them. As for those from whom you fear disobedience, admonish them and send them to beds apart and beat them\" (Sura 4:34) (though some Islamic scholars claim that this is a symbolic 'beating' only where-by the husband just 'taps' his wife on the arm. Although the wording does not say it should be but a symbolic tap, it should be noted anyway that it still points to male domination over women. (and it is an interpretation that is in the minority)\n \n It is clear that Muhammed 'loved' women, he kept nine wives and numerous concubines. But is this love? What did he invoke his followers to do? \"Omar reported from the Holy Prophet (Muhammed) who said, 'No man shall be questioned for beating his wife.'\" (Al Hadis, Vol. 1, p. 215) \n \"The prophet said: 'When a man calls his wife to bed and she does not come, the husband spends the night being angry with her, and the angels curse her until morning. The one who is in heaven is displeased with her until the husband is pleased with her.'\"(Sahih hadith, chapter 558) \n \n \"The Prophet (Muhammed) said: 'I was shown the Hell-fire and that the majority of its dwellers were women who were ungrateful.' It was asked, 'Do they disbelieve in Allah?' (or are they ungrateful to Allah?) He replied, 'They are ungrateful to their husbands and are ungrateful for the favours and the good (charitable deeds) done to them. If you have always been good (benevolent) to one of them and then she sees something in you (not of her liking), she will say, 'I have never received any good from you.'\" (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 1:2:28) \n \n \"Abu Sayeed al-Khodri reported that Muhammed was talking to a group of women when he said, '... I see the majority of you will go to Hell.' The women asked why, to which Muhammed responded, 'You often curse and are ungrateful to your companions.' He then told them they had a basic defect in their nature, to which they responded, 'How?' Muhammed answered, 'Is not the attestation (knowledge and witness) of a women only worth half of a man's? And that is on account of her short intelligence.'\"(Al-Hadis, Vol. 3, p. 137)\n \n Okay, so these words of Islam were written years ago. What relevance do they have today? Can I remind you that the Koran is seen as the word of their god. To question it is to commit blasphemy. The Haddiths are the doings of Muhammed. Moslems believe that he was the most perfect of men, that his example should be followed. In Islam, women are clearly inferior to Men.\n The list goes on...\n \n \"Allah's Apostle once said to a group of women : 'I have not seen any one more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. A cautious, sensible man could be led astray by some of you.' The women asked: 'O Allah's Apostle, what is deficient in our intelligence and religion?' He said: 'Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?' They replied in the affirmative. He said: 'This is the deficiency of your intelligence' ... 'Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?' The women replied in the affirmative. He said: 'This is the deficiency in your religion.'?Sahih Bukhari, Arabic-English translation, 1 Hadith No. 301. See also vol. 3, Hadith No. 826.\n \"The prophet of Allah said: When a man calls his wife to satisfy his desire, let her come to him though she is occupied at the oven.\"\n Mishkat al-Masabih, English translation, Book I, Section 'Duties of husband and wife', Hadith No. 61\n \n Islam protects children is another claim made. In pre-Islamic Arabia there was the frequent practice of female infanticide; the killing of unwanted female children. Islam stopped this. But how does Islam evoke protection of female children?\n Let?s look at the Haddiths (Volume 7, Book 62, Number 64: Narrated 'Aisha')\n that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death).\n Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 64, from http://www.quraan.com/Bukhari/62.asp\n \n Thus when the Ayatollah Khemani married a ten year old (he was twenty at the time), he was simply following the example of Muhammed?. Yes there are child-marriages going on in non-Muslim areas of the world, but please remember that\n in Islam it is actually supported by their leader. It is done BECAUSE of their religious beliefs.\n Furthermore, \n \"...[T]he Prophet (Muhammed) said to her (Aisha), 'You have been shown to me twice in my dream. I saw you pictured on a piece of silk and someone said (to me). 'This is your wife.' When I uncovered the picture, I saw that it was yours. I said, 'If this is from Allah, it will be done.'\" (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 5:58:235). Remember, that she was only a child. He is fantasising about a little girl.\n \n Thus when the Ayatollah Khemani married a ten year old (he was twenty at the time), he was simply following the example of Muhammed?.

He is the most perfect of men? so to follow his example is actually seen by Moslems as a good thing. One counter-argument to this was that because Muhammed only ever had one child, he couldn?t have possibly had sex with all these females. But, remember, the Haddith of Aisha is quite specific, and it is a Haddith that Muslims teach!\n \n For instance it (your web-site) says that racism is not approved by Islam by is practiced by Muslims.\n \n They forget the words of their founder because Muhammed didn?t just loathe women and non-Muslims, but black people as well?\"Abu Darda reported that the Holy Prophet (Muhammed) said: Allah created Adam when he created him. Then He stroke his right shoulder and took out a white race as if they were seeds, and He stroke his left shoulder and took out a black race as if they were coals. Then He said to those who were in his right side: Towards paradise and I don't care. He said to those who were on his left shoulder: Towards Hell and I don't care.\"\n (Hadith, Mishkat ul-Masabih, translated by Karim, v. iii, p. 117)\n \n Muhammed spends much time talking of hate and war and violence.\n \"As for those who are slain in the cause of God, He will not allow their works to perish. ... He will admit them to the Paradise He has made known to them.\" (47:8)\n \n \"Let those who would exchange the life of this world for the hereafter, fight for the cause of God; whether he dies or triumphs, We shall richly reward him. ... The true believers fight for the cause of God, but the infidels fight for the devil. Fight then against the friends of Satan ...\" (4:74,76)\n \"The believers who stay at home??apart from those that suffer a grave impediment??are not the equals of those who fight for the cause of God with their goods and their persons. God has given those that fight with their goods and their persons a higher rank than those who stay at home ...\" (4:95,96)\n \"Slay the idolaters wherever you find them. ... lie in ambush everywhere for them. If they repent and take to prayer and render the alms levy, allow them to go their way ...\" (9:5)\n \"Those that make war against God and His apostle and spread disorder in the land shall be put to death or crucified or have their hands and feet cut off on alternate sides, or be banished from the land. They shall be held up to shame in this world and sternly punished in the hereafter: except those that repent before you reduce them ...\" (5:34,35)\n \"Make war on them until idolatry shall cease and God?s religion shall reign supreme\" (8:39)\n \"Prophet, rouse the faithful to arms. If there are twenty steadfast men among you, they shall vanquish two hundred; and if there are a hundred, they shall rout a thousand unbelievers, for they are devoid of understanding.\" (8:65)\n \"Fight against such of those to whom the Scriptures were given ... and do not embrace the true Faith, until they pay tribute out of hand and are utterly subdued.\" (9:29)\n \"Allah's Apostle (Muhammed) said, 'Know that Paradise is under the shades of swords.'\" \n (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 4:52:73) \n \"Allah's Apostle (Muhammed) said, 'The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. \"O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him.'\" \n (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 52, Number 177) \n \"The Prophet (Muhammed) said: 'When the slave runs away from his master, his prayer is not accepted; he is an infidel.'\" \n (Hadith No. Muslim 32) \n \"The Prophet (Muhammed) said: 'Then go to the persons who do not join the congregational prayer and order their homes to be burnt...'\" \n (Hadith No. Muslim 234) \n \"Narrated 'Abdullah: Allah's Apostle (Muhammed) said, 'The blood of a Muslim who confesses that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that I am His Apostle, cannot be shed except in three cases: In Qisas for murder, a married person who commits illegal sexual intercourse and the one who reverts from Islam (apostate) and leaves the Muslims.'\" \n (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 9:83:17)\n \"The Prophet (Muhammad) said: 'Do not stone the adulteress who is pregnant until she has had her child.' After the birth she was put into a ditch up to her chest and the Prophet commanded them to stone her. Khalid came forward with a stone which he threw at her head, and there spurted blood on the face of Khalid and he cursed her. The gentle Prophet prayed over her and she was buried.\" \n (Hadith No. Muslim 682) \n \"Bani An-Nadir and Bani Quraiza fought, so the Prophet (Muhammad) exiled Bani An-Nadir and allowed Bani Quraiza to remain at their places. He then killed their men and distributed their women, children and property among the Muslims, but some of them came to the Prophet and he granted them safety, and they embraced Islam. He exiled all the Jews from Medina. They were the Jews of Bani Qainuqa', the tribe of 'Abdullah bin Salam and the Jews of Bani Haritha and all the other Jews of Medina.\" \n (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 5:59:362)\n \"Narrated Anas: 'Some people from the tribe of 'Ukl came to the Prophet (Muhammed) and embraced Islam. The climate of Medina did not suit them, so the Prophet ordered them to go to the camels of charity and to drink, their milk and urine. They did so, and after they had recovered from their ailment (became healthy) they turned renegades (reverted from Islam) and killed the shepherd of the camels and took the camels away. The Prophet sent (some people) in their pursuit and so they were (caught and) brought, and the Prophet ordered that their hands and legs should be cut off and that their eyes should be branded with heated pieces of iron, and that their cut hands and legs should not be cauterized, till they die.'\" \n (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 8:82:794)\n \n There is no Islamic equivalent of ?turn the other cheek?, or ?blessed are the peacemakers?. What about ?love thy neighbour??\n \"O you who believe! Do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.\" (Koran 5:51)\n \"O ye who believe! Take not for friends Unbelievers (non-Muslims) rather than believers: Do ye wish to offer Allah an open proof against yourselves?\" \n (Koran 4:144) \n \"Thou seest many of them turning in friendship to the Unbelievers (non-Muslims). Evil indeed are (the works) which their souls have sent forward before them (with the result), that Allah's wrath is on them, and in torment will they abide.\" \n (Koran 5:80)\n \n I must stress that these are teachings revered by Muslims! They saw it as clever that Muhammed massacred PoWs; that it was prudent that he order assinations; that he was a real man that he slept with so many women!\n \n The major problem about progress for Islam is that there concept of the Koran is that it is the direct word from god. To argue against it isn't a matter of a mistranslation, or that the writer was only 'inspired' by god. To argue against it is to argue against their god himself!",

   "There are differences on the view of marriage\n \n Christ said that anyone who re-marries is committing adultery.\n \n Muhammed allowed 'temporary marriages' Though only some Muslims still practice this...\n \n Though there are important differences between Twelve-Imam Shi'ism and Sunnism on the level of the principles of the religion (usul al-din), on the level of the sharia and fiqh or jurisprudence there are surprisingly few places where Shi'i or 'Ja'fari' law differs from all four Sunni schools, the Hanaf'i, Hanbali, Maliki, and Shafi'i. Perhaps the most important difference occurs in relation to the institution of mut'a, or 'temporary marriage'. The Sunni authorities agree that mut'a was permitted by the Prophet at certain points during his lifetime, but they maintain that in the end he prohibited it completely. In contrast the Shi'is maintain that the Prophet did not ban it, and they cite numerous hadith from Sunni as well as Shi'i sources to prove this. Having established its legality, they then devote tremendous care and attention to defining its legal status and all the rules and regulations connected with it. \n http://www.al-islam.org/al-serat/muta/\n \n Thus a temporary marriage is an excuse to visit prostitutes; you can temporarily marry the prostitute, then divorce her in the morning.\n \n Further seems as one writer found it permissable to issue a Muslim web-site comparing Christianity to Islam, so I now offer the reverse...\n \n http://www.answering-islam.org/Women/place.html\n \n focussing on the views of each religion towards women...",

It was an unknown concept to most. \n \n These groups which you speak of were seen as heretics and castouts by the main Church which held power in Europe.\n\n \n What a terrible case of cultural imperialism! You need to look out beyond the Anglo-Saxon USA as a be-all and end-all of your world. Your whole argument is not a counter to mine! It is WASP history at its worst! It's actually quite an insulting thing to say to people like me who aren't American, who also believe in democracy. So, we've got you to thank for living in a 'free world', huh?\n \n Firstly, 'the main Church which held power in Europe' - when are we talking about? If you mean 300-400 years ago, then the Orthodox Church, it covered most of Europe both by terms of area and population. But you're occidental world view ignores this. As to them being 'heretics' (again your post-Catholic bias showing) yes they were radical Christians. That's what I said. Radical Christians form the basis of modern democracy, now you're denying this.\n \n Democracy in the USA, if we're even to confine our argument to that, stems from the ideas of the 'Glorious Revolution' of 1688 in Britain, which itself harks back to the movements of the Levellers, the Diggers etc, that I mentioned earlier, and which you've completely ignored by trying to redefine the boundaries not only in time, but in space as well, by confining things to just the USA. The democracy of the USA was hijacked by a great many agnostics, which is why it never became a true democracy - with a large number of people disenfranchised because of property status, sex, or skin colour.\n \n Are you now saying that the USA is a model of democracy? I bet you're not!\n \n Do you acknowledge that your atheistic founding fathers approved of slavery? Do you acknowledge that Christians in UK and USA (Wilberforce and Garrison, respectively) were at the forefront of ending slavery in those nations? I bet you've never even considered that, so quick are you to bag all religions.\n \n \nDid you know that the Pope is one of the only absolute rulers in the world now? Even though he rules no nation other than the Vatican. His very word is suppose to be absolute law to over 1 billion Catholics. And if he wanted to he could excommunicate any who defy his wishes. He can not be questioned on what he says for any reason.\n\n \n Define 'absolute'.\n \n The Pope is elected.\n \n But again, confining your argument to your own experience. You've had dealings with the Catholic Church, and you're American, so you're argument is only against Catholicism and in terms of American experience and you're arguing against ALL of Christianity on the little you know.\n \n Take for instance you've overlooked the fact that the leader of North Korea is an atheist and an absolute ruler. You'd in fact have more chance being Pope than you would of being head of North Korea (being as the later is only open to children of the leader). What does this prove? As much as you having a go at the Pope. But you're irrationally intent on bringing them down.\n \n And you ignore the main thrust of this thread... on Islam. You've had very little to say other than a backwards admission that Islam is pretty repressive now - but hey, all religions are!\n \n This is of course an insult to Buddhists everywhere. You tar them with the same brush.\n \n But again, compare the teachings of Muhammad to Christ. Chalk and cheese.",

I ask you again, show me the testimony to condemn Jesus!\n\n \n Let him spoke in his own words, not hearsay from the bible.\n \n \nShow me the causality.\n \n \n The Inquisition, Crusades, the Burning Times, etc, etc.\n \n \nTell me what the lie of the Crusades was? You have the most sparse use of facts that I've ever come across. Such a bland statement that the 'Crusades were based on a lie' what ever that was!\n\n \n That the Muslims had taken over the holy land and were oppressing Christians there. It turns out that they more or less tolerated each other.\n \n \nThe Holy Roman Empire? Which one? It's amazing the pap comments you are coming up with. Half of Europe was Orthodox. Show me when they were ruled by the Holy Roman Empire (any of them!)\n\n \n Irrelevant. They both used the network already in place left behind by the Roman Empire to their advantage.\n \n \n \nYour whole argument consists of brandishing all religion as abhorrent, and ignoring facts and spouting generalisations. Hardly rational. And your rationale is you hate religion.\n\n \n I see no difference between any of the dominance based religions.",

   "You'd be wrong (again)\n\n \n The manner in which you use the term liberal is much like they did during the McCarthy Era.\n \n \nWhat a terrible case of cultural imperialism! You need to look out beyond the Anglo-Saxon USA as a be-all and end-all of your world. Your whole argument is not a counter to mine! It is WASP history at its worst! It's actually quite an insulting thing to say to people like me who aren't American, who also believe in democracy. So, we've got you to thank for living in a 'free world', huh?\n\n \n Get real. If it wasn't for the American founding fathers there wouldn't be any democracy in the world now. BTW, my ancestry is not anglo-saxon at all. You are assuming far too much.\n \n \nAre you now saying that the USA is a model of democracy? I bet you're not!\n\n \n It is the first in modern history to be put into affect, even if somewhat flawed. No others had succeeded as much.\n \n \nDo you acknowledge that your atheistic founding fathers approved of slavery?\n\n \n Who said anything about them being atheists? Or that they were mine? Many of them were deists. Dispite their religious upbringing they knew the dangers of what it meant when Church and State were one. That is why so many had left England in the first place. Canada never had an official policy of slavery as the USA had.\n \n \nDo you acknowledge that Christians in UK and USA (Wilberforce and Garrison, respectively) were at the forefront of ending slavery in those nations? I bet you've never even considered that, so quick are you to bag all religions.\n\n \n There are always heretics in any belief system.\n \n \nDefine 'absolute'.\n\n \n In this context;\n \n Without conditions or limitations\n \n \nThe Pope is elected.\n\n \n By all of the Catholics in the world? :)\n \n \nBut again, confining your argument to your own experience. You've had dealings with the Catholic Church, and you're American, so you're argument is only against Catholicism and in terms of American experience and you're arguing against ALL of Christianity on the little you know.\n\n \n Wrong on many accounts. I'm not an American. I'm Canadian. It even says so under my name to the left-hand side of the screen. :)Considering that the vast majority of Christians in the world are Catholic it makes all others into heretics. \n \n BTW, the primary form of Christianity in the USA is Protestantism (56%), and Catholics (28%, 2002). Even then the USA is the third most populous Catholic country in the world.\n \n \nTake for instance you've overlooked the fact that the leader of North Korea is an atheist and an absolute ruler.\n\n \n One thing you may not realize that most far eastern religions are non-theistic in nature. So, calling him an atheists is irrelevant.\n \n North Korea:\n Traditionally Buddhist and Confucianist, some Christian and syncretic Chondogyo (Religion of the Heavenly Way) (They do have religious freedom, of a sort .}\n \n South Korea:\n Christian 49%, Buddhist 47%, Confucianist 3%, Shamanist, Chondogyo (Religion of the Heavenly Way), and other 1% \n \n The majority religious belief in South Korea is more non-theistic than theistic as is in the North.\n \n \nYou'd in fact have more chance being Pope than you would of being head of North Korea (being as the later is only open to children of the leader). What does this prove? As much as you having a go at the Pope. But you're irrationally intent on bringing them down.\n\n \n non sequitur\n \n \nAnd you ignore the main thrust of this thread... on Islam. You've had very little to say other than a backwards admission that Islam is pretty repressive now - but hey, all religions are!\n\n \n Correction, all dominance based religions are. BTW, I've stated in other threads that I mean dominance based religions.\n \n \nThis is of course an insult to Buddhists everywhere. You tar them with the same brush.\n\n \n Irrelevant.\n \n \nBut again, compare the teachings of Muhammad to Christ. Chalk and cheese.\n\n \n At least they had first hand accounts of Muhammad. All they have of Christ are third or more hand accounts. With nothing written during his lifetime. Not even an account of his execution by the Romans and they were fanatics at record keeping.",

Yes, I understand you suggest that there was a party that 'evolved' into the Republicans, but Washington wasn't even elected by popular vote.

Logic, too isn't your strong-point.\n \n \nHeretics which had went against the established system.\n\n \n Circular reasoning. Anyone who went against slavery had to have gone against the established system! The system was established (by your own argument; by atheists). Therefore these Christians went against the established system. They were 'heretics' in that sense. However, they followed Christian values, not secularist ones.

Some years ago, and for some years I never went to Church. I was always someone who believed in Christ. But I wasn't religious because I didn't belong to any denomination.\n \n \nAnd you can't either since there are no words by Christ in the bible. It is all just hearsay.\n\n \n Again your bias. Even if it were hearsay, then show me the words 'attributed' to Jesus that you object too. You can't even do that! Show me what you are actually objecting to, even if it's just hearsay. You can't.

There are some that are not.\n \n Take the Nazis. Anyone might recognise that this is at it's centre an evil ideology. A 'liberal' who is trying to find the good in everyone might say 'Okay, but not all Nazis are bad'.\n \n Sure, there is some truth to that. There are good people, there are bad people, wherever you go.\n \n There are a great many good Muslims.\n \n But Islam itself is not a tolerant religion. The founder of Islam was a man who followed his baser desires. He married a nine-year old girl. He had nine wives, and many concubines. He lead armies into battle and ordered the execution of PoWs. He ordered that people who are Muslim should not convert (to be an 'apostate'). The crime of apostasy still carries the death-penalty in some nations.\n \n Likewise, while we in the secular west believe in plurality of ideas, it is not so throughout Islamic nations. Saudi Arabia; an American ally, won't allow anyone to preach their own religion to Moslems. Many Islamic states hold similar laws.\n \n It was my intent to try to reverse or correct a growing liberal trend; the belief that Islam is an oppressed religion.\n \n It is an oppressive belief system. It is so, because it's founder was a part-time desert pirate who's raiders got lucky and struck out at the Byzantine and Persian empires exactly when these two regional super-powers were exhausted after slogging it out against each other for decades; the Persian Empire fell in a year to Islam, the Byzantine Empire lasted; but lost vast amounts of territory.",

I see that you don't know what logic is either.\n \n \nCircular reasoning. Anyone who went against slavery had to have gone against the established system! The system was established (by your own argument; by atheists). Therefore these Christians went against the established system. They were 'heretics' in that sense. However, they followed Christian values, not secularist ones. Secularists had established that some men were inferior.\n\n \n Man, are you ever screwed up.\n \n \nI wrote \"What about the Pope? An absolute ruler? No, he's accountable to God. He's elected by his peers.\"\n \n Huh? I'm not saying that everything he says isn't from his God.

I asked you to define it, you haven't, because you don't really have a definition. Australia too in a sense uses Magna Carta. We too are an evolving democracy.\n \n \n What you mean France wasn't a success? Britain wasn't a success?\n\n \n \n The French Revolution was AFTER the American Revolution. The USA was the first.\n\n \n So? Britain was before the USA. They had a parliament which was just as representative as the USA system - because in effect even today no one directly votes for the US president... it's the electoral college that counts. If Britain was a democracy before the USA, and France after, then why is the USA the 'first modern democracy'?\n \n \n When I went to school, Modern History for us began at the French Revolution, therefore the founding of the USA was just before 'Modern History' began. I understand that different educational spheres have delineated a different starting point for the modern world.\n \n \n \n You seem to forget Canada's other heritage.\n \n \n What's this got to do with the price of fish? I said that modern history is sometimes said to have begun at the French Revolution. Therefore it could be said that France is the first modern democracy, because the US Revolution is too early to be considered modern. This is you fault for not defining your statement about the USA being the first modern democracy.\n \n \n Who did? The atheists; Hume, and Locke!\n \n \n \n Slavery existed in the colonies before there was a USA.\n \n \n Yes, that's right. Locke, an atheist helped write the charter for the Carolinas, enshrining slavery. The USA founding fathers had the opportunity to end it in 1776 when they declared independence, or later when they drew up the Constitution, but they didn't. Why does this keep escaping you? I know these facts are frustrating to your anti-religious argument, but you'll just have to deal with them.\n \n \n I said \"Your champion atheists founded a nation based on slavery.\" And you agree that the founders of the USA were atheists.\n \n \n \n Where did I said anything like that..\n \n \n Come come, don't be coy!\n \n In post 26 you quote me saying...\n \n\"The birth (or re-birth) of democracy in the West was because of Christianity. Radical religious groups such as the Quakers, Levellers etc. saw that as each of us is created in God's image, we are all, men and women, equal.\"\n \n \n And you said...\n \nWrong\n \n \n So you don't agree that the founding fathers were radical Christians. Plain and simple. You admit that 'some/many' had fled to America. That's it.\n \n In post 35 when you said \nWho said anything about them being atheists? ... Many of them were deists.\"\n\n \n So, 'some' of them are atheists. 'Many' of them are deists, but not radicals, nor non-radicals either, according to you. You keep bandying about such loose terms as 'they' and 'many', it's hard for you to follow your argument.\n \n But then again in Post7 you did say \nChristianity is growing at a stagnant rate of around 2.3% per year.\n If it's stagnant, it's not growing! Sometimes you show an inability to know what you're saying\n \n \nHuh? Let's look... you claim that the founders of the USA weren't Christian, but atheists.\n \n Deist:\n 1. A person who believes that God created the universe and then abandoned it\n\n \n So, I know what a deist is. Some deists believe that god no longer exists, therefore they are atheists... god does not exist now.\n \n \nThe USA was founded with slavery entrenched. Therefore 'man, do you ever have it wrong'.\n\n \n \nIrrelevant. The Constitution made it wrong.\n\n \n What? The same constitution that made the USA the model of democracy? But you're the one arguing that they are the exemplar model of democracy! Yet Britain ended slavery before the USA did; and they didn't have half the nation rise up in arms to defend slavery either! So it's not the people who wrote the Constitution, it's the Constitution itself that's at fault. It must have a life of its own.\n \n \nHuh? Washington wasn't a Republican!\n\n \n \nDid say that he was.\n\n \n You said that the Republicans, or what would become the Republican party tried to make a monarchy in the USA. But you reply too soon anyway...\n \n \nThe 'Republican Party' was founded in the 1850s. History isn't your strong-point.\n\n \n \nDidn't say that they were republicans either. I had said that it was those conservatives types who would later be the bases for it. You are a bit hung up on sementics. I guess that thinking isn't your strong point either.\n\n \n They're your words... Next I said... \n \nYes, I understand you suggest that there was a party that 'evolved' into the Republicans, but Washington wasn't even elected by popular vote. None of the first presidents, regardless of the party, were elected by popular vote!\n\n \n And you reply...\n \n \nBut he still wasn't appointed as king as the conservatives of the time wanted.\n\n \n Now you're really off your nut? Let me summarize, the USA, founded as the ideal democracy by a large group of people who either believed that God never existed or did once exist create your perfect state, which includes slavery, but it's not they're fault, it's the constitution that made it wrong, or people who would 70 years later form the Republican Party. That's cleared things up.\n \n \n\n First you're saying that America is the first real democracy, now you've switched around and saying that they were trying to set up a democracy. Logic, too isn't your strong-point.\n\n \n \nHow is it switching when just said that I switched to the same thing I had said before? I see that you don't know what logic is either.\n\n \n Because you keep switching! One minute you say one thing, then another, then you're back to the original point, then next you're switched again, then back to the original point. Just because you keep saying one point - the USA is the first modern democracy, doesn't mean you've got an argument, especially when you keep saying other things that don't site well with it.\n \n \nCircular reasoning. Anyone who went against slavery had to have gone against the established system! The system was established (by your own argument; by atheists). Therefore these Christians went against the established system. They were 'heretics' in that sense. However, they followed Christian values, not secularist ones. Secularists had established that some men were inferior.\n\n \n \nMan, are you ever screwed up.\n\n \n If you say so. You're the one who said that they went against the system, and the system was established by atheists other humanist losers.\n \n \nI wrote \"What about the Pope? An absolute ruler? No, he's accountable to God. He's elected by his peers.\"\n Huh? I'm not saying that everything he says isn't from his God. It's you making the claim.\n\n \n \nNo, it is the Church which makes that claim. You're just being an irrelevant.\n\n \n And you're being irreverent. You tried to show that religion is bad because a religious person (the Pope) remains one of the last absolute rulers. I said, what about the Kim family in North Korea (and you've not mentioned them here because it's a hole in your argument; so you've gone back to just picking on the Pope).\n \n \nAgain your bias. Even if it were hearsay, then show me the words 'attributed' to Jesus that you object too. You can't even do that!\n\n \n \nOf course not. They don't admit that it is nothing more then hearsay.\n\n \n Exactly, you can't show your connexion. You made baseless claims about Christianity being the evil of the world, because of the actions of Christians. I asked you to show the teachings of Christ that lead to these evils, and you can't. You're effectively blaming Jesus for the failings of his followers. In fact because of your hatred of Catholicism, you've illogically extended it to all Christians, and all religions.\n \n I can show a connexion with Islam; however, because Muhammad (and I quoted him heavily) called for people to kill non-believers.\n \n \n\n Show me what you are actually objecting to, even if it's just hearsay. You can't. You just have an irrational hatred of religion.\n\n \n \nPlease. Such tactics are nothing more than apologetics and thus discounted.\n\n \n In other words you have no argument! Show me the money!\n \n \nThe former Roman Empire again shows your western sensibilities! You mean the Western Roman Empire, because the Roman Empire in the east continued well past the establishment of the Holy Roman Empire. Sorry, history and geography don't seem to be your strong points. You need to look beyond western history. It matters not that your own background is European, because you've adopted the dominant American culture as your reference point. All your statements follow from that axiom.\n\n \n \nIt was still the Roman Empire. It is irrelevant if while it was self-destructing that half of it managed to split off and survive for a bit afterwards.\n\n \n Of course it matters. You said that Christianity had the power of the Roman Empire behind it. Western Europe lost the Roman Empire. Even your terminology 'managed to split off and survive' suggests that the Eastern/Byzantine Empire broke away from the main empire. You're so Western-centric in your arguments its amazing. The Byzantine Empire didn't 'just manage to survive' at all. It was a vibrant entity for 1,000 more years! You suggest it was a mere accident.\n \n I am an Orthodox Christian. I am aware of the cultural heritage of the east.\n \n \nAnd you showed no evidence. You just make a pronouncement. Making pap statements is not an argument.\n\n \n \nPlease. again you show yourself for what you truly are. Either that or you forget you history.\n\n \n Your words speak volumes in nonsense. You're the one to make an irrational attack on Christianity based not on Christ but His followers. I keep asking you to show me what Christ says that's so objectionable and you can't.",

I've never known anyone who is so able to meld two conflicting strains into the same gasp as yourself.\n\n \n Actually the form of democracy which the founding fathers had finally decided on was to be a republic.\n \n I never said even once that America was great. All I ever said was that the USA was first country to successfully use the democratic process on a larger scale.\n \n \nBut, again your limited knowledge. You're assuming that my ancestors were convicts; most Australians don't have convict ancestry... don't let facts get in the way of your argument.\n\n \n Sure, some were the unwanted underclass as well. With only a small minority being actual colonists there by their own choice.\n \n \nNone of my ancestors were convicts! My father, for instance was born in Clay City, Clay County, Indiana! Except I don't need to be an American apologist like yourself.\n\n \n Now I understand why you're being so irrational. You're projecting.\n \n \nI don't feel less about myself because I'm not American. Australia gave women the vote in federal elections in 1902. The USA did so in 1919. Did this mean that Australia was in fact 'more' democratic than the USA?\n\n \n Like I had said, I never said anything at all about how great the USA was. Only that it was the first successful country to use the democratic process\n \n \nBut there's a difference between you and I here. I am not saying that Britain is the prime example of democracy. I am just saying that they are a democracy. You're saying that the USA is the prime example; without it we'd not have any modern democracies left.\n\n \n Of course, wouldn't have been any in the same vein or extent. The French even stated that the American Revolution was what had inspired them.\n \n \nThere is no such thing as race. I agree with Marxists on this.\n\n \n So, you're a communist?\n \n \nThat is why it's irrelevant that you're Canadian; you wanna be American.\n\n \n Hardly. Boy, are you ever wrong on that account. But than again, you are projecting. I would never want to be an American. I couldn't stand the lowering in my standard of living. :)\n \n \nYou put forward America as the normative model of a democracy. You crave what you're not.\n\n \n You really have a bug up your rear.\n \n \nWow! A frank admission that you don't have anything to back you up;\n\n \n Please. \n \n \nthat takes a lot of guts to admit you're arguing without facts. Lurch would never have done even that. That's cool. You've said you're an ex-Catholic, so from that you're hating all religions. Try a little insight into your own thought processes though; actually that's probably asking too much.\n\n \n Most of the time you're not worth going into too much detail. You're more interesting in ad homs.\n \n \nFirstly, so you disagree that Islam rose at the time that the Persian and Byzantine Empires had exhausted themselves? I'm not sure that you know what you're disagreeing with. You're a comic debater. What is it that you're actually disagreeing too?\n\n \n I never said any such thing. I'm just saying that Christianity's history is just as or maybe even more bloody.\n \n \nSecondly, prove that Christian history is more bloody. Oops, that's right you don't have any facts do you. Keep up with the meaningless drivel.\n\n \n Hitler had over 6 million Jews exterminated. The Burning Times in Europe, The Inquisitions. the Crusades, and of course of the centuries of wars between differing Christian sects as well.\n \n '\nThey' again. Do you consult 'them' often? Do 'they' reply?\n \n Anyway, consult them, find an argument, then get back to me.\n\n \n You are irrelevant. A minor amazement only.",

There's a difference in your argument again, you're not now arguing that Britain wasn't a democracy, but that it treated its colonies harshly. Please stick to an argument. The one you're on now has the modern parallel that the USA, a democracy, is involved in an unpopular war in Iraq.\n \n You're subtle switch of focus also must be seen as a tacit admission that you had no dispute with what I said.\n \n \n I know you love saying this, because it sounds good. As I said, at least, when I was at school, modern history studies began with the French Revolution. Perhaps your modern history books do start with the American revolution.\n\n \n \nI think that yours is starting with the modern history of art.\n\n \n No, read my comments. In NSW, my state, all school students who do modern history start their studies at the Napoleonic Wars. That is deemed by us as the start of modern history. Your studies board might start it in 1492 for all I know. I've given you ample time to state this... why you think that the USA is the 'first' 'modern'. By our time-line as taught to us, it's not 'modern' because it predates 'modern' history. I'm not even saying that this is an absolute. I've said it's just how we reckon it. I've asked you how you reckon it that way and you keep going on with something else. When does your 'modern' history start? Did you even do history?\n \n \n Switzerland was/is a democracy that is older than the USA. San Marino is too. There were many democracies in medieval times; in Italy. France was younger. What makes the USA 'first'?\n\n \n \nSwitzerland didn't get its constitution until 1874. \n And they didn't allow women to vote until 1971.\n http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/suffrage.htm\n\n \n Well, done. You're actually looking things up.\n They didn't allow women to vote in national elections, yes. So what? By your rationale the USA wasn't a democracy until the 1920s, nor Britain.\n You don't need a constitution to be a democracy. From memory the USA didn't get there's till about 20 years later, and even then, well after Geo Washington was president, it wasn't ratified by some states. \n \n What was your point anyway?\n \n \nThe USA was the first successful one on a larger scale and I had said this as well.\n I can understand why you're having so much trouble with this. You're like a creationist. You see the \"final\" product and believe that it was always like that. You don't think that it had to evolve to where it is now. \n\n \n Oh really. Re-stating the mantra about the USA doesn't answer my question, why do you think it was the 'first' 'modern' democracy.\n \n As to 'on a large scale' well what do you mean by this, area? population?\n \n You have moved on a bit since last time; actually taking some time to research. That's an improvement. Unfortunately you're still arguing from ignorance. All the bluff in the world won't cover that.",

The reason he's considered the first PM because even though there were Prime Ministers before him, he was the first in the modern sense, with a party, elected etc.\n\n \n A coup is not the same thing.\n \n \nAh, I see, you really don't know what a constitutional monarchy is.\n\n \n Does she have direct say in your affairs?\n \n \nIt's honest of you to not concede you're wrong, but let's move on...I'll even skip over the part that you now seem to be debating on an issue you don't understand - but has that stopped you before?\n \n Canada, Britain, New Zealand, Australia are all constitutional monarchies. We all have the same monarch, Elizabeth II. Her powers in each is limited by the constitutions in each country. Hence constitutional monarchy. I thought that you were in Canada. You don't even know what kind of government you have?\n\n \n Actually you are the one who doesn't know that difference. \n \n Canada is a confederation with parliamentary democracy. The Queens rule is mainly as the leader of the Commonwealth of Nations, primarily an economic union. Are you saying that the leader of the UN is also the leader of your country, that is more of a political union?\n \n \nSure, and the US had slavery. There's a difference in your argument again, you're not now arguing that Britain wasn't a democracy, but that it treated its colonies harshly.\n\n \n Remember, you live in a former prison colony.\n \n \nPlease stick to an argument. The one you're on now has the modern parallel that the USA, a democracy, is involved in an unpopular war in Iraq.\n\n \n The USA is a Republic, but the principles are mainly the same.\n \n \nYou're subtle switch of focus also must be seen as a tacit admission that you had no dispute with what I said.\n\n \n Wrong. The USA was the first, but that doesn't mean that they were perfect from the start. They had to learn over time. \n \n \nNo, read my comments. In NSW, my state, all school students who do modern history start their studies at the Napoleonic Wars. That is deemed by us as the start of modern history.\n\n \n They are teaching a wrong version of history, but that isn't new. The British don't really want to admit that major defeat. :)\n \n \nYour studies board might start it in 1492 for all I know. I've given you ample time to state this... why you think that the USA is the 'first' 'modern'. By our time-line as taught to us, it's not 'modern' because it predates 'modern' history. I'm not even saying that this is an absolute. I've said it's just how we reckon it. I've asked you how you reckon it that way and you keep going on with something else. When does your 'modern' history start? Did you even do history?\n\n \n Poor Aussie.\n \n \nWell, done. You're actually looking things up.\n They didn't allow women to vote in national elections, yes. So what? By your rationale the USA wasn't a democracy until the 1920s, nor Britain.\n You don't need a constitution to be a democracy. From memory the USA didn't get there's till about 20 years later, and even then, well after Geo Washington was president, it wasn't ratified by some states.\n\n \n Irrelevant.\n \n \nWhat was your point anyway?\n\n \n You expect perfection, where there is none and can be none.\n \n \n \nOh really. Re-stating the mantra about the USA doesn't answer my question, why do you think it was the 'first' 'modern' democracy.\n\n \n I don't think that at all. It is fact.",

   "Stop changing the focus. Do you agree or not that Christianity spread peacefully for its first few centuries? Obviously you now do, because you've not disputed my claim, merely changed the focus.\n\n \n No, it didn't. Once it get the Roman Empire behind it it could impose its beliefs on many.\n \n \n \nSigh! I was comparing Christianity and Islam in their respective first 300 years. You said you understood the difference. Now you're changing the focus again, and not looking at Christianity for its first 300 years, but its first 2,000. Please please stick to a debate.\n\n \n I am, you are the one who is trying to distract from the issue with your apologetic nonsense.\n \n \nIslam conquered it's empire by the sword. Christianity spread through the Roman Empire without bloody conquest; it was the subject of persecution.\n\n \n The empire was already a conquest with a very bloody history of its own.\n \n \nIf you can't see that then you're showing you're completely unprepared to have a reasoned debate without brining in a priori hatred of religion. Show me where your facts are to dispute this.\n\n \n You only have an official version of history prospective.\n \n \nThey are fundamentally different religions because their founders were different types of people. One was a warrior, the other, Christ, was a messenger of peace.\n\n \n Christ was just a figuehead, a martyr to use. Both Christianity and Islam are off-shoots of Judaism. They even share most of the same stories and people. The Muslims even recognise Jesus as a prophet, though not as the Christ (Most Christians don't even know that Christ isn't a name, its a title.) Not even the Christians were that tolerant.\n \n \nSaying you're not, and showing that you are. Show me where you find dispute that Christianity spread peacefully in its first 300 years. Actually address the issue, don't suddenly try widening it to encompass all of Christianity as you just tried above.\n\n \n The victor gets to write the official version.\n \n \nYou're a fool. Augustine is not history! Only an imbecile would keep making so many errors. I'm truly amazed you know how to type. I mention Augustine's writings and you think it's history. How bright you are. You constantly argue from lack of knowledge. You then say \"I've read this\" or \"I understand that\" but in making comments like that you show you don't. Are you still in your early teens? You argue like that; all attitude.\n\n \n Who said that I was speaking of him. I had said that most Christians would write their history to favor them, and that is true.\n \n \nIf you don't know about the difference between history and theology, please stay off the debate.\n\n \n I'm not the one who doesn't know the different... Christians even teach their children theology based history as real history. It is no different than when the Ancient Greeks and later the Romans taught their children the same about their gods. Do you actually believe that Moses went on top of a mountian and talked to god in the guise of a burning bush, or that a flood actually covered the entire Earth and that either 2X2, or 7X7 (Depends on which version) of all animals could fit on a single ark built by a single man and his family? :)\n \n \nI know you hate Religions, and you see them all the same. I feel sorry though that you've not been able to use objective evidence to prove your point.\n\n \n They are all the same.\n \n \nI may not debate you for much longer... call it a victory. You're wearing me down as I actually take the trouble to address your mistakes, and you make so many of them.\n\n \n All you are doing is using apologetics, which mean nothing.\n \n \nYou don't use facts pertinent to your argument.\n You demonstrate the inability to deal with the subject at hand, as you keep changing it.\n You don't stick to an argument, in fact you use mutually exclusive arguments.\n\n \n That best describes you instead.\n \n \nThen you have the hide to criticise other people.\n\n \n Hide?

The heaviest blow that ever struck humanity was the coming of Christianity. Bolshevism is Christianity's illegitimate child. Both are inventions of the Jew. The deliberate lie in the matter of religion was introduced into the world by Christianity.... Let it not be said that Christianity brought man the life of the soul, for that evolution was in the natural order of things. (Night of 11th-12th July, 1941)\n \n  Christianity is a rebellion against natural law, a protest against nature. Taken to its logical extreme, Christianity would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure. (10th October, 1941, midday)\n \n  The best thing is to let Christianity die a natural death.... When understanding of the universe has become widespread... Christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity.... Christianity has reached the peak of absurdity....

We'll see to it that the Churches cannot spread abroad teachings in conflict with the interests of the State. (14th October, 1941, midday)\n \n  Christianity is an invention of sick brains: one could imagine nothing more senseless, nor any more indecent way of turning the idea of the Godhead into a mockery.... ....

I don't believe the thing's possible, and I see the obstacle in Christianity itself.... Pure Christianity-- the Christianity of the catacombs-- is concerned with translating Christian doctrine into facts. It leads quite simply to the annihilation of mankind. It is merely whole-hearted Bolshevism, under a tinsel of metaphysics. (14th December, 1941, midday)\n \n  It would always be disagreeable for me to go down to posterity as a man who made concessions in this field. I realize that man, in his imperfection, can commit innumerable errors-- but to devote myself deliberately to errors, that is something I cannot do. I shall never come personally to terms with the Christian lie. Our epoch Uin the next 200 yearse will certainly see the end of the disease of Christianity.... My regret will have been that I couldn't... behold . (27th February, 1942, midday)\n  The reason why the ancient world was so pure, light and serene was that it knew nothing of the two great scourges: the pox and Christianity. (19th October, 1941, night)\n \n All these statements were made by Hitler during private meetings\n \n \n I know where that came from. One of his men, which was close to him, had actually been anti-Christian and wrote what he thought Hitler should do in his diary.\n\n \n Wrong. The quote is above. \n \n \n There may have not been something like the what had happened in Germany, but they were talking about what had happened over the many centuries as well. What the Muslims think of the Jews now. Before that they more or less tolerated them if only they taxed them extra.\n\n \n Firstly, the Jews weren't just heavily taxed.\n \n  The Muslim attitude toward Jews is reflected in various verses throughout the Koran, the holy book of the Islamic faith. \"They [the Children of Israel] were consigned to humiliation and wretchedness. They brought the wrath of God upon themselves, and this because they used to deny God's signs and kill His Prophets unjustly and because they disobeyed and were transgressors\" (Sura 2:61). According to the Koran, the Jews try to introduce corruption (5:64), have always been disobedient (5:78), and are enemies of Allah, the Prophet and the angels (2:97-98).\n \n Jews were generally viewed with contempt by their Muslim neighbors; peaceful coexistence between the two groups involved the subordination and degradation of the Jews. In the ninth century, Baghdad's Caliph al-Mutawakkil designated a yellow badge for Jews, setting a precedent that would be followed centuries later in Nazi Germany.24\n \n At various times, Jews in Muslim lands lived in relative peace and thrived culturally and economically. The position of the Jews was never secure, however, and changes in the political or social climate would often lead to persecution, violence and death. \n \n When Jews were perceived as having achieved too comfortable a position in Islamic society, anti-Semitism would surface, often with devastating results. On December 30, 1066, Joseph HaNagid, the Jewish vizier of Granada, Spain, was crucified by an Arab mob that proceeded to raze the Jewish quarter of the city and slaughter its 5,000 inhabitants. The riot was incited by Muslim preachers who had angrily objected to what they saw as inordinate Jewish political power.\n \n Similarly, in 1465, Arab mobs in Fez slaughtered thousands of Jews, leaving only 11 alive, after a Jewish deputy vizier treated a Muslim woman in \"an offensive manner.\" The killings touched off a wave of similar massacres throughout Morocco.25\n \n Other mass murders of Jews in Arab lands occurred in Morocco in the 8th century, where whole communities were wiped out by the Muslim ruler Idris I; North Africa in the 12th century, where the Almohads either forcibly converted or decimated several communities; Libya in 1785, where Ali Burzi Pasha murdered hundreds of Jews; Algiers, where Jews were massacred in 1805, 1815 and 1830; and Marrakesh, Morocco, where more than 300 hundred Jews were murdered between 1864 and 1880.26\n \n Decrees ordering the destruction of synagogues were enacted in Egypt and Syria (1014, 1293-4, 1301-2), Iraq (854859, 1344) and Yemen (1676). Despite the Koran's prohibition, Jews were forced to convert to Islam or face death in Yemen (1165 and 1678), Morocco (1275, 1465 and 1790-92) and Baghdad (1333 and 1344).27\n \n The situation of Jews in Arab lands reached a low point in the 19th century. Jews in most of North Africa (including Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Morocco) were forced to live in ghettos. In Morocco, which contained the largest Jewish community in the Islamic Diaspora, Jews were made to walk barefoot or wear shoes of straw when outside the ghetto. Even Muslim children participated in the degradation of Jews, by throwing stones at them or harassing them in other ways. The frequency of anti-Jewish violence increased, and many Jews were executed on charges of apostasy. Ritual murder accusations against the Jews became commonplace in the Ottoman Empire.28\n \n As distinguished Orientalist G.E. von Grunebaum has written:\n \n It would not be difficult to put together the names of a very sizeable number Jewish subjects or citizens of the Islamic area who have attained to high rank, to power, to great financial influence, to significant and recognized intellectual attainment; and the same could be done for Christians. But it would again not be difficult to compile a lengthy list of persecutions, arbitrary confiscations, attempted forced conversions, or pogroms.29\n \n The danger for Jews became even greater as a showdown approached in the UN. The Syrian delegate, Faris el-Khouri, warned: \"Unless the Palestine problem is settled, we shall have difficulty in protecting and safeguarding the Jews in the Arab world.\"30\n \n More than a thousand Jews were killed in anti-Jewish rioting during the 1940's in Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Syria and Yemen.31 This helped trigger the mass exodus of Jews from Arab countries. (http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/myths/mf15.html#c) &#61663;- Jewish site. \n \n And so did Christianity, though, most of the converting was with Christians of a different sect to their sect, but it is the same thing.\n\n \n Charlemagne was the first Emperor to convert by the sword, which wasn't supported by the Church (otherwise the guy would be a saint). That was 700 years after Christ; no, Christianity's belief wasn't to convert by the sword. Only Kings and Emperors did that.",

   "We have several that have been written and all say the same thing. Ever heard of the Peshitta Bible? But Matthew, Mark, Luke, and so on wrote those books.\n\n \n By the beginning of the 5th century, or slightly earlier, the Syrian Church's version of the Bible, the Peshitta ('simple' translation) was formed.

The source of these writings were from one of his closest men, who happened to be anti-Christian and as I had wrote earlier, wrote what he thought Hitler should have said.\n \n Here are some quotes of my own.\n \n The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in his own denomination, of making people stop just talking superficially of God's will, and actually fulfill God's will, and not let God's word be desecrated. [original italics]\n \n For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their abilities. Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the Lord's creation, the divine will.

[original italics]\n \n -- Adolf Hitler, from \"Mein Kampf\",\n translation by Ralph Mannheim.\n \n The F\u00fchrer made it known to those entrusted with the Final Solution that the killings should be done as humanely as possible. This was in line with his conviction that he was observing God's injunction to cleanse the world of vermin. Still a member in good standing of the Church of Rome despite detestation of its hierarchy (\"I am now as before a Catholic and will always remain so\" [quoting Hitler]), he carried within him its teaching that the Jew was the killer of God. The extermination, therefore, could be done without a twinge of conscience since he was merely acting as the avenging hand of God -- so long as it was done impersonally, without cruelty.\n \n \n -- John Toland (Pulitzer Prize winner),\n from \"Adolf Hitler\", pp 507, talking about the Autumn of 1941.\n \n \n The \"I am now as before a Catholic...\" quotation from Hitler was recorded in the diary of Gerhard Engel, an SS Adjutant, in October 1941. Hitler was speaking in private, not before a mass audience, and so it is difficult to dismiss the comment as propaganda lies.\n \n \nWrong.

Even Muslim children participated in the degradation of Jews, by throwing stones at them or harassing them in other ways. The frequency of anti-Jewish violence increased, and many Jews were executed on charges of apostasy. Ritual murder accusations against the Jews became commonplace in the Ottoman Empire.28\n \n As distinguished Orientalist G.E. von Grunebaum has written:\n \n It would not be difficult to put together the names of a very sizeable number Jewish subjects or citizens of the Islamic area who have attained to high rank, to power, to great financial influence, to significant and recognized intellectual attainment; and the same could be done for Christians. But it would again not be difficult to compile a lengthy list of persecutions, arbitrary confiscations, attempted forced conversions, or pogroms.29\n \n The danger for Jews became even greater as a showdown approached in the UN. The Syrian delegate, Faris el-Khouri, warned: \"Unless the Palestine problem is settled, we shall have difficulty in protecting and safeguarding the Jews in the Arab world.\"30\n \n More than a thousand Jews were killed in anti-Jewish rioting during the 1940's in Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Syria and Yemen.31 This helped trigger the mass exodus of Jews from Arab countries. (http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/myths/mf15.html#c) &#61663;- Jewish site.\n\n \n Look at Christianity's treatment of the Jews for the same periods as well. No one like the Jews at all in their long history. If they were not on the move they were someone's slaves.\n \n \nCharlemagne was the first Emperor to convert by the sword, which wasn't supported by the Church (otherwise the guy would be a saint). That was 700 years after Christ; no, Christianity's belief wasn't to convert by the sword. Only Kings and Emperors did that.\n\n \n http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03610c.htm\n \n I hadn't seen anything there to suggest that he didn't have the Church's favor. Quite the opposite in fact.\n \n They only make one a saint if they performed miracles. Not if they just gave service to the Church.\n \n BTW, that link from the Catholic Encyclopedia website. :)\n \n It doesn't really matter who did it, wheither it be the Church directly, or those with its blessing it is the same thing. Once Christianity gained enough strength they worked to force their religion on all in the name of their god.\n \n \n I never said that Islam was any more cilivized either. If Islam had a New World to go to like the Christians did which allowed them to change without the close watchful eye of Mother Church they may have developed to were Christianity is today. That is what was meant by Islam of today being like Christianity was 300 or 400 years ago. Get it?",

He was saying that \"Christians are worse than Muslims\", then he said \"Christians were cruel to Jews in the middle ages and Muslims were nice\", now he's saying \"They both had their good and bad times\".... what's next?\n\n \n He does it all the time. I point it out and he says \"No I don't\" and kids himself.\n \n He also said Australia's not a constitutional monarchy, and neither is Canada. I posted government web-sites from the respective nations, and he keeps quoting the CIA world-factbook as evidence of his claim; because it says we're a Federation (we're both; which means he's claim re: monarchy is false). Unfortunately he's not the balls yet to admit this. I guess he's about 14 years old. He has all the arrogance of Lurch, but none of the cohesion. He still can't understand that words such as democracy, federation, constitutional monarchy, are all equally valid descriptions, and not mutually exclusive.\n \n On another post I mentioned about continued Christian influence in lawmaking. I don't know if you read this. He maintained that there is no influence from Christians, then he agreed, there is influence, but it's not persuasive.\n \n I mentioned Lord Aitken's decision in Donaghue v Stevenson. I asked him to show which pagan texts Lord Aitken was drawing from when he used Christian concepts when he asked 'Who is my neighbour'.\n \n He says all Christian ideals stem from pagans, which means all the times he's had a go about Christians persecuting Jews means it's not Christianity at fault, but paganism!\n \n I insisted that he show which pagan references Lord Aitken was drawing from. He then asked \"Who is Lord Aitken?\" What a buffoon! Then he claimed I slipped it in (I guess retrospectively).\n \n He then said that all the pagan texts were destroyed by persecuting Christians, so how could Lord Aitken (whoever he is :) )draw upon pagan texts? He tries so many opposing arguments at once he's in a muddle.\n \n I asked him again to show me the connexion between Aitken's decision and paganism, and he says he already has! What a laugh he is, except I don't think he's intentionally trying to be funny. Saying he's done something all the time makes me think of myself when I was young... \"Have you cleaned your room?\" \"Yes!\"\n \n He suggested that the USA was the first modern democracy. I asked him why 'modern' as NSW (my state) teaches modern history from the French Revolution; that is after the USA became a state - this isn't to say that his history curriculum has a different start date; I just wanted to know. Instead of telling me, he just repeats that they are the first modern democracy; more democratic than Britain of the same era (despite women and most Negroes couldn't vote). He quoted me figures to show that Geo. Washington was unanimously elected... his own web-site that he was quoting* says a) Washington was unopposed and b) only c.200 people voted for him! Hardly democracy in the 'modern' sense.\n \n Britain was oppressive he says, therefore they weren't a democracy; forgetting how the US treated its indiginies.\n \n These are just a few of his many lapses. Sometimes I grow tired of his antics, but then I feel like I'm duty bound to try to help him; but he doesn't want help as he's showing that he won't research, he won't take time to consider, he won't admit error.\n \n One of his standards was to say irrelevant. I tried it back at him to see how he reacted and boy did he! He said something along the lines that someone arguing like that had nothing to say! The fact that there's not even a skerrick of self-recognition in that is rather spooky.\n \n On another thread he said that Australia had laws against religion\n \n \nWe don't have a law restricting the government from eastablishment (sic) of religion, you do.\n\n \n I said \nAre you referring to s.116. of our Federal Constitution...?\n \"The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.\"\n Obviously you don't believe in taking time to respond, and actually researching what you're debating. Why clutter your comment with facts?\n\n \n Did he admit his error? No, he said...\n \n \nI was speaking of the USA. You sound just like an American that I forget that you aren't \n\n \n Actually if he knew his stuff he'd have realised that there was a small bluff there. I write this now knowing he might read it; sort of a gloat.\n \n It is because despite this law we have made laws on religions. However, I was prepared for this, because the USA has done so too, despite their amendment; they made laws against Mormons practicing polygamy. I thought he'd have a go at it, but he has so little depth that instead of trying that line he just lied.\n \n He also doesn't know if he's American or Canadian. When talking about American law he uses 'we' instead of 'they'. I have in the past pointed out his miserable failure when it comes to pronouns, and this is the only thing he's even come close to acknowledging; by criticising me for pointing these errors out! Like that's my fault too!\n \n The whole time I've been unsure whether he and Killakozzy are the same poster. Both used the maths argument that Christianity is false because there are more non-Christians. Charchuk and Killakozzy raised this so many times as proofs of their ideas, and both had difficulty with the illogical arguments they were making.\n \n The classic is Killakozzy saying\n \nYou can present whatever evidence you can find. You can quote scripture until you're blue in the face.... post url liks.... demand that I give evidence for my claims.... but until you can prove one little, minute piece of evidence, your \"facts and figures\" are nothing but castles built on mudslides\n\n \n In other words, until I can prove my argument, without Scripture, without references, and without facts and figures, I've lost the debate!\n \n Now I do take some joy in gloating over these issues. I have been subject to ridicule for my own errors, and will be in the future.\n \n \n *that in itself was a major break-through as most the time he just gives opinion. Unfortunately he doesn't fully understand what he's quoting; or he'd stop with the CIA factbook references.",

   "In whom would you rather follow?\n\n \n \nNeither.\n\n \n Fair enough, if you think that peace and war amount to the same thing; that over-turning a table is the same as killing 900 people.\n \n \nHere again you have a warped sense of sameness. Over-turning tables he did. How is that comparable to killing 900 PoWs? Muhammad lead armies into battle. He celebrated political assassinations.\n\n \n \nJehovah led armies into battle. He told the tribes of Israel to go into Canaan and destroy it, run the people out, demolish their churches, destroy them- even if they are nice.\n\n \n \nWhat about my no 1 favorite Bible quote? \"Blessed is the man who takes your babies and smashes them against the rocks\" Psalms 137:9 \n ...turn the other cheek of my arse.\n\n \n That is not God talking. That is David. What is your point? Sure, he is hoping for something bad to happen. The same Bible mentions that the very same David sent his best friend into the heart of battle to be killed because he lusted after the man's wife. No where does it say \"This is the right thing to do\". It is merely recording that David is a failed person who made many grave errors. And later sought atonement for them.\n \n If you want to compare God to Muhammad in order to show them as both vindictive/cruel etc., your comparison fails immediately because you can't judge God. You have no idea of the reason why God does what He does.*\n \n You think God as depicted in the Old Testament is bad, but have no idea about Allah (see below).\n \n \n Actually, you believe Jesus to be a man, so for you, you should be comparing two men, Jesus and Muhammad. Now you don't want to. Funny that because it runs contrary to what you believe?\n\n \n \nActually, since we are arguing about what believers are told about each person, I think it makes sense to consider that one is given God-status and the other is a human prophet.\n The problem with arguing about Christianity is that the forms are so varied and the Bible so inconsistent that you could argue that the Bible says virtually anything.\n\n \n \nThe Koran on the other hand was written at a certain time, and passed down intact, never translated or added to or censored.\n\n \n No, that's simply not true. The Koran didn't achieve final and definitive form till some time after.\n http://www.isisforum.com/research/origins.htm\n \n Even it's writting was done over a large portion of Muhammed's later life. Thus we see Muhammed at Medina first imploring his followers to pray towards Jerusalem, but because the Jews didn't convert en mass, he had them turn around, stick their arse's in the air and pray towards Mecca (whence Muhammed had fled).\n \n Further...\n \n Second to the Koran are the Haddiths (the sayings of Muhammad by Muhammad and his followers). These are more extensive, and are used in order to understand how Muhammad interpreted various verses - because Muhammad might go into some length on - a commentary on various Koranic verses.\n \n These are divided into 'strong' and 'weak' Haddiths depending upon the distribution of their acceptance. The 'strong' are generally universally accepted. The 'weak' are not. Thus there is 'universality' here either.\n \n \nAnyway, you continue to argue as though Christianity is about Jesus more than it is about God. God did many things that demonstrated him to be as cruel and jealous as Allah. Biblical characters do atrocious things, like offering up their daughters to be raped, for example.\n\n \n I don't doubt that you've found this, but I'd like the verse, please.\n \n \nAlso, the stories about what Jesus supposedly did are fundamental to Christianity, whereas in Islam people are following Muhammad's words more than his life.\n\n \n Not true at all. Muhammad is, as I've already quoted earlier the exemplar of men. He is the way they are supposed to be.\n \n \nIt sure isn't like Muslims are instructed to follow Muhammad by marrying nine-year-olds.\n\n \n He did so by example. That is why; and I fail to understand why you'd not picked this up when I've mentioned it twice already; the Ayatollah was able to marry a 10 year old when he was 20. Even today in Islam generally as soon as a girl has her first menstruation; she's able to be married - this can be as young as 9. It is in Islamic law in places such as Iran precisely because it was the way Muhammad acted.\n \n \nIt is also not hard to find praised historical figures of Christian Europe with same or equally heinous predilections.\n\n \n I'm not sure what you mean here. I have stated time and time again that when Christians do 'bad' it is in spite of being Christian, NOT because of it. When a Muslim marries an under-age girl, it is because he is allowed to. When he blows up a missionary, it is because of his religion, not despite it.\n \n \nWhat is important is how people are taught to think within a religion. So, for example, white right-wing Baptists are taught that most people are evil sinners because they fornicate and whatnot. Liberation Theologists are taught to listen to Jesus' condemnations of the greedy and rich and his exaltations about the poor, and to see the mirrors of Biblical injustices in their lives. This is what effects how their religious beliefs translate into their behaviour. \n\n \n Now you're contradicting yourself. Your now not arguing that there's something inherently bad about Christianity - that puts it on a par with Islam, but admit how particular groups (mis)interpret their religion.\n \n Tell me how does a Muslim marrying an underage girl misinterpret Islam?\n \n \nBecause Christianity is so widely interpreted, arguing that \"Christians believe\" anything is difficult. Islam is only slightly less so, but it is still an important consideration. A Muslim fundamentalist in a position of power within the UAE is likely to behave very differently from an anti-racist New Afrikan Muslim. So generalizations are hard to make.\n\n \n I'm not in general making the comparison between the practitioners, I am attacking the theology itself. However, I see Islam as worse because it encourages people to be evil.\n \n \nI still don't see any significant difference in the source (books, prophets behaviours) of either religion. I find neither religion particularly appealing on those bases, but I know enough good people of both religions to know that this is not the whole story. Have you ever read the Meaning of the Koran? It's very interesting.\n\n \n No, but I've got the Koran itself. Although it's an English version which Muslims will in fact say is a lesser version than the original Arabic - which is cultural elitism!\n \n \nAnd I'm not comparing Allah and Jehovah\n\n \n \nBut that would be the most meaningful comparison.\n\n \n Then scroll down to the \"Comparison grid between Christianity and Islamic doctrine\"\n at\n http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/islam_e.htm\n before you cast judgment.\n \n \n Also, I don't refer to God as Jehovah.\n \n \n *Here is what a Christian site says (I don't agree with all their conclusions; but I do agree that we can not judge God). I give it forward because I am pressed for time to find the Orthodox reasonings; a matter for which I apologise.\n \n \"When reading how God acted in a harsh or angry manner, they assume they are seeing what God is really like. After all, that is how we make judgments about other people. We watch them in action and decide if they are gentle or mean, wise or foolish, good or bad. But even when evaluating people, we should always make room for the context. If you saw me grab my son by the arm and yank him toward me, you might conclude I was harsh and abusive. But if that incident occurred along a busy highway, you would call me quick thinking, crediting me with saving my son from being struck by a car. Before we determine character from behavior, we must consider the context.\n We need to do the same when determining the character of God. We must consider what made it necessary for Him to act as He did. Don?t just ask what He did, ask why. When you do, you will notice that God always works with people where they are, doing for them what they need most. When you see a young mother talking baby talk to her toddler, you don?t assume the mother is mentally deficient. You assume she has stooped to her child?s level of conversation because she loves her child and wants to communicate that love. There is always a good reason for what God does, even when we think a particular action is strange. \n When God did not answer Job, it was because silence taught important lessons that words could never teach. When God killed the man trying to help, it was because the help offered was actually harmful. When God behaved violently or asked His people to behave violently, it was not because He is violent. It was because the ancient Near East was a violent place... \n ?Why didn?t He teach them a better way?? He did. He showed them that violence is not the best response. Many laws of the ancient Near East commanded excessive and unfair punishments. You could be killed for insulting someone. An offense against an important official was punished more harshly than the same offense against a common person.[13]\n Instead, God called His people to perfect equity: an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. No more, no less, and no favoritism. It did not matter whose eye or tooth was damaged?noble or common person?the punishment was the same. Like a loving parent, God compassionately and gently taught His people a better way than violence. He told them to treat others the way they would like to be treated.[14]\"\n http://www.trianglepublishing.com/oldtestament/chapter1.html\n \n \n I will read http://www.cbcg.org/graceofGod_OT1.htm another site I have found to see if it has any further to add to this.",
