   "The following is an excerpt from an interview Obama gave to the Advocate. This is one of the many reasons I love the man :)\n \n http://advocate.com/exclusive_detail_ektid53285.asp\n \n \nBoth you and your wife speak eloquently about being told to wait your turn and how if you had done that, you might not have gone to law school or run for Senate or even president. To some extent, isn&#8217;t that what you&#8217;re asking same-sex couples to do by favoring civil unions over marriage, is to wait their turn? \n \n I don&#8217;t ask them that. Anybody who&#8217;s been at an LGBT event with me can testify that my message is very explicit -- I don&#8217;t think that the gay and lesbian community, the LGBT community, should take its cues from me or some political leader in terms of what they think is right for them. It&#8217;s not my place to tell the LGBT community, wait your turn. I&#8217;m very mindful of Dr. King&#8217;s &#8220;Letter from Birmingham Jail&#8221; where he says to the white clergy, don&#8217;t tell me to wait for my freedom. \n \n So I strongly respect the right of same-sex couples to insist that even if we got complete equality in benefits, it still wouldn&#8217;t be equal because there&#8217;s a stigma associated with not having the same word, marriage, assigned to it. I understand that, but my perspective is also shaped by the broader political and historical context in which I&#8217;m operating. And I&#8217;ve said this before -- I&#8217;m the product of a mixed marriage that would have been illegal in 12 states when I was born. That doesn&#8217;t mean that had I been an adviser to Dr. King back then, I would have told him to lead with repealing an anti-miscegenation law, because it just might not have been the best strategy in terms of moving broader equality forward. \n \n That&#8217;s a decision that the LGBT community has to make. That&#8217;s not a decision for me to make.\n",
