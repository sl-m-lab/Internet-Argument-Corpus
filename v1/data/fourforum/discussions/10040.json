Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is \"looking at\" bringing back the Fairness Doctrine, a controversial policy designed to ensure equal time for all political viewpoints on radio, but criticized by many as resulting in the opposite result.\n \n When asked by Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday\" if she would revive the measure, said, \"Well, I'm looking at it, as a matter of fact, Chris, because I think there ought to be an opportunity to present the other side. And unfortunately, talk radio is overwhelmingly one way.\"\n \n Wallace pointed out, \"But the argument would be it's the marketplace, and if liberals want to put on their own talk radio, they can put it on. At this point, they don't seem to be able to find much of a market.\"\n \n Feinstein responded: \"Well, apparently, there have been problems. It is growing. But I do believe in fairness. I remember when there was a fairness doctrine, and I think there was much more serious correct reporting to people.\"\n \n The Democrat said talk radio tends to be one-sided.\n \n \"It also tends to be dwelling in hyperbole. It's explosive. It pushes people to, I think, extreme views without a lot of information.\"\n \n Among the targets of leftist Democrats is conservative champion Rush Limbaugh, the most-listened to host in the history of talk radio, who has railed against in the Fairness Doctrine for years.\n \n (Story continues below)",

International observers, such as the Great Little Jimmy Carter are not obligated to tell the truth when sent to police an election.\n \n Name a talk show host that advocates the violent overthrow of our government.\n \n What the liberal side can't stand is that nobody wants to listen to their drivel. What most of our Washington Wonder Boys including liberal and conservative can't stand is that talk radio gives the people an actual venue for venting and expressing their views...such as the recent uproar concerning illegal immigration and free passes to millions of criminals who have silently invaded and are in the process of raping the entire country...thanks to socialist pigs like Ted Kennedy, Barbara Boxer, Hillary Clinton and others; and the influence of big business on George Bush and his crew of pseudo-conservatives.\n\n \n I'm not talking about talk radio, I'm talking about RCTV, the Venezuelan station that had its licence withdrawn.
