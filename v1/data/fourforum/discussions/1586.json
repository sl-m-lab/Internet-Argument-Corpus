   "I affirm that Homosexuals should be allowed to marry.\n \n I'd like to quickly make a few observations on the round:\n 1) Allowing homosexuals to marry doesn't mandate any religious institution to recognize it. The affirmative only proposes that such marriages be recognized by the government, and open civil marriage to these people.\n 2) Since the negative argues for a restriction on action, the burden is on him/her to provide direct harms that justify governmental prohibitions on an action. Since the default in a free society, is, well, freedom, it is assumed people should be allowed to take an action unless proven otherwise.\n \n Contention I: Marriage is a fundamental human right. The institution of marriage is rightly upheld by liberals and conservatives alike as a key social institution that should be relatively unhibited by federal regulation. As a general principle, any action to regulate which adult heterosexuals can marry would be regarded as obscene. The warrent for this is obvious, a government has no place telling people which individuals they designate as their life partner. In the United States, this is known as freedom of association, the government can no more designate who my wife will be than who my friends are. The fundamental, intimate relationships I form across my life are sacred to me, and cannot be breached. This regulatory prohibition holds even if a demonstrated social good can be demonstrated by micromanaging the institution. For example, while advances in genetics and bioengineering could concievably create \"partnerships\" most beneficial to society, in terms of the dynamics of the partners and their likely children, this would still not justify government regulation of the event. Despite all prospective gains that might come to the children, a union of Marilyn Vos Savant and Stephen Hawking should not be statutorly mandated. However, the only secular negative point comes down to just that. Because they allege that more \"ideal\" partnerships could be created, they seek to create and enforce regulations that mandate these types of partnerships to occur. This is morally equivilant to enforcing ideal partnerships on heterosexuals. The impact is that laws banning homosexual marriage are based off the false and inconsistently applied premise that marriage is an instrument of social change, not a sacred union between to individuals. If the latter outweigh's the former, then any union of people has to be recognized as a legitimate expression of individual choice. If the former outweighs the latter, then marraige is already dead in the water anyway.\n \n Contention II: Regulation of marriage is outside the purview of a legitiamate government. Before I go into this, I'd like to comment on some basic social contract theory. John Locke theorized about a hypothetical \"state of nature\" that existed prior to governments, where men could theoretically do anything, because they had no laws. They had absolute theoretical liberty. But in practice, they had little substantive liberty, b/c anything they did could be taken away by the bigger bully on the block. So we formed governments to protect \"life, liberty, and property.\" Philosopher John Stuart Mill, in analyzing the proper role of government in his book \"On Liberty\" outlines his \"harms principle\" which says that people have absolute liberty up until the point it tangibly takes away the liberty of others. The warrent for this is clear, because under the Lockean model the only justification for taking away real liberty is to safeguard substantive liberty, any action which reduces substantive liberty (in other words, regulations that don't pertain to specific rights violations) is immoral. What the negative needs to prove, and it can't, is that allowing gays to marry has a tangible, non-discursive impact on the rights of another (presumably a heterosexual). (it should be noted that Mill specifically denied \"bad\" discourse as a legitmate harm under his theory, the action has to be tangible).\n \n Contention III: As a matter of equality, gays must be allowed to marry. When society undertakes to provide benefits to a group, \"it must be provided to all, on equal terms\" (Brown v. Board of Education, 1954). B/c of the numerous, diffuse benefits that marriage provides, both tangible (vistitation rights, tax deductions etc.) and abstract (legitimacy, membership in the community), to specifically exclude a class of human's from these benefits is a denial of the basic maxim that \"all [hu]men[s] are created equal.\" Nor do civil unions provide solvency. Civil Unions fall victim to being akin to the seperate but equal doctrine rejected by the courts in the 1950s. As the court ruled in Sweatt v. Painter, even if in a \"seperate but equal\" system TANGIBLE benefits are identical, the intangible issues, such as prestige, reputation, membership in community etc. make seperation inherently unequal. The multi-tiered structure that civil unions would be part of would inherently be seen as a second class institution, created an \"us vs. them\" seperation that only serves to reinforce discriminative mindsets in America. To turn a likely negative argument, opening marriage to gays is actual a positive tool of social change, because it destigmatizes the community and allows them to have full participation in society.\n \n In sum, the affirmative claims the following:\n 1) No one can tell an individual who they are allowed to form intimate relationships with, whether those relationships are platonic or not.\n 2) Governmental Theory doesn't allow for the negative proposal.\n 3) Even buying that the social situation is a legitimate issue, the affirmative offers comparative benefits via destigimatization and rejection of discriminatory mindsets. The alternative offered by the negative is at best multi-tiered and socially divisive, and at worst blantently unequal.\n \n For those reasons, I affirm.",

Now, with your reasoning, it is mine and that child's fundamental right to marriage. Also, suppose I wish to designate and animal or a sibling. Homosexual marriage blurs the lines of who and what should marry. \n \n \n \n \"In the United States, this is known as freedom of association, the government can no more designate who my wife will be than who my friends are.\"\n \n \n Yes, but there are obvious differences between friends and wife.\n \n \n \n \"The fundamental, intimate relationships I form across my life are sacred to me, and cannot be breached.\"\n \n \n My faith (which discourages homosexuality) is sacred to me and cannot be breached.

   "I was just pointing out what you could do and get away with using your arguments.\n\n Not really, which is why the slippery slope argument is a logical fallacy. Here's why: presumably, the reason the SS arg is made runs something along the lines of \"X would also justify Y, and even if X would be ok, Y wouldn't be, so we can't risk it.\" This falls apart on itself. If \"Y\" is bad for reasons independent of X (in the case of child marriage, the fact that it is exploitative and doesn't allow for reasonable consent), those become independent reasons to reject Y that exist independent of affirming X. Thus, the logic by which I affirm the right of gays to marry but reject child marriage is simple: Gay marriage should be allowed as it is a contract that cannot reasonably be withheld from adult americans. Children can be restricted from this contract as they are unable to give consent and are prone to exploitation.\n \n \nActually, the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union), who is at the forefront of trying to get the law changes so homosexuals can marry, believes that children can give consent.\n \n Good for the ACLU. I am not them, and they are not me. My args don't hinge on changing age of consent laws, so the fact that the ACLU advocates such is entirely irrelevant. Furthermore, even if I was a rep. of the ACLU, its yet another logical fallacy to suggest that b/c a group made a false or flawed statement on one issue, ALL their issues are flawed. In this case, the particulars of my analysis still stand, b/c none of the args above require a change of age of consent laws.\n \n \nPlease give me stats on how long the average homosexual relationship lasts.\n \n I don't have the stats, but neither am I obligated to provide them. The burden set forth in my first post (Obs. 2) says that you have the burden of proof on the rez. Unless non-partisan studies specifically say that gays have weaker relationships (and you impact that to the resolution, b/c i fail to see how length of relationship plays any role in the debate in a society with a heterosexual divorce rate of 50%), the presumption still lies on the aff.\n \n \nHomosexuality was removed by the APA as a mental disorder from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1973 following militant threats against members of the executive board.

Just b/c the APA was wrong on one topic doesn't prove its wrong on a seperate issue.\n 2) Questioning the credibilty of the studies doesn't disprove them per se. The neg doesn't provide any offensive grounds for saying the why study is flawed. Again, under the undisputed paradigm laid out in Obs. 2, without specific proof as to negative aspects of the affirmative case position, presumption rests with the aff.\n 3) Even if you decide not to buy the APA as a warrent, that was only one of two warrents I give. The NASWP warrent was not contested, so it provides the aff grounds independent of the APA (\"National Association of Social Workers Policy Statement explains: \"Good parents are good parents regardless of their sexual orientation. Gays and lesbians are not going to chose to adopt or have their own children unless they really want to have children.\"\")\n \nBeyond all this, however, lies what the negative didn't assert and didn't refute.

This is an a priori voter, if legitimate governments can't morally put restrictions on marriage, it becomes irrelevant if those restrictions would be socially beneficial or not. By dropping this argument, the points he makes on social harms (Which i refute anyway in this post and in contention 3 of my last post) are rendered irrelevant.\n\n These were extensions I made off my first speech at the end of my second post. None of this has been touched by the negative. At this point in the debate he has forfeited his right to refute these arguments, as with one neg and one aff post remaining there is no time to adequetely flesh them out. Therefore, under accepted debate practices I ask the judge that the non-refuted sections of the aff case (Observations 1 and 2, Contentions 2 and 3) be accepted as true for the round.\n In my final post (the one after this, the final negative post), I will crystalize why the non-refuted points of the aff, as well as the lack of an offensive negative case position mandate an affirmative ballot.\n \n EDIT: Just reminding y'all that I won't be here for Prez day weekend.

Dreamweaver will judge whenever he returns.\n \n \nThe ACLU is the organization that is controlling the debate for homosexual marriage. If they get that to pass, what can't they get to pass? YOU may not agree with them, but I was pointing out why homosexual marriage shouldn't be allowed, because the groups at the forefront of the debate will always want to push for more rights. Even for pedophiles.\n \n 1) You don't provide any warrent that they are \"controlling\" the debate.\n 2) Even if they are, I give 2 responses why that's irrelevant (the fallacy of the \"slippery slope\" argument and the point that being wrong on one issue doesn't make one wrong on another necessarily). Neither of these two responses are refuted by the opposition.\n \n \nThe divorce rate of hetorosexuals is not 50%. That statistic was dreamed up by taking the number of people who get married this year and dividing by how many got divorced. Which doesn't make sense because the people getting divorced got married in years in the past.\n \n That's the only way to calculate it. It stands to reason that the divorce rate for marriage could be derived by taking the amount of people leaving the institution over those entering it on any given year. You don't provide an alternative way to evaluate it, and this one seems reasonable (as most couples don't divorce within the first year, so saying they were married earlier so their current divorces \"should't count\" is the fallacious arg.) Furthermore, the response misses the point of my argument, which is that society has so far not applied the \"stability in marriage\" paradigm to heterosexuals, so its unfair to apply it to homosexuals.\n \n \nThe reason i used that quote was to discredit the APA. YOU were the one who quoted them in the first place in order to defend your position.\n\n Crossapply all the defense I gave to the quote itself. You can read above to the ACLU defense b/c its essentially the same (and unrefuted). Furthermore, recall that the APA was only half the warrent I give. The NASWP warrent has not been touched, it still stands.\n \nAlso, you did not provide me with any stats of anything in order to show that homosexuals will be good parents. Divorced parents are a problem for children in today's world, since it is shown that homosexual unions stay together a lot less, how will that help today's children?\n \n 1) I give the NAWSP warrent, which you never addressed. \n 2) You don't give any stats that say homosexuals unions stay together less, you just assert it\n 3) we already don't view that as a viable reason for restriction, see the \"stability paradgim\" argument above\n 4) The onus isn't on me for stats, see obs. 2 in post 1.\n \n Here are your reasons to affirm in today's round.\n 1) The negative doesn't provide any offense. Virtually all of his attacks are on the cred of either sources I didn't quote (ACLU) or ones that I did quote but as supplement to other sources (APA). None of this negates the resolution, if anything, it just condemns a few of the groups which would presumably affirm. The response I give to these attacks (the fallacy of the slippery slope, the fallacy of claiming that being wrong on X makes one automatically wrong on Y, and the point that I had other warrents that weren't being questioned) were never addressed by the negative side. As a judge, you have the obligation only to vote on things specifically mentioned in round. As NO attacks were given on several of the affirmative claims and responses (including 2/3 of my case), these claims have to be accepted for the purpose of the round. And since the 2nd observation (also uncontested) firmly places teh burden of proof on the round onto the negative, the lack of offensive negative reasoning is enough of a rationale to affirm.\n \n 2) \nBeyond all this, however, lies what the negative didn't assert and didn't refute. First of all, he provides no warrented offense as to why gays shouldn't be allowed to marry. Cross-apply my second observation, which he doesn't dispute, which shows why he has the burden of proof in the round. Without warrented statements as to why homosexual MARRIAGE in specific is bad (not marrying children, not homosexuals raising children) he doesn't meet the burden and can be dropped on face.\n He also doesn't refute my second contention, which shows that government isn't the proper forum for restricting marriage anyway. This is an a priori voter, if legitimate governments can't morally put restrictions on marriage, it becomes irrelevant if those restrictions would be socially beneficial or not. By dropping this argument, the points he makes on social harms (Which i refute anyway in this post and in contention 3 of my last post) are rendered irrelevant. \n \n\n Again, these claims were never even addressed, even in passing, on the negative side. The affirmative thus wins the point that the lack of governmental authority to regulate marriage makes every single negative point moot. Again, this is an a priori voter. Even within the clash though, the negative gets the (again, uncontested) benefit of destigmatization and rejection of discriminatory attitudes. This clearly outweighs the unwarrented neg allegation that gays will do a poor job raising children, which a) is non-topical, as that's not what the rez is asking and b) disproved by the NAWSP warrent which the neg doesn't contest.\n \n Ultimately, the aff wins b/c the neg doesn't meet its offensive burden set in the first post, the aff wins the argument that government isn't the proper regulatory mechanism for marriage (Con. 2) and the proven aff benefits in Con. 3 (destigmatization and no discrim) outweigh the unwarrented, nontopical and disproven neg claims about gays and children and/or longevity of the relationship.\n \n For those reasons, you must affirm.",

   "I would like to begin by congratulating both interlocutors for their quality of debate and their consecutive respect for one another. I'll make a few points on what I thought of each argument. \n \n Dsadevil; affirming that Homosexuals should be aloud to marry.\n \n The structure of the argument was adequately done. Points were made palpable and to the point with no irrelevant information. The three beginning contentions were a grand beginning and hard ones to oppose. Quality didn't decrease throughout, but was rather, consecutive. Points were stated and then efficiently exemplified. Showed a good knowledge of the issue, background information and Politics. \n \n Overall, a well laid out argument with clear direction and clarity. \n \n ROCC; against Homosexual marriage.\n \n No doubt some relevant and challenging points raised. Although attacking the original post, other arguments and reasons for your position were raised with examples. Also did a good job in highlighting and better clarifying earlier points at times. \n \n If I am to pronounce a winner, I shall have to say Dsadevil, and here are a few reasons why:\n \n As I have already mentioned, over-complicating in any debate or theorem is a great error. A good principle to abide by is Ockham's razor. However, over-simplifying might be thought to be of just as great an error. I do not feel that ROCC provided enough information to fully strengthen his argument, explain points fully, and hence - not provide an as good rebuttal. \n \n Dsadevil did well to highlight a logical fallacy, and did a good job of explaining it too. If you are accused of a logical fallacy in your argument, it is a serious blow. Since the point is fallacious, it should either be backed up with a logical basis, or it should be withdrawn. \n \n Both sides did, pretty much, an efficient job of including sources. Apart from ROCC's first post, sources were generally cited. ROCC did, later, provide a source, but a source or link should always be included when the statement is made. If not at the same part, then, at the end of the post. \n \n I'm open to questions and thoughts, but it's not likely that I will change my mind. Thanks for a grand debate guys. :)",
