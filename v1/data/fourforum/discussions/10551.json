   "According to Christianity and other popular religions, God created man. Then why. . . .\n [*]Doesn't He realize that it would benefit all mankind to just appear once or twice so that no one would doubt His existence?[*]If He DID write the bible as so many proclaim, doesn't he realize the book, as written, is NOT historical or even practical but contains stories so out of touch with humanity and reality they cannot be believed?[*]Why didn't He realize from the beginning that the \"devil\" would be present in life and would be a distraction to good?[*]Why does He insist on people believing in Him to be \"saved\" and yet will not intercede in their behavior?[*]Why is religion, based on \"understanding\" simply a guessing game. Some believe this, others believe that?[*]It is apparent the bible was written for the people of that time. Why has He not updated to make it understandable to each generation?[*]Why does God permit money-hungry quacks to be in the media making HIS mission more difficult to believe?[*]According to many believers, God has healed them of life-threatening afflictions. Why isn't everyone who prays healed? Didn't they say the right words in the right order? Why are some believers apparently special and others are not?Feel free to add other \"WHYS\" to the list.\n Why does religion MAKE SENSE to you?",

   "My questions assumed nothing. These are beliefs that Christians hold to be true. I simply asked why these coincide with logic.\n\n \n Those are beliefs that some Christians hold, sure. So you narrowed down from \"some religions\" to Christianity without saying you were, and then did in fact go with a new assumption in each question. That it was a Christian assumption rather than yours doesn't change the fact that a new assumption is being raised in each question.\n \n My point here is that if you want to talk about religion in anything other than a \"this is what I believe\" level then it's really important to be very clear about what you're trying to discuss. Your opening question of \"If God created man then why...\" is not really supported by any of your backup questions which hit on the nature of faith, the nature of evil, pretty much the whole gamut of religious topics. If you want to pick one question, clearly define which definitions you're using, and say which assumptions (or beliefs, if you will) you are and aren't using then we could have a real discussion. As it stands all you really have is a list of things you don't get about religion.",

   "A pervasive weakness of the age of faith is the insidious inability of devotees to separate the lies of clergy from fundamental reality. The effect is manifest in the deluded ascription of faith with morality and ethics, when the facts speak just the opposite.\n \n So when the Catholic bishops \"warn\" their suffering flock that votes have eternal consequences (see damnation and hell), the suckered believers seem to have no way of discerning the merit of the claim. The flock continues to suffer, and clerical angst is satisfied.\n \n Paradoxically, the faithful often see their suffering as meritorious and seem quite happy with this sorry state of existence. Many Americans seem to enjoy masochistically the emotional mayhem required for their salvation. I can only hope this group of people is well served.\n \n My concern is not so much for those who voluntarily bestow such suffering upon themselves. Rather it is the emotional holocaust of the saint's self-expressed cruelty on the ignorant, the young, the powerless, and the rest of humanity. Although the bishops of cruelty attempt without mercy to assign to their deluded sheep the sickness of fear and salvation, the rest of us must also wade in the overflow and live with the dismal political stench that is endemic to the swamp of clerical thought.",
