   "So what does everyone think about this? \n \n Personally, I am neutral about him. I really don't know enough about him to say one way or another, however he seems like the kind of no BS guy who get's things done. \n \n I was a bit surprised that Bush used recess appointment to put him through, but seeing as how the Democrats were just going to Filibuster his hearings to death, I don't blame him. I think the Filibuster just needs to go. It is just a room full of people saying \"I don't like your guy, so I'm going to go to the microphone and say LALALALALALALALA for 3 hours\". It is a tactic used by both republicans and democrats. I thought we at least had grown-ups in congress, not a bunch of spoiled 5 year olds. \n \n This is the part that really bothers me though (from my favorite idiot)...\n \n \"The abuse of power and the cloak of secrecy from the White House continues,\" Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said of the Bolton appointment. \"It's bad enough that the administration stonewalled the Senate by refusing to disclose documents highly relevant to the Bolton nomination. It's even worse for the administration to abuse the recess appointment power by making the appointment while Congress is in this five-week recess. It's a devious maneuver that evades the constitutional requirement of Senate consent and only further darkens the cloud over Mr. Bolton's credibility at the U.N.\" -Teddy\n \n First off, I thought it was within the presidents power to use recess appointment. Apparently, so did Clinton. \n Where was Teddy boy with his condemnation when President Clinton used recess appointment 140 times during his administration? Oh, it only works that way when it is not your boy....oh silly me...my mistake... emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Recess appointments and fillibustering are pants and they should go since they aren't used anymore for what they were intended. Fillibustering isn't even in the original Constitution.\n \n As for John Bolton, based on what I've heard of him he seems like absolutely the wrong person for the job. Being an ambassedor to the UN requires tact and compromise, things which this egomaniac doesn't have. Carl Ford, the former chief of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, called Bolton \"a quintessential kiss-up, kick-down sort of guy\" and a \"serial abuser\" of subordinates. This is not the kind of man the people of the US need as their representativein the UN.\n \n Interestingly enough, the UN can still reject Bolton just as long as one or more of the General Assembly members rejects his credentials. The case then goes to the UN Credentials Committee where he will get the up-or-down vote that Bush so badly wanted in the Senate:\n \n http://www.btcnews.com/btcnews/1050",
