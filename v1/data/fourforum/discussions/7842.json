   "This is obviously sarcasm illustrating some people's illogical thought processes. Copernicus did indeed state that the sun was the center of the universe. People believed him. However, he was proven wrong eventually. But proving a theory wrong does not automatically prove another right.\n Many creationism supporters argue that if evolution is wrong, then their creator designed everything the way it is 6000 or so yrs ago. Any scientist or student can tell you that nothing can be \"proved\" absolutely (except math/logic). The future may always hold better technology from which to discover something closer to the truth. This does not mean in any way that creationism has merit.\n Creationism seems to rely on irrational beliefs and thoughts, logical fallacies, ignorance and sometimes outright lying to support it. Also, personal incredulity is never evidence that you're right. Why would they need these tactics if creationism had merit?\n Seriously, attempting to explain rational thought to an irrational person is virtually impossible. This is why mental health facilities sometimes sedate their patients. If you're using logical thought to convince someone who cannot, it just won't work. They may even appear to be intelligent, but intelligence does not always imply rationalism.",

   "Walking-fish:\n Those Young Earth Creationists are not much more of a threat than the Flat Earthers. It is the ID folks who are making the real progress in eroding the teaching of evolution in public schools. They're using the same tactics of using binary logic. Some of them have serious science degrees and are schooled in the philosophy of science. Their language (irreduceable & specified complexity / information theory) is getting harder to keep up with. \n \n I just heard one such philosopher discuss how it is no more improper to attribute a designer to the bacterial flagellum, as it would be to make that assumption about a rotary motor abandoned on another planet with no designer in sight. Then he went on to explain that you didn't need evidence for a designer to have evidence that something was designed. These are clever people who listen to all the objections to design theory and think up counter arguments that are as inventive as they are bogus. I fear that a lot of young molecular biologists, who aren't savy to their clever style of argument, will fall prey to them. In the mean time, the YECs can continue to make progress with the scientific illiterates like Laurie Appleton (are you familiar with this infamous internet troll?).",
