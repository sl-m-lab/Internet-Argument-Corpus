   "King James Bible  \n Jesus XXXXXXXXs:-\n \nMatthew 5 \n 38 \u00b6 You have heard that it was said, \"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.\"\n 39 But I say to you, Do not resist evil. But whoever shall strike you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.\n 40 And to him desiring to sue you, and to take away your tunic, let him have your coat also.\n 41 And whoever shall compel you to go a mile, go with him two. \n \n 911 case shows most American can't do as above but took revenge by invading innocent Afghan in the name of God !!! And who on earth would listen to this kind of ****** anyway ???\n \n \n\n Matthew 5 \n 27 \u00b6 You have heard that it was said to the ancients, \"You shall not commit adultery.\"\n 28 But I say to you that whoeverlooks on a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.\n 29 And if your right eye offends you, pluck it out and throw it from you. For it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be thrown into hell.\n 30 And if your right hand offends you, cut it off and throw it from you. For it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be thrown into hell.\n \n \n This means all healthy man on earth at least have to pluck his eyes out and cut off his penis as well in order not to be thrown his body into hell ! \n \n Jesus tricks:-\n \nMatthew 4 \n 1 \u00b6 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit up into the wilderness, to be tempted by the Devil.\n 2 And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, He was afterwards hungry.\n 3 And when the tempter came to Him, he said, If You are the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.\n 4 But He answered and said, It is written, \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.\"\n 5 Then the Devil took Him up into the holy city and set Him upon a pinnacle of the Temple.\n 6 And he said to Him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down. For it is written, \"He shall give His angels charge concerning You, and in their hands they shall bear You up, lest at any time You dash Your foot against a stone.\"\n 7 Jesus said to him, It is written again, \"You shall not tempt the Lord your God.\"\n \n \n How can we know he really is the son of God if he don't show any convincible evidence to us but saying that we are tempting the lord of our God if asking him to prove his identity???\n \n \n\n Matthew 4\n 16 And evening coming on, they brought to Him many who had been possessed with demons. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick\n \n One of the most popular \"sickness\" that Jesus has \"cured\" is \"spirit get into human's body\", do we ever known of or heard of if there really has that kind of symptom found in our hospitals or any doctor on earth can remove spirit from human's body in today's hi-tech world now ???",

   "Your post appears to be rude and not terribly useful any sort of real way.\n \n911 case shows most American can't do as above but took revenge by invading innocent Afghan in the name of God !!! And who on earth would listen to this kind of XXXXXXXX anyway ???\n\n You must consider that \"most American\" cannot speak for all Christians in America, letter lone all the Christians in the world.\n \nBut I say to you that whoeverlooks on a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.\n\n This is one of the greatest verses in The Bible. The latter part of the quotation that you have presented is clearly more metaphorical rather then literal. I'll tell you how you know that you are in Love. When you don't look at other women, in any lustful way. That is when you know that you are in True Love.\n \n This post is a clear absurdity, poorly backed up, and increasingly weak in a debate. I would recommend that you read the entire Bible, before critisizing.",
