   "EZ seems to believe that the Laws of the Old Testament are the Written words of \" GOD\".. so I thought I would post this to give him something to chew on for a bit.\n \n Actually The Hammurabi Code was written centuries before the Mosaic Laws were even a thought. Moses, If he wrote anything at all which is a question, simply used the Laws from the Babylonians and changed them around to fit his own views. The Precept of the \" eye for an Eye\" concept came from the Hammurabi Code.\n What's more interesting is the fact that the Hammurabi Code also came to be by way of \"Divine\" intervention. The Laws were originally given to King Hammurabi on a mountain, handed down by the Sun God Shamus. Hammurabi then carved these laws into stone and presented them to his people. \n \n This could mean that the entire Story of Moses is like the Story of Jebus, borrowed from old ancient civilizations and re-told with new names to build a religion and a society. \n \n The Code of Hammurabi is a well-preserved Babylonian law code, dating to ca. 1700 BCE (short chronology). The sixth Babylonian king, Hammurabi, enacted the code, and partial copies exist on a human-sized stone stele and various clay tablets. The Code consists of 282 laws, with scaled punishments, adjusting \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth\" (lex talionis) as graded depending on social status, of slave versus free man.\n \n According to Jewish tradition the Torah was revealed to Moses in 1312 BCE at Mount Sinai;(another date given for this event is 1280 BCE).The Zohar, the most significant text in Jewish mysticism, states that the Torah was created prior to the creation of the world, and that it was used as the blueprint for Creation.Modern biblical scholars see no signs of Mosaic authorship, but indications of much later writing:\"Here and there in the Pentateuch Moses is said to have written certain things ... but nowhere is it affirmed that the Pentateuch was authored by Moses ... One would therefore think that what calls for an explanation is not why most people stopped believing in the dogma of Mosaic authorship, but rather why anyone believed it in the first place.\"\n \n The Hammurabi Code and Mosaic Law were used to govern their people during two different times. They had similarities and differences, between the two. For example, they were both \"discovered\" by their leaders in similar ways, but differed in their approach to justice and morality. Hammurabi Code respects women, but has distinct social class and penalties based on the class you belonged to, while the Mosaic Law had no distinction between people and gave everybody even fairness.Both the Hammurabi Code and the Mosaic Law were received by their peoples in similar ways. The Hammurabi Code was written by the Babylonian king, Hammurabi. He received these codes through divine intervention. He was given these codes by the sun god, Shamus atop a mountain. Mosaic Law was written by the God of the Hebrews. They received this law when Moses, the leader of the Jewish nation, was led up Mt. Sinai by Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews. \n \n \n \n Outside of its central significance in Judaism, the Torah is accepted by Christianity as part of the Bible, comprising the first five books of the Old Testament.[12] The various denominations of Judaism and Christianity hold a diverse spectrum of views regarding the exactitude of scripture. The Torah has also been accepted to varying degrees by the Samaritans, an ethnoreligious group of the Levant, and others as the authentic revealed message of YWHA to the early Israelite and as factual history, in both cases as conveyed by Moses. It is also accepted by Muslims as the Divine book, although they think it is modified after the death of Moses.\n \n It's also Notable that Islamic religion also believes in the Mosaic Laws , although they changed them a bit to more fit their specific beliefs. \n \n So basically we have three sets of Law.. written by supposedly two men and handed down by two Gods. \n \n There ya go EZ.. Chew on that .. I'll bring you another Plate after you ignore this and make some senseless half baked reply about how I'm going to Hell for questioning YOUR god....",
