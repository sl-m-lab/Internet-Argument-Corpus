The issue with US (and UK) ME policy is that it's one-sided, with no benefits accruing to any of the other nations involved, support of Israel's real estate policy aggression and Saud oppression of non-royalty being very questionable exceptions.\n \n As an American, I'd say our ME policy is worse than XXXX. Supporting the Shah of Iran, the Sauds, Pakistan, Israel and Iraq has made American a very ugly word across the ME and brought retaliation to the US and UK from ME extremist organizations. Invasion and occupation of Iraq under false pretenses presented the US/UK with increased ME resentment as that misguided action turns into Iraqi civil war. The latest example of US imperialism by proxy, Israel invading Lebanon, is just more fodder to motivate ME extremists at the cost of Lebanon's infrastructure and additional support by the Lebanon citizenry for extremist resistance.\n \n As to UK interests being harmed by UK alignment with US ME policy, oil and ME extremist violence in the UK obviously come to mind. It's my understanding that UK North Sea oil passed peak five years ago with subsequent reductions in reserve estimates on an annual basis. Future dependence on ME and Russian oil will place the UK closer to the unenviable US position of oil import dependency. As to the violence, both the US and UK currently live in a very expensive siege mentality due to their ME policy and I'd certainly consider that harmful.",

Even in the democratic paradises we created in Iraq and Afghanistan, the crime is in converting FROM islam, not in failing to convert TO islam. \n \n \n \n This is another opinion article that offers no factual basis for your claim. \n \n \n \n This is a yahoo answers question, which generally means it was submitted by a kid. The fact that some high school kid somewhere agrees with you does not make your argument factually correct.\n \n \n \n \n \n Another one from yahoo answers. Even this quote does not support your claim. Where in this does he say \"covnert or die\"? He doesn't. He says \"freedom or death\". Sounds like Thomas Jefferson.\n \n Jim, obviously you put a lot of work into finding these \"sources\". When you cannot find a single reputable source to back your position, don't you think the logical answer is that you are simply wrong? The fact that there are others out there who are similarly wrong does not make you right, it just means that you are not the only one out there pushing a nonsensical argument devoid of any facts.\nActually, I put very little effort into finding those links. It should be obvious to anyone with an IQ above room temperature that you are simply in denial. Perhaps it's because of your adamant distaste for anything I print.\n \n I have a long post or two coming to counter your ridiculous claim that I supported the Shah. Apparently, it takes more than a reasonable effort to combat your attempts to have all the innocent readers here believe your gibberish. It may take two or more posts to get all the information on here, but it definitely proves you wrong.",

   "WTF??? I just logged on and read your moronic challenge. \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=7090&page=11\n \n Strtign there, you go on for pages and pages about how Carter should have supported the shah because in not doing so he telegraphed to the russians that we would not interfere if they invaded afghanistan. You then display a complete and total ignorance of the entire Iranian conflict, the entire conflict in afghanistan, and even try to blame carter for our current problems, based on his failure to support the shah. \n \n That was one of the few threads where I have ever seen you concede an argument (though the factual evidence against your position was absolutly overwhelming). Predictably, though, you learned nothing and are back arguing the same nonsensical, factually incorrect points.\nRead carefully. This will be a long response. Just so readers don't become confused about who is telling the truth here, I've copied ALL of my text from the lilnked thread (It is a good one, too. Thanks for reminding me of it.)\n \n My challenge was for you to come up with a few of the \"too many to count\" times I have expressed support for the Shah.\n \n \n\n Look at your own attitudes on past events in the ME. You have faulted Carter more times than I can count for not properly supporting the Shah. The shah was a ruthless dictator and over 80% of the Iranian population opposed him. You seem to think it was a GRAVE mistake not to support brutal militant crackdown in order to make sure that the shah, who everybody despised as a tyrant, stayed in power. \n \n\n \n You will find one post of mine with links to articles proving Carter was a wimp and basically gave Afghanistan to the Russians. You will nothing that says I supported the Shah's actions.\n \n Daewoo is a master at twisting arguments to fit his agenda.\n \n Here, from a long lost thread are ALL of the words I wrote (and some of those quoted). NOTE: THIS WILL REQUIRE THREE POSTS<<<\n \n Jt and the Shah of Iran\n \n #12\n ...and today I listened to a person who had previously repeated these claims and was now retracting them because he admits that no laws have been broken in the spying game.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Why don't you verify that the lunatic is not lying or bending the truth for dramatic flair before you decide to trust the lunacy?\n \n ...and would you care to name the lunatic? That is, unless your source requires anonimity.\n \n \n Here's story from just a few years ago that explains some of the lunacy and paranoia.\n \n http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/nsa/stories/privacy/\n \n In reality, the NSA is prohibited from spying on U.S. citizens unless it can prove to a special court that there is probable cause to believe that a citizen is committing espionage or other crimes as an agent of another government.\n \n \n The 1998 movie \"Enemy of the State,\" starring Will Smith and Gene Hackman, portrayed the NSA as an evil Big Brother spying on Americans. The plot involves the NSA's deputy director, who oversees the murder of a congressman due to his opposition to a bill that the NSA official wants passed. \n \n Lt. Gen. Michael Hayden, the NSA's director, saw the movie in a South Korean theater filled with other military personnel while he was under consideration for his current job. The movie did not paint a positive picture of the NSA, he said. \n \n \"I made the judgment that we couldn't survive with the popular impression of this agency being formed by the last Will Smith movie,\" Hayden said. \n In certain cases, the NSA can look into the activities of U.S. citizens or residents if it believes they are acting as agents for another country. The agency must first get the permission of a special court created by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and then get the U.S. attorney general's consent. \n \n Hayden said the burden of proof is on the NSA when seeking such authorization. He declined to say whether the agency had ever been turned down.\n \n \n \n #19\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by daewoo Sure...if it is important. I thnk his name is larry. He is my barber.

Here is another one:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn...121601825.htmlSo it appears in this case the nut jobs were likely right. The NSA has apparently been spying on people without warrants. \n I did read the story I linked. I certainly had not read the one you linked afterward. In your linked story, it does appear that overseas communications may indeed be being monitored without warrants. It also says that this is within the law.\n \n It also says:\n Quote:\n Lamberth had previously expressed grave doubts about the White House's post-Sept. 11 interest in mixing the investigative powers of intelligence agents with those of criminal detectives and prosecutors. A showdown over the issue resulted in the only decision ever issued by the secret court's appellate panel, which ruled against Lamberth and said the president had broad powers to authorize eavesdropping to fight terrorism.After Kollar-Kotelly became presiding FISA judge in 2002, she became concerned in the course of one case that warrantless eavesdropping in the NSA collection program could be used to develop information to be presented in the FISA court, the government source said. There appeared to be no evidence that it had happened, only an indication that it could.\n Kollar-Kotelly's (She's a Clinton appointed judge.) concern is no different from many that are expressed without any evidence that something illegal has happened or is likely to happen. There are innumerable things that could happen, but to promote them as a justifiable fear is nothing more than alarmism, designed to criticize those in charge.\n \n I'm curious as to why you think my comments constitute \"spouting off\" any more than do yours. Could it be theatrical hyperbole on your part?\n \n Likely, there is some truth to the widely held view that law abiding people, constituting the overwhelming majority of the American public, have little to fear from the \"big brother\" scare tactic promoted by Bush bashers.\n \n \n \n \n #20\n Cowards such as Mohammed Atta and his fellow travelers?\n \n ...and groveling on the knees is hardly a description correctly attached to fighting terrorism with clandestine methods.\n \n If we don't expend great effort and stealth to catch terrorists before they repeat or better their efforts to destroy the WTC, you may someday be offered a Middle Eastern Haircut...an offer that you will not be able to refuse. I'm sure they'll be happy to leave the sideburns...attached to your head as it drips your warm blood all over the floor...and you may never know the blade swinger's name.

However, it was a joke anyway. I'm relatively certain your barber is the least of your worries.\n \n Quote:\n I was talking about the story that is the subject of this thread. The one linked in the very first post. \n I had read that too and not noted anything that implied a single incident of random snooping on law-abiding citizens. Also, I don't recall the use of \"without warrant\".\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by OP link Risk to the countryAt each review, government officials have provided a fresh assessment of the terrorist threat, showing that there is a catastrophic risk to the country or government, the official said.\"Only if those conditions apply do we even begin to think about this,\" he said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the intelligence operation.\n There's quite a difference, also, in the responses of McCain and Feingold.\n \n McCain shows proper restraint...Feingold shows exaggeration of fact.\n \n Some of you seem to be trying to paint a picture of thousands of black vans easing through neighborhoods trying to detect terrorists dialog with electronic devices, or scanning the airways for signs of terrorism on the gigajillions of phone calls we make daily. There's no reason to assume the snooping is random. Firstly, there aren't enough agents to do anything close to that. Secondly, and most importantly, for the 36 times Bush has re-upped the permission, he's been shown that there is grave threat to the US from suspected terrorist activity.\n \n Your collective claim of our rolling over and giving up civil liberties is unwarranted.\n Quote:\n \"The president has authorized NSA to fully use its resources - let me underscore this now - consistent with U.S. law and the Constitution to defend the United States and its citizens,\" the official said, adding that congressional leaders have also been briefed more than a dozen times.\n \n The President is doing his job. It's not necessary that you understand or be aware of everything that happens in this effort.\n \n \n Quote:\n You are mis reading the article, Jim. What she is saying is legal is the regular way of going about it, where the NSA obtains a warrant from a special court. She says nothign of the legality of the current system, where they spy on US citizens with no warrant. I am guessing it is pretty illegal since they are talking senate investigations and pressing charges against people/ \n The senate is prone to investigate just about every single thing that comes along these days, and there's already the purported shadow of impropriety and lawlessness. You are assuming guilt before hearing proof. All your opinions here are based on opinions of others, not the assembled \"whole truth\".\n \n \n Quote:\n Becuase you saw fit to jump into the middle of the thread without even bothering to read the article that is the topic of the thread. \n You had no evidence that I hadn't read it.

Even the bombings of their oil facilities was viewed as in fighting, becuse that could not possibly have been pulled off without the knowledge and support of key government personnel. N Korea also comes to mind. N korea should be paradise to those like Jim and Bassman who are hell bent on safety and care little for liberty. The North Koreans may not have much by way of personal freedom, but the secret police do a good job of ensuring that nobody could pull off a terrorist attack there. These places are totalitarian paradises. They strongly support the death penalty for everything from murder to rape to drug dealing to repeated theft. Both use the same mentality as jim (\"if you are not doing anything wring you do not have anythign to worry about\") to justify their totalitarian policies.Why can't these folks move to one of those countries as opposed to screwing up ours?\n Strawman! \n \n \n \n \n \n #39\n The strawman pacifists seems to have been making a lot of hay lately. The best you can do is extend my argument to the ridiculous and then blow it away...along with the straw.\n \n Get a grip on reality and realize what terrorists are trying to do.

The threat is of a totally different nature now. It involves individual maniac people, hard to distinguish from decent folk, planning years in advance to maim and murder with unconventional means not easily predicted. With our southern borders being about as effective as a flour sifter, there's no way to tell how many terrorists have already crossed it or how many will do so tomorrow.\n \n Not that I think the bomb shelters would have been successfully protective...they might have only allowed those in them to live a bit longer and suffer more hardships. They were good for business though.\n \n I can agree with you about ceasing to help ME countries (...after Iraq and Afghanistan are on their own two feet. We need to fix what we broke.) Excepting some difficulties with oil supply, if they fight each other, I won't care that much. If they attack our true friends, maybe we should help our friends out again, like we did Kuwait...and Israel.\n \n I'd be happy to leave them alone and see if they enjoy eating sand and drinking light crude.\n \n We're already unwelcomed in Saudi Arabia anyway.

Do you know that there first attacks on US troops occurred in the Sudan. Do you know that the Sudan is in Africa, hardly a middle eastern country?\n http://www.infoplease.com/spot/terror-qaeda.html\n After his expulsion from Saudi Arabia, bin Laden established headquarters for al-Qaeda in Khartoum, Sudan. The first actions of al-Qaeda against American interests were attacks on U.S. servicemen in Somalia. A string of terrorist actions suspected to have been orchestrated by al-Qaeda followed (see sidebar), and in August 1996 bin Laden issued a \"Declaration of War\" against the U.S.\n \n Al-Zawahiri is suspected of helping organize the 1997 massacre of 67 foreign tourists in the Egyptian town of Luxor and was indicted in connection with the bombing of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya.\n Tanzania and Kenya are also in Africa.\n I believe these attacks came before Afganistan and Iraq activities. If not, it's still a minor point.\n \n The principal stated aims of al-Qaeda are to drive Americans and American influence out of all Muslim nations, especially Saudi Arabia; destroy Israel; and topple pro-Western dictatorships around the Middle East. Bin Laden has also said that he wishes to unite all Muslims and establish, by force if necessary, an Islamic nation adhering to the rule of the first Caliphs. \n \n According to bin Laden's 1998 fatwa (religious decree), it is the duty of Muslims around the world to wage holy war on the U.S., American citizens, and Jews. Muslims who do not heed this call are declared apostates (people who have forsaken their faith).\n \n Did you catch the \"around the world\" part?

Your link about how surveillance WITH a warrant is legal is pretty much unrelated. \n It relates to big brother surveillance which IS the topic of this thread.

In order to make the intrusion, our laws require a warrant signed by a judge. That is one of our most basic rights.

Such courts are very popular in Saudi Arabia. I am telling you, bud, you would LOVE it there.

   "#80\n Well, I won't do a search to find them, but there have been several instances where my nemesis in this thread has appeared to support the cause of terrorism and condone their actions.\n \n \n \n \n #81\n I have heard more about this outrageous practice on conservative talk radio than anywhere else.\n \n \n \n \n #83\n You should try Michael Savage at least once also.\n \n \n \n #96\n All 3700 of his posts? Did you miss the one where he said he contributes to money to some charity knowing that at least some of the money goes to support terrorism? My memory is not failing. There was a multipost exchange between us wherein this occurred.\n \n It was way back in time, possibly over a year. The \"Find all posts...\" tag will show only the most recent 500 posts. I'm not familiar with getting into archives on this board. Maybe 500 is all they save.\n \n It's not that important to me though. However, my memory of it is clear. It occurred during series of my posts wherein I repeated my occasional motto \"Kill all terrorists and those who support them\". He chimed in with an exchange wherein he made the statements mentioned above.\n \n \n \n \n #97\n Thank you.\n \n \n \n \n #98\n I don't believe the army is still there.

Bush to withdraw all US armed forces from the kingdom as soon as any campaign to disarm Iraq has finished.\n \n \n \n \n #104\n ...involuntarily.\n \n (jim passes rope to gamehuis)\n \n \n \n \n #105\n I heard on NPR this morning that it takes about two days to get a warrant for a phone tap. There has to be a hearing...substantially more more than a fax and a five minute wait. After two days, the warrant is useless...the opportunity has passed.\n \n I'll wait for more to unfold before retracting my support for this type of warrantless spying. If it is that we tap calls and emails to foreign terrorists regardless of their source, then US citizens making such calls are fair game. If we tap a US citizen's phone or emails because he has been known to communicate with terrorists before, that citizen is also fair game. If we tap or track emails of a citizen who has done nothing in the way of communicating with terrorists, that is illegal and someone should lose his job.\n \n \n \n \n #108\n I believe in fighting fire with fire. I try to extend this to conversations also. If someone is polite and respectful to me, I generally respond in kind. If someone is rude and offensive to me, I generally respond with rudeness, disrepect and expletives.\n \n In the case of opposing terrorism, kindness and correctness will get us nowhere...except maybe dead.\n \n \n \n \n #109\n I see little sense in demanding we apply our rules regarding civil rights to foreign terrorists. Our Constitution is not intended to protect foreign terrorists. They do not respect our Constitution, why should it be used to respect them?\n \n It appears to me that the extension of our spying on foreign terrorist's conversations to argue that we are randomly spying on US citizens is a strawman sort of thing. I don't advocate random spying, but to attempt to extend our Constitutional protections to terrorists is ludicrous and self-defeating.\n \n \n \n \n #114\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by georged The process of securing a search warrant where I live is pretty simple.

I know it's quite simple to get a warrant to search someone's property, especially when all involved, including the judge, are \"good ole boys\". \n Quote:\n Electronic eavesdropping is a different situation. I'm not aware of any LE agency including the FBI with resources that possesses the electronic capability of the NSA.

That normally requires approval by a state attorney general or/and a federal judge using specific probable cause argument. Unless one has an illegal note from a standing president. \n ..and I don't think the taps in question were looking into business fraud or simple illegalities. They were directed at terrorism and conversations with terrorists. Until I hear that some other criteria was used to justify the taps, I will support the use of sneaky methods, legal or not, to be used against known terrorists and all those who communicate with them.\n \n As said earlier, Im certain the NSA has a list of known terrorists.

And, under provisions of the Patriot Act, none of those private or public companies were allowed to disclose you were under investigation or they would face criminal prosecution. And you wondered why your bank called your small business revolving credit line with no explanation? In our country your sense of 'fairness' approaches ignorance. LE with no restraint isn't going to make mistakes, serious mistakes that ruin lives? Or cross the line for political purposes? That's the reason we had checks and balances such as wire tap warrants, to protect the innocent. You're saying LE should be entitled to determine who they investigate with zero oversight. That's the definition of a police state. \n I'm not familiar enough with the specifics of the authorizations to comment. However, it is strawmanish to imply that all foreign calls are illegally monitored or that I support unrestrained LE. In the NSA only and directed toward foreign terrorists only do I support relaxing the standard procedures.\n \n \n \n \n #119\n I don't think we need a trial and guilty verdict to determine that Bin Laden and all his henchmen are terrorists. Visual sightings of people at terrorist training camps likely do not include non-terrorists. (Why do you think they always hide their faces on their beheading videos?) Captured computers likely contain contacts. Interrogation of captured terrorists likely reveals names of accomplices.\n \n Thankfully, the NSA has a lot more information than the average citizen does.

Maybe you could explain what you would have liked Carter to do about the Svoiet invasion of Afghanistan. This should be rich.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Carter\n One of the greatest contributors to Carter's political downfall came in November of 1979 when a pro-U.S. monarchy was toppled by the 1979 Iranian Revolution and dozens of American hostages were taken inside the American embassy by Islamic fundamentalist revolutionaries after Carter gave sanctuary to exiled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. With the international outrage at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan later the same year, Carter appeared impotent, as America saw its influence declining abroad.\n \n \n President Carter initially departed from the long-held policy of containment toward the Soviet Union, as first articulated in the Truman Doctrine and held to by all subsequent American presidents, both Republican and Democrat.\n \n See, he had no balls. John Kennedy made the Soviets back down with a blockade and fearless threat of nuclear war. Carter just relaxed and said in effect, \"Y'all can have Afghanistan.\"\n \n The main conflict between human rights and U.S. interests came in Carter's dealings with the Shah of Iran. The Shah had been a strong ally of America since World War II, and was one of the \"twin pillars\" upon which U.S. strategic policy in the Middle East was built. However, his rule was strongly autocratic. Though Carter praised the Shah as a wise and valuable leader, when a popular uprising against the monarchy broke out in Iran, the Carter administration did not intervene.\n The Shah was deposed and exiled. Many have since connected the Shah's dwindling U.S. support as a leading cause of his quick overthrow. Carter was initially prepared to recognize the revolutionary government of the monarch's successor, but his efforts proved futile.\n \n \n In December 1979, USSR invaded Afghanistan, after the pro-Moscow Afghanistan government placed by a 1978 coup was overthrown. There are many theories as to why the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Some believed the Soviets were attempting to expand their borders southward in order to gain a foothold in the region. The Soviet Union had long lacked a warm water port, and their movement south seemed to position them for further expansion toward Pakistan and India in the East, and Iran to the West. The Carter administration, and many Republicans and Democrats alike, feared that the Soviets were positioning themselves for a takeover of Middle Eastern oil. Others believed that the Soviet Union was fearful that the Muslim uprising would spread from Iran and Afghanistan to the millions of Muslims in the USSR. After the invasion, Carter announced the Carter Doctrine: that the US would not allow any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf. Carter terminated the Russian Wheat Deal, a keystone Nixon Detente initiative to establish trade with USSR and lessen Cold War tensions. The grain exports had been beneficial to people employed in agriculture, and the Carter embargo marked the beginning of hardship for American farmers. He also prohibited Americans from participating in the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, and reinstated registration for the draft for young males. Carter and Zbigniew Brzezinski started a $40 billion covert program of training Islamic fundamentalists in Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n \n The grain embargo hurt the American farmers and in turn, the American economy. (Don't we all remember those years of rampant inflation and high interest rates?)\n \n Refusing to take part in the Olympics simply gave the Russians more gold medals.\n \n I suppose one thing he might have done is similar to what Kennedy did against the Russians in the Cuban missile crisis. He could have thwarted their use of the seaport of Afghanistan. One of their key goals was a warm water port. He just didn't have the balls to stand up to them in such a military fashion.\n \n Another thing he could have done would have been to REFRAIN FROM LETTING THE RUSSIANS KNOW THAT HE WOULD NOT INTERFERE IF THEY INVADED AFGHANISTAN. That, my friend was a MAJOR blunder.\n \n Though his plan to train the Islamic fundamentalists is said to have contributed to the eventual collapse of the Soviet, it left the Taliban in control of the country...and we all know what happened after that.\n \n \n \n \n \n http://www.discoverthenetwork.org/in...asp?indid=1655\n \n \n \n \n \n While Carter's administration brought the U.S. some of its worst economic conditions in living memory - with soaring interest and inflation rates - his worst failing as President was in the realm of foreign policy. His human rights policy led to human rights disasters in Nicaragua and Iran, where he facilitated the rise to power of Marxists and Islamist despots, respectively. Both of those new tyrannies far surpassed the brutality of their predecessors. The fruits of the Iran disaster are still very much with the United States today. If the U.S. would have supported the Shah or his successors, the history of the past 25 years in the Middle East would have been very different, and the Iranian people would have fared much better. Moreover, the Soviet Union would have hesitated greatly over invading Afghanistan in 1979. Carter's timid approach to international conflicts emboldened the USSR to extend its reach further into the Third World. \n \n By letting the Soviets know he would not respond if they invaded Afghanistan, Carter spawned a war that ultimately saw one million dead Afghans, five million displaced, and a situation of evil that nurtured the Islamic hatred and militancy that ultimately turned on the West and brought about 9/11.\n \n During his Presidency and the years since then, Carter has demonstrated a refusal to acknowledge the hard reality that evil must sometimes be met with overwhelming force; that negotiation cannot always win the day when one is dealing with an enemy that has no interest in mutual respect or peaceful coexistence. Even Neville Chamberlain, the arch-appeaser of England in the 1930s, eventually came to understand the dark truth about the Nazis, but Carter and similarly minded leftists cannot be shaken from their sentimental view of the world, even by something as stark as 9/11.\n \n Carter is a mixture of neo-Kantianism-that is, the philosophical view that one's good intentions outweigh the practical consequences of one's actions and words-and leftwing Christian pacifism that believes the use of force is always wrong. Although Carter, like most leftists, says that the use of force is always to be available as \"the last resort,\" in practice Carter would never reach \"the last resort.\" There is always one more negotiation to be held, one more appeal to the United Nations, one more \"last-ditch effort\" to try. Whereas Ronald Reagan believed in \"peace through strength,\" Carter believes in \"peace through talk\"; this was the hallmark of his Presidency.\n \n \n \n \n #172\n Carter approved the plan. He was the President. He was driving the boat.\n \n Show me some strong evidence that a deal was worked out ahead of time and I will take you seriously.\n \n The truth is, the Soviets fear US Presidents who carry a big stick and are percieved to have the balls to use it. Jimmy Carter was a wussy President. He's done great things as an ex-President, but he did is a diservice as President.\n \n \n \n \n #178\n http://news.yahoo.com/s/ibd/20051220...0051219feature\n \n \n The effort has given Bush the chance \"to restart his case on why we're in Iraq,\" said Stephen Hess, professor of media and politics at George Washington University.\n \n While explaining and defending his strategy, Bush has gotten credit for his realistic appraisal of the challenges the U.S. faces, Hess said.\n \"The president has successfully pulled out of a tailspin,\" he said.\n \n Hess noted that Bush gave an especially forceful defense of his decision to authorize wiretaps of global communications of suspected terrorists without a court order.\n \n \n Maybe people are beginning to see the light!\n \n \n \n \n #182\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by daewoo Maybe you did not understand the question.

They shipped in soldiers in busses. The intel report on the Soviet Afghan border for the day of the invasion read \"normal activity, nothing significant to report\". After observing the fighting near the capitol, carter ordered the CIA to attempt to asses the situation. It took 1 day to get a report from the field. That report read \"The Soviets have invaded and have complete control over Afghanistan\".There was no possibility of \"containment\". The only option at that point was open warefare with the soviets, and we were not about to take that step. \n Read above these lines. Carter telegraphed our intent not to interfere BEFORE the invasion. \n \n Quote:\n Instead we used Afghanistan, and its indigenous people, to orchestrate the downfall of the Soviet Union. It was Afghanistan that broke the back of the soviet union, not anythign before or after. It bankrupted their military and as (or more) importantly it showed other nations that the Soviets COULD BE beat. \n You make it sound as if that was Chicken Carter's plan all along.\n \n Quote:\n Like I said, they already HAD Afghanistan. There was no opportnity for a simple blockade or anythign else. The only option for forceful removal was an extended engagement against an entrenched enemy in a nation half a world away, and without any friendly nation in the area to stage from, using a military that had just undergone an extensive retooling for jungle warfare that did no posess the manpower or equipment to revert to mountain warfare. Good luck with that one. \n Again, read my answers before spouting off.\n \n \n Quote:\n Uh, and you really think that the inflation and high interest rates were caused by the loss of less than $1 billion in grain exports? \n It helped.\n \n \n Quote:\n WTF? Are you sure you have not been lobotomized? \n No. I see you've finally learned how to spell it.\n Quote:\n Keeping in mind that Afghanistan is landlocked, whose port would we have blockaded?

Some people thought that after gaining control of Afghanistan the Russians were going to take part of Pakistan, including Karachi, where there is a warm water port. Personally, I think that argument is ridiculous. The Russians have several ports that, while not warm water, do not close seasonally. For years prior to the invasion of Afghanistan, the Russians supported the leader of Afghanistan, including massive amounts of military equipment. HE was overthrown, and the new boys on the block were rabidly anti russian. It is far more likely that the Russians simply did not want that particular leader armed with all the goodies they had passed on to Afghansitan over the years. I can't believe that you are so pig headed that you came back and debated this point without even bothering to find a map of Afghanistan. Even your own link does not support your argument here:Quote:The Soviet Union had long lacked a warm water port, and their movement south seemed to position them for further expansion toward Pakistan and India in the East, and Iran to the West. Even this does not suggest that Afghanistan had a port (which anybody even marginally familiar with Afghanistan knows they do not). It says that their movement positioned them for further expansion. I guess whoever wrote the article assumed that any reasonably intelligent person already understood that Afghanistan is a land locked country.\n \n I have explained my lack of thoroughness in the port mistake. I don't know your age, but I'm wondering if you were still wet behind the ears in the '70s when Carter was considered BY MANY to have done exactly as I claim.

Your article is implying that by failing to support the shah Carter telegraphed to the Russians that we would not interfere. I think the guy who wrote your article is an idiot.

The most recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Jimmy Carter, is dumber than a box of rocks.He is the quintessential liberal without the slightest grasp of reality. \"But, Alan, he was the President of the United States,\" you say. That's right. And the good citizens of this nation voted him out after just one term because they quickly came to the conclusion he didn't have a clue about either domestic or foreign affairs. The various despots of the world took a look at Jimmy and instantly knew they had nothing to fear. In 1979, his failure to support to the shah of Iran led to the rise of the Islamic jihad that threatens the world today. The shah was overthrown by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini whose gang of Muslim bullyboys took US diplomats hostage and held them for 444 days. It wasn't until President Ronald Reagan took the oath of office that they were freed. To this day, I am convinced he let the Iranians mullahs know he would blow Tehran off the face of the map if they didn't turn our diplomats loose. Later he would bomb Muamar Quadaffi of Libya who has been conspicuously careful ever since.In his book, In the Shadow of the Ayatollah , William J. Daugherty, a former Marine who joined the CIA and was among those held hostage by the Iranians, noted that \"Iran under the shah commenced an extensive modernization program while adopting a staunchly pro-West, anticommunist political posture.\" When Carter withdrew his support, the shah was forced to flee and the fires of Islamic fanaticism were lighted, leading ultimately to 9-11. Iran, today, is among President Bush's triumvirate of the \"Axis of Evil.\" Iranians, to their credit, are in the streets seeking to overthrow the ayatollahs who deny them the freedoms we take for granted.Carter also presided over the \"return\" of the Panama Canal to that nation. The Red Chinese moved in, purchasing facilities at both ends of the Canal built with US dollars and protected for years by US troops. Our control of this most strategic facility between the North and South American continents should never have been abandoned. Carter \"negotiated\" with the North Koreans, thinking, as all liberals do, that if you're just nice enough to Communists, they will keep their word. Today, North Korea continues to threaten South Korea, Japan, and our nation, but now it does so with missiles and a nuclear program. This isn't about 20-20 hindsight. This is about Carter's abject stupidity and Bill Clinton's treachery.In accepting the Nobel Peace Prize, Carter identified the United Nations as the one institution capable of maintaining the peace, ignoring the historic fact that it has been US strength that has enforced whatever peace there is in the world. It was US troops that restrained North Korea when it invaded the South. Thousands of our troops remain there. It was US troops that ended Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. The list of US peacekeeping is long, but the UN has never insured any peace in its 55 years. \"War may sometimes be a necessary evil. But no matter how necessary, it is always an evil, never a good. We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each other's children,\" said Carter. Wrong. Utterly, totally wrong! Harry Truman, the President who thwarted the North Korean invasion in the 1950s said it best. \"Freedom is still expensive. It still costs money. It still costs blood. It still calls for courage and endurance, not only in soldiers, but in every man and woman who is free and who is determined to remain free.\"There have always been good wars. If the French and Austrians had not stopped the invading Islamic armies in past centuries, all Europe would be speaking Arabic today. If the allies had not stopped the armies of Nazi Germany we would be speaking German today and the Japanese would control all of Asia. The general who led the allies in World War II, Dwight D. Eisenhower, later to serve as US President, said, \"We must be ready to dare all for our country. For history does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid.\"Carter is both weak and timid. His words condemn him, but while accepting the Peace Prize he condemned President Bush's policy of preventative intervention in Iraq, a nation that has defied the UN for more than a decade. Had Hitler's ambitions been thwarted in the 1930's, millions would not have died. Had we not dropped atomic bombs on Japan to end the war in the Pacific, the US would have suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties. If we do not learn the lessons of history, we are condemned to repeat it.Let the Nobel Committee give out its meaningless Peace Prize to the likes of Jimmy Carter, and let the rest of us prepare for a new war whenever and wherever the forces of evil seek to destroy freedom. \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Zell Miller 1992: \"I made it because Franklin Delano Roosevelt energized this nation.

They were wrong. They claimed Reagan's defense buildup would lead to war. They were wrong. And, no pair has been more wrong, more loudly, more often than the two Senators from Massachusetts, Ted Kennedy and John Kerry.\"\n http://www.partialobserver.com/article.cfm?id=653The InvasionOn November 4, 1979 an Iranian Islamic cleric, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, declared war on America when his militant Islamic followers invaded the United States by attacking the sovereign territory of the US embassy in Tehran, kidnapping 52 US diplomats and holding them hostage for 444 days. The weak and ineffectual response of President Jimmy Carter to this invasion of the United States provided the radical Islamic world with all the evidence it needed to convince itself the West was a culture in decline, and it's leading country, America, could be humiliated and defeated easily, and with impunity. America's failure to respond to the Iranian Invasion of America with a severe and decisive military action was to World War Three what Europe's reaction to Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia was to World War Two - a timid response of appeasement that encouraged imperialistic dreams of world conquest in a sociopathic mentality.http://www.trumanproject.org/trumanpaper3.htmlInstead, the next Presidential contest brought the election of Jimmy Carter, who suffered through four years of well-intentioned misadventures in security policy, deepening the impression that Democrats were hostile to the military and deeply suspicious of American power, not the party you wanted in charge when an international emergency demanded tough action. From the start, Carter sent signals that he would pursue an excuse-me foreign policy. Carter picked Cyrus Vance, perceived by some as \"the closest thing to a pacifist that the U.S. has ever had as Secretary of State\" as his lead diplomat, and Andrew Young, who once suggested, \"it may take the destruction of Western civilization to allow the rest of the world to really emerge as a free and brotherly society,\" as Ambassador to the United Nations. (15)The new president's first foreign policy act, taken within 24 hours of his inauguration, was to order the removal of all nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula. A few days later he followed up by announcing his intention to withdraw all American ground troops from Korea. A host of defense-minded Democratic Senators, including Sam Nunn, Scoop Jackson, John Glenn, and Hubert Humphrey, joined virtually unanimous Republican opposition to the plan to pull the troops out of Korea, and Carter was forced to rescind the idea. Carter then proceeded to cut the seven-year defense budget he inherited from Ford by $57 billion. (16) Later he abruptly canceled the B-1 bomber program shortly before production. As one observer put it, \"If the President had only done something to soften the impact of his announcement on congressional and public attitudes, the troubles and criticism he received probably would not have been so great.\" (17) By the spring of 1979, 62% of Americans thought the U.S.'s position in the world was \"becoming weaker.\" (18)Carter's initial missteps poisoned public perception of his fitness to handle America's security, particularly in the midst of a crisis abroad. After initially rallying around the President in the wake of the Iranian hostage crisis, the public quickly grew impatient with his inability to bring the hostages home safely. When a daring rescue attempt ended in failure, public mistrust of Carter only grew. (19) Similarly, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was blamed on Carter's conciliatory stance toward the Soviet Union. (20) By the end of his four years in office, the American public \"felt bullied by OPEC, humiliated by the Ayatollah Khomeini, tricked by Castro, out-traded by Japan and out-gunned by the Russians.\" (21) The narrative of Democratic incompetence spoiled Carter's foreign policy successes, most notably the Camp David Accords.To be sure, Carter was wise to recognize the security relevance of \"soft\" foreign policy tools such as human rights promotion (the Bush Administration has lately come around to this view itself). But whatever the wisdom of Carter's policies, their political symbolism was disastrous, feeding into the perception that Democrats shy away from projecting American power and leave our security vulnerable. Because Carter's policies were seen as weak, his symbols began to seem weak as well. Concepts like peace, cooperation, and human rights came under Carter to imply weakness. Together, these fueled a negative narrative. Without intending it, Jimmy Carter drove home the notion that Democrats were skeptical of American strength, determined to scale back the military, and too timid to stand up to our enemies' acts of aggression.Like I said, Daewoo, Carter told the Russians we would do nothing if they invaded Afghanistan. He told them with his actions and his weakness. Carter was a military wimp.Come on. Be a man and admit it so we can go on to something important. \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Daewoo Quote: He wasn't ALL bad. He was just a wimp when it came to flexing military muscles.

The Bay of Pigs was simply a failed effort. The Cuban blockade wherein Kennedy stood up to the Russians was not...and he didn't have to set foot in Cuba to make their missiles disappear. Carter's abandonment of the Truman Doctrine (He was the only President, Democrat or Republican, up to that time to do such a stupid thing) set the stage for Russia's advance. \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Daewoo Quote: I have explained my lack of thoroughness in the port mistake.

There was no gain for the US in attempting to invade Afghnaistan in order to take the coutnry back, and the expense, incluidng retooling the entire US military for the job, would have been HUGE. We had no way to get our troops into the country, no way to resupply them, and no real chance of vistory since the entire Soviet militarty could be brought to bear in less than 14 days to end any kind of ill advised US intervantion.There will always be those who believe that having the best military in the world is a magic wand that can be waved to make problems go away. They are sorely mistaken. If you can not get you men and equipment into a location, and with enough troopp strenght to secure your method in ingress, you cannot possibly win. If you cannot resupply your troops efficiently, you cannot possibly win. What it comes down to is that we could not possibly have won in Afghanistan. While th US military was certainly better than the Soviet military technologically, we sould almost cetainly have lost in Afghanistan. We chose a long time ago to equip our military with relatively few \"superweapons\" instead of optign to provide weapons that could be quickly and produced and that are cheap enough that we can afford to produce them in quantitiy. This makes for a military that is highly effective in a limied engagement, or an engagment against a smaller adversary. Against the Soviets in afghansitan, even if we had managed to put the ENTIRE US military on the groud, we would have certainly lost. While US tanks had provent to be twices as effective as soviet tanks, they had 6x as many tanks as we had. Their fighters were only 80% as effective as ours, but they had 4X the number. Couple this with the fact that their resupply and reinforcements were hours away, while ours were days away. They could outproduce us on ordinance nearly 10 to 1. They had complete control of the country, including fortified military postions and already had a complete supply chain in place that they had built for the Afghanis. It was a war that we could not possibly have won.\n This point has been adequately addressed. We didn't have to set foot in Afghanistan to back the Russians down. The lead up to the invasion was quite lengthy. Carter just never showed he had any balls...whoops, I guess that's because he didn't...or was he just too timid to expose himself? \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Daewoo Quote: That was not his argument.

You are arguing that our handling of Iran, when we did not get directly involved in a POPULAR overthrow somehow sent the Russians a signal that it was OK to overthrow Afghanistan. Lets step into the real world here for just a minute, Jim. The soviets invaded afghanistan becuase the Afghani governemtn had lost control over the islamic fighters in the country. There is no question of that. They were afraid that the islamic militant movement would extend into the islamic population of the USSR, causing an internal conflict. We let it go because there was nothign we could do. The Soviets were untouchable. We also let it go because Carters national security advisor on the DAY of the invasion, came up with the plan to use the war in Afghnaistan as the Soviets Vietnam. Beyond that, we did NOT want Islamic militancy to spread.Carters plan on this, drafted by his NSA, was to keep the soviets fighting the Afghnais for years to come but WITHOUT giving the Afghanis enough resources for a decisive victory in order to bleed out the Soviet Union and DEFINATLY without supporting the Islamic fundamentalists. We supported ONLY the northern alliance, a loose confederation of secular interests.Reagan came along and thought that we could accelerate the Afghan conflict, and thus the breakup of the Soviet Union by putting more support against the soviets. He tasked the CIA with organizing, training, and equipping the Islamic fundamentalists. Al Queda was born (gee, that was a good idea...not). Our support of the islamic militants certainly accelerated the Soviets defeat in Afghnaistan, but also fueled an increase in Islamic fundamentalism and militancy in the ME. Reagan did what Carter was unwilling to, he taught Islamic militants how to defeat a superpower.\n You've already claimed that the plan to assist the Afghan rebels was Carter's advisor's plan (seeming to deny it was Carter's). Carter was driving the boat...I believe that was my response the first time we went over this. Carter was therefore not unwilling to teach militants how to defeat a superpower. You are merely pulling your expected tricks of switching the argument. I'm chasing shadows again...I'm seriously considering that lobotomy!\n \n \n \n \n #200\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by daewoo And led to full scale war with the soviets.

Take a look at http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch29ir.htmlIt is a PEER REVIEWED article about the fall of the Shah from a non partisan source. The US NEVER pulled its supprot fromt he Shah. Even AFTER he left Iran, we continued to support him and it caused the Iranian hostage crisis. This is where your argument falls flat on its face and proves to be the argument of an ignorant political partisan wntirely lacking logic. If we had pulled supprt form the Shah, WHY did we take him in and grant him asylum? WHY did we not return him to Iran in exchange for the hostages? Simply put, Carter felt that the US had promised the Shah support, and it was time to live up to that promise. That is all there is to it. \n There's a link following that that you apparently failed to read. It offers FACTUAL EVIDENCE that the US abandoned the Shah.\n \n Get a grip on reality, genius! \n Quote:\n Any connection between the loss fo the Shah and the invasion of Afghanistan is simply idiotic. First, we never abandonded the Shah. Second, if we HAD abandoned the Shah, or were percieved as having abandoned the Shah, the argument that this somehow encouraged teh Soviets to INVADE another nation is simply retarded. WE KNOW WHY the soviets invaded Afghanistan. We know becuase the curtain fell a long time ago (thanks a lot more to Jimmy carter than to Ronald Regan) and the Soviets invaded Afghanistan beause they were afraid that with the ISalmic Militants running thing, they would have trouble with their own Islamic population. The Pro soviet governemtn there had fallem, the Sovietsa already had military assetes in teh country,a nd they figured that could invade it quickly and easily nd the problem would be solved. They were right about the invasion wrong about the \"problem solved\" part. Their invasion took less than 3 days, and fewer than 300 Soviets died. They could not control the country after they took it, though. \n again, you spout denials.\n Quote:\n The kicker to this is that I wish Carter HAD abandoned the Shah. The Shah was a tyrant, and the islamic revolution was wildly popular (80+ percent support). Because of US support and weapons, hundreds of thousands of Iranians were killed. That should not have happened. Iranians had as much right to self determination as anybody. If that large a percentage of the people wanted the Shah out, we should not have tried to help him hold on to power. The Shah loosing power was only a bad thing if you hold the arrogant view that the US knows what is best for everybody on the planet and that we haev the rigth to force our culture on others. The Iranians saw wester culture and soundly rejected it...just as the Iraqis are now. Still, any connection made between the actions of the US regarding the internal workings of a third tier nation, and the decision of a super power to invade another nations is just absolutly stupid. There are no two ways about it and there is no nice way to put it. It is nothing but partisan BS, and not even intelligent partisan BS at that. The US would have WITHOUT QUESTION, lost a war in afghanistan, and since it would have essentially been a direct war with the Soviets, it would have been WWIII, and quite possibly the end of the planet earth. ...Carter was more than willing to teach militants to defeat a super power, just not islamic fundamentalist militants. He sent officers to work with the Northern alliance, a group of anti Soviet, pro western militants. His goal was to use Afghanistan as the Soviets Vietnam, but WITHOUT contributing to the spread of islamic militancy. It is undeniable that the war in Afghanistan led to the downfall of the Soviet Union. It is also undeniable that the spread of Islamic militancy and Islamic fundamentalism has NOT been a good thing. Considering those two facts, I would say that Carters strategy in Afghanistan was a good one. \n We weren't discussing whether the Shah demise was good or bad. We're discussing whether he was abandoned by Carter or not. He was and you simply are speculating in your favor regarding whether we could or could not have beat the Russians in a showdown over their invasion of Afghanistan. \n \n Quote:\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_...of_AfghanistanEducate yourself. The lead up to invasion was lengthy? It was a complete sneak attack. Teh Soviets had troops stationed IN AFGHANISTAN. Soviet technicians were responsible for MAINTENANCE on Afghani equipmet. In fact, the Afghanis were unable to mount any effective defense because the day before the invasion, those same soviet technicians told the Afghani commanders that they had to take the batteries out of all the vehicles for winter maintenance. They removed all the batteries and drained all the acid from them. The next day when the soviets invaded and the Afghani soldiers got in their vehicles, they would not start. There was no buildup to the war. We did not even know it had happened until after it was over. It took us several days just to figure out it had been the soviets and not in internal coup, despite the fact that we CIA operatves ont he ground in Afghanistan. The PEOPLE of Afghanistan did not even realize they had been invaded. Most of the MILTARY in Afghanistan did nto know the soviets had invaded until days later. NOBODY ON THE PLANET had any idea the Soviets were even considering an invasion of Afghanistan, least of all America. The lead up to the invasion was NOT lengthy. Afghanistan was a Russian ALLY. \n Wrong again.\n \n http://fas.org/irp/cia/product/afghanistan/\n \n Apparently you were asleep when all this happened. There were concerns of Soviet take over in Afghanistan for months before it happened. Had it been only weeks, Carter still would have had time to posture himself menacingly instead of looking like the weak, meek sheep that he was. \n \n Compare that to Kennedy who only took a few hours after verifying the threat to respond like a brave leader.\n \n You argument again is all wet. Carter was a wimp. It is only in retrospect that we see that his chickeness helped with the collapse od Soviet Russia. He helped by accident and now his cronies claim credit for something they really never conceived as a plan.\n \n \n \n \n #205\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by daewoo BTW, Jim,I was going to give you enough rope to hang yourself with this one, since, like most other subjects, it is blatantly obvious that you did not bother to do any research and have limited your knowledge to political talking points.The Shia are expcted to take 140 out of 275 seats in the parliment.

I consider any such talk to be \"coddling\" the terrorists.\n \n The donations were not the singular cause of my statement. You make it sound so. Whether one suspects that some portion of a contribution will go into the local terrorism campaign should weigh heavily on the consideration of going through with it. Were I not allergic to jail, I would decrease may tax payments based upon my disagreement with various budget items. I do not have the luxury of withholding payment. Any contributor to any cause does. Perhaps he sent along a note saying none of his money was to be used for terrorism, letting them know that he doesn't condone it. However, based on other things, I doubt he did.\n \n Based on the above, I have to conclude that he still appears to condone.\n \n ...but to answer your question as stated: No.\n \n \n \n \n #228\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by daewoo The problem when it comes to palestenian charities is that many of the biggest charitable organizations also have the biggest militant factions.

AFIK, the palestenians are freedom fighters. If they blow up some israeli busses, I am ok with that.

The terrorists here are the ones fighting for human rights. They are fighting for the most basic of human rights...the right to self determination. You have the right to freedom.

Perhaps you've hung out with daewoo too long.\n \n The US has already been attacked several times in various ways, each employing stealth and explosives. So far, most of the attacks have been out of \"the States\", but I do recall one several years back that took over 3000 lives of innocents from many nations. Explosives were used there, too...they were stolen and plowed into targets along with the innocent people that happened to be aboard.\n \n Rubber rafts are not required. Invasion is not required.

If you wanna go back to the first terrorists, you'll find the Jews against the Jews, with daggers, among \"friends\". If you want to justify the suicide bombings with something besides \"these people have a just cause\" then have at it. I'm for stopping the use of explosives. I've stated so in other threads. I do support a moratorium on the use of bombs by ANYBODY! I want the bombing to STOP!\n \n It is not bravado that drives me to criticize those who support IN ANY CONSCIOUS WAY the activities of suicide bombers. If it is hate I'm displaying, it's certainly not misplaced. I don't really hate terrorists. I just want to see them all DEAD!\n Quote:\n ...Or use a version of Hitler's 'final solution', as you're proposing. Nice people many of we American's have turned into trying to falsify our own blunders. No wonder the world despises our arrogance. \n Another straw-man. Shame on you. Everybody wants to bring up Hitler and his maniacal campaign to exterminate and control people and compare it to the US led campaign to enable self-rule and freedom to prevail. Hitler was one of the greatest of racists that has lived to date. The US stands for all races. \n \n I'm not proposing anything close to Hitler's 'final solution'. I just want to defeat terrorism, like that that breeds bastards like Hitler.\n \n \n The choice of weapons on either side may be said nearly infinite. Knives, Side-arms, Rifles, Automatic weapons, Mortars, RPGs, IEDs, strap-on vest bombs, heavy car and truck bombs are available to both sides. Precision guided \"surgical\" weapons are primarily on our side.\n \n As long as suicide bombings and other totally random acts of violence continue, there will be those hunting down the perpetrators using whatever weapons are deemed suitable and within the rules of fair warfare. We choose not to use many of the weapons being used by terrorists. We do issue explosives when terrorists are targeted. Some civilians die from mistakes, errant munitions and other causes related to the attack, but it can in no way be attributed to intent of death. This is in contrast to the intent of a suicide bomber's mission...to inflict as much civilian death and maiming as possible. That's why the gutless bastards are pasted with nails, nuts and bolts.\n \n I'm in favor of the US vacating the area also.... as long as the relative stability of free nations is not overrun and Israel stays right where it is. Then we'd have to come back and spank XXX again.\n \n \n \n \n #294\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by OccamsRazor Hitler was not \"bred\" by terrorism.

Unless you want to illustrate how Hitler was bred by terrorism \n I did choose the wrong word. Thank you. \"Like that that feeds bastards like Hitler\" works better for me.\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by OR That's one of the things that irks me with the 'war on terror', the subversion of historical examples (by both sides) to justify their rightousness. \n I didn't bring it up.

No doubt those short of a limb or two will share the sentiment as well.\n My intent was to point out the difference between deliberately killing innocent people and accidentally killing them. I am sure the resentment is there regardless of lack of intent. However, I would likely harbor more resentment for the suicide bomber that killed my child than I would toward the stray police bullet that killed my child during a firefight with terrorists...and there would likely be some comfort in knowing the police didn't intend to kill my child.\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by OR Were you in favour of the US sticking its nose back in to start with?

If the terrorist commander had the same attached value of an innocent human as the commander of those who would stop him, there would be no bombings, suicide or other. The terrorists are driven by retarded culture worship that includes swinging a sword while emitting a blood curdling scream.\n \n \n \n Quote:\n That is the weight that comes with command.

You may find one where I mentioned that he failed to support the Shah, but this is a matter of fact.

You then display a complete and total ignorance of the entire Iranian conflict, the entire conflict in afghanistan, and even try to blame carter for our current problems, based on his failure to support the shah. \n\n \n Then, you, for whatever reason (not sure on this one) felt compelled to C&P an ENTIRE THREAD here rather than just pointing people towards it so they could read it properly formatted. I can only imagine that this is because you wanted to blast people with it and make it as difficult to read as possible, thus reducing the chance that they WILL read it, and see very clearly that my first contention, that you fault carter for not properly supporting the shah, is without any question correct.\n \n Then, you come back with this final post, where you make yourself look both dishonest AND stupid.:\n \n \nIf you read carefully, you'll see that the long discussion regarding Carter's weakness was a link which I copied out of courtesy to the reader.

   "To me the religon and the extremists are a distraction from what needs to be done in the Middle East.\n \n Yes the policy of America and Britian to do with the Middle East is XXXX. The reason for this is they have their own agenda of what they want and seem to ignore International law. Look at Iraq - a complete disaster from all accounts with open civil war between the different factions in the country. Not only that they went in their ilegally with no justification. With this I mean there were no weapons of mass destruction or at the time before the invasion were not links to global terorism (well nothing has been found yet). All Iraq has done is fuel extremist and acts almost like a training ground for them when insurgents enter and leave the country. Just this in itself makes their policy XXXX. Not only that they seem to ignore international law with regard to the Chebba Farms and Golan Heights. One of the first thing Bush and Blair should have done in the Middle East is to set up an international UN peace keeping force to ocuppy the Cheba farms and Golan Heights and remove all Israeli troops from both area's of land. Then remove all Mines and Israeli weaponary and buildings. This would have gained the American and Brittish alot of respect from Arabic countries in the Middle East. At an agreed time there would be a hand over of the the land to it rightful legal owners when. this could take years, but at least Syrian and Lebanese land would not be occupied by Israeli troops and that in itself would help to defuse the situation. After this they address the Palestinian problem and establishemnt of a Palestinian state within the Middle East.\n \n Thats the whole problem the Americans and British have not tackled any of the three above issues. Th Golan heights, Chebba Farms and the establishement of Palestinian state have to be tackled to give a chance for peace and tackling the extremist problem. The other problem is that the Amricans and Brittish are not acting impartially when dealing with the Middle East.They have to be seen to be not on anyones side to be able to negotiate peace in the area. Look at America sending bunker busting bomb via Britian to Israel to bomb Lebanon. How can that be considered an act of a neutral impartial power able to negotiate peace in the Middle East.",

   "So that's what it's all about with sending more 22 thousand U.S. troops to Iraq! First of all that's funny figures for 22 thousand thrown into the cauldron of Iraq will make little military difference. But not long ago Condi explained this riddle announcing that those forces might be sent to Iran and Syria in May this year. And those 22,000 are just formal figures for mass media. In practice they'll send to Middle East about 80,000 U.S. troops.\n And U.S. European yes-men like Poland, and Czechia, and Baltic countries are to support them together with Georgia, and Moldova, and Ukraine, and Azerbaijan (GUAM). And those three last ones are obliged \"voluntary\" send their people to those \"hot spots\" in the guise of co-operation with U.S. security agencies. In those countries recruitment is already going on at full speed.\n It reminds Middle Ages when in case of war vassals of noble mighty feudal lords had to recruit peasants from villages under their control. They were irregulars and cannon-fodder. Looks as if New Europe and GUAM pay U.S. overlord some kind of feudatory tribute. And someone (Moldova, and Ukraine, and Azerbaijan) pay with lives of their peoples.",
