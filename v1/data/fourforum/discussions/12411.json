   "I agree that you shouldn't be put on Megan's list unless you actually forced someone to do something they didn't want to do (this doesn't only include rape, but if you make them pose for nude pictures, do a striptease, etc. then you should be put on the list). I have a few scenarios. \n \n 1. Suppose you're a senior in high school (eighteen years old) when you get nude pictures of a fifteen year old girl on your cell phone, but you don't bother to check your cell phone so you don't know about them. So someone else, someone you don't even know is caught looking at the pictures and sent to the office. It turns out that this kid is the first person to distribute these images and he tells everyone he sent them to. So your best friend gets called to the office and he mentions among the list of people he sent them to, that you were one of them. You don't realize that you have the photos on your cell phone until you get to the office; but it's too late. You'll now have to explain them to the judge, but you didn't even know about them until now.\n \n 2. I had a friend who this happened to. He had to hide out from the police for a couple weeks. Unlike the previous scenario, it was more or less his fault but I really don't think he deserved to be put on a Megan's list for it. He was eighteen and he had sex with a fifteen year old girl. But the thing is, she consented to it. In fact, from what I've heard, it was her idea. They broke up a few weeks after that, and in her bitterness, she called the police and said he raped her. I thought it was interesting how they got along so well even after this \"rape\". \n \n Of course, few people would have the nerve to get up on the witnesses stand in front of dozens of people and call a teary-eyed, traumatized-looking girl a liar. But if it can be proven to the Jury that the underaged person consented to it, then the accused shouldn't be considered guilty of anything.\n \n 3. Suppose a guy gets really drunk and walks down the street naked or does his business in the hallway in an apartment building. He should definitely be charged with indecent exposure/public urination, but he shouldn't be put on Megan's list for it. Besides making work for the janitor or sending the wrong message to children, he didn't really hurt anyone by what he did, even though it was incredibly stupid and he should be at least fined or put on parole for it.",

   "Should a seventeen year old girl be arrested and put on the sex offender registry for pleasuring a boy who is almost legally old enough to consent?\n \n \"ONE day in 1996 the lights went off in a classroom in Georgia so that the students could watch a video.
