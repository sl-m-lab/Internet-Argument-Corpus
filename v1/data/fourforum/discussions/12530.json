Additionally, the associated federal regulations interpreting these laws are even larger. Minimum penalty for a violation is typically 5 years in federal prison for every offense.\n \n It is estimated that there are between 22,000 and 30,000 gun laws on the books in America. Those laws include restrictions on possession, carry, distribution, storage, transfer, manufacture, sale, ownership, importation, use and more. \n\n The Virgina Tech Killer was a gifted Engineering student. Even if we found a way to totally dis-invent guns, does anyone think, in this day of suicide bombers, that this guy could not of thought of another way to implement his carnage?\n \n One thread in common I have found is, that these guys believe that they have been totally screwed over and picked on. Either real, like Columbine, or imagined, like the recent New York and VT killings. This seems to me to be the key, and the way we should approach these tragedies. How can we stop the real bullying, and the imagined bullying as well. \n \n I have talked to school teachers, and law enforcement, and the Jock bullying has become horrendous. If you agree that, what we have been doing is not working, then, we need to do a better job of socialization, and make the bullies know that this is unacceptable. We should instead teach that it is the Jocks responsibility to protect the weaker students, or something similar. \n \n But unfortunately we have kicked God out of our School settings, and we seem to lack the teaching of morals, and or right and wrong. Instead we teach something like situational ethics or something similar.",

How many unarmed people have to be killed in a \"gun free zone\" before you come to realize that mandating unarmed and helplessness will do nothing to save even a single life?\n \n \nA lot more people die in gun accidents than in mass shootings.\n\n \n Aha!
