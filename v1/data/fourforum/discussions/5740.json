   "Do know that the real number of losses in Iraq is concealed? Yet even official facts are so outrageous that I like the majority of Americans think that the number of human losses is inadmissible. Did the war against Hussein give us more peace and safety? On contrary, this war became the Second Vietnam for us, and even worse. Our soldiers are returning home as miserable losers not as winners! Our army is becoming degraded. I've heard that there was the order not to retire for drunkenness, and drug addiction, and abusing, and even murders of natives.\n No wonder that veterans of Iraq suffer from mental diseases and can be dangerous to society. Also speaks volumes the fact that number of divorces in families of such military men much increased.\n So it is no surprise that young people refuse to serve in the army and Pentagon can't enroll the planned number of recruits already for 4 months in a row. Some of the experts even inclined to believe that soon the conscription would be renewed!",
