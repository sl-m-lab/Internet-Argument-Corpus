   "EKET, Nigeria (AP) - The nine-year-old boy lay on a bloodstained hospital sheet crawling with ants, staring blindly at the wall.\n \n His family pastor had accused him of being a witch, and his father then tried to force acid down his throat as an exorcism. It spilled as he struggled, burning away his face and eyes. The emaciated boy barely had strength left to whisper the name of the church that had denounced him - Mount Zion Lighthouse.\n \n A month later, he died.\n \n Nwanaokwo Edet was one of an increasing number of children in Africa accused of witchcraft by pastors and then tortured or killed, often by family members. Pastors were involved in half of 200 cases of \"witch children\" reviewed by the AP, and 13 churches were named in the case files.\n \n Some of the churches involved are renegade local branches of international franchises. Their parishioners take literally the Biblical exhortation, \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\"\n \n \"It is an outrage what they are allowing to take place in the name of Christianity,\" said Gary Foxcroft, head of nonprofit Stepping Stones Nigeria.\n \n For their part, the families are often extremely poor, and sometimes even relieved to have one less mouth to feed. Poverty, conflict and poor education lay the foundation for accusations, which are then triggered by the death of a relative, the loss of a job or the denunciation of a pastor on the make, said Martin Dawes, a spokesman for the United Nations Children's Fund.\n \n \"When communities come under pressure, they look for scapegoats,\" he said. \"It plays into traditional beliefs that someone is responsible for a negative change ... and children are defenseless.\"\n \n The idea of witchcraft is hardly new, but it has taken on new life recently partly because of a rapid growth in evangelical Christianity. Campaigners against the practice say around 15,000 children have been accused in two of Nigeria's 36 states over the past decade and around 1,000 have been murdered. In the past month alone, three Nigerian children accused of witchcraft were killed and another three were set on fire.\n \n Nigeria is one of the heartlands of abuse, but hardly the only one: the United Nations Children's Fund says tens of thousands of children have been targeted throughout Africa.\n \n Church signs sprout around every twist of the road snaking through the jungle between Uyo, the capital of the southern Akwa Ibom state where Nwanaokwo lay, and Eket, home to many more rejected \"witch children.\" Churches outnumber schools, clinics and banks put together. Many promise to solve parishioner's material worries as well as spiritual ones - eight out of ten Nigerians struggle by on less than $2 a day.\n \n \"Poverty must catch fire,\" insists the Born 2 Rule Crusade on one of Uyo's main streets.\n \n \"Where little shots become big shots in a short time,\" promises the Winner's Chapel down the road.\n \n \"Pray your way to riches,\" advises Embassy of Christ a few blocks away.\n \n It's hard for churches to carve out a congregation with so much competition. So some pastors establish their credentials by accusing children of witchcraft.\n \n Nwanaokwo said he knew the pastor who accused him only as Pastor King. Mount Zion Lighthouse in Nigeria at first confirmed that a Pastor King worked for them, then denied that they knew any such person.\n \n Bishop A.D. Ayakndue, the head of the church in Nigeria, said pastors were encouraged to pray about witchcraft, but not to abuse children.\n \n \"We pray over that problem (of witchcraft) very powerfully,\" he said. \"But we can never hurt a child.\"\n \n The Nigerian church is a branch of a Californian church by the same name. But the California church says it lost touch with its Nigerian offshoots several years ago.\n\n Churches involved in torture, murder of thousands of African children denounced as witches -- latimes.com\n \n Well.\n Apple didn't fall far from that tree. Just a few hundred years in the past.\n I wonder how many of the evangelists that went to Africa made sure to cover the \"Love thy neighbor as thyself\" in great detail...",

   "If one is of the opinion that the ends justifies the means then it is highly logical and indeed an obligation to force religion on to the people.\n\n But my response is do the means ACTUALLY ACHIEVE the ends in the first place?\n If a person is going to argue for terrorist attacks in order to stop U.S. involvement in the Middle East, but the terrorist attacks actually INCREASE U.S. involvement in the Middle East, then obviously the original logic is lacking because the means WORK AGAINST the desired \"end\"...\n \n And we can cover a few threads around here that document the fact that this is EXACTLY what is happening. Christianity is currently in statistical decline (percentage of population) because Americans are perceiving these aggressive demands by Christianity as not something they want to be a part of.\n \n So the puritanical approach DRIVES PEOPLE AWAY. emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n On a separate note, I am frequently struck by people who try to argue that gays are trying to \"legislate opinion\". I think it's an amusing inverse to the situation, but fails to recognize that gays getting equal rights DOES NOTHING to change other people's opinions.\n It just doesn't work like that in either way.\n So people should stop pretending it does.\n \n Like I said earlier, I think we have a fair amount of agreement (possibly?).\n But whereas you said \"misguided logic\", I would agree that it is misguided, and disagree that it is in any way \"logic\".\n \n \n \nThe only problem would be how oppressive one would be and how severe would be the penalties for heresy and ungodly practises.\n\n In some ways, I don't think that is even very significant.\n Take teen sex for example.\n \n We do not significantly PUNISH teens who have sex.\n The main driving issue is whether or not a FULL sex ed course will be taught, as opposed to ONLY teaching about \"you shouldn't have sex\".\n Minimally \"oppressive\" I would think.\n \n But the IMPACT is still tilted towards this having a NEGATIVE effect on the desired outcome.\n \n Even the withholding of information like the existence of condoms from sex ed, when we all know they exist, has a negative effect on decreasing teen pregnancy (i.e. it actually increases teen pregnancy).\n \n \n \nIn the middle ages just about all the people of Western Europe were illiterate, something that would be a problem now but was highly desirable then.\n If the only people who could read and write were the clergy then the chances that the Bible could be questioned by laymen were remote. thus heresy was minimalised and the people could recieve their religious instruction from the clergy.\n A rounded education is a poor trade off for a people who are in danger of eternal torment\n\n That is a whole different mine-field. One which should involve discussions on clergy utilizing their efforts for the purpose of power.\n When the clergy \"forgives\" based on people giving money to the church, does that really turn into people getting saved? emoticon_frazzled\n \n You're assuming the clergy taught an effective philosophy in the first place.\n \n \n \nCan I remind you of the fearful results of freedom to choose the ways of the Lord?\n\n Again, can I remind you of the bible's passages?\n Matthew 5:45 He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.\n \n It is a fairy tale that God punishes societies as you describe. A preaching which pushes towards clergy power for clergy benefit.\n \n \n \nHow would the Hebrew God feel about his servant failing his flock by letting them choose between gods way and the way of the flesh.... and eventual damnation?\n\n I'm sorry, but your statements are getting more and more bizarre.\n \"letting them choose\"???\n GOD CREATED that choice in the first place.\n \n The Hebrew God put a tree in with Adam and Eve GIVING THEM the choice between God and problems with \"damnation\".\n And now you're telling me that you think God is going to \"feel\" something because Christians do not achieve something THEY CANNOT ACHIEVE in the first place, by allowing a choice that God himself allowed???\n \n Cause Christians cannot make anybody choose the Hebrew God.\n In fact, in all honesty, they do not even try to make that choice a forced issue in the first place. Most Christians I have seen respect the first amendment giving people the right to choose a non-Christian religion.\n \n \n \nAlso I believe Moses enforced the worship of god on the Israleites when his back was turned and they made a golden image to worship\n\n By KILLING those who worshipped otherwise.\n Is that where you want to go with this?\n \n And furthermore, WHY are you using an outdated OLD TESTAMENT philosophy.\n You'll note that Jesus told his followers to go forth and convert people.\n NOT to make them believe something.\n Jesus EXPLICITLY told his followers what to do if people didn't receive the Christian message. Part of that clearly involved leaving town.\n \n \n \nIt surely is not about bargaining with God.\n Societal improvements may not be an improvement if they defy the word of god.\n\n Are you aware of the New Testament commentary on women?\n They are not to have authority over men.\n They are not to teach men.\n There are a whole lot of biblical restrictions that fly in the face of modern female equality.\n \n In all reality, if you want to look at the MAGNITUDE of biblical violation, 5% of the population being gay is NOTHING compared to 50% of the population (women) having biblical violating equality. emoticon_frazzled",

   "My answers have reflected this post.\n \n \nI agree that no church should force its interpretation of a religion on others.\n \n There is a kind of logic to it however.\n Consider that I am a practising Christian that understands that only the ones that follow the word of Christ will go to heaven and the rest will live in eternal torment. \n You are an unbeliever with the potential to either live forever in paradise or in hell.\n If I force you to practise Christianity with a view to you eventually understanding the word of God I would be reducing your chances of eternal torment. You might not appreciate it at the time but after death you will.\n \n \n \n \n The whole point of following Christ is to live the life that he demands.\n If you are a nigerian who practises voodoo then you must give up voodoo.\n If you are a practising homosexual you must give up practising homosexual sex.\n A voodoo practising Christian is not a Christian. A practising Homosexual Christian is not a Christian. ( FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARGUMENT)\n\n \n \n \n \n \n That is the dilemma of the damnation of the sinner and the obligation of the saviour.\n You question the fairness and the biblical authority to the solutions that I suggest whereas I am not concerned with this ..only the Churches percieved responsibility to Gods flock and how ..by whatever means they could save them from eternal damnation.\n \n \n In the past the church would have had the power of theological knowledge over the rest of the people because most of the population could not read.\n with that and other methods of repression the Church could administer their flock in whatever way they liked..and they did.\n Also the only means of heresy was to invent or study another way of worship. This would need the knowledge to read and write if it was to propagate.\n Now the church could consider whatever it saw fit to make its flock follow Christs teachings because the means justifying the end.\n \n The Inquisition and the brutal forcing of Catholics worship on the South American population by the Spanish is two examples.\n \n \n The saving of the soul was far more important than fairness or Biblical authority.so heretics were burnt and people were slaughtered to make examples..and this was a logical thing to do and indeed the right thing to do in that time with those beliefs..according to the priests.\n \n No dissenters were allowed..\n And to a point it worked.\n \n Even then the Church realised that they had the easiest way to convert the heathens was to allow them a little of their old religion into the new but very little , more in the way of rituals.\n \n This was my point..the Catholic Church did not drive people away because they could not get away and the few that did ..well they were going to hell anyway!\n No Aztec could not quote a line from the Bible back at the missionaries because they didnt know any.\n \n You have raised many points that are worth discussing but they take the debate away from my point in the post above..that it could be considered the Churches duty to force Christianity on others if you believe that if you do not , they will life forever in torment.",

The purge was motivated by the desire on the part of the leadership to remove dissident elements from the Party and what is often considered to have been a desire to consolidate the authority of Joseph Stalin. Additional campaigns of repression were carried out against social groups which were accused of acting against the Soviet state and the politics of the Communist Party.\n \n A number of purges were officially explained as an elimination of the possibilities of sabotage and espionage, in view of an expected war with Germany. Most public attention was focused on the purge of the leadership of the Communist Party itself, as well as of government bureaucrats and leaders of the armed forces, the vast majority being Party members. However, the campaigns affected many other categories of the society: intelligentsia, peasants and especially those branded as \"too rich for a peasant\" (kulaks), and professionals.[3] A series of NKVD (the Soviet secret police) operations affected a number of national minorities, accused of being \"fifth column\" communities.\n \n According to Nikita Khrushchev's 1956 speech, \"On the Personality Cult and its Consequences\", and more recent findings, a great number of accusations, notably those presented at the Moscow show trials, were based on forced confessions, often obtained by torture,[4] and on loose interpretations of Article 58 of the RSFSR Penal Code, which dealt with counter-revolutionary crimes. Due legal process, as defined by Soviet law in force at the time, was often largely replaced with summary proceedings by NKVD troikas.[5]\n \n Hundreds of thousands of victims were falsely accused of various political crimes (espionage, wrecking, sabotage, anti-Soviet agitation, conspiracies to prepare uprisings and coups) and then executed by shooting, or sent to the Gulag labor camps. Many died at the penal labor camps due to starvation, disease, exposure and overwork. Other methods of dispatching victims were used on an experimental basis. For example, one secret policeman gassed people to death in batches in the back of a specially adapted airtight van.[6][7]\n \n \n Cant blame religion at all for this one!\n __________________",
