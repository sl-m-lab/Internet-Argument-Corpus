What \"origins\" are you talking about? There are all kinds of sciences that deal with the origins of things. Cosmology is the science that deals with the origin of the universe. There are planetary physicists who deal with the origin of planetary systems. Abiogenesis studies how life on earth arose. But since all of these are science, they are also naturalistic. Perhaps if you were more specific about what a priori question you mean and how they should be studied by science.",
