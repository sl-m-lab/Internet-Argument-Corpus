   "Terrorists of all kinds who got apprehended and bailed to Iraqi government by American soldiers are living in dependence on al Qaeda now!\n \n As it got out to the light, former representatives of Sunni Army were the executors of the latest acts of terrorism in Iraq (Shiah palmers attack and explosion in Sunni Army base)! Well, in truth Americans supply al Qaeda by new members by arresting bandits who lose most part of their wages and leave army and to join terrorists! I wonder how much trained soldiers of Allah Americans sent to terrorists with their own hands!",
