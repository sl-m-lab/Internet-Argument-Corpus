   "Check this link:\n http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_scriptura\n It should have all that you want to know. \n \n Is the Bible Alone Sufficient for Spiritual Truth?\n http://www.carm.org/catholic/biblesufficient.htm\n\n \n The second web-site does a slight shuffle, but there still is contradiction in it's statement: \" For example, there is no statement in the Bible that says there is a Trinity, or that Jesus has two natures (God and man), or that the Holy Spirit is the third person in the Godhead. Yet, each of the statements is considered true doctrine within Christianity, being derived from biblical references. Therefore, it is not required of Scripture to have a statement to the effect, \"The Bible alone is to be used for all spiritual truth,\" in order for the statement to be true.* So, for the Catholic to require the Protestant to supply chapter and verse to prove Sola Scriptura is valid, is not necessarily consistent with biblical exegetical principles.\"\n \n It is in effect saying that there is no passage to back up a claim for the Trinity but it is 'implied' in the New Testament. This is a bit of slight of hand. An attempt to argue both sides of the case at once.\n \n If it is 'implied' it means it is open for interpretation. The early Church interpreted it in such a manner.\n \n Then it has a go at Catholics who pray to Mary (what about us Orthodox? We never get a mention! What are we - chopped liver?)\n \n Quite clearly the veneration of Mary is just as Biblical, viz passages in Luke \"I will be Blessed through the Ages\" , \"Blessed are you amongst women\"\n \n \n Further, that site says \" If the Bible is not used to verify Sacred Tradition, then Sacred Tradition is functionally independent to the Word of God. If it is independent of Scripture, then it has no right to exist as an authoritative spiritual source since the Bible is what is inspired, not tradition.\"\n \n But, as Tradition existed before the Bible, it then makes more sense to say that ...\"If tradition is not used to verify the Bible, then the Bible is functionally independent to the Word of God. If it is independent of Tradition, then it has no right to exist as an authoritative spiritual source since the Holy Tradition is what is inspired, not the Bible.\"\n \n No where does the Word of God imply a written form. Jesus referred to himself as the Word made flesh. \" My brother and my bethren are thses which Hear the word of God\" (Luke 8:21), again it is not a written, but spoken.\n \n I say this because Tradition IS inspired. If it wasn't how could they have based it to put the Bible together? It is because they sat down and said, \"Okay folks, we've got a few hundred books here, which ones agree with what we've always taught (tradition). We'll keep those and put them in the Bible\".\n \n In other words, Protestants have got things back the front.",

   "If you base your beliefs on the Bible alone, you can end up anywhere...\n \n My own favourite period of history, the British Isles in the 1600s is full of Biblical prophecy groups; Adamites, (Antimonians), Anabaptists, Baptists, Behmenists, Brownists, Diggers, Fifth Monarchists, Grindletonians, Jacobites, Levellers, Muggletonians, Puritans, Quakers, Ranters, Sabbatarians, Seekers, and Socinians.\n \n The Fifth Monarchist believe that the Kingdom of God was at hand; that the King, Charles Stuart was the anti-Christ. They believed it was therefore justifiable to rise up against him.*\n \n \"On January 6, 1661, an event occurred that threatened to overwhelm whatever friendship King Charles harboured toward these sectarian subjects of his. A London congregation of Fifth Monarchists, a Baptist-derived group of millenarians who held that Jesus intended to return physically to sit upon England?s throne, staged an abortive uprising under the slogan, \"King Jesus.\" Although occupying St. Paul?s cathedral for a brief time, they were quickly subdued; fourteen, including their leader, were executed, their heads stuck up on London Bridge as grisly warnings to others with similar ideas\"\n http://www.kimopress.com/Ingle-02.htm\n \n \"The \"Fifth Monarchy\" or the \"Fifth Kingdom\" is a biblical reference. The reference is based of the Old Testament (Daniel 2: 44) of a prophesy in a dream by King Nebuchadnezzar. He envisioned five kingdoms in history, and the last, or Fifth Kingdom would usher in a new kingdom on earth. Millenarianism was a popular message of the Interregnum (1649-1660). \"The godly being in league with God ...\" (1626) wrote Thomas Gataker.\n Works such as Henry Archer's: The Personal Reign of Christ upon Earth (1642) became a popular work during the period on the Millennium. It foretold the conversions of the Jews (1650) and the destruction of the Turks, and foretold the second coming of Christ (1700). The Civil War itself became a vehicle of new religious fervour. The execution of Charles I (1649) became a rallying point as a sign from God ushering in His New Kingdom to many.\"\n http://www.exlibris.org/nonconform/engdis/fifthmonarchists.html\n \n \n *Oddly enough, Charles' father James I was able to argue from the Bible in favour of Monarchy! Thus you can have diametrically opposed beliefs, based on the Bible.\n \"The state of monarchy is the supremest thing on earth. For kings are not only God's lieutenants upon earth, and sit upon God's throne, but even by God himself they are called gods...\"\n King James Stuart in \"A Speech to the Lords and Commons of the Parliament at White-Hall\" (1610) - this is the same King James who gave us the King James Bible.\n See also \"An Homily against Disobedience and Wylful Rebellion\" (1570)",

   "Concerning the teachings of \"Praying to Mary\", it isn't the same as we pray to God, it is different. It is more of asking Mary to pray for us, as one asks eachother to pray for them. Mary's body is in heaven; Mary is more close to Jesus than anyone has ever been (She witnessed his conception, birth, works, trial, death, resurrection, and ascension), so it's only logical to ask Mary, specifically, to pray for us. Further, Paul has assured us that those in heaven are not dead, but alive, thus we can also ask the saints and angels to pray for us. \n \n After reading Epaphras_Faith's site, I am baffled at the bias.

This was an afterthought on an old debate. Others I was debating with will know the reason for it. \n \n You will have plenty of time to know me. I have posted over 300 times since september. I have noticed that you have posted 80 some since January. I wonder why you worry about debating me. I certainly post often enough. Given your rate of posting I would think it would be the other way around. \n \n You will get plenty of opportunity. This board is also a forum to share information. That is its intended purpose, not just to argue but for a chance at exchange of info. Yes, the site is biased, of course it is. So are catholic websites. DUH!!!!!!!!!!!!\n \n I was offering my side. Maximus has posted large chunks from other sites as have many others. I posted a link as I did not want to plagiarize or try to redo an argument that I am not as educated to do. I will and have debated the issues. If you don't like the site say so but do not come after me with the passive agressive bull. Your attempt is to discredit me as a debater. Check out my other posts and get to know me before you do that. You have been posting for a while but not often and I have only recently come across you.",
