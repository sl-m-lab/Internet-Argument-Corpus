Kill!\"\n \n What incredible savagery!\n \n.... the person dishing out the roughest stuff at the moment is Sarah Palin.\n \n \"I was reading my copy of the New York Times the other day,\" she said.\n \n \"Booooo!\" replied the crowd.\n \n \"I knew you guys would react that way, okay,\" she continued. \"So I was reading the New York Times and I was really interested to read about Barack's friends from Chicago.\"\n \n .... \"Now it turns out, one of his earliest supporters is a man named Bill Ayers,\" Palin said.\n \n \"Boooo!\" said the crowd.\n \n \"And, according to the New York Times, he was a domestic terrorist and part of a group that, quote, 'launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and our U.S. Capitol,'\" she continued.\n \n \"Boooo!\" the crowd repeated.\n \n \"Kill him!\" proposed one man in the audience. \n\n http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/10/06/in_fla_palin_goes_for_the_roug.html",
