   "WASHINGTON - With an early fundraising blitz, the online liberal advocacy group MoveOn.org has shown both its potential as a Democratic asset and a Republican target in the 2006 elections. \n \n In less than three days last week, the group's political action committee raised from its members nearly $833,000 for Sen. Robert C. Byrd (news, bio, voting record) (D-W.Va.), who next year could face his first competitive race in decades. \n \n The amount represented more than three-fourths of the total that Byrd collected between Jan. 1 and March 31, and was the most money MoveOn has raised for one candidate at one time, according to the group's officials. \n \n http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=2026&ncid=2026&e=2&u=/latimests/20050406/ts_latimes/goppouncesonbyrdlinktoliberalgroup\n \n call them what you may, but that's down right impressive.",
