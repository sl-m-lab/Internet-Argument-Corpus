   "Fascists according to Estonians were just bandits' gang which was kicked out from Estonia by another bandits' gang - Soviet troops! I guess great battle against fascism as world evil is beyond Estonian brain! Well, if we stick to this primitive logic we can call everybody who fight against terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan bandits or criminals! It's clear that during military operation in Iraq and Afghanistan civilians die and some people in these countries can't be happy with the fact. Similar to Estonians they are fighting \"occupants\" by any possible method! By this way we are getting that al Qaeda and Hezbollah terrorists are one gang of criminals and coalition troops heading by USA and European allies are another such gang!\n Well, Estonians do not share neither European nor common human values. Only their petty interests matter for them and all those who don't agree to it are branded criminals.",

   "...for all those \"Euro newcomers\". And they're trying actively to strike keynote of EU policy. And this keynote reeks a lot with radicalism, xenophobia and racialism. L As if all EU deputies slept deep and then suddenly woke up... 'Oh, you see we have that Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty neo-fascist faction in Parliament and I didn't know... Of course that's disgrace for us all. But who will first vote against it? (not me, not me)' in the same way Europeans react towards desecration of WW II memorials in Estonia. May be it seems to them that Estonia is somewhere in far-far away land. But it's here, just at hand and it is still EU member. They've begun spreading this nationalist virus. And now many follow their example.\n Such anti-Semites as Polish biologist Maciej Giertych has been inspired by Estonian example. He had conscience to present his essay 'Civilizations at war in Europe' in EU Parliament hall. This tract denounces Jewish influence as detrimental to Europe. Moreover pan Giertych refuses right living near Poles to Jews and calls them 'civilization of programmed differentiation from surrounding communities...' And what about thousands years of Jewish history, Jewish culture, the Bible at last I wonder? How could EU Parliament allow to propagandize unconcealed anti-Semitism in its very building? That's scandalous! Wake up or soon some new Hitler would be speaker in our Parliament.",

   "Well, I think it is time we do something to Estonia. As a result of EU's let-alone principle, in this country there took place a rigged parliamentary election - if to choose my words carefully - that enabled neo-fascists and nationalist zealots consolidate their grip of authority. On March 26, the ruling coalition will get formed in the Riigikogu and it is easy to guess what party members it will be consisting of. At last, fascists will be able to gain revenge in an individually taken country, while the consequences promise to be deplorable for the whole European Union. We relied fondly on Estonian social democrats but they turned out to be as fascist-minded as members of ResPublica and the Reform party of Estonia - that is why many members of the Social Democratic party voted in favor of the law enabling removal of the monument to liberators of Europe from the Nazi Germany. Well, it looks like time to apply some measures to Estonia. The harsher the sanctions, the better for Estonia itself and EU as such. Just don't shelve the motion, right?",

Many European Internet friends of mine don't know that there is such totalitarian state like Estonia is member of EU for our government tries to suppress gossip about it.\n And at the same time I was on Tonismagi Hill among memorial defenders in April 26 and brought group of my friends there. Police brutally suppressed the demonstrators. You know after that meeting two strange fellows invited me persistently to cafe. There they've in quite clear and polite terms explained me that if I continue such 'antisocial activity' and publicly express my opinion then I'd be very sorry about it. Also I shouldn't talk much on this topic on phone. 'Think about your future and future of your parents.' - said they to me. Some of my friends had similar conversations.\n Now I'm ashamed but I was so scared by this talk that didn't try to prevent demolition of the memorial. And it is clear our authorities stacked at special services too. And I don't doubt that in case of active resistance there will be much more victims of police arbitrariness.",

Both countries are full of ambitious and claim some territories in European lands. They want the European space to be reshaped. And Tallinn wants money to patch up its economy.

   "Last Thursday and Friday in Tallinn, Estonia, Estonian special police force showed how cruel it can be dispersing a small crowd of Russian Estonians who were protesting against humiliating removal of a WWII memorial to Russian soldiers - defeaters of fascism. In order to 'pacify' some 700 Russian protesters (mainly elderly men and women with their teenage sons and daughters), over 3,500 policemen dressed up fit to kill were gathered at the T&#1093;nism&#1076;gi Square equipped with full body armor, helmets, rubber truncheons, electric shockers, tear gas sprays and handguns loaded with live rounds, not rubber ones as they should be in such cases. It looked like Estonian authorities feared that this small number of defenders of the Soviet monument would no less than overthrow a government or start an 'orange revolution' there. When violent clashes started, it became clear that Estonian policemen were instructed to show no mercy to protesters. They pulled protesters out from the crowd one by one and beat them up by twos and threes with no respect to gender or age of the victim. I saw with my own eyes how one of Estonian police machos stroke down to the ground an elderly woman who was standing nearby shouting 'Shame to Estonia!' and began to kick her with his boots. Damn, it was monstrous!!!! About 100 protesters got beaten up, their faces bleeding, their arms and legs broken. At least five protesters got killed, over 300 were arrested. At last, Estonian government showed us its savage face! In the respect of this event, I wonder why there was not a single European newspaper that gave an unembellished coverage of the inhumane massacre that took place right in the center of Estonian capital? Europeans must be aware that tyranny is rising up in Estonia as well as heroizing fascism. EU must do something to stop it!",

I heard it told that Estonian prime minister Andrus Ansip has embezzled some \u00802.35 mln from the money supply that had been laid out by EU for Estonia for economic advancement of that country as a new EU member-state. In order to conceal his misappropriation, Ansip worked up a disturbance in the center of Tallinn by removing old Soviet war memorial. As I see, the whole scheme worked as Ansip planned it. Russian Estonians were put in a temper by demolishing the monument that honors their grandparents who defeated fascism, and removing the relics of them. After that riots got sparkled and lasted for three days until they were severely suppressed by Estonian special police forces. Yes, it was a real massacre as far as I could estimate. There was only one thing that was miscalculated by Ansip. Yes, there were hundreds of people taken into custody, hundreds were wounded by the fierce police of Estonia, and even a few people were killed. BUT! general property damage cannot amount to \u00802.35 mln as Andrus Ansip asserts. A crowd of 600-700 people just cannot cause such great financial harm even though there were three days of riots! My conclusion is that Ansip plays the fool with us! He thinks he can embezzle money we give to Estonia and no one would take notice of it! Answer's a lemon! We'll show Ansip up in his true colors!",

For sure Ansip knew that such behavior would rouse indignation in Russia and among Estonian national minorities. And isn't it suspicious that very US lackey Estonia that can't do anything without American instructions boosted that nasty fuss? It was quite clear whose side EU would take.\n There are already notes in such European editions as The European Voice and Daily Telegraph that EU 'has become anxious about exacerbation of relations with Russia and doesn't leave out possibility of prohibition of its joining WTrO (World Trade Organization) and of postponing summit Russia-EU.\n This means just that US don't need strong Russia and Europe and more less they need in co-operating Russia and Europe. So they press towards to introduce split between those two political forces. Besides they by such means they wanted to discredit both Russia and Germany which is in the chair of EU now.
