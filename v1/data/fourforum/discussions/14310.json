   "...... THEN THEY CAME for the Jews,\n and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew.\n \n THEN THEY CAME for our Constitution\n and by that time no one was left to speak up.\"\n \n   Should right to silence need claiming? \n Should suspected criminals have to speak up to claim their \"right to remain silent?\" The U.S. Supreme Court thinks so.\n \n A 5-4 majority of conservative justices ruled this week in the case of a Michigan murder suspect who actually was silent for most of a three-hour police interrogation. Because he never explicitly told investigators he was invoking his Constitutional right against self-incrimination, the court ruled, police were free to interrogate him until he confessed.\n \n Justice Sonia Sotomayor, leading the court's liberal dissenters, said the ruling \"bodes poorly for the fundamental principles\" protected by a suspect's so-called \"Miranda\" rights, which the Court laid out in a famous 1966 decision. Is she right? Or should police be given the widest possible authority to pump suspects for information? \n \n Shouldn't need to jump through hoops for rights\n \n The Supreme Court's ruling boils down to this: Police get to assume you don't want your Constitutional rights. The Miranda warning &#8212; the one you've heard cops say on TV a million times &#8212; is now essentially meaningless.\n \n \"Today's decision turns Miranda upside down,\" Justice Sotomayor wrote in her dissent. \"Suspects will be legally presumed to have waived their rights even if they have given no clear expression of their intent to do so.\"\n \n Imagine them treating other parts of our Constitution this way! \n \n Apparently, in America, we have to do this now. \n \n A public declaration! I would like to make it clear to everyone right now! I want, no in fact it is much worse than that, I DEMAND all of my Inalienable, and therefore recognized by our Constitution as protected, Rights! \n \n They are NOT privileges. Something one has to ask for! The Constitution was written to restrain government. All of Government. That means you work for us. It is NOT the other way around!\n \n It is all of our Constitution. Police and government too. So what will you do? Waite till the come for your family? Waite till the come for you?",
