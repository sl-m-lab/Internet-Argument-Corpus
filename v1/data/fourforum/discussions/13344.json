   "I was reading a review of a book about justice and in part it says:\n \n Mr Sandel brings abstruse-sounding ethical puzzles down to earth with vivid examples taken from the news: price gouging in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, affirmative-action programmes at American universities, large bank bonuses paid with public money. Are such practices unjust? If so, why? What if anything is morally wrong with, say, organ farming or surrogate pregnancy for money? \n \n Mr Sandel illustrates the old classroom chestnut-is it ever right to kill one innocent person to save the lives of several others?-with a horrifying dilemma from Afghanistan in 2005. A four-man American unit on reconnaissance behind lines stumbled on a shepherd likely, if let go, to betray them to the Taliban. They could not hold him prisoner. Nor, on moral grounds, would the serviceman in charge kill him. Released, the shepherd alerted the Taliban, who surrounded the unit. Three were killed along with 16 Americans in a rescue helicopter. The soldier in command, who lived, called his decision \"stupid, lamebrained and southern-fried\". Which was right, his earlier refusal or his later regret? \n \n In each case, Mr Sandel gently prods readers to check their gut reactions of right and wrong against three philosophical views. To utilitarians such as Jeremy Bentham and J.S. Mill, the right action is roughly speaking whatever most promotes human well-being. Kantians stress individual rights and not using others as means to your ends. Aristotelians emphasise virtues and intrinsic values that make for worthwhile lives.\n \n Mr Sandel then suggests objections and counter-objections to each of those learned answers. He gives each its due, but nudges readers towards the Aristotelian approach by being harder on the other two. For classroom purposes, he presents the three approaches as rivals, though how far they do preclude each other is debatable. This is ethics with trainer wheels, and up to a point it works well. \n \n First principles of justice: Rights and wrongs | The Economist",
