   "Minorities are Majority in More Areas\n \n From sprawling urban areas to rural counties, racial and ethnic minorities outnumber whites in more parts of the country, according to 2003 Census estimates out today.\n \n Denver and Orange County, Calif., as well as remote Yoakum County, Texas, and Barbour County, Ala., are among 26 counties where whites who are not Hispanic have lost their majority status since 2000. That's now the case in 280 of the nation's 3,141 counties, further evidence that diversity has spread.\n \n http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=676&ncid=676&e=2&u=/usatoday/20040930/ts_usatoday/minoritiesmajorityinmoreareas\n \n \n Anchor Babies: The Children of Illegal Aliens\n \n Each year, thousands of women enter the United States illegally to give birth, knowing that their child will thus have U.S. citizenship. Their children immediately qualify for a slew of federal, state, and local benefit programs. In addition, when the children turn 21, they can sponsor the immigration of other relatives, becoming \"anchor babies\" for an entire clan.\n \n http://www.fairus.org/ImmigrationIssueCenters/ImmigrationIssueCenters.cfm?ID=1190&c=13\n \n \n Shifting Racial Spectrum\n \n For the first time in Denver's history, Anglos are no longer the majority of the city's population, new census figures indicate.\n \n Denver's Anglo population dropped by 0.8 percentage points between 2002 and 2003 to 49.4 percent of the 558,379 residents, according to figures released Wednesday by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n \n http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/census/article/0%2C1299%2CDRMN_429_3219406%2C00.html\n \n \n Related Threads:\n \n Top 10 Reasons to Close America's Border\n \n 16 Facts that White Kids Won't Learn in School\n \n Immigrants Bring Tuberculosis\n \n \n \n .",

   "I am not worried about Americans losing jobs to illegal aliens. I am concerned about social services being handed out to people that come here illegally. I saw a show a couple years ago about mothers that come across the border, have a baby, sign up for welfare and go back to Mexico. Later they cross the border every month to get their check from a PO box, cash it and then go back to Mexico.\n \n Here is Southern CA many Emergency Rooms are closing down. Many of the closings have been attributed to uninsured illegal aliens. The hospitals claim they can not continue the service.\n \n Personally, if it would shut down every social service, I would favor opening the borders.",

One in every four Americans receives a government check in some form and that would mean \n eliminating the inefficient civil servants, mostly unionized, who administer those monolithic bureaucracies. When combined, the workers and clientle are a huge number few politicians would want to take on in a war.",
