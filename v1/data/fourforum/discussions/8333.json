   "Blast that Benedict XVI! He has placed me in a quandary again!\n \n Now, I love a certain elegance of language, let's say the use of language with that soft patina of age and old fashionedness that makes it beautiful in my eyes. Who gives a damn if the modern illiterate can't understand it. I prefer King James to revised or whatever those dadblasted newfangled versions of the Bible are colled.\n \n And I thrill to the rewording of the mass to read, \"Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof,\" as opposed to \"Lord, I am not worthy to receive you,\" especially when I learn that in the historical context of the wording \"these words hark back not only to the Latin Mass but also to the words of a Roman centurion preserved for us in the Gospels.\"\n \n But. . . I present to you, esteemed readers, the heart of the debate:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/16/us/16mass.html\n \n June 16, 2006\n A Changing Mass for U.S. Catholics \n By LAURIE GOODSTEIN and CINDY CHANG\n Roman Catholic bishops in the United States voted yesterday to change the wording of many of the prayers and blessings that Catholics have recited at daily Mass for more than 35 years, yielding to Vatican pressure for an English translation that is closer to the original Latin. \n \n The bishops, meeting in Los Angeles, voted 173 to 29 to accept many of the changes to the Mass, a pivotal point in a 10-year struggle that many English-speaking Catholics had dubbed \"the liturgy wars.\"\n \n But the bishops made substantial changes to the text that the Vatican wanted, and those changes could still be rejected by Vatican officials. \n \n Some of the changes they did adopt are minor, but in other cases Catholics will have to learn longer and more awkward versions of familiar prayers. For example, instead of saying, \"Lord, I am not worthy to receive you,\" in the prayer before Communion, they will say, \"Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof.\"\n \n The reason for the change is a Vatican directive issued in 2001 under Pope John Paul II that demanded closer adherence to the Latin text. But some bishops in the English-speaking world were indignant at what they saw as a Vatican move to curtail the autonomy of each nation's bishops to translate liturgical texts according to local tastes and needs. \n \n The new translation is likely to please those traditionalists who longed for an English version more faithful to the Latin in use before the Second Vatican Council in the 1960's. But it may upset Catholics who have committed the current prayer book to heart and to memory and who take comfort in its more conversational cadences. \n \n \"This translation will affect the worship life of every Catholic in the United States and beyond,\" said Bishop Donald W. Trautman of Erie, Pa., chairman of the bishops Committee on the Liturgy and a vocal critic of the Vatican's translation who insisted on amending it. \n \n The translation must go to the Vatican and Pope Benedict XVI for final approval. It could still take as much as two years until the new text is published and put into use in American churches, Bishop Trautman said in an interview. \n \n Some Catholics welcomed the changes. Leon Suprenant, president of Catholics United for the Faith, a conservative group in Steubenville, Ohio, said, \"When the Mass was first celebrated in English shortly after Vatican II, some of the translations took liberties with the original, and we lost some of the beauty and dignity of the original.\"\n \n Mr. Suprenant said, \"Certainly we're in favor of the new translation, which is a more faithful literal translation of the Latin, and we are a Latin rite church.\"\n \n The bishops rejected about 60 of the changes proposed by the International Committee on English in the Liturgy, the panel of bishops from 11 English-speaking countries that prepared the translation. For instance, the committee wanted to change the phrase in the Nicene Creed \"one in being with the Father\" to \"consubstantial with the Father.\" \n \n But the bishops kept the current version, noting, \" 'Consubstantial' is a theological expression requiring explanation for many.\"\n \n The Rev. Lawrence J. Madden, director of the Georgetown Center for Liturgy in Washington, said: \"In hewing to the Latin more closely, it's making some of the English awkward. It isn't the English we speak. It's becoming more sacred English, rather than vernacular English.\" \n \n Father Madden said, \"That's one of the reasons why a large number of the bishops up to this point have been opposed to the translation, because they're afraid this is going to distance the liturgy from the people.\" \n \n Other changes were easier for the bishops to accept. The familiar exchange of greetings between the priest and congregation: \"The Lord be with you/And also with you,\" will be replaced by \"The Lord be with you/And with your spirit.\" This version is already used in Spanish-language Masses, and many others. \n \n The changes apply only to the \"Order of Mass,\" which includes the prayers and blessings recited at every service - not the scripture readings and prayers that are recited only during feast days and holidays. \n \n American bishops went into the meeting in Los Angeles under pressure to put an end to the controversy. Bishops in Australia, Scotland, England and Wales had already voted to accept the Vatican-backed translation. \n \n And just last month, Cardinal Francis Arinze, head of the Vatican's Congregation for Divine Worship, sent a letter to the president of the U.S. bishops' conference, Bishop William S. Skylstad of Spokane, Wash., saying the American church ultimately must accept the changes. \n \n \"It is not acceptable to maintain that people have become accustomed to a certain translation for the past 30 or 40 years, and therefore that it is pastorally advisable to make no changes,\" Cardinal Arinze wrote.\n \n The Vatican directive in 2001, known in Latin as Liturgiam authenticam, was a turning point in the process. It said that in any translation, \"great caution is to be taken to avoid a wording or style that the Catholic faithful would confuse with the manner of speech of non-Catholic ecclesial communities or other religions.\"\n \n The burden of introducing the new translation to parishioners will fall on the priests, said the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, a former editor of the Jesuit magazine America, who has followed the debate.\n \n \"The priests are going to be the ones on the firing line who will have to explain this, and most of them don't see any advantage in this new translation,\" Father Reese said. \"They're going to have to defend something they don't even like.\"\n \n The Rev. Robert J. Silva, president of the National Federation of Priests Councils, said of the priests he represents: \"We're not real anxious to have changes. There's real concern because a lot of us are saying, Is this really a theological and Biblical issue? Is it really to upgrade the language, or is this something that's a little more ideological?\"\n \n Father Silva said, \"It's probably a little of both.\"\n \n Laurie Goodstein reported from New York for this article, and Cindy Chang from Los Angeles.\n \n Commentary to follow.",

   "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/18/opinion/l18mass.html\n \n June 18, 2006\n New Wording for Catholic Mass (4 Letters) \n To the Editor: \n \n Re \"A Changing Mass for U.S. Catholics\" (news article, June 16): \n \n Why is it necessary to change the spoken English of the Mass just to satisfy some Latin purists in the Vatican? \n \n Latin has been a dead language for centuries. It is more direct and unequivocal at Communion time to say \"Lord, I am not worthy to receive you\" (current wording) than \"Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof\" (new wording). \n \n Under what roof, where? Are we inviting someone to our house, or are we receiving Communion?\n \n Donald Andries -- Deerfield, Ill., June 16, 2006\n \n To the Editor:\n \n As a lay Catholic, I support the return to the words \"Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof\" to be said before receiving the Eucharist. These words hark back not only to the Latin Mass but also to the words of a Roman centurion preserved for us in the Gospels. \n \n It is salutary for us Catholics to recall the remarkable faith and disposition of that centurion when receiving the Body and Blood of Christ. \n \n Richard H. Escobales Jr. -- Buffalo, June 16, 2006\n \n To the Editor:\n \n Was there one parish or diocesan council in the United States that was requesting consideration of a move to these more stilted and antiquated forms of expression at Mass? \n \n Did the bishops have nothing better to talk about with the billions for the war in Iraq heaped on the heads of our children? \n \n Could they have addressed the growing gap in health coverage and the role of the government in all issues of public financing? \n \n Please, give us some leadership on these issues in light of the Gospel. Liturgy, for all its problems, is easier to address than vexing human problems, wherein the work of God resides. \n \n David E. Pasinski\n Syracuse, June 16, 2006\n \n To the Editor:\n \n New translations of Catholic Mass prayers have been approved by our bishops under Vatican pressure. \n \n Many national conferences of bishops, especially noteworthy in the 1998 Synod for Asia, have long sought greater autonomy for local churches. \n \n The Japanese bishops decried the demands by Rome that their liturgical books be translated by students in Rome rather than under the bishops themselves in Japan. \n \n The Vatican did not yield then, or today in the matter of English translations. It maintains its control, even in such ancillary matters.\n \n That priests and lay people, and now the bishops themselves, have no real voice in local matters can only increase the polarization within our church and deter the return of the many who have already been alienated. \n \n (Msgr.) Harry J. Byrne -- Bronx, June 16, 2006",
