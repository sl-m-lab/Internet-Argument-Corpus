   "By 365gay Newswire\n 11.16.2009 12:29pm EST\n \n Towleroad reported today that a gay Puerto Rican teen was found brutally murdered on the island.\n \n Nineteen-year-old, Jorge Steven Lopez Mercado's body was found burned, decapitated and dismembered on Nov. 14 in Cayey, a city only a few miles away from his hometown in Caguas.\n \n According to an iReport by Christopher Pagan, \"He was a very well known person in the gay community of Puerto Rico, and very loved.\"\n \n Pagan said, \"Never in the history of Puerto Rico has a murder been classified as a hate crime. Even though we have to follow federal mandates and laws, many of the laws in which are passed in the USA such as Obama's new bill, do not always directly get practiced in Puerto Rico.\"\n \n Pagan also noted the public remarks from a police investigator for the case that 'people who lead this type of lifestyle need to be aware that this will happen'.\n \n Towleroad translated gay activist Pedro Julio Serrano's response:\n \n \"It is inconceivable that the investigating officer suggests that the victim deserved his fate, like a woman deserves rape for wearing a short skirt. We demand condemnation of this investigator and demand that Superintendent Figueroa Sancha replace him with someone capable of investigating this case without prejudice.\"\n \n According to Pagan, the story has only made local headlines and deserves international coverage.",

Other reports from around the web say the suspect may have offered the victim money for sex.\n \n Says the Associated Press in the first mainstream media coverage we've seen:\n \n Police say they have arrested a suspect in the slaying of a teenager whose decapitated remains were found along a road in southern Puerto Rico.\n \n Police commandant Eliezer Colon says the man was detained at his home early Tuesday morning. The suspect has not been identified because he has not been formally charged.\n \n The burned and dismembered body of 19-year-old Jorge Steven Lopez was discovered Friday in a wooded area of the town of Cayey. Authorities are looking into whether he may have been targeted because he was gay.\n \n Activist Pedro Julio Serrano called on authorities to treat the case as a hate crime if the investigation shows Lopez was killed because of his sexual orientation.\n \n There will be a vigil at 8 p.m. Sunday in New York City. Americablog is calling on people to email Attorney General Eric Holder to ensure the murder is prosecuted as a hate crime.",

   "Another Update: \n By Jennifer Vanasco, editor in chief, 365gay.com\n 11.17.2009 3:20pm EST\n \n UPDATE 5:30 pm:\n \n The Puerto Rican newspaper El Nuevodia reports that the suspect in the killing of Jorge Steven Lopez Mercado is Juan antonio Martinez Matos, 26 years old and father of four. (This is a translation from a colleague; the link is Arrestan sospechoso de asesinato de homosexual - El Nuevo Da and we'd appreciate corrections!)\n Send / Share\n Add Comment\n Martinez Matos was \"looking for women\" in a red light district last Friday. He had already been turned down several times, but Lopez Mercado, wearing a blue dress and boots, agreed to get in his car.\n \n District Attorney Jose J. Bermudez says that in his confession, Martinez Matos said that he thought Lopez Mercado was a woman. The victim asked him for money and when he refused, Lopez Mercado pulled out a knife. When Martinez Matos realized that the teenager was actually male, he had a flashback to when he was raped in prison while he was serving a sentence for domestic violence. He then attacked Lopez Mercado, separating his arms from his torso.\n \n Police found a wig, a knife, a burned mattress, a burned PVC pipe and blood on the wall where the murder took place.\n \n The forensic evidence is being investigated by the FBI. Though they have not specified charges yet, the DA says that he is sure this qualifies as a hate crime.\n \n Activists are calling for justice and for the media to focus on the suspect's acts instead of the behavior of the victim.\n \n The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force released a statement saying: \n \n \"We urge local law enforcement authorities to continue their expedient work on this case. Fortunately, Puerto Rico has a local hate crimes statute, but it is imperative that federal authorities continue to monitor this ongoing investigation and step in if necessary or assist if asked, as allowed by the new federal hate crimes law.\"\n \n Pedro Julio Serrano, Task Force Communications Manager and founder of Puerto Rico Para Todas said in a statement:\n \n \"This is a terrible, terrible crime. While we are pleased that law enforcement has acted promptly in making an arrest, it is vital that the hate crimes angle be investigated. This horrendous killing of a young gay man shows no compassion or respect for the dignity of a human life. As someone who grew up in Puerto Rico and has been very active in its lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, this is a heart-wrenching moment. Our hearts and sympathies go out to all of Jorge Steven L\u00f3pez's loved ones at this difficult time. Justice must prevail.\"\n \n *************************\n \n 365gay has new information on the murder investigation surrounding the decapitation and dismemberment of Puerto Rican teen Jorge Steven Lopez Mercado.\n \n Juan Costa Rivera, a 365gay reader who knows Lopez Mercado's friends, says that the local PR press is reporting that the suspect's house was radied by police, where they found a burned mattress and pvc pope, a wig, two knives and a \"big blood stain on a wall.\" The suspect confessed to police, saying he was looking for prostitutes in a red light district in Caguas. Basically, Rivera says:\n \n \"After being rejected by a few women, he saw Jorge dressed as a woman and asked him to go with him to the house. Apparently on the house, the suspect found out that Lopez was a man, after Lopez made sexual advantages, and as a result of the rage, he did what he did.\"\n \n Rivera says the police told media outlets that the suspect will likely use a \"homosexual panic\" defense, arguing for a plea of temporary insanity.",

You DO recognize some legal maneuver attempts.\n What you're trying to do now is \"blame the victim\".\n Like as you attempt, it's a common ploy in attempting to blame the rape victim when a rapist decides that \"no\" isn't an answer he is going to accept.\n Yet again you side with the criminals. Consistently fascinating!\n \n But what you fail to recognize is that regardless of \"dressing as a woman\" and \"trying to sleep with a straight man\" in no way justifies murder.\n In fact, legally the logical reaction would be to simply reject the advance.\n \n Now I am not defending such deceit in an attempt to get laid. I think the actions of this victim are questionable at best, but not unprecedented as in finding a receptive audience from some.\n You would think the adam's apple would give it away... emoticon_rolleyes\n Or maybe it did, and that's the reason why this murdererous ex-felon picked up the gay man in the first place...\n \n But I can't help but think that if we as a people adopt a policy whereby deceit utilized in an effort to get laid is something that has \"kill him\" as a valid response, then there are going to be an AWFUL LOT of straight guys out there who would be in danger as well.\n \n \n \nYou can debate the fact that the ex-con could be lying, but how can anyone debate the fact the the kid was out there in a dress trying to sleep with a straight man.\n\n Perhaps you can explain to me why I would need to debate that in the first place?\n Regardless, there are some guys who are into that sort of thing.\n Perhaps if he had found one of the more accepting \"straight\" guys, this wouldn't have happened.\n \n \n \nInstead of watching himself he got himself into trouble, hence my earlier statement, he was looking for trouble and found it. PERIOD!!emoticon_rolleyes\n\n Yes.\n You consistently side with the murderer, which I find truly fascinating.\n \n Do you also side with the rapists and criticize the woman for not putting out after he paid for dinner and drinks?\n Or is it just the gays who deserve to be killed when an attempt at a sexual liaison results in murder?",

You can name a long list?! Well name them for me big boy, I challenge you. And nope, I cannot name any straight men. WHY?! Let just say because it was once again Sarcasm that flew over your head.

You're sitting here knowing good and well that this is not the reason that you made that little statement. You kniw that you were being sarcastic with Article, but because you were called out for it, you dug this tacky explination out of your arse. We're not buying it.\n \n \n \n \nI would ask what the topical point of that comment would be, but I'm pretty there is none.\n It's just an attempt at personal invective to side-step the fact that despite the incapability of multiple posters to recognize the obvious, the District Attorney is proceeding to treat this crime as an obvious hate crime...\n\n \n Whoa! I feel like I just stepped into an episode of Law and order. At first people thought that he wasn't taking it seriously, and now you see where he is making sure it is under the label of,\"Hate crime.\" Who cares?! So your point is?! Why would I care whether it gets labeled a hate crime?! Why would I try to side step something that really makes no never mind to me?! I'm arguing the fact that he went out looking for trouble, and found it. In my opinion, it is not a hate crime, but if they want to label it as such, then so be it. But I think it's some sicko that took self-defense way too seriously, and killed the cross dressing gay kid. But the only one who seems to be side stepping anything here is you. You fail to look at the fact that if he was not out there doing what he should not have been doing, this would not have happened to him. You fail to look at the kids actions that lead to his death.\n \n \n \n \nWell, that opinion is duly noted...\n I mean, I find it fascinating that you would so quickly attempt to lump in my credibility with a murderering ex-felon who has an obvious reason to lie about the motive for his crime...\n But hey! We all got our standards.\n\n \n What can I say I'm a fascinating person. Yup, we do all have our standards, and I believe that I brought yours to the fore when I lumped you with the ex-con.\n \n \nAnd evidently you are blindly trusting of people who kill gays in a most extreme manner, claim self-defense, but then fail to report it as such when the opportunity to come forward on your own presents itself.\n\n \n I do?! Well that's funny how you can make such a bold statement as to tell me that I blidly trust people who kill gay people. How is saying that the kid was looking for trouble blind trust in the ex-con?! And since he said that the kid had a knife, why is it that the police found the knife on the killer?! I mean a quick fingerprint test would show that it was the young gay kids knife. So that is facts. And that fact that the kids was in a dress in the middle of the night trying to sleep with a straight man is also a fact. So I wouldn't call that blind trust. But I could just as easily say that you trust, cross-dressing muggers who lie to try and sleep with straight men, blindly.\n \n \nAnd I don't know if you can recognize it or not, but these comments are some of the things that will be brought up in a trial. Possibly a jury trial.\n I would be fascinated to see you try to defend your blind trust in the statements of a murderous ex-felon to eleven other people face-to-face.\n Now THAT would be entertainment! emoticon_xgood\n\n \n Well I guess you would have to turn on the t.v for your entertainment, because I didn't recieve an invitation to the trial. Sorry to burst your bubble. Maybe you can try to entertain yourself for a while, maybe with the lights, turned off, singing to your favorite doll, the rest is up to your own creative imagination.emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \n \nAhhh.\n See! You DO recognize some legal maneuver attempts.\n What you're trying to do now is \"blame the victim\".\n Like as you attempt, it's a common ploy in attempting to blame the rape victim when a rapist decides that \"no\" isn't an answer he is going to accept.\n Yet again you side with the criminals. Consistently fascinating!\n\n \n I fascinated you again huh?! Your going to have to start paying me for the viewing pleasure. I'm not blaming the victim, I'm putting responsibility where it belongs. From what I see both parties were at fault and palyed a part in what happened. Not all of the blame goes to the killer, the victim/first agressor played a major part in what happened to him. Have you ever heard of cause and effect?! Without a cause, there would be no effect. How do you like being spoon fed the basics?!\n \n As far as rape victims are concerned it really does depend on the situation, and the circumstances that surround the case. Not one case is the same, so I would not be able to lump a rape victim with this situation, without generalizing all rape cases. \n \n \nBut what you fail to recognize is that regardless of \"dressing as a woman\" and \"trying to sleep with a straight man\" in no way justifies murder.\n In fact, legally the logical reaction would be to simply reject the advance.\n\n \n Did I say that it justifies murder?! No I did not. I simply stated that the boy had a lot to do with what happened to him. And if you were reading the article, the killer said that the boy's actions reminded him of an experience when he was raped in prison. You spoke of the logical response is to reject the advance. I'm surprised that you act as if you are so smart but then make silly statements such as this one. Obvioulsy a person capable of decapitating a human, and burning him, is in not position to think logically. So maybe the logical response would have been to say no, but we are not talking about a logical person. We are talking about a sick individual. So here is my thoughts, logic would have dictated that you don't go out at night dressed as a woman, and try to rob, and sleep with a straight man.\n \n \n \nNow I am not defending such deceit in an attempt to get laid. I think the actions of this victim are questionable at best, but not unprecedented as in finding a receptive audience from some.\n You would think the adam's apple would give it away... emoticon_rolleyes\n Or maybe it did, and that's the reason why this murdererous ex-felon picked up the gay man in the first place...\n\n \n I highly doubt it, if he picked him up after seeing the adams apple, he would not have been surprised to find out he was a man. Not all men have adams apples that are pronunced.\n \n \n \nBut I can't help but think that if we as a people adopt a policy whereby deceit utilized in an effort to get laid is something that has \"kill him\" as a valid response, then there are going to be an AWFUL LOT of straight guys out there who would be in danger as well.\n\n \n I'm not aware of anyone here trying to make such an insane statement as the one you assume we are making. No one here is saying that he should have been killed because of his deceit; we are just saying that he is not completely innocent. But because we're not ignoring his part in this and pitting him because he was gay, you&#8217;re having a queen moment. And exaggerating what we are trying to say, by claiming that we condone the killing of that young gay boy. This is not a fact.\n \n \n \nPerhaps you can explain to me why I would need to debate that in the first place?\n Regardless, there are some guys who are into that sort of thing.\n Perhaps if he had found one of the more accepting \"straight\" guys, this wouldn't have happened.\n\n \n Because you seem to try to ignore that fact that this kid had anything to do with what happened to him. You argued the fact that the ex-con could have lied, which he mmight have, but you cannot aruge the fact that the kid was out there looking for trouble. Or else he would not have gotten into what he did. That I why I said you cannot debate that fact. \n \n And let me ask this question, why would there have to be a more accepting straight guy?! If they are straight why would they have to tollerate a gay trying to put the moves on them?! Also, yes some people are into that sort of thing, that is why I said in my earlier post that he should have stated he was a male, in case people are into that, instead of trying to bed down a straight man.\n \n \n \n \nYes.\n You consistently side with the murderer, which I find truly fascinating.\n \n Do you also side with the rapists and criticize the woman for not putting out after he paid for dinner and drinks?\n Or is it just the gays who deserve to be killed when an attempt at a sexual liaison results in murder?\n\n \n I constantly side with the murderer?! You need some more articulating skills, you read, but you don't comprehend. I feel sorry for you. These last two questions aren't worth me dignifying them with answers. If you want these answered, then you waste your own time contemplating them.emoticon_rolleyes",

   "TL DR;\n I think it's right to not immediantly assume a hate crime, although I love my gay friends no differently, less or more than my straight friends, and have always accepted and approved of them.\n Honestly, I took a Sexuality/Gender course, and did my final research paper on hate crimes to gays still being prevelant in today's culture. What I found was quite surprising-- the vast majority of those gay-hate crimes also had drugs involved, big time, and money. And honestly, it's not too huge of an assumption to make that if society XXXXs you over (IE growing up gay) you may be more inclined to getting high.\n In the end, although I hated the people who did the crimes- because most of them were homophobic,, I honestly believe that they didn't kill the guy on the sole purpose of him being gay- he killed the guy for some serious drug-related reasons (which, is honestly only serious to those in the business, as the TV show \"weeds\" puts into perspective, what do you do if that QP is your mortage? ) Obviously he's not out to spout that out in court. \n However I do believe that when it came down to it, a homophob on an angry rage will hit a gay/lesbian harder than someone who was accepting of their sexuality. \n Reason for the extensive brutality- probably hate crime\n Reason for the original crime- drugs.\n \n The answer- don't do drugs..(or don't lie to a generation about just one of them)",

A legal concept intended specifically for these situations, it evaluates whether the use of self defense was suitable to the threat.\n \n Because, y'know, it could be either way?
