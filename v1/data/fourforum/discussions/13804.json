   "If you cannot work it out, there seems little point in attempting an explanation in terms you could understand.\n\n \n I can't work it out because the concept defies physics and reality. Anyone with even a bit of common sense would realize that on their own.\n \n The database is nothing but thousands of pictures of recovered bullets found at crime scenes. The concept of a ballistics database is that every barrel is unique and no two will leave the same marks on a fired bullet. But this notion is dashed to pieces by a little thing we call reality. The wear and tear put on a barrel from firing -not to mention the scratching to the bore done by routine cleaning- will significantly change the ballistic profile and eventually the same barrel won't leave the same marks.\n \n And then there's the fact that the bullets, depending on what their structure is, will deform, break up, or completely fragment upon contact with a hard target, making it impossible to get a good match.\n \n Then we come to the fact that a ballistics database is useless if you have nothing to trace. Right now all the police can do is try and match bullets against other bullets in an attempt to determine which gun was used. But this is useless when gun owners weren't required to submit fired rounds for the police database in the first place. This is even more useless when the criminals won't register their guns, and are unlikely to leave them behind at the crime scene for the police to find.\n \n There's also the fact that shotgun barrels will leave no trace marks behind. Birdshot, buckshot, slugs, etc. they're all fired from smooth bore barrels. You can't perform any sort of comparison with smooth bores, even if you were firing solid slugs. Even if you tried you'd get nothing, because the rounds bounce around inside the barrel and get all banged up and deformed.\n \n And then there's the simple fact that no matter how hard you try, having the police stare at pictures of bullets have no crime fighting potential that will help arrest criminals and break up crime rings.\n \n Now, thimble head, care to try and debunk the facts?",
