As most of the founding fathers were dietists with a few agnostics, I can't even imagine agreement among them to combine government with mythical belief systems.\n\n Yes, but I think that the specific wording of the establishment clause leaves some room for interpretation, and under the pre-civil war (pre 14th ammendment) constitution there was some room for states to \"establish\" or \"regulate\" religion since Congress would not be involved. But the way it's interpreted now, the 14th ammendment means, in effect, that the states also cannot establish religion.\n \n If there was originally meant to be a true seperation of church and state, then the establishment clause would have read more like the other ammendments in the bill of rights.

As I said, the enforcement of the bill of rights must be tempered with common sense. According to the first amendment people are allowed to say, \"write this law based on my religion.\" And the government is then required to say no, also due to the first amendment.\n \n \n\n What about selling alcohol on Sunday, or anti-prostitution laws?\n \n\n What about them? You were saying that laws are based on morals, and are therefore religious and not secular. I gave a counter example to show that your claim was incorrect. The fact that some laws, like no booze on sunday, do have a religious basis just shows that the system is imperfect and things slip through, not that laws aren't or shouldn't be secular.\n \n \n\n But we do this all the time.

However, I don't belive, as you seem to imply, that religion provides that morallity. Rather I think that religions have tapped into and codified that morality. The principle came first, and religions adopted it. And what is this basic moral principle? Simply put, things that hurt people are bad and things that help people are good. Vastly oversimplified of course, and with lots of room for discussion, but I believe that that is the esssence of any succesful moral system, including the religious ones. So to use your first example, why does the medical code of ethics strictly regulate human experimentation? Not because God told them to do it that way, but because they want to insure as much as possible that they do more good than harm. The risk of harm to the individuals being experimented on must be outweighed by the good the experiments are expected to do.",

The Kansas Board of Education voting, today, to diminish the role of evolution in the state's science curriculum. The ballot in preliminary, the board expected to make its final decision in the next couple of months. This is round two for the state of Kansas and about round 102 for the country.\n \n But unlike prior battles, strict biblical creationism barely gets a mention. Instead, even though critics call it a way of dressing God up in a lab coat, opponents of evolution say they're fighting science with science. Here's CNN's Ed Lavendera.\n \n ED LAVENDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The battle over how to teach science is erupting in Kansas.\n \n UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Leave the room, sir.\n \n UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not going to leave the room.\n \n LAVENDERA: It's the latest fight to bring the theory of intelligent design to a classroom near you. The Kansas State Board of Education is considering new science curriculum standards that offer a more critical view of evolution. Supporters don't understand why many scientists aren't open to this debate.\n \n JOHN CALVERT, INTELLIGENT DESIGN SUPPORTER: They also are favoring a set of standards that do not allow or comprehend criticisms of evolution. LAVENDERA: Many teachers are angry to see what they call bad science make it into the classroom.\n \n STEVEN CASE, INTELLIGENT DESIGN OPPONENT: Those are inappropriate changes. Some for educational reasons, some for scientific reasons.\n \n LAVENDERA: Intelligent design, or I.D., as it's often called, is the idea that the universe is so complicated that some things cannot be explained by science alone, that there must be some intelligent source behind the world's creation.\n \n Intelligent design theory does not say God is responsible, that's where it differs from creationism. But skeptics say intelligent design simply disguises religion in a shroud of science. Critics often call it science fiction.\n \n STEPHEN MEYER, DISCOVERY INSTITUTE: If we put intelligent design into our biology textbooks, based on the misrepresentation of real scientific fact and the conjecture that its proponents rely on, then we may as well add the study of flying saucers and aliens from outer space to our biology and physics books.\n \n LAVENDERA: A recent Harris Interactive poll found 64 percent of Americans believe in creationism, that human beings were created directly by God. 22 percent believe in the theory of evolution. And 10 percent support intelligent design. But when it comes to the question facing hundreds of school districts around the country, 55 percent of Americans believe all three ideas should be taught in school together.\n \n Intelligent design even has President Bush's support. He says it should be taught in schools along with evolution. Supporters argue intelligent design is a legitimate science worthy of debate as an alternative to what they see as the flawed theory of evolution.\n \n JOHN COURAGE, HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE TEACHER: We've had 150 years of one dogma ruling biology. What we're asking for is that Darwinian evolution be taught to students, but also the current scientific criticisms of the theory.\n \n LAVENDERA: Like the proverbial elephant in the room, intelligent design is roaming through classrooms and school board meetings around the country. Everyone knows it's there, but many scientists still don't want to talk to it, for fear of giving it too much credibility. But it appears intelligent design may might already be gaining in the war of acceptance.\n \n\n \n The poll numbers CANNOT be right.\n They just can't.",

You're pretending that you're trying to save them from \"immorality\", but your definition of immorality is simply that which doesn't agree with your religion.

It says \"respecting an establishment of religion\". Not one religion, or a religion, but religion in general.\n \n I think the problem here is that you don't really understand what the phrase \"seperation of church and state\" means, and that's why you're so afraid of it.

   "Evolution is science, creation is religion. If you want to teach creation, teach it in a religious studies class, or philosphy, or something in that vein. To teach creation in science class is to elevate a religious view to the realm of scientific truth. And that is clearly establishing a religion. \n\n \n You're putting evolution and creation on completely different levels, based only on your own views, and you're in the minority. The theory of evolution has gaping holes, requiring faith to fill them, and some of creationism has scientific credibility.\n \n \n \n \nI think you need to read your own post again. You are saying that your view on how to lead your life is correct, and the view of anyone who feels differently is wrong. And you want your religious views given the weight of law to enforce your morality. If the \"general public\" did in fact share your views then we wouldn't be having this discussion, would we? No one would be engaging in these so called \"anti-christian\" activities that you feel we need protection from. But they are, and so you want to stop them by having your religious views elevated to law.\n\n \n A minority is engaging in anti-Christian activities. Anti-Christians seem to claim the first amendment as their own exclusive property. From post 44, (not written by me);\n \n \n A recent Harris Interactive poll found 64 percent of Americans believe in creationism, that human beings were created directly by God. 22 percent believe in the theory of evolution. And 10 percent support intelligent design. But when it comes to the question facing hundreds of school districts around the country, 55 percent of Americans believe all three ideas should be taught in school together.\n\n \n \nAgain you are saying that you need to impose your religion on others. You're pretending that you're trying to save them from \"immorality\", but your definition of immorality is simply that which doesn't agree with your religion. There are social problems, but they won't be solved by forcing others to worship the way you do, or making them march in lock step with your dogma. \n\n \n I'm not talking about worship, I'm talking about morality that makes sense to the majority in a democratic republic. I'm not advocating laws because they are religious, but because the majority thinks they make sense. (and they don't violate rights guaranteed by the TEXT of the Constitution) The words, \"thou shalt not steal\" are in the Bible. Should laws against stealing be repealed? - is prohibiting stealing forcing religion on everyone? \n \n \n \n \nLet's quote a framer then, shall we? This is from the letter you mention.\n Thomas Jefferson:\n \"I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, thus building a wall of separation between church and state.\"\n \n Please explain to me how that can mean anything other than that the first amendment was meant to ensure a seperation of church and state. \n\n \n I'll let Justice William Rehnquist do it.\n \n \n It is impossible to build sound constitutional doctrine upon a mistaken understanding of constitutional history, expresssly freighted with Jefferson's misleading metaphor for nearly forty years. Thomas Jefferson was of course in France at the time the constitutional amendments known as the Bill of Rights were pressed by Congress and ratified by the States. His letter to the Danbury Baptist Association was a short note of courtesy, written fourteen years after the amendments were passed by Congress. He would seem to any detached observer as a less than ideal source of contemporary history to the meaning of the Religious Clauses of the first Amendment. \n\n \n More from Rehnquist;\n \n The Establishment Clause did not require government neutrality between religion and irreligion nor did it prohibit the Federal Government from providing nondiscriminatory aid to religion. There is simply no historical foundation for the proposition that the Framers intneded to build the \"wall of seperation\".....\n \n ....The \"wall of seperation between church and State\" is a metaphor based on bad history, a metaphor which has proved useless as a guide to judging. It should be frankly and explicitly be abandoned. \n\n \n Rehnquist again;\n \n [since 1947] our Establishment Clause cases have been neither principaled nor unified. Our recent opinions, many of them hopelessly divided pluralities, have with embarrassing candor conceded that the \"wall of separation\" is merely a blurred, indistinct, and variable barrier, which is not wholly accurate, and can only be dimly perceived.\" \n\n \n \n \n \n \nAnd your assertion that the first amendment merely prohibits the establishment of one state religion is ludicrious, and completely without justification. It says \"respecting an establishment of religion\". Not one religion, or a religion, but religion in general.\n\n \n They based how they set up our government by what they experienced in Europe. They were worried about conflicting religions, not inconvieniences to non-believers. \n \n \n \nI think the problem here is that you don't really understand what the phrase \"seperation of church and state\" means, and that's why you're so afraid of it. What does it mean to you?\n\n \n Since it's not in the Constitution, it means NOTHING to me. Now that you've read Rehnquist's words, do you understand it better?",

And if evolution has gaping holes, please present them here, I would like to see them. \n\n \n There is a difference between protecting rights, and satisfying every discomfort that Athiests find in our society. \n \n The main gaping hole is this; Untill about the time of Einstein, Athiests could comfort themselves with the belief that the universe is eternal, and thus did not need a cause. But since then, five lines of scientific evidence have been discovered that prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the universe did indeed have a beginning. Science has proven, by it's own methods, that the world began abruptly in an act of creation to which you can trace the seeds of every star, every planet, every living thing in this cosmos and on the earth. And it has found that all this happened as a product of forces that man cannot hope to discover - supernatural forces. It takes every bit as much faith to be an evolutionist as it does to be a creationist.\n \n \n \n \nminority or majority doesn't matter, but the first amendment is a right everyone has, not just the majority, and not just the minority. \n\n \n I agree.

It is to protect the right to property of people. Religion doesn't own this law, it would be a law regardless of religion. \n\n \n Atheism is arguably a religion. As I showed above, science can't hope to prove that the universe began without a supernatural creator. Why should their assumption that there is no creator be taught as fact, with no other (at least equal) assumptions not be permitted to be taught in our schools?\n \n \n \nWell how can you know something is or isn't in the Constitution if you don't understand it?\n\n \n What kind of a question is that? :) I didn't admit to not understanding it, I questioned his understanding of it.

I'll gladly take up the particulars of this issue with you in the creation/evolution forum. All I'll say here is that if your only objection is trully that you want creation taught along side evolution than you could have said so far sooner than this. Are you sure that's what your objection is? Nothing else? \n\n \n It's not my only objection, but it was in post #1 - I've been referring to it throughout this entire thread. My objections all fall into one simple catagory - the mis-interpretation of the first amendment.\n \n \n \n \nYou voice your opposition to it, but you're still not saying what you think it is. Here's my take. Seperation of church and state means that the government should not:\n A) Suppress the free excercise of religion, within reasonable bounaries (no human sacrifice for example)\n B) Endorse one religion over another, or endorse religion over non religion. (IE, the government shouldn't pressure your religious decisions)\n C) Enact laws which have a strictly religious purpose.\n You seem to agree with me on A, but I've gotten the impression that you've come down on both sides of B and C.\n\n \n Here's what I think it is ~ IRRELEVANT, because it's not in the Constitution. Now lets apply your A, B, & C to the TEXT of the First Amendment.\n \n A. I agree\n \n B. The word \"endorse\" is not in the first amendment. The word \"establishment\" is. Those two words definitions may be slightly similar, but only slightly. The word \"endorse\" is much more vague. I can claim that public funding \"endorses\" the study of evolution, therefore the government endorses atheism. We can do a lot of arguing about what's endorsed, that's the reason the word \"endorse\" isn't in the first amendment. Compared to all the documentation and politics that went into the development of them, the Constitution and Bill of Rights themselves are amazingly short. The words used in them were chosen VERY CAREFULLY.\n \n C. I would agree, if a law FORCED a person to be religious. We have no laws, present or past, that have even come close to that.",

The first is that we need to be able to distinguish Christian values, or any relgion's for that matter, from what you might call generic values. Simply because something appears in the BIble does not make it Christian, or at least not exclusively Christian. Some version of \"Thou shall not kill\" is found in most religions, and in most cultures. It's a basic tenant of any moral structure, and so does not \"belong\" to Christianity. And therefore having laws against killing in no way should be construed as endorsing a religious creedo. If you tried to have a law saying that you couldn't eat red meat on Friday, that would be a religious law.\n \n The second point you bring up concerns the government coercing people's religious choices. You speak of laws and arrests, and seem to suggest that their lack is sufficient to ensure freedom of religion. I would disagree. For people to really have religious freedom, they must believe that they have religious freedom. As a hypothetical example, if a government says you have religious freedom, but social services in an area where people of religion A lived were always better then in the religion B neighborhoods, and religion B people always seemed to lose in court, and religion A holidays were state holidays, but none of religion B, then you couldn't really say that there was religious freedom, right? There's definite pressure to be of religion A, even if there's no laws to that effect. This sort of thing has happened often enought throughout history that people are right to be concerned about it. And so it's not enough for our government to simply not pressure people, it's their responsibility to not give the appearance of pressuring people. And having a big old plaque in the middle of the courthouse saying \"worship this God and no other\" most definately gives the impression of pressure. It may not be forcing people by law to become Christians, but it does give the impression that the government prefers Judeo/Christianity, and if the people believe that the government is biased towards one religion then they won't feel as free to follow another.",

Do you really think that the Supreme Court just made up \"separation of church and state\"? Really? \n \n No. Thomas Jefferson was asked by a religious group to explain a bit more about the First Ammendment, and part of his response was ...\n \n \n\"Believing that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should make no law 'respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between church and state.\" \n (President Thomas Jefferson, 1802 letter to the Baptists of Danbury, Connecticut) \n\n \n Do you see Jefferson's explicit link between the First Ammendment and the separation between church and state? Can you see that he is explaining the intent of the establishment clause?\n \n \n Oh, and Jefferson mentioned the separation of church and state on more than one occassion ...\n \n \n\"Because religious belief, or non-belief, is such an important part of every person's life, freedom of religion affects every individual. State churches that use government power to support themselves and force their views on persons of other faiths undermine all our civil rights. Moreover, state support of the church tends to make the clergy unresponsive to the people and leads to corruption within religion. Erecting the \"wall of separation between church and state,\" therefore, is absolutely essential in a free society.\n \n We have solved ... the great and interesting question whether freedom of religion is compatible with order in government and obedience to the laws. And we have experienced the quiet as well as the comfort which results from leaving every one to profess freely and openly those principles of religion which are the inductions of his own reason and the serious convictions of his own inquiries.\"\n (Thomas Jefferson, to the Virginia Baptists, 1808)\n This is his second use of the term \"wall of separation,\" here quoting his own use in the Danbury Baptist letter. This wording was several times upheld by the Supreme Court as an accurate description of the Establishment Clause: Reynolds (98 U.S. at 164, 1879); Everson (330 U.S. at 59, 1947); McCollum (333 U.S. at 232, 1948)\n http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/jefframe.htm \n\n \n \n \n \n \n ********************************\n \n Here, let me give you a bit more on Jefferson's views on separation of church and state.\n \n \n\"The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg.\"\n -- Thomas Jefferson, Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781-82 \n http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/jefframe.htm \n\n \n \n \n\"[N]o man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.\n -- Thomas Jefferson, Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom (1779), quoted from Merrill D. Peterson, ed., Thomas Jefferson: Writings (1984), p. 347 \n http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/jefframe.htm \n\n \n \n\"Our civil rights have no dependence upon our religious opinions more than our opinions in physics or geometry.\"\n -- Thomas Jefferson, Statute for Religious Freedom, 1779. Papers, 2:545\n http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/jefframe.htm \n\n \n \n And though not one of the founding fathers, we have the separation of church and state mentioned by other historical figures.\n \n \n\"Encourage free schools and resolve that not one dollar appropriated for their support shall be appropriated to the support of any sectarian schools. Resolve that neither the state nor nation, nor both combined, shall support institutions of learning other than those sufficient to afford every child growing up in the land of opportunity of a good common school education, unmixed with sectarian, pagan, or atheistical dogmas. Leave the matter of religion to the family altar, the church and the private school supported entirely by private contributions. Keep the church and state forever separate.\"\n -- Ulysses S.

   "DamEtel: Do you see Jefferson's explicit link between the First Ammendment and the separation between church and state? Can you see that he is explaining the intent of the establishment clause?\n \n \n \nMarc9000: The Constitution ... was established 11 years before Jefferson wrote his letter to the Danbury Baptists, which was nothing more than a short note of courtesy.\n\n \n Wrong. It was an explanation of the establishment clause, helping to clarify its intent. \n \n Gee, now do you think that that might be why the Supreme Court has used Jefferson's statements about building a wall of separation between church and state as their means of understanding the intent of the establishment clause? Huh?\n \n \n \n And if you'll note, again, Jefferson repeated his phrase \"wall of separation between church and state\" in another letter to a religious group to help explain the intent. \n \n \n \n \n Now, is there anything else about the Constitution that helps confirm that it's a secular document, meant to separate church and state? Yep.\n \n First, neither the word God nor the word Jesus appear anywhere in either the Constitution or the Bill of Rights. It's a secular document. This is important because it was the first time that a national government was founded without promoting a state religion. You'd have to understand how out of place for the time a secular Constitution really was to understand the importance of leaving God and Jesus out such an important document; and how doing so clearly shows an intent to not go along with the then universal act of mixing church and state.\n \n Second, the only references to religion in the Constitution and the Bill of Right are EXCLUSIONARY. One forbids the government from mandating religious 'tests' in order for someone to serve as a public official. For a bit of context, Delaware was requiring a person to swear an oath that he believed in the Holy Trinity in order to hold a public office, and other states had similar religious requirements for holding government offices. Jefferson and the other founders of our nation said that they would have none of that - which mixes church and state - for the national goverment.\n \n The other is, of course, the First Ammendmant, which forbids -- not allows -- the government from doing certain things related to religion. You would need to know the historical context - the conditions prevailing in that day - to know just how anti-status quo this was too, and how therefore just by saying \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; . . .\" showed that the intention was to do away with the then universal union of church and state.\n \n Now, it is EVERYONE who ratified the Constitution and agreed to the Bill of Rights - not just Jefferson - who understood, because of the obvious change from the status quo that was in place at the time, that the documents were meant to do away with the then standard practice of mixing church and state, and therefore, to separate church and state.\n \n \n \n \n \nmarc9000: Jefferson was one of the most secular of all the founders.\n\n \n And yet, funny enough, it wasn't Jefferson alone who made the Constitution our governing document, seeing as how every state ratified the SECULAR Constitution.\n \n \n \nmarc9000: He didn't have authority to make changes in wording and interpretation of the country's foundation, and I don't think he wanted to.\n\n \n And he didn't change anything!

How about Jefferson's treaty with the Kaskaskia Indians, which provided annual cash support for the tribe's Roman Catholic Priest and church? Congress appropraited public money time and time again for Indian education carried on by religious organizations, in the 19th century.

They want to add words in some places, and disregard actual text in others. Several phrases come to mind;\n \n \"...shall not be infringed\"\n \n \"...probable cause.....particularly describing the place to be searched...\"\n \n \"...shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.\"\n \n \"...nor execssive fines imposed...\" (ever hear of Merck Pharmaceuticals?)\n \n \"...are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.\"\n \n Many originalists think that paying almost no attention to the above actual text is far more dangerous to the health of our country than separating church & state. Are these no longer relavent? Are you really an originalist, or are you a non-originalist (activist), as almost all of the \"separation of church & state\" crowd are?

   "Everyone has the choice and the capability to learn and live what they want. How they go about doing it determines the success and consequences. Things may be taught and learned in the schools, but do the youth learning these things accept what is taught? No, and last i checked the local schools taught conflicting theories on creationism/evolutionism etc., etc. and were to make clear that all of the things taught are theories and/or beliefs and were unable to say anything more. I have heard that where you live determines how you live and i think that is true. Those who work to run countries have influence on the societal values. Abortion, gay rights, and many of the 'hot' issues are moral issues which each individual should have the right to choose for themselves what actions they take. This isnt meant to be a rambling lecture honestly. I have noticed the ever increasing instances of Christian beliefs in everyday life. Seperation of church and state has become a fragile grey line. it is up to each person in how they live each day to make thier views known without monopolizing society. I have my beliefs and will share them but i believe that each person has the right to make choices for themselves according to what they believe, not what i believe. Openmindedness is becoming increasingly scarce. Most people do not take kindly to everything they do being checked and restricted because of someone elses beliefs. Before you try to go around 'converting' people imagine what your reaction would be. In the way you spread your ideas remember that philosophy to one person may be religion to another.",

The 'template' for the Constitution, Virginia's 1786 Act for Establishing Religious Freedom. There was much political - which at the time also meant religious! - debate about Jefferson's proposal, which is one reason it took until 1786 to pass.\n \n \n \nmarc9000: Why do you suppose George Washington's proclaimation of Thanksgiving day went politically unchallanged?\n\n \n I'd imagine that in those days, when Washington was a god, he could have done all sorts of questionable things, without being questioned about them.\n \n I mean, come on, consider what our current George W - XXXXX and hypocrite - gets away with ... and he, sir, is no Washington!\n \n Also, opposing religious things in those days was virtual political suicide. Just ask Jefferson!\n \n And let's not forget how Jefferson handled this issue...\n \n \n\"Jefferson, unlike Washington and Adams, refused to issue presidential proclamations of thanksgiving to God, often requested on official occassions by the evangelical churches that had played such an important role in passage of the Virginia religious freedom act and ratification of the Constitution.\" (Freethinkers, Susan Jacoby, Owl Books, 2004, p43) \n\n \n Washington's thanksgiving proclamations may have gone officially unchallenged, but Jefferson - as president - refused to do it and considered it a violation of the First Amendment.\n \n \nmarc9000: Was Jefferson the only one entrusted with interpreting the Constitution for us?\n\n \n He's one hell of a lot more authoritative on the matter than you are!\n \n Can you show us a founding father's statements, made just after the Consistution and Bill of Rights were written, that says the First Amendment is NOT supposed to build a wal of separationg between chruch and state?\n \n \n \nmarc9000: Why is all this \"separation of church & state\" outcry happening only today?\n\n \n Probably because freethinkers these days don't risk the same kind of retaliation as they did back then. Hell, just about 10 years ago an atheist who put a stop to school prayer - Madalyn Murray O'Hair - was brutally murdered. Kind of tough for freethinkers to speak out against religious wrongs when those who do get killed, are mistreated, or face destroying their own political careers.\n \n Religious persecution still occurs in America today! The religous persecute those who as not religious.\n \n Over the years, the opposition to freethough has risen and subsided and risen and .... When it's on an upswing, we shouldn't expect to see much protesting of religious actions.\n \n \n \nmarc9000: Then why are those words not in there - EVERYONE who ratified it DID NOT SEE those words.\n\n \n What words?

It's not something I can continue to do.\n \n What little time I can spare here and there for posting on the Net I will devote to my primary concern, the Creation/Evolution debates; the section where I have spent the vast majority of my time here, and the only one I mentioned when stating I was going back to school...\n \n \nI've been involved heavily in a lot of different threads in this Evolution/Creationism forum. For me to make my \"back to college\" comment on the last page of one thread would not let everyone I've been debating know, and they may mistakenly take my sudden lack of responding to mean I can't counter their arguments.

   "Has the meaning of the Constitution ever been debated? Are you serious? Does the right to bear arms mean you can have an assault rifle? Does freedom of the press mean that reporters never need to reveal their sources? Is flag burning covered under freedom of speech? Any of these debates ring a bell? \n\n \n The constitution is not about such details. The constitution defines and establishes the distribution, authority, and structure of Government. The process by which decisions are made.\n \n \nThe Bill of Rights is a guideline, it simply isn't specific enough to stand on its own. \n\n \n The Constitution is principles, not specifics, and it stands on it's own just fine, to those who halfway understand it.\n \n \n It must be interpreted, and that is the job of the Supreme Court. \n\n \n And it's the job of legislatures, states and people, to determine specifics about things like assault rifles, news sources, and flag burning. \n \n \nThis country, which once condoned slavery and denied women the vote, has grown morally over the years, and so we must re-examine what the Constitution means in light of that growth. \n\n \n And there is a process to do it, without eliminating or changing it's principles in the slightest. Slavery was outlawed by the 13th amendment, NOT by judicial order. Women were given the right to vote by the 19th amendment, not by judicial order.\n \n \n Sometimes new decisions as to how to interpret the Bill of Rights must be made. You call certain decisions 'judicial activism', I call them interpretations you don't like. \n\n \n No, I call them political decisions made by the wrong people according to the Constitution.\n \n \n Unless you're willing to take the stance that every single re-interpretation was judicial activism? Is that your claim? If not then I don't see how your claim holds any water.\n\n \n I do take that stance, every single re-interpretation when the legislatures, states, or people didn't have the slightest say in the matter.",

   "And? When they DID think about it, they referenced Jefferson's explanatory statements, penned shortly after the Bill of Rights itself was written, by one of the primary founding fathers of our nation. \n\n \n Do you really believe a courtesy note to a religious group can by used as an all-encompassing, last word analyzation of the entire first amendment?\n \n \n \n \n \nSure. The 'template' for the Constitution, Virginia's 1786 Act for Establishing Religious Freedom. There was much political - which at the time also meant religious! - debate about Jefferson's proposal, which is one reason it took until 1786 to pass. \n\n \n I was asking about the period AFTER the Constitution and Bill of Rights were established and ratified, not before.\n \n \n \nI'd imagine that in those days, when Washington was a god, he could have done all sorts of questionable things, without being questioned about them. \n\n \n I'd imagine he couldn't have done any more questionable things than any president in any other time, possibly less. He was the first president, probably a lot of jealousy. And a very fresh Constitution. Just think, a decent percentage of people and politicians probably actually understood it! \n \n \nI mean, come on, consider what our current George W - XXXXX and hypocrite - gets away with ... and he, sir, is no Washington!\n \n Also, opposing religious things in those days was virtual political suicide. Just ask Jefferson! \n \n \n I can't communicate with the dead.\n \n \nAnd let's not forget how Jefferson handled this issue...\n\n \n He was outvoted on that one two to one, wasn't he? Why do you hold Jefferson's views so much higher than the other founding fathers? Why do you expect everyone else to?\n \n \n \n \nWashington's thanksgiving proclamations may have gone officially unchallenged, but Jefferson - as president - refused to do it and considered it a violation of the First Amendment. \n\n \n He didn't have to do it because it was already done. He specifically considered Thanksgiving day a violation of the First Amendment? Can you reference that, or did you just make it up?\n \n \n \n \nHe's one hell of a lot more authoritative on the matter than you are!\n\n \n That's true. And it's equally true that you aren't qualified to speak for him.\n \n \nCan you show us a founding father's statements, made just after the Consistution and Bill of Rights were written, that says the First Amendment is NOT supposed to build a wal of separationg between chruch and state?\n\n \n No. I can't find anything by them that says we can't change to communism in 50 years either, but I think it's safe to say they didn't want it. But I can show you a statement by Jefferson about judicial activism, written in 1825, after he had a chance to see how the U.S. system of government worked.\n \n \n This member of Government [the judiciary] was at first considered as the most harmless and helpless of all it's organs. But it has proved that the power of declaring what the law is...by sapping and mining slyly and without alarm the foundations of the Constitution, and do what open force would not dare to attempt.\n(letter from Jefferson to Edward Livingston, 1825)\n \n \n Kind of reminds you of the recent eminent domain law, doesn't it?\n \n \n \n \nProbably because freethinkers these days don't risk the same kind of retaliation as they did back then. Hell, just about 10 years ago an atheist who put a stop to school prayer - Madalyn Murray O'Hair - was brutally murdered. Kind of tough for freethinkers to speak out against religious wrongs when those who do get killed, are mistreated, or face destroying their own political careers. \n Religious persecution still occurs in America today! The religous persecute those who as not religious.\n \n Over the years, the opposition to freethough has risen and subsided and risen and .... When it's on an upswing, we shouldn't expect to see much protesting of religious actions.\n\n \n O,Hair's murder \"political retaliation\" emoticon_rolleyes / Religious persecution - give me a break. \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat words? And what is the it that people ratified? Gee, am I supposed to be able to figure out what your intent is just by reading some words? :-) \n \n \n The words, \"separation of church and state\". Please concentrate.\n \n \n \n \nJefferson didn't add words to the text, and he didn't change the interpretation ... he explained the original intent\n \n \n \n No, those who interpret the First Amendment in a manner other than the original intent - as spelled out by Jefferson - are those who are changing it.\n\n \n The Danbury letter was not intended to \"spell it out\". If you want to see things spelled out, check out the Federalist Papers sometime. \n \n \n \nAre you an undereducated religious fundamentalist, as almost all of the bashers of \"separation of church and state\" are?\n\n \n I'm an originalist. I see you responded to my question with a question, and ducked mine. Maybe this will help you. I honestly believe it's non partisan.\n \n http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/interp.html\n \n Read the eight reasons for each, Originalist and Non-Originalist, and let me know which one describes you best.

In too many cases, mandatory minimum sentences are unwise and unjust. \n\n \n Since it's federal law, and not prohibited by the Constitution, no one should care what he \"personally accepts\" about it.

When our allies or our way of life are under assault, we'll help provide them security.\n \n We'll keep our Judeo-Christian values. You are welcome to Islam, Scientology, Pig Latin, Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals, Humanism, Al Gore, the nose pickers, the Kool Aid drinkers, and Shirley McClain. You can also have the U.N.. but we will no longer be paying the bill.\n \n We'll keep the SUVs, pickup trucks, Indy cars, Hot Rods and oversized luxury cars. You can have the Cash for Clunkers wrecks, all with Obama stickers. \n \n You can give everyone healthcare if you can find enough practicing doctors and nurses who will do it, and that's supposing you also will have some money to pay for it (knowing your government will be bankrupt in no time with all your drunken-sailor spending programs). We'll continue to earn our own healthcare. We'll keep The Battle Hymn of the Republic and the National Anthem. I'm sure you'll be happy to substitute Imagine, I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing, Kum Ba Ya, the Soviet National Anthem, or We Are the World.\n \n We'll practice trickle down economics and you can give your trickle up poverty your best shot. Since it often so offends you, we'll also keep our history, our name and our flag. More later.\n \n P.S. Oh yeah, please take Barbara Streisand, Harry Reid, Nanci Pelosi, Jessee Jackson, Al Sharpton, Barbara Boxer, Jane Fonda, Obama, and all the other radical, left wing loons with you. And don't come back.\n \n emoticon_xbouncer\n\n \n Isn't this like your sick twisted version of heaven on earth or something? Is this what you actually believe it will be like when Jesus comes back?",
