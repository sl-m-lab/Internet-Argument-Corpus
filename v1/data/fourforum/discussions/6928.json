   "Here is the red tape that is currently holding up the recharging of Earth's magnetic field as it continues its decrease toward Tesla zero. On 26th July 2005 the Planning and Regulatory Panel of Salisbury District Council refused English Heritage's application for excavation and removal of A-344 road beside Heelstone:\n \n http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.5437\n \n English Heritage's application, approved by the Northern Area Committee of Salisbury District Council at its meeting of 19th July 2005, was refused by the Planning and Regulatory Panel of Salisbury District Council on 26th July 2005, because it did not provide for excavating and removing the Heelstone artifacts:\n \n http://www.geocities.com/garrydenke\n \n 1) brass altar (5c-5c-3c)\n 2) gold ark (2.5c-1.5c-1.5c)\n 3) gold table (2c-1c-1.5c)\n 4) gold altar (1c-1c-2c)\n 5) gold candlestick\n 6) gold breastplate\n 7) gold ephod\n 8) gold censer\n 9) brass laver\n \n http://www.garrydenke.com/seismic.htm\n \n 1) A-A' (1979) C91 quadrant bearing; N 73 E\n 2) B-B' (1953) C36 quadrant bearing; S 67 E\n 3) C-C' (1923) C6 quadrant bearing; S 57 E\n 4) D-D' (1923) C6 quadrant bearing; South\n 5) E-E' (1923) C6 quadrant bearing; S 50 E\n 6) F-F' (1923) C6 quadrant bearings; S 2 W - S 22 E\n 7) G-G' (1923) C6 quadrant bearing; S 50 E\n 8) H-H' (1956) C51 quadrant bearing; S 63 E\n 9) I-I' (1979) C91 quadrant bearings; S 71 E - S 34 E - S 71 E / S 71 E\n \n http://www.salisbury.gov.uk/council/contact\n \n English Heritage was very surprised, and disappointed, by Salisbury District Council's decision, but they now know the grounds for refusal are ones which can easily be resolved when English Heritage submits the amended scheme providing for the excavation and removal of the Heelstone artifacts and A-344 road.\n \n http://www.gnn.gov.uk/content/detail.asp?NewsAreaID=2&ReleaseID=175616\n \n The review will be taken forward by a steering group consisting of representatives from: the Department for Transport; the Department for Culture, Media and Sport; the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; the Highways Agency; the Government Office for the South West; and statutory advisers.",
