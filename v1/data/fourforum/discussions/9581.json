I believe the point was to show the pointlessness and absurdity in viabilty arguments that some pro-choicers propagate.\n\n Quite honestly, I did not notice this thread having any one particular point. However, perhaps I misinterpreted, but there seemed to be statements thrown around suggesting that it is evil to abort a fetus at 21 weeks because it could survive outside the womb at 21 weeks. My post was mostly in response to such sentiments.\n \n As for viability arguements, there are a few points that I would bring up:\n 1. Once the fetus is living outside the womb - ex. in premature birth - then nobody on the pro-choice side (to my knowledge) would advocate killing it since there is no reason to do so - there is no competition between rights.\n \n 2. Roe vs Wade uses that viability arguement in allowing states to outlaw abortion (exception for risks to a mother's health or life) once the fetus becomes viable. I am personally currently comfortable with that stance since it coincides fairly closely in time with my own critical criteria of the possible emergence of a mental existence - also roughly at the start of the third trimester. However, I agree with you that viability is not a strong arguement to use. For example, if someday artificial wombs would be developed which could sustain an embryo after, say, a few weeks, then do we call that embryo viable and prevent all women from having abortions at that stage? I would say no.",

I'm not sure I'm entirely happy with abortions at this late stage, though I am pro-choice -- it seems bizarre to me that anyone could get beyond the first trimester without wondering when she last had a period and taking a test.\n\n I've also wondered about this. The great majority of abortions are indeed performed in the first trimester - some statistics from http://www.policyalmanac.org/culture/archive/abortion_statistics.shtml :\n \n 57% of abortions occur at <8 weeks of gestation\n 87% of abortions occur at <13 weeks of gestation\n 4.3% were at 16--20 weeks of gestation\n 1.4% were at <21 weeks\n \n This shows that the great majority of women do discover their pregnancies fairly quickly and choose and carry out their abortions also fairly quickly.\n \n My understanding from other sources are that those that occur around the third trimester are almost exclusively for reasons related to risks to the mother's life or health. Though I don't have the time to find some backup material, I would assume that most abortions performed in the first trimester are done by choice for reasons other than risks to life or health and that this fraction goes down as you move away from first trimester into the second and then third trimester. It would be a rare woman woman who does not realize that she is pregnant until many months into a pregnancy.

   "I gave some potential reasons. Perhaps the mother can't afford to keep it, or perhaps she is mad at the child for coming so early. There may not be a reason to kill it, but I'm wondering if you think it immoral if somebody did. And if so, do you think it immoral enough to charge the person who would do so as a murderer?\n\n I would not call it murder until there is a mental existence involved since I do not believe that a person exists until a mental existence starts. Would I personally consider it immoral to kill it un-necessarily - yes, but to a much lesser extent than it would be to kill it once it had mental existence. The reasons that you stated for her to kill the newborn are not compelling reasons since she has other choices that do not impose on her own valued rights as a person (ex. her right to her own body). \n \nAs I have said ad nauseum, the fact that one does not like the policy established by the Court in Roe v. Wade has nothing to do with its correctness (I.e., one should not approve/disapprove of a decision on the basis that it establishes an agreeable/disagreeable policy). The question of whether abortion IS protected by the Constitution has no relationship to the question of whether the Constitution SHOULD protect abortion. And quite clearly, the trimester framework was not protected by the Constitution.\n\n If all we did in this forum is debate the legality of abortion, then we would have nothing to really debate since its legality is ultimately determined by which party is voted in which can create anti-abortion laws and which also can pick justices for the Supreme Court. Most of us here, including myself, are interested in the general moral and/or philosophical reasons for being for or against abortion rights. From that point of view, we are certainly free to express our opinions on whether a particular ruling is morally right, in our view. Our opinions here are worthless where the law is concerned. The only power that we have on this issue where the law is concerned is in our vote, and I will continue to vote for pro-choice candidates.\n \nI fear that you are leaning toward the position that this child, born at 22 weeks, is not a person, and therefore, it has no rights. Since there is \"nobody home,\" I think your view cannot make a distinction between (to borrow Shooter's analogy), chopping this baby's head off on the one hand, and chopping down a weed with a weed eater on the other. I think this is the logical conclusion of your view, but you are free to correct me if I am wrong.\n\n I have already said that I do not believe that it should be killed if there is no compelling reason to kill it since I do value that pre-mentally existing fetus or newborn baby for its potential to gain that mental existence. Also, compelling reasons include killing it only if that cannot be avoided without imposing on important rights of a real mentally-existing person.\n \nI am indeed thinking of the premature baby as being equal to a baby born at the normal gestational term. But it is not because I sympathize with it. Just to be clear, I have significant reservations as having empathy as the standard for determining the morality of an action. But I have raised the questions I have because you adhere to this standard. I am prepared to say that the child born at 22 weeks has the same right to live as a child born at the normal stage. And the fact that I cannot see your position as allowing this, is one reason that I do not accept the empathy standard.\n\n Well, we have different standards of morality. Mine is based on empathy which leads to a standard of treating others as I would have myself be treated. Yours may or may not be based on some arbitrary religious code. Of course, each of us consider our own moral code superior and will not convince the other.",

Now we have rights dependent on location, development, and on other people in general. This is getting cfazy.\n\n I am not saying that the baby has rights as you and me. However, I think that, once it is out of the womb, the state can claim a right to protect that life because of its potential to become a person and, critically, because the protection of that life would, at that point, not violate the critical right of any actual person.

In my view, it is not a person until it gains mental existence. \n \n This is a situation where looks deceive us since what we see is a tiny version of a baby out of the womb so we might psychologically attach the same type of characteristics to it as we attach to a normal baby. If we do that, then we are fooling ourselves since there is one very important characteristic missing from that 22 week old - mental existence. We may think that we are looking at a person - mental existence at all - but all we are looking at, at that stage, is a living body. \n \n I can understand the emotional reaction that people would have to that 22 week old and I would probably have it to.

   "Again, I never said that the Declaration of Independence has legal force. What I have said is it demonstrates the basis of rights (that is, the justification for the existence of rights) in the American tradition. That basis is the Creator. I am merely trying to point out to Shooter that \"mental existence\" is not the basis of rights.\n \n I think you would have to agree with this as well, because even if the Constitution is the basis of our rights (rather then just declaring what rights have been recognized), it could be amended to afford rights to trees. Therefore, mental existence is not the basis of rights.\n\n If you are not claiming that the Declaration of Independence is the basis of legal rights than why should we even care what the Declaration of Independence says about this? Outside of legal rights, all we have is a wide range of opinions of a wide variety of people. \n The Declaration of Independence just represents the opinions of the people writing it.

   "I am not saying that the baby has rights as you and me. However, I think that, once it is out of the womb, the state can claim a right to protect that life because of its potential to become a person and, critically, because the protection of that life would, at that point, not violate the critical right of any actual person. Remember, in the abortion debate, the main motivation of pro-choice proponents is protection of the mother's rights over her own body.\n A right I deny exists (and as do you when this \"being\" is defined as a person by you). So to clarify, if someone were to kill this born baby then a person has not been killed and it would be as morally wrong (towards the baby that is) as if someone punched the mother and caused a miscarriage. I assume a punishment would that of killing a dog or something.\n \n \nThough it may sounds strange to you - no, it is not a person yet, just like the frozen embryos out of the womb are not people. In my view, it is not a person until it gains mental existence. \n \n This is a situation where looks deceive us since what we see is a tiny version of a baby out of the womb so we might psychologically attach the same type of characteristics to it as we attach to a normal baby. If we do that, then we are fooling ourselves since there is one very important characteristic missing from that 22 week old - mental existence. We may think that we are looking at a person - mental existence at all - but all we are looking at, at that stage, is a living body. \n \n I can understand the emotional reaction that people would have to that 22 week old and I would probably have it to. But, where laws are concerned, we cannot go by gut reactions alone, we have to analyze the situation to see what is really happening. That 22 week old is still just a body without a mind at that stage. I think it has a value because it will soon become a real person - mind and all, but it doesn't automatically become a person by being out of the womb.

The 22 week old is simply MUCH closer to the critical stage than is an embryo out of the womb so I would place more value in it, but certainly less than in one that already mentally existed.\nI don't think mental existence is a requirement as it makes no sense to be one. \n \n Anyway, lets go over this evolving standard of when a baby/fetus/embryo/being/human/person or whatever actually has rights as you and I:\n \n First we look at the \"being\" and decide if this undefined term \"mental existence\" exists. If yes then we assume this to be a person and the mother has no right to kill another person. If no then the mother may still have the right to kill this \"being\" (by the way..only the mother? what happens if someone else kills it...car accident for example?). So now we look at whether or not the burden of the \"being\" is too great and overwhelms the so called \"right\" to ones own body. At this point we accept this to be a human being I suppose since there is an admission of something imposing on another. But this human being is only a \"potential person\" which means the rights are limited to some unknown list of pre-person rights of which life is not one of them absolutely. So now we look to location to determine if this \"right to life\" exists or not. If the location is in the womb then the burden is deemed to be too high...I guess due to discomfort and other various things. Even here, only one person has the right to terminate as I suppose this pre-person is property of the mother? However, if outside the womb then pre-persons rights have somehow changed since the burdens once had by the mother are now gone (although new ones might exist). So pre-person's rights are not really rights naturally had but rather rights granted by the mother. We therefore can have a 21wk old baby outside the womb whom no one (including the mother) can kill because pre-persons outside the womb have different rights from pre-persons inside the womb. \n \n This is getting way to confusing.

Indeed, in case you are interested, I have heard of a passage in the Old Testament (one of very few passages in the Bible hinting at life prior to birth) that designates that the punishment for precisely that type of killing is that the perpetrator should pay a fine for that action. Not that I think that people should follow the Old Testament but I would think that would be relevant from your point of view since your morality is one based on Biblical teaching. (I am willing to find and quote the passage, but would not be willing to go into a full discussion of that, if that is what you would get into.).\n \nSo now we look at whether or not the burden of the \"being\" is too great and overwhelms the so called \"right\" to ones own body.

The question is \"When can a woman kill the fetus?\". I would say that, if it is out of her body, then none of her critical rights are being violated and she has no right to kill it. If it is in her body, then it depends on its stage of development:\n 1) Prior to mental existence, it has value but no rights and that value is less important than the mother's rights to her own body, so she can abort it.\n 2) After mental existence, it has rights and the woman cannot abort unless it is an issue of self protection (its life is a big risk to her life or health).",

Indeed, the Constitution doesn't directly address the issue of when a human life gains the rights that it outlines, so none of our views are directly supported by the Constitution. There are judicial arguments, which you obviously disagree with, that do support a woman's right to her body. However, those are obviously also contested.

   "well, animals show all those mental attributes and we still butcher, torture them, experiment with them and eat them. so killing an unconscious foetus is no big deal, and if somebody wants to eat them ... why not?\n\n I covered this in another thread but will repeat it here. There are at least two major reasons why I favor humans over animals and don't give them equal rights. The first is that I favor my own species - in a us vs them type of way. It is clear to me that, if we were to stringently try to adhere to having the same standards for rights for humans vs animals, then we would not be able to survive as a species. We need to have animals for food or at least for supplying food (eggs, milk). We need to kill pest species to be able to grow our own food, prevent desease spread by rats, etc. We no longer need to completely struggle for survival as a species (except what we might do to ourselves) but, if we made human vs animal rights equal, then our survival would once again be in jeopardy. I unabashedly favor our species to thrive vs. the survival of other species.\n \n The second reason is based on my moral approach based of a moral consensus - I will try to treat others as I would expect myself to be treated. Animals cannot take part in a moral consensus. \n \n That said, I do support laws against animal cruelty - and not just for pet animals but for other situations. For example, I only recently realized that food animals are not always killed instantaneously and humanely - I would support laws forcing humane killing of food animals.",

If you think we are pests then do you advocate our mass extermination to bring our population to levels more manageable with nature? I don't. I advocate for family planning to keep our population growth under control, and I advocate for safe havens for wild animals in terms of protected territories where people would not encroach, except for park rangers and controlled nature tours.\n \n And, though we might get away with not eating meat, we would not get away with not killing pest species or killing animals that might compete for the same foods. Also, before we became the dominant species, we were treated as a food source just as much as any other animal was. Indeed, there are still isolated cases throughout the world where people in remote areas are attacked by anything from mountain lions to crocodiles and eaten. Our technology and numbers make us much less vulnerable than we once were. It is not that animals suddenly became kindhearted and moral. \n \n I am a human.

Conjoined twins have the same DNA but I doubt many would say they are not 2 different people.\n\n Saying \"being a person is to actually be a person\" means nothing if you do not define what specific characteristics define a person. I define person as (1) mentally existing and (2) of the human species. In the development of a human, it is the onset of mental existence that I find critical because that mental existence is at the core of what I view as a person. Apparently, for you, something happens to an unfertilized egg that transforms it from a non-person to a person. I am just trying to see what characteristics reside in a newly fertilized egg that do not reside in an unfertilized one - a characteristic that suddenly makes it a person worthy of rights in your view.\n \nBy the way, that brings up a point about whether or not you support the \"violinist\" argument often discussed in abortion forums. The situation involves 2 people with \"mental existence\" as defined by you and from all accounts you feel that one this point is reached then a right to life is to be maintained (thus disallowing third trimester abortions generally). Would your argument change for the violinist?\n\n I don't think someone can just grab a person off the street and force them to support someone else without their agreement. In a pregnancy, the woman has about six months to decide whether to keep the child, knowing full well that a deadline for decision is approaching. If the deadline passes and she still hasn't decided then tough luck, she has to continue the pregnancy to term (unless exceptions such as risk to her life or major health risk, etc. come up). She HAD a choice and didn't decide in time to use it.\n \n In the violinist arguement, if she were just grabbed off the street and plugged to a machine supporting him, I think he has no right to force her to support him and she could disconnect. It would be a matter of self defense. I would think of that situation as being somewhat analogous to rape. \n \n However, in a modified version of the violinist arguement, if she was plugged into a machine and he would be connected at a later date (say a few months down the line), then she could disconnect anytime until he would be connected. At that point, it would have been her choice not to disconnect so, if she waits with her decision too long, she has to support him. Note: this assumes that the support would be temporary, as it is in a pregnancy.",

It can be seen when they play with a baby doll and they cradle it, care for it, and then all of a sudden throw it on the ground as part of their play--they don't have a true sense of empathy and can't feel what it would have been like to be a real baby thrown on the ground.

I believe your empathy to be as rudimentary as the youngsters' if it cannot embrace a fetus weeks earlier than a line of conjecture drawn at the 3rd trimester.\n\n \n And why not? The mother is a human life also, entitled to her rights. You can't just yank them away from her on the basis that an embryo is weak or \"helpless\".\n \n \n \n \n \nYour position is based on how you wish others to treat you? How would it feel to be chemically burned to death or violently torn apart? Rudimentary indeed.\n\n \n It is illegal to chemically burn people. \"He\" didn't exist untill somewhere around the third trimester. The embryo was just his body, not him. If the embryo was disposed of that does not mean that \"he\" or any people were, because there was no person inside of the embryo.\n \n \n \n \nI have read that a fetus has brain waves at 40 days. It experiences REM sleep (when we have dreams) at 17 weeks. It often responds to sounds and the mother's voice in the womb. So how do you know when a mental existence begins?

My doubt is that they can feel true empathy at that point. They most often mimic what an adult does without having a true idea of what they are doing. So if they pat their sad friend or family on the back when they are crying it is because they model what others do or someone told them to do it. It can be seen when they play with a baby doll and they cradle it, care for it, and then all of a sudden throw it on the ground as part of their play--they don't have a true sense of empathy and can't feel what it would have been like to be a real baby thrown on the ground. So if empathy is your criterion then I think you must move your line of protection of life back quite a bit and many will be victims of your line of reasoning.\n\n \n A two year old is without doubt a person. A human being with mental existence. An embryo is not a two year old.",

   "Have you deceived yourself into thinking you have established a humane and objective position in the treatment of human life? \n \n What good is empathy if it is not merciful enough, caring enough, encompassing enough to embrace the most vulnerable, most innocent, most helpless, most weak of human life? I believe your empathy to be as rudimentary as the youngsters' if it cannot embrace a fetus weeks earlier than a line of conjecture drawn at the 3rd trimester.\n\n Most of what I have read about the mind is that thoughts of any sort (emotion, analysis, etc.) are centered in the cerebral cortex, whose connections do not sufficiently develop until the beginning of the third trimester. Before that, there is no mind in any way that we recognize it. Therefore, until that time, all there is (where a embryo/fetus is concerned) is a developing body with \"nobody home\". I cannot have empathy with bodies - I have empathy with the suffering. emotions, experiences of a mind. \n \nYour position is based on how you wish others to treat you? How would it feel to be chemically burned to death or violently torn apart? Rudimentary indeed.\n\n Of course I would not like to be chemically burned to death or violently torn apart. Why? Because I would suffer, feel the emotions of fear and loss, etc. A fetus prior to gaining mental existence is incapable of suffering, having any emotions, etc. - it is JUST A BODY with NOBODY HOME. The empathy/sympathy that you feel towards that embryo is just based on your IMAGINATION of that embryo suffering. I base my morality on reality.\n \nI have read that a fetus has brain waves at 40 days. It experiences REM sleep (when we have dreams) at 17 weeks. It often responds to sounds and the mother's voice in the womb. So how do you know when a mental existence begins? If you are wrong, is it worth millions dying?\n\n Here are a couple of links which describe the neurological view of a mind not existing before the third trimester:\n \n Part 4 of http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml \n \n http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=21&id=162\n \n If you have links describing REM sleep in embryos, please provide them. My guess would be that you misinterpreted and that the REM sleep was measured in late term fetuses, not early term embryos.\n \n2 year olds definitely have a mental existence. My doubt is that they can feel true empathy at that point. They most often mimic what an adult does without having a true idea of what they are doing. So if they pat their sad friend or family on the back when they are crying it is because they model what others do or someone told them to do it.

So if empathy is your criterion then I think you must move your line of protection of life back quite a bit and many will be victims of your line of reasoning.\n\n You are missing the point. I am not saying that I think 2 year olds deserve rights because THEY can feel empathy. I am saying that *I* feel empathy toward the two year olds, just as I can feel empathy toward any mentally existing being that can suffer, feel emotions, etc. It is largely MY empathy that drives me to treat others better - that coupled with the expectation that I would be treated better if I were in their situation as well. You are simply misunderstanding my views. \n \n [Note: I was away on a business trip - thus the delay in my response.]",
