In fact, Lincoln was more than willing to legalize the insitutition of slavery forever and help the South preserve its continuation with a new fugitive slave law. Lincoln inherited a fortune from his own wife's slave owning family from Kentucky. Did he repudiate that? Of course not, for as a trial lawyer he even defended a slave owner before the Illinois Supreme Court. I would also like to point out that blacks could not even reside within the State of Illinois, it was illegal under the Illiniois State Constitution, a measure which Lincoln was himself quite proud of. Lincoln however did consider it to be a good idea to preserve the Western states as the \"exclusive preserve of the white race\" which according to him was \"superior\" for white labour. Lincoln also considered deporting blacks to Africa, and he in fact did help colonize many blacks there, the descendents of whom went on to enslave the native African population for decades.\n \n \nbut lincoln did want to prevent the EXPANSION of slavery into the territories. that is what the main difference was.\n\n \n Lincoln did not want to contaminate the territories with the obvious inferiority of the black race, which he considered to be fit for deportation from American soil. Lincoln wished to keep the Western states the exclusive preserve of the white race, for white labour. In other words, Lincoln was appealing to the Republican Labour constituancy, a self interested political manauever by an Illinois trial lawyer.\n \n Sure. I will post it below\n \n \nwhat me and american implied in the history debate was that slavery was not the \"cause\" of the war, but it was the main \"factor\" of the war.\n\n \n I disagree entirely. That is absolutely ridiculous for a number of reasons.\n \n A. Slavery was in decline anyway due to capital intensive agriculture, especially in the Upper South which did not originally join the Confederacy.\n \n B. Lincoln was more than willing to accomodate Southern Slavery as I will detail below.\n \n C. Lincoln was not willing to negotiate with regards to his tarriff and neither was the South. It was the tarriff dispute which had been brewing for decades which caused the war, not any moralistic propaganda canard over slavery.\n \n D. Slavery did not even become an issue until well into the war, and thus it is rather ridiculous to suggest that slavery caused the war.\n \n E. The vast majority of Southerners did not own slaves in the first place.\n \n The South seceded from the United States because of Lincoln's plan to massively increase tarriffs on imports, at the expense of the South. South Carolina had threatened to secede years earlier for this specific reason. The South fired on Fort Sumter because Lincoln unconstitutionally and unilaterally blockaded Southern ports, an act of aggression, to collect his tarriff revenue and to protect Northern commerce. This led to Lincoln's call to raise troops, which led to the secession of the Upper South where slavery was in massive decline. The invasion of the South by the North is what prompted Southerners to fight the bloodiest war in American history. Southerners believed they were fighting for independence, which was precisely the case, and not to preserve an institution the vast majority of them had nothing whatsoever to do with. The War Between the States was a culimination of a broad conflict between the North and the South, a conflict which came close to flaring up again in the 1960s, over state's rights, again almost a century after slavery had been abolished. There are vast differences between the North and the South. These differences have little to do with slavery, have always existed, exist now and will in all likelihood continue to exist indefinitely.\n \n \nthere is a huge difference. if slavery had never existed, there never would have been a civil war\n\n \n That is false. The North and the South have found DOZENS of issues to bitterly disagree over since slavery has been abolished, and indeed before slavery was even a source of contention in the United States. There are broad CULTURAL differences between the North and the South that have always existed, that go back centuries to the British Isles. These differences persist to this day. The Union in the very first place was only a practical agreement. I have pointed out that Lincoln was more than willing to accomodate slavery, that Lincoln ran on a platform of preserving slave with a new fugitive slave law, and that Lincoln was willing to preserve slavery forever with a new constitutional amendment to collect his tarriff. The War Between the States was an economic dispute, as has been true of most other American wars. The South seceded from the United States for many reasons and fought for its independence for the same reasons, first and foremost because the two areas are entirely culturally alien to one another and because the economic dispute over the tarriff is what sparked it off.",

   "Politically Correct History\n \n by Thomas J. DiLorenzo\n \n \n http://www.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo37.html\n \n The political left in America has apparently decided that American history must be rewritten so that it can be used in the political campaign for reparations for slavery. Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr., of Chicago inserted language in a Department of Interior appropriations bill for 2000 that instructed the National Park Service to propagandize about slavery as the sole cause of the war at all Civil War park sites. The Marxist historian Eric Foner has joined forces with Jackson and will assist the National Park Service in its efforts at rewriting history so that it better serves the political agenda of the far left. Congressman Jackson has candidly described this whole effort as \"a down payment on reparations.\" (Foner ought to be quite familiar with the \"art\" of rewriting politically-correct history. He was the chairman of the committee at Columbia University that awarded the \"prestigious\" Bancroft Prize in history to Emory University's Michael A. Bellesiles, author of the anti-Second Amendment book, \"Arming America,\" that turned out to be fraudulent. Bellesiles was forced to resign from Emory and his publisher has ceased publishing the book.)\n \n In order to accommodate the political agenda of the far left, the National Park Service will be required in effect to teach visitors to the national parks that Abraham Lincoln was a liar. Neither Lincoln nor the US Congress at the time ever said that slavery was a cause - let alone the sole cause - of their invasion of the Southern states in 1861. Both Lincoln and the Congress made it perfectly clear to the whole world that they would do all they could to protect Southern slavery as long as the secession movement could be defeated.\n ?\n On March 2, 1861, the U.S. Senate passed a proposed Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution (which passed the House of Representatives on February 28) that would have prohibited the federal government from ever interfering with slavery in the Southern states. (See U.S. House of Representatives, 106th Congress, 2nd Session, \"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0160063868/lewrockwell/\", Document No. 106-214, presented by Congressman Henry Hyde (Washington, D.C. U.S. Government Printing Office, January 31, 2000). The proposed amendment read as follows:\n \n \nARTICLE THIRTEEN\n No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or give to Congress the power to abolish or interfere, within any State, with the domestic institutions thereof, including that of persons held to labor or service by the laws of said State.\n\n Two days later, in his First Inaugural Address, Abraham Lincoln promised to support the amendment even though he believed that the Constitution already prohibited the federal government from interfering with Southern slavery. As he stated:\n \n \nI understand a proposed amendment to the Constitution . . . has passed Congress, to the effect that the Federal Government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the States, including that of persons held to service. To avoid misconstruction of what I have said, I depart from my purpose, not to speak of particular amendments, so far as to saythat, holding such a provision to now be implied constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable (emphasis added). \n\n \n This of course was consistent with one of the opening statements of the First Inaugural, where Lincoln quoted himself as saying: \"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\"\n \n That's what Lincoln said his invasion of the Southern states was not about. In an August 22, 1862, letter to New York Tribuneeditor Horace Greeley he explained to the world what the war was about<b></b>:\n \n \nMy paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and it is not either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union.\n\n \n Of course, many Americans at the time, North and South, believed that a military invasion of the Southern states would destroy the union by destroying its voluntary nature. To Lincoln, \"saving the Union\" meant destroying the secession movement and with it the Jeffersonian political tradition of states' rights as a check on the tyrannical proclivities of the central government. His war might have \"saved\" the union geographically, but it destroyed it philosophically as the country became a consolidated empire as opposed to a constitutional republic of sovereign states.\n \n On July 22, 1861, the US Congress issued a \"Joint Resolution on the War\" that echoed Lincoln's reasons for the invasion of the Southern states:\n \n \nResolved: . . . That this war is not being prosecuted upon our part in any spirit of oppression, nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions of those states, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and all laws made in pursuance thereof and to preserve the Union, with all the dignity, equality and rights of the several states unimpaired; and that as soon as these objects are accomplished the war ought to cease. \n\n By \"the established institutions of those states\" the Congress was referring to slavery. As with Lincoln, destroying the secession movement took precedence over doing anything about slavery. \n \n On March 2, 1861 - the same day the \"first Thirteenth Amendment\" passed the U.S. Senate - another constitutional amendment was proposed that would have outlawed secession (See H. Newcomb Morse, \"The Foundations and Meaning of Secession,\" Stetson Law Review, vol. 15, 1986, pp. 419-36). This is very telling, for it proves that Congress believed that secession was in fact constitutional under the Tenth Amendment. It would not have proposed an amendment outlawing secession if the Constitution already prohibited it. \n \n Nor would the Republican Party, which enjoyed a political monopoly after the war, have insisted that the Southern states rewrite their state constitutions to outlaw secession as a condition of being readmitted to the Union. If secession was really unconstitutional there would have been no need to do so. \n ?\n These facts will never be presented by the National Park Service or by the Lincoln cultists at the Claremont Institute, the Declaration Foundation, and elsewhere. This latter group consists of people who have spent their careers spreading lies about Lincoln and his war in order to support the political agenda of the Republican Party. They are not about to let the truth stand in their way and are hard at work producing \"educational\" materials that are filled with false but politically correct history.",

   "[quote]This afternoon the President of the United States gave audience to a Committee of colored men at the White House. They were introduced by the Rev. J. Mitchell, Commissioner of Emigration. E. M. Thomas, the Chairman, remarked that they were there by invitation to hear what the Executive had to say to them. Having all been seated, the President, after a few preliminary observations, informed them that a sum of money had been appropriated by Congress, and placed at his disposition for the purpose of aiding the colonization in some country of the people, or a portion of them, of African descent, thereby making it his duty, as it had for a long time been his inclination, to favor that cause; and why, he asked, should the people of your race be colonized, and where? Why should they leave this country? This is, perhaps, the first question for proper consideration. You and we are different races. We have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races. Whether it is right or wrong I need not discuss, but this physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both, as I think your race suffer very greatly, many of them by living among us, while ours suffer from your presence. In a word we suffer on each side. If this is admitted, it affords a reason at least why we should be separated. You here are freemen I suppose.\n \n A Voice: Yes, sir.\n \n The President---Perhaps you have long been free, or all your lives. Your race are suffering, in my judgment, the greatest wrong inflicted on any people. But even when you cease to be slaves, you are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race. You are cut off from many of the advantages which the other race enjoy. The aspiration of men is to enjoy equality with the best when free, but on this broad continent, not a single man of your race is made the equal of a single man of ours. Go where you are treated the best, and the ban is still upon you.\n \n I do not propose to discuss this, but to present it as a fact with which we have to deal. I cannot alter it if I would. It is a fact, about which we all think and feel alike, I and you. We look to our condition, owing to the existence of the two races on this continent. I need not recount to you the effects upon white men, growing out of the institution of Slavery. I believe in its general evil effects on the white race. See our present condition---the country engaged in war!---our white men cutting one another's throats, none knowing how far it will extend; and then consider what we know to be the truth. But for your race among us there could not be war, although many men engaged on either side do not care for you one way or the other. Nevertheless, I repeat, without the institution of Slavery and the colored race as a basis, the war could not have an existence.\n \n It is better for us both, therefore, to be separated. I know that there are free men among you, who even if they could better their condition are not as much inclined to go out of the country as those, who being slaves could obtain their freedom on this condition. I suppose one of the principal difficulties in the way of colonization is that the free colored man cannot see that his comfort would be advanced by it. You may believe you can live in Washington or elsewhere in the United States the remainder of your life, perhaps more so than you can in any foreign country, and hence you may come to the conclusion that you have nothing to do with the idea of going to a foreign country. This is (I speak in no unkind sense) an extremely selfish view of the case.\n \n But you ought to do something to help those who are not so fortunate as yourselves. There is an unwillingness on the part of our people, harsh as it may be, for you free colored people to remain with us. Now, if you could give a start to white people, you would open a wide door for many to be made free. If we deal with those who are not free at the beginning, and whose intellects are clouded by Slavery, we have very poor materials to start with. If intelligent colored men, such as are before me, would move in this matter, much might be accomplished. It is exceedingly important that we have men at the beginning capable of thinking as white men, and not those who have been systematically oppressed.\n \n There is much to encourage you. For the sake of your race you should sacrifice something of your present comfort for the purpose of being as grand in that respect as the white people. It is a cheering thought throughout life that something can be done to ameliorate the condition of those who have been subject to the hard usage of the world. It is difficult to make a man miserable while he feels he is worthy of himself, and claims kindred to the great God who made him. In the American Revolutionary war sacrifices were made by men engaged in it; but they were cheered by the future. Gen. Washington himself endured greater physical hardships than if he had remained a British subject. Yet he was a happy man, because he was engaged in benefiting his race---something for the children of his neighbors, having none of his own.\n \n The colony of Liberia has been in existence a long time. In a certain sense it is a success. The old President of Liberia, Roberts, has just been with me---the first time I ever saw him. He says they have within the bounds of that colony between 300,000 and 400,000 people, or more than in some of our old States, such as Rhode Island or Delaware, or in some of our newer States, and less than in some of our larger ones. They are not all American colonists, or their descendants. Something less than 12,000 have been sent thither from this country. Many of the original settlers have died, yet, like people elsewhere, their offspring outnumber those deceased.\n \n The question is if the colored people are persuaded to go anywhere, why not there? One reason for an unwillingness to do so is that some of you would rather remain within reach of the country of your nativity. I do not know how much attachment you may have toward our race. It does not strike me that you have the greatest reason to love them. But still you are attached to them at all events.\n \n The place I am thinking about having for a colony is in Central America. It is nearer to us than Liberia---not much more than one-fourth as far as Liberia, and within seven days'--- run by steamers. Unlike Liberia it is on a great line of travel---it is a highway. The country is a very excellent one for any people, and with great natural resources and advantages, and especially because of the similarity of climate with your native land---thus being suited to your physical condition.\n \n The particular place I have in view is to be a great highway from the Atlantic or Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean, and this particular place has all the advantages for a colony. On both sides there are harbors among the finest in the world. \n Again, there is evidence of very rich coal mines. A certain amount of coal is valuable in any country, and there may be more than enough for the wants of the country. Why I attach so much importance to coal is, it will afford an opportunity to the inhabitants for immediate employment till they get ready to settle permanently in their homes.\n \n If you take colonists where there is no good landing, there is a bad show; and so where there is nothing to cultivate, and of which to make a farm. But if something is started so that you can get your daily bread as soon as you reach there, it is a great advantage. Coal land is the best thing I know of with which to commence an enterprise.\n \n To return, you have been talked to upon this subject, and told that a speculation is intended by gentlemen, who have an interest in the country, including the coal mines. We have been mistaken all our lives if we do not know whites as well as blacks look to their self-interest. Unless among those deficient of intellect everybody you trade with makes something. You meet with these things here as elsewhere.\n \n If such persons have what will be an advantage to them, the question is whether it cannot be made of advantage to you. You are intelligent, and know that success does not as much depend on external help as on self-reliance. Much, therefore, depends upon yourselves. As to the coal mines, I think I see the means available for your self reliance.\n \n I shall, if I get a sufficient number of you engaged, have provisions made that you shall not be wronged. If you will engage in the enterprise I will spend some of the money intrusted to me. I am not sure you will succeed. The Government may lose the money, but we cannot succeed unless we try; but we think, with care, we can succeed.\n \n continued below\n \n [...]\n \n [quote]",

   "The Civil War was origonally fought for states right by the south. Slavery was very controversial but did not become a primary goal until Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclomation, issuing all slaves their freedom. \n Afterwards it became even more of a struggle for and against slavery. \n The confederate flag represents the south and its struggle and the people who died for it. \n \n Looking into technecalities, the southern struggle by the end of the war was to keep slavery and defend their homeland.\n The norths struggle was to end it and to re-unite the Union\n The symbol of the Souths struggle became the Confederate flag. \n \n There are alot of people who fly the flag not because they are racist, and not because they support slavery, but because they are honoring the souths fallen heroes. \n \n But of course it has also come to attention that the flag is also flown alot for racism, and support of slavery. \n \n The confederate flag offends alot of people. Most of the offended people are African American. Althought their are alot of northeners who also do not like the flag. There are also people living in the south who disagree with flying it. \n \n I will now attempt to compare the confederate flag with the swastika.\n As you should know the swastika was a symbol used by Nazi's during WW2. It represented the Nazi party, and their ideas. The actions they took against people that were not like them, resulted in the worst genocide of all of human history. The Holocaust. Their are still alot of Nazi's out their who wish the same thing to happen again and to \"finish the job\". \n \n *Anyone who supports and advocates the Nazi party I will not speak with on this debate.*\n \n The Germans are ashamed of their history because they know what acts their relatives, and alot of deceased parents, grandparents, etc did was horrible, \"evil\" and wrong. \n Their is no swastika flown on Germany's capital, and I would be HIGHLY suprised to find it on any building, or for anyone to wear or shirt like that in any part of Germany without being condemned.\n \n The swastika reprents those horrible acts and ideas about how the world should be run. Those ideas I have accepted already as wrong. \n \n Of course the events of the Holocaust are far more drastic than that of slavery. But for some reason a symbol flys more frequently for one and is more accepted and more controversial than the other.\n \n I wouldn't like to make all southeners who fought in the revolutionary war to sound horrible, because I am related to some of them. My goal is to show that both the Germans and Confederates fought for something that was wrong.\n \n Therefor why should they be honored as heroes?\n \n Thank you for reading this\n \n If you would like to talk through faster communication:\n Email: SilentPoet326@hotmail.com\n AOL Screen Name: SilentPoet326\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

   "I find it completely ok if people fly the flag. They can fly it all over their homes, and wear the shirts to public places. The problem I have is when the SC state house flies it on their grounds. Having a monument specifically dedicated to the fallen soldiers is ok. Although I still can compare it to giving a monument to fallen Nazi soldiers, which I think most people can find wrong. Doing that honors them, what they fought for, and dishonors the people they killed. In this case its the people they enslaved. \n \n \n I am currently living in a southern state, and although I did not grow up in a extreme southern enviorment I am aware of the cultural diffrence between the south and the north. \n \n To say that the flags main or sole purpose is to just say hey looks we are a diffrent culture or have a diffrent lifestyle down here seems a bit absurd.

You also seem to misunderstand the analogy. No one says Nazism and American slavery are at an equal (or similar) level of reprehensibility. The analogy is formal: the two logical arguments are exactly equivalent:\n \n YOU: CF was not on slave ships, THEREFORE CF does not symbolize racism.\n \n ME: swastika was not on slave ships, THEREFORE swastika does not symbolize racism.\n \n Note that you can also substitute \"olive branch\" for \"CF\" or \"swastika\" and have the analogous argument. In that case the conclusion would happen to be true, but that is just incidental: in the \"swastika\" example the argument leads to a patently false conclusion. This shows that your argument itself is worthless.\n \n \nSecond, sorry no I don't have any pictures of american flags flying over slave ships but it did happen, how do you think they got here?\n \n \n Very few slaves were imported after the USA was formed.

The answer then is the Spanish and Potugese, when they needed more labor in their new colonies. Again, this is irrelevant for the issue.",

With each slave that was brought over, one less job was available for the free people. Thus, this made their labor decrease in value because there was now a greater demand for jobs.\n\n \n This is a very weak argument. First, there were no slaves brought over at least since 1807, and in some states well before that. Second, freeing the existing slaves would not make any more jobs available, and they would start competing with whites for many jobs that were reserved for whites before. It was thus in the best economic interest of poor Southern whites that no slaves be freed. Third, even if you were right on the economic issue (which you are not), you underestimate the patriotic sentiments. People do in fact fight with all their hearts for their countries whose systems/regimes impoverish them. The Kambodians fought against the Vietnam invasion even though the Khmer Rouge regime was objectively the far greater evil; the Iranians fought fanatically in the Iraq-Iran war; the North Koreans would do the same if a conflict with South Korea broke out. And these are infinitely more drastic examples than anything suffered by poor white Southerners.\n \n \nWhat were the Confederates fighting for? It wasn't racism. It wasn't slavery. It was state's rights. \n\n \n There is no such thing as state rights. Individuals have rights, states have powers. But yes, they did fight for state powers against federal powers. But which powers specifically? Look better and you'll see that slavery was the key issue indeed.\n \n The source of the conflict was economic in nature. The emerging industrial, capital-intensive North was quickly gaining importance and the agricultural, labor-intensive South was losing it. his threatened the wealth and the power of the ruling class in the South and they wanted to limit interstate commerce to protect themselves. The North did not want to allow that (and interstate commerce was in the federal domain) and the war broke out essentially for that reason.\n \n You may say this has little to do with slavery, but the wealth and power of the Southern quasi-aristocracy was very much based on the profits they made on products of slave labor. As such profits would diminish, many of them would get less wealthy and less able to keep huge plantanions and many slaves. Even if they were allowed to keep slavery legal, the system would eventually collapse under economic pressures. And that would, as I explained before, hurt the poor Southerners in the labor market.

It was thus in the best economic interest of poor Southern whites that no slaves be freed.\n\n \n Without slavery, you would still have the same number of workers and the same number of jobs. By looking at the Jim Crow era that followed the freeing of slaves after the Civil War, I doubt that blacks would have been able to compete for jobs reserved for whites. If that were the case, then it probably would have increased job availablity for whites. Not only would whites have first access to the jobs they already had, but many plantantion owners, when forced to decide between choosing to pay a white person or a black person, would probably have chosen the white person.\n \n \nyou underestimate the patriotic sentiments.\n\n \n No, I don't. I believe that is exactly what they fought for. They had more of a pride in their state (SC, GA, MS, etc.) than they did for their country (USA). When forced to back one, they backed their state government.\n \n \n I would furthermore like to point out that it is correct that today the Confederate flag is misused as a hate symbol. However, the same organization that turned the Confederate flag into a hate symbol also uses the Christian cross as a hate symbol by burning it. I don't see a push to ban use of the Christian cross, so why do people push banning the Confederate flag.",

   "Without slavery, you would still have the same number of workers and the same number of jobs. \n\n \n Workers, yes. Jobs, not necessarily. It depends on how abolishing slavery would affect the economy. Since the economy of the South depended significantly on agricultural products of slave labor, abolition was almost certain to cause a recession and fewer jobs would be available. But my argument still holds even if the number of jobs remains the same.\n \n \nBy looking at the Jim Crow era that followed the freeing of slaves after the Civil War, I doubt that blacks would have been able to compete for jobs reserved for whites. \n\n \n Jim Crow laws were an unconstitutional attempt to reverse the liberation of slaves. Taking them as the given conditions reverses cause and effect. They were enacted precisely to prevent blacks from competing with whites - in all spheres, economic, political, etc. And if whites did not fear that competition, why would they have pushed for such laws?\n \n \nIf that were the case, then it probably would have increased job availablity for whites. Not only would whites have first access to the jobs they already had, but many plantantion owners, when forced to decide between choosing to pay a white person or a black person, would probably have chosen the white person.\n\n \n First, you must realize that plantation work is less desirable than, say, making shoes. Second, while plantation owners owned slaves, they paid nothing other than housing and food (usually below most free people's standards). Now they have to pay wages. Most blacks, used to poorer conditions, would be willing to work for less than most whites. Most plantation owners would choose cheaper labor. Whites would have to lower their wage expectations to compete. Owners would probably be willing to pay whites a little more than blacks, but that still would have been low. Third, consumers would also follow their prejudices only to a point where it becomes too expensive. So trained blacks, like cooks and blacksmiths, would be able to compete with whites by working cheaper. Again, most whites would lose economically.\n \n \nHowever, the same organization that turned the Confederate flag into a hate symbol also uses the Christian cross as a hate symbol by burning it. I don't see a push to ban use of the Christian cross, so why do people push banning the Confederate flag. \n\n \n 1. A cross and a burning cross are two completely different symbols. (You wouldn't say that a burning bush means the same as a bush, would you?)\n \n 2. You can forbid the use of a burning cross in some (many) circumstances.\n \n 3. A state may not use a cross on its official building anyway, so your analogy does not help your case.",

(In 1950 industry shipments were 97 million square yards.)\n \n \n The United States supplies approximately 45% of the world's carpet.\n \n \n Most carpet today -- 90% -- is tufted, the process that grew out of the chenille bedspread industry. \n The Impact of the Carpet Industry in Georgia\n (Based on 2003 statistics)\n \n Eighty percent of the U. S. carpet market is supplied by mills located within a 65 mile radius of Dalton, Georgia (Whitfield, Gordon, Catoosa, Murray, and Bartow counties).\n \n \n The manufacturer in Georgia with the largest number of employees is a carpet manufacturer.\n \n \n The four largest carpet companies are headquartered in Georgia and 7 of the largest 14 carpet companies are headquartered in Georgia. \n \n http://www.carpet-rug.com/drill_down_2.cfm?page=10&sub=3&requesttimeout=350\n \n \n Speaking of slavery and civil rights: India itself is more a symbol of hatred and racism than the Confederate Flag will ever be!\n \n http://www.iabolish.com/today/features/india/carpet.htm\n \n Child Slavery in the Carpet Industry\n \n \n Effects \n \n Slavery cannot be dismissed as an isolated problem in remote villages; it is a global issue, which profoundly yet quietly affects our daily lives. Many goods produced with slave labor are exported directly to North America and Europe, and consumers often purchase these slave-made products while unaware of their tainted origins. In addition, although production of certain consumer goods may not explicitly use slave labor, they may still use slave-made components. As an example, Kevin Bales cites slave-produced charcoal that is essential to making steel in Brazil. Much of this steel then becomes car parts and other metal goods that make up a quarter of all of Brazil's exports.\n \n Among the more prominent slave-made goods from India are oriental carpets. In recent years, the carpet export industry has become one of India's largest - and is believed to \"employ\" more child slaves than any other industry. Between April of 1995 and March of 1996, Indian carpet exports earned $656 million, with the largest portion ($225 million) coming directly from the United States. In 1998, the majority of US carpet imports originated in India, with income for India amounting to approximately $282 million. Indeed, the carpet industry proves to be extremely valuable for the Indian economy, earning large amounts of foreign exchange and providing further entry into the global market.\n \n Trapping Children \n \n The extreme poverty of the harijans or untouchables (the lowest group in the traditional caste system) and the adivasis (the tribals or indigenous people) make them the most vulnerable groups for exploitation. 80% to 90% of all bonded laborers in India are harijans and adivasis. The absolute levels of poverty and the lack of social welfare, education, or alternatives make it very easy for the loom owners to exploit these groups. Within these groups, children are probably the most exploited. One justification for child labor in the carpet industry is the predominant \"myth of nimble fingers, which claims that the small fingers of children are more productive than those of adults. (Nevertheless, the quality carpets that can be sold at the highest prices are often those made by adults.)",
