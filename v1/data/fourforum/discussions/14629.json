   "there are many examples of poor design/exactly what we would expect if evolution were true, so i thought it would be fun to compile them into one thread. i'll start.\n \n ive heard Richard Dawkins say that the flounder fish is an example of poor design:\n http://purpose1charters.com/images/Flounder.jpg\n the flounder is born just like a normal fish, but throughout the course of it's lifetime will begin to swim horizontally and on the sea floor. one eye will migrate to the other side of the head through metamorphosis, thus creating this ugly creature who cant see properly, swim properly, or eat properly (because it's mouth is vertical). its very survival relies almost entirely on excellent camoflage. the so-called designer did not do a very good job designing the flounder, however this is exactly what we would expect this fish to do under the pretenses of evolution.\n \n the eye has been described as being of poor design:\n http://ohiovalleyeye.com/images/eye_G02_anatomy_label_600.jpg\n the optic nerve cuts directly through the retina, creating a blind spot. again, this is exactly what would happen if evolution were true, but a being designing the eye with such an obvious flaw is ridiculous.\n \n the human jaw:\n http://www.sunsetteethwhitening.co.uk/images/clip_image019.jpg\n unfortunately for a lot of us, our jaws are not accomodated to fit such a large number of teeth, thus we need to get some pulled out. if you were designing the human jaw, would you be trying to jam as many teeth as possible into it? maybe as a bet? our jaws have actually gotten smaller from that of our ancestors, but our teeth count remained the same, which in evolutionary terms makes complete sense.\n \n mudskipper:\n http://www.bountyfishing.com/blog/images/mudskipper.jpg\n my all time favorite example of evolution - the currently living perfect intermediate species. why isnt the mudskipper talked about more often? you couldnt possibly ask for a better intermediate species between fish and amphibians, and yet it is alive today! anyways, the mudskipper is a fish that has to have a bubble of air in their gills to help them breathe underwater, and can only breathe above water if its moist. so here is a designer designing a fish that has difficulty breathing in the water and difficulty breathing out of the water, yet in its current evolutionary stage, it makes perfect sense.\n \n if this so-called designer were an architect, all of his buildings would fall down.",

   "Another one:\n \n Rabbits have to eat their food twice to extract the nutrients from it. It ferments in their butt and then they eat it again. We know there are better ways of doing this that nature has found, so why eat your own excrement?\n \n Taken from other sources:\n \n http://www.haitiwebs.com/archive/index.php/t-43898.html\n \n The erector pili are smooth muscle fibers that give humans \"goose bumps.\" If the erector pili are activated, the hairs that come out of the nearby follicles stand up and give an animal a larger appearance that might scare off potential enemies and a coat that is thicker and warmer. Humans, though, don't have thick furs like their ancestors did, and our strategy for several thousand years has been to take the fur off other warm looking animals to stay warm. It's ironic actually that an animal, sensing danger is near, would puff up its coat to look scarier, but the human hunter would see the puffier coat as a warm prize, leaving the thinner haired weaker looking animals alone. Of course, some body hair is helpful to humans; eye brows can keep sweat out of the eyes and facial hair might influence a woman's choice of sexual partner. All the rest of that hair, though, is essentially useless. \n \n he Human Tailbone (Coccyx)\n These fused vertebrae are the only vestiges that are left of the tail that other mammals still use for balance, communication, and in some primates, as a prehensile limb. As our ancestors were learning to walk upright, their tail became useless, and it slowly disappeared. It has been suggested that the coccyx helps to anchor minor muscles and may support pelvic organs. However, there have been many well documented medical cases where the tailbone has been surgically removed with little or no adverse effects. There have been documented cases of infants born with tails, an extended version of the tailbone that is composed of extra vertebrae. There are no adverse health effects of such a tail, unless perhaps the child was born in the Dark Ages. In that case, the child and the mother, now considered witches, would've been killed instantly. \n \n The Blind Fish Astyanax Mexicanus\n In an experiment designed by nature, the species of fish known as Astyanax mexicanus, dwelling in caves deep underground off the coast of Mexico, cannot see. The pale fish has eyes, but as it is developing in the egg, the eyes begin to degenerate, and the fish is born with a collapsed remnant of an eye covered by flap of skin. These vestigial eyes probably formed after hundreds or even thousands of years of living in total darkness. As for the experiment, a control is needed; and luckily for us, fish of the same species live right above, near the surface, where there is plenty of light, and these fish have fully functioning eyes. To test if the eyes of the blind mexicanus could function if given the right environment, scientists removed the lens from the eye of the surface-dwelling fish and implanted it into the eye of the blind fish. It was observed that within eight days an eye started to develop beneath the skin, and after two months the fish had developed a large functioning eye with a pupil, cornea, and iris. The fish were blind, but now they see. \n \n The Sexual Organs of Dandelions\n Dandelions, like all flowers, have the proper organs (stamen and pistil) necessary for sexual reproduction, but do not use them. Dandelions reproduce without fertilization; they basically clone themselves, and they are quite successful at it. Look at any lawn for the proof. If dandelions were to revert to sexual reproduction, they might not retain whatever traits they have that allow them to be pests to gardeners everywhere. If flowers can begin reproducing in this manner, does that mean animals, even humans could too? Asexual reproduction can be a good strategy in an environment that is constant if a species is well suited to those conditions. It doesn't take a scientist to figure out that humans wouldn't last long if the condition set forth was no sexual contact with others. Therefore, the human sexual organs are probably in no danger of becoming vestigial. \n \n Fake Sex in Virgin Whiptail Lizards (Vestigial Behavior)\n Only females exist in several species of the lizards of the genus Cnemidophorus, which might seem like a problem when it comes time to propagate the species. The females don't need the males though, they reproduce by parthenogenesis, a form of reproduction in which an unfertilized egg develops into a new individual. So basically, the females don't need the males; they just produce clones of themselves as a form of reproduction. Despite the fact that it is unnecessary and futile to attempt copulation with each other, the lizards still like to try, and occasionally one of the females will start to \"act like a male\" by attempting to copulate with another female. The lizards evolved from a sexual species and the behavior to copulate like a male -- to engage in fake sex -- is a vestigial behavior; that is, a behavior present in a species, but is expressed in an imperfect form, which in this case, is useless.

   "nice one, DB.\n \n human head proportion:\n \n our heads are enormous compared to our bodies, especially in babies. it is the part of our body with the most mass per size. this means its really easy for us to fall over and hurt ourselves; babies and old people are prone to this. anyone with basic understanding of physics will tell you that when something tall has a heavy thing on top, it's likely to topple over. why not put the big, heavy bit at the bottom? why the very top? also, coincidentally, the big heavy bit at the top is also the most important bit. it would be quite easy for us to fall and smash our heads and be killed - all because of poor design. either that or evolution, which is a far better explanation.\n \n posture:\n \n do you have back pain? i do. the reason we get back pain is because we stand upright. quadroped animals dont get back pain like we do, because their spines are horizonal. how is back pain caused? mostly, people dont have their head and shoulders placed in the right spot to avoid it. a slight mis-positioning of these structures could cause life-long pain. our shoulders sag forwards along with our heads. maybe our designer didnt have a ruler.\n \n lets talk about boobs. boobs are another example of poor proportions which cause problems with posture and back pain. why are boobs at the top of the torso? this causes a) more mass higher up on the tall structure and b) stress on the spine causing lower back problems with girls that have bigger boobs. this is another feature, along with the head and shoulders, that could be mis-positioned, so sadly to say, girls get it worse. also, as a girl becomes adapted to her awkwardly proportioned head and shoulders, shes suddenly attacked with globes of altered sweat glands filled with fatty tissue on the front of her chest during puberty. she has to adapt all over again.",
