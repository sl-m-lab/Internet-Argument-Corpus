   "Okay, this idea isn't original with me (although I did write this, from here)\n Here's a video presentation that I created: Part 1, Part 2\n \n ----------\n \n Let's pretend for a second that you are part of Joshua's army. You might want to reread the book of Joshua to get a better glimpse of what that would be like. In any event, you live in the time of miracles. Your people are the chosen people of God. God has continually worked his will to help and harm your people. You grew up with stories of God flooding the earth, while sparing Noah, and stories of God helping Moses get his people away from the Pharaoh.\n \n God has even helped your commander-Joshua-with his conquests of the ancient world (or through your eyes-the present).\n \n In the midst of one of these conquests, you are standing with Joshua and his army. They have just defeated the male warriors of the Amorites and started to destroy their town. They are mercilessly slaughtering the remaining villagers, the women and children. Some of the Amorites are still resisting, but most are begging for their life. All of Amorites are terrified at the unwelcomed and impossible to stop prospect to come. Joshua, as ordered by God, shows no mercy to any of them. He kills husband, wife, brother and sister all in the name of God. The Amorite villagers plead and cry with Joshua, to spare their lives. They beg for the life of their children, all to no avail.\n \n So finally Joshua comes to you, drenched in blood, and he hands you his sword. He points to a remaining Amorite child. A three year old, who has just witnessed the butchering of his father, his brothers and sisters. He's watched through tears as Joshua dismembered his relatives. He cries while he watches you walk over to him, with Joshua's sword still drenched in blood. His eyes shift to his mother, who is still alive for the moment. She can not help him, although she's begging for his life. Save him and take her life, she pleads. The child is pleading with you as well and begging with you for his life. His face is twisted in horror. He is crying and begging you not to kill him.\n \n So what do you do?\n \n Do you:\n \n 1. Refuse to kill the child and stop Joshua from killing the child? Will you risk your life for the three year old?\n \n 2. Summon the faith and courage to hack the child to death. Either quickly or slowly, depending on how much vengeance you feel God needs satisfied.\n \n 3. Refuse to kill the child and let either Joshua or another soldier do it.\n \n 4. Refuse to believe that Joshua speaks for God-be prepared to have enough courage to sacrifice yourself to stop Joshua.\n \n Would you kill this child that's begging, crying, and pleading with you? Yes or no?\n \n I would say no.\n \n That's the Joshua Challenge.",

   "Will you promise me that if god tells you to do something you will talk to a doctor about it before you do it?\n\n The difficulty is that, if god does tell you to do something (not just you, Archie), you first have to decide whether it truly is god or something else (a delusion, the devil, a whim etc etc). In order to decide, you might wonder if god would ask you to do such a thing. If it's a good thing, it doesn't really matter. Though your sanity may be in question, to madly do good things is not too bad a thing. However, if you are asked to do a bad thing, you would probably have to rely on your own set of moral values to decide.\n \n This point of using your own moral judgement to decide whether you should obey what you think might be god's commands brings us back to the old question as to whether man was produced in god's image, or, as is far more likely, each man/woman/child produces their own personal little god in their own image. This would explain why so many people seem to think that god is on their side regardless of what they are doing (giving away money; driving at 20mph in a 30mph zone; killing prostitutes, mexicans or muslims etc etc etc).\n \n Now we might go back to the original question and further ask whether Joshua was truly told by god to go off and murder a whole bunch of people, or was it a delusion, a deception by the devil, or perhaps just a great big lie from a power-mad blood-thirsty maniac.\n \n So, we mere mortals, finite beings that we are, when it truly comes down to it, have to rely on our own moral values to judge whether something is right or wrong. Even if ordered by god to do something, we have to rely on our own judgement before going on some mad spree that may just be the result of a chemical imbalance in our limbic system or prefrontal cortex.",

But His dealings with Humanity since Jesus died on the Cross is based on Grace rather than the Law.\n \n Don't be fooled though because God will not be mocked. He is still a God of justice and will judge us all according to our works and deeds. And let me say this also, God has protected Israel since their return to their homeland in 47. But He has had no faithful Jews whom He has spoken to or through like the OT Patriarchs and Prophets. And neither does He command christians to kill in His name and that is evidenced by the fact that we don't have hoards of Fundamentalist evangelical Christians out there hunting and killing atheists. \n \n This is what is so diabolical and insane about your sides arguments. You have no evidence of anything like you are suggesting in real time in the modern world yet you make the argument none the less. Oh yeah, you and penfold will point to insane lunatic killers and hold them up as evidence even though they don't claim to be committed christians at all, only that God told em to do it. So in your sick mind, that means that Archangel is awaiting his marching orders to go kill people. \n \n Here is my original response to this threads OP, and I stand by it as Gods reasoning at that time. If that answer doesn't satisfy you atheists, then tough!!! For me to have allowed you to make this OT query about modern day christians is my fault because I can never imagine the depths to which you will sink. If you want more info than this then take it to God Himself. If you ask Him sincerely without that sanctimonious condescension, He will answer you.\n Interesting that Archangel hasn't responded.

So that if it was written in the bible it happened in history?\n\n \n ABSOLUTELY, YES!!!\n \n I will say one more thing in defense of this post. No where did I say that I endorsed or supported the genocide which took place at that time.

   "\n You think that your feigning of condescension and insincere concern for me is even the least bit convincing accipiter? My answer to you is if you had even a marginal clue as to who God really is in a personal way as I do, you would humble yourself before him in the complete knowledge and confidence that He would never ask you to anything but to love and forgive your fellow man as I forgive you for the disrespect you show the living God in your disbelief, and for the ignorance you have shown by judging Him as if He was just a fallen Man.\n\n \n \n Anthony321\n I think you have the market cornered on \"condesension.\" A fallen man would hopefully be locked up for acting in the same manner as your all loving God. Evil is not magically transformed into goodness just because God does it. It becomes even more deplorable when such actions are spawned from a being who is suppossedly the pinnacle of morality. Deciding that it is okay for the \"big boss\" to break the rules to which the little people must adhere is called brown nosing.\n \n \n Archangel\n judging Him as if He was just a fallen Man.[/QUOTE]\n \n \n \n Anthony321\n Oh how common and unholy is the fallen man. \"Just a fallen man\" shows your disdain and contempt for what you believe we actually are. I thought that we were all unique souls that God took time and great pains in creating. Special beings that he loves unconditionally, and that he created for the sole purpose of playing a part in his divine plan. How can this same community of patented original souls be reduced to just a group of fallen men? Perhaps the fallen men are the result of a fallen God.",

   "Yeah smiley, that's it! It's a complete waste of time discussing this with you because you and your cohorts have absolutely no spiritual or scriptural insight at all. You say my argument is pathetic but it isn't even my argument. All I am telling you is what the bible says in the NT throughout its over all message. \n \n You are ignorantly applying the OT actions to the NT now by claiming that the standard we are being held to by God in this Age of Grace is what it was during Joshua's time during the Age of the Law. Now I'm not saying that Gods moral principles or standards have changed at all. He is the same yesterday, today and forever. But His dealings with Humanity since Jesus died on the Cross is based on Grace rather than the Law.\n \n Don't be fooled though because God will not be mocked. He is still a God of justice and will judge us all according to our works and deeds. And let me say this also, God has protected Israel since their return to their homeland in 47. But He has had no faithful Jews whom He has spoken to or through like the OT Patriarchs and Prophets. And neither does He command christians to kill in His name and that is evidenced by the fact that we don't have hoards of Fundamentalist evangelical Christians out there hunting and killing atheists. \n \n This is what is so diabolical and insane about your sides arguments. You have no evidence of anything like you are suggesting in real time in the modern world yet you make the argument none the less. Oh yeah, you and penfold will point to insane lunatic killers and hold them up as evidence even though they don't claim to be committed christians at all, only that God told em to do it. So in your sick mind, that means that Archangel is awaiting his marching orders to go kill people. \n \n Here is my original response to this threads OP, and I stand by it as Gods reasoning at that time. If that answer doesn't satisfy you atheists, then tough!!! For me to have allowed you to make this OT query about modern day christians is my fault because I can never imagine the depths to which you will sink. If you want more info than this then take it to God Himself. If you ask Him sincerely without that sanctimonious condescension, He will answer you.\n \n \n If one understood historical and scriptural context, Gods command makes perfect sense. And I have no problem defending Gods command. Here's why:\n (Deuteronomy 2:33-34) - \"And the Lord our God delivered him over to us; and we defeated him with his sons and all his people. 34So we captured all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, women and children of every city. We left no survivor.\"\n \n The command by God to kill all inside a city is seen by many to be immoral and a demonstration that the Bible is not true. But, we must examine the issue in light of its context, its biblical context, not in light of present day, non-Christian assumptions. If we want to see if it is moral or not, we must know which morals are in question.\n \n First of all, the context of this verse is dealing with the wickedness of Amorite king Sihon of Hesbon, a city of the Amorites (Num. 21:25). They were a wicked people (Gen. 15:16; 2 Kings 21:11). When the Israelites wanted to pass through their land during their exodus from Egypt, the Amorites refused them safe passage and attacked the Israelites. However, they were soundly defeated by Israel (Num. 21:21-31). It is in this context that God delivered them over to the Israelites; that is, in the context of the battle.Why did the Israelites destroy cities and kill all of the people inside? | Christian Apologetics & Research Ministry\n \n \n \n Herod was just a man and he was killing all of the first born males in order to murder the Messiah of the Jews at birth. This not only made him evil but a direct enemy of God Himself. That you are blind to that obvious fact speaks volumes about your spiritual condition.\n \n \n \n ABSOLUTELY, YES!!!\n \n I will say one more thing in defense of this post. No where did I say that I endorsed or supported the genocide which took place at that time. Personally speaking, I can't even step on a bug at this stage of my life, So this feigning of concern that I am hearing voices that might tell me to go on a killing spree just makes my skin crawl. What I am defending and wont compromise on is that if my Heavenly Father told Joshua to wipe this people out then His reasons were righteous and justified and right. Even if it makes no sense from our human perspective.\n \n You can take that faith based endorsement any way you like, and you can surmise anything you like about me based on that support. I COULDN'T CARE LESS. But when all is said and done in this lifetime, you will finally understand how right I am and how wrong you are and have been in your opposition to the God who made you. The only way I can support my beliefs is with the bible which you reject as supernatural wisdom. So short of reaching out to God directly, it's not looking good for you to ever understand what I know to be true. Nuff said!\n\n So, you are saying that because there are no hoards of Fundamentalist evangelical Christians out there killing atheists, this is somehow proof that god hasn't asked even one individual to kill in his name.\n \n That is like saying that because the human race isn't on the edge of extinction due to road traffic accidents that means that no-one has ever died in a car crash.\n \n And what makes you think that god would be limited to asking christians to kill (or not, as you are claiming)? Does he have limited abilities when it comes to commanding people to do things?\n \n You also make the claim that a god who has ordered mass murder in the past, but is now not doing so, has not changed in any way. You are truly blind.\n \n I do accept that god will not be mocked, as it is not possible to mock something that does not exist.\n \n Then you go on to claim that 'my side' (whatever that means) has no evidence to back up our suggestions, yet it is you who made the ridiculous comment in the first place, claiming that you know what god would or wouldn't do, almost directly after saying that we mere finite beings have no understanding of the inner thoughts of this eternal god. But I guess you were actually saying that the rest of us have no understanding of the inner thoughts of this eternal being, whereas you are on the inside track, and can tell us exactly what is going on in the mind of the almighty.\n \n Then you get back to the good old, \"I am just going to repeat myself and claim that my answer must be beyond your understanding\" rubbish. I must say that this is no surprise anymore. If you cannot (or dare not) explain it, it can't possibly be your fault.\n \n And then we get back to your usual finale of declaring yourself correct and that we will all realise this at some unspecified time in the future. You really ought to try a different script. This one is getting very old and boring.",

That's why they don't see the dire consequences to their actions down the road (Obama's massive $8 trillion debt coming home to roost in the future as one example; putting a 10% luxury tax on yacht sales, which resulted in the little guy getting laid off when yacht sales plummeted, being another example). Same thing here.\n \n Liberals are clueless about the \"down-the-road-effects\" of how the hard-core Muslim babies and Palestinians are brought up to hate and kill Jews. Generation after generation now wage war against, and kill the Jews. Do you think the children of the Canaanites or the other \"ites\" were any different? Doing it your way there would be countless generations of these \"raised up,\" indoctrinated murderers running loose and raising their own kids to kill more and more Jews and others. It wouldn't end. \n \n So God stops it cold with that generation and dispenses divine JUDGMENT.\n \n In the end, fewer people die in God's economy, and of those who do, the bad go down to the Pit to suffer what is deserved; and if there's any innocents they go to heaven.\n \n Not only that, but fewer innocent people die because countless generations of Canaanite murderers are not around anymore to do their killing.\n \n In the gushy-goo liberal worldview, the killing would still be going on today by tens of millions of people who wouldn't otherwise be here killing others, had God not stopped them dead in their tracks long ago.",

If you can't actually debate the issues, then we have nothing more to discuss.\n\n \n Getting back to the question, I asked this before but you did not comment so I will ask it again.\n \n God told Joshua to kill all the women and babies.\n \n Joshua tells you to kill the women and babies because he says god told him to kill them.\n \n Do you stop to think that Joshua may be nuts or lying?",

   "I got your PM Matthew. Here's my answer to your infantile and shallow question. Ask God, because no answer I give you will be accepted or believed as truth.\n\n \n You are the one who says that the bible is the literal word of God. You are the one who thinks the bible is true. I am the one who believes that the bible is nothing more then a Jewish fairy tale book akin to Grimm's fairy tales and no more true then the harry potter books. It seems like a perfectly reasonable question to ask someone who believes the bible is the truth. It is hardly a shallow question to ask why God would want to have Joshua kill the infants and fetuses. Do you see the conundrum yet? If you believe that it was right and just and that a merciful God ordered Joshua to kill infants and fetuses then how can you say that a just and merciful God disapproves of abortion?",
