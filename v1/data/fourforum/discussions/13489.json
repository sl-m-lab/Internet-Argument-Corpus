Surprisingly, that 'fear' doesn't extend to MOABs nor bunker busters or hellfire missles.\n \n Simply put, they view the gun as evil even in the hands of a law abiding citizen using it in self defense. They celebrate even a criminal overcoming the \"evil\" when their fears are overcome and ignore the injustice when it meets the goal their phobia has shielded them with like a cloak. That is why they depict criminals as a \"victim\" and the law abiding as murderers. It fits their pre-conceived notions and preserves their incorrect belief that 'guns are bad'. This is a means of escape for irrational fears they hold to satisfy their id and ego. \n \n Like any other phobia, the means to correct it is to face up to that fear and get exposure to guns, shooting and self-defense. But no, parts of society encourage this particular form of mental illness and encourage it; some, to profit from it or get a perculiar sense of self-fullfillment to believe that they are actually doing something useful. To do this, they have to encourage disobedience to the Rule of Law and ignore it to pass laws in conflict with morals and Constitutional laws to fit the niche they reserve for themselves and their 'inner needs'. Damn the torpedoes and full speed ahead.\n \n They are sick, mentally ill, and at great cost to society refuse the rational and insulate themselves in certain groups with similar identities to justify their irrational fears. Some will get treatment and return to normal mores, most will not and will ignore them at their own peril and their fellow countrymen.\n \n I have invited people to post those fears on their cars and on their front yards but deep inside they know what will happen if they do what they encourage gun owners to do. It is time to stop the pandering and make these folks get treatment! emoticon_xgood",

By the time of the Normandy Invasion, the Free French forces numbered more than 400,000 strong. 900 Free French paratroopers landed as part of the in the British Special Air Service Brigade (S.A.S.); the Free French 2nd Armoured Division, under General Leclerc, landed at Utah Beach in Normandy on 1 August 1944, and eventually led the drive towards Paris, while the divisions which had been fighting in Italy became part of the French First Army, under General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, and joined the U.S. 7th Army in Operation Dragoon. This operation was the Allied invasion of southern France. The Allied forces advanced up the line of the Rh\u00f4ne River to liberate the Vosges and southern Alsace.\n Are we good so far?\n \n Again from wiki: The French Resistance played a valuable role in facilitating the Allies' rapid advance through France following the invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, and Provence on August 15, by providing military intelligence on the Atlantic Wall and Wehrmacht deployments and coordinating acts of sabotage on power, transport and telecommunications networks.\n \n As old Abe said you have removed all doubt!

The Foreign Legion included many non-French soldiers. Other contingents were Moroccan, Algerian and Tahitian (the latter serving with particular distinction in the Western Desert). 17,000 Senegalese died defending France in 1940, many being shot by the Germans after being taken prisoner.\n \n Finding an all-white division that was available proved to be impossible due to the enormous contribution made to the French Army by West African conscripts. The 2nd Armoured Division was chosen to lead the Liberation of Paris as it had only 25% black troops.[4]\n\n \n Gee, Jo, you really should have read your sources.
