But I think when what happened in Chechnya happens here and the regular citizens drive around picking them off one by one, they will run naked to get out of this country. As you can see, I am NOT PC-I feel that the internment of the Japanese in WWII was the proper thing to do. We all sit back so smug and arrogant in our knowledge and rational thought that we forget to be human. If someone with Black hair was known to be wanting to do harm to your children, would any of you sit back and say that we can't stereotype against people with Black hair, then go out and hire a babysitter with Black hair? (I know, not the greatest analogy LOL) God help the person who says they would. I fail to see why it's any different for a country to do the same. Furthermore, I think we need to get into the heads of the terrorists and play mindgames with them. I know from a reliable source that during at least one operation over in the Middle East, our guys drove around with loudspeakers calling the AYrabs impotent. This being a major insult in their \"culture\" caused them to leap out in anger and give away their positions and we picked them off easily (great warriors, huh? LOL) I'm sure there are things we could take advantage of, such as their \"religious\" beliefs, that could have them in a corner sucking their thumbs, but NOOOOOOOO we are above that, we are more rational.

What should America be doing to achieve this?\n \n Does anybody have a plan they think would work?\n\n \n #1 Work on achieving a better international opinion. In this case, going to war without being attacked, and without specific links to terrorism, makes us a greater target. this does not mean the international community controls the US, on the contrary, through smart politics, we can control their opinion of us, to suit our selfish needs. Only bushies submit that winning a war without violence is sissy....just because bush never read the art of war, or rather, anything since his college days, isn't justification for pre-emptive violence without consensus.\n \n #2 Fix the freaking mess that is our intelligence community. The entire way of life sounds like it's a mess, and isn't geared around their mission...to provide plentiful, accurate intelligence to our government. Fixing the intelligence community requires that you admit there are problems with it. Which I seriously doubt Bush and his administration would do unless they were forced to. Power corrupts and blinds. If you no longer have the power to examine and fix what is broken, you will not be able to compete long term. Luckily, we get a regime change every 4-8 years. Bush can only do \"so much\" damage.\n \n #3 Out of the 50% of our governmen't revenue that goes to military spending, a significant percentage should be redistributed specifically to defense of our land, and in the intelligence abroad. The cold-war tactics of acting like we can build a star wars defense system (which was and still is a sham), was meant to psychologically cripple Russia. Should we not re-focus our spending from those ridiculous research expenditures that don't actually do anything for America now and focus them on our new enemy, terrorism? yes. That means pulling some funding from one area of defense and putting it into another, good luck getting Bush to do that, he doesnt' read, and think anything that cut any defense spending is \"evil and unamerican\" (even if they are redistributed to places that make America safer and stronger).\n \n #4 Quit getting caught doing **** that we decry. I.e. \n - Starting a war and killing thousands of civilians because we wanted to. \n -Torturing prisoners when we denounce the target of our pre-emptive war as being a torturer. \n - Being misled by those that use religious beliefs to support their motivations while denouncing others who use religion to back their goals (osama and many others).\n - Using subtle implications to steer the entire international community, including the average American, to believe that there were links to WMDs and Al Queda in Iraq, when there were none.\n \n that's a start.\n \n \"Defeating terrorism\" is impossible (unless you have the power to control all thoughts or kill every living thing capable of terrorism in the universe), just as defeating ignorance is impossible. You can make reduce the impact it has on the world though, but you cannot \"defeat it.\" What's it? An idea? A way of fighting? Many americans, even our government have comitted acts of terrorism. The only difference is that in this case, Americans died, so we move to prevent it. Which I'm all for, I just don't think we're saying the right things when we do say them.\n \n -Mach",

What should America be doing to achieve this?\n \n Does anybody have a plan they think would work?\n\n terrorism probably can never be defeated, because its an ideal and not a tangible entity. but it can be greatly reduced. we already have ways of detecting terrorists (although they mostly openly declare that they are/support terrorists), and large organized terrorist groups are highly visible. very often, terrorists belong to cults or societies where they reaffirm their hate or discuss their strategies. also, they usually swear into the group, go through initiations of sorts and wear common insigna, sort of like gangs in the us. \n \n to me, the way you deal with organized terrorism is similar to dealing with drug cartels or violent gangs: covert intellegence (even if it means invasion of privacy), forced raids, and indictments. though the activities are different, drug cartels and terrorist groups habe many similarities. there is usually some sort of hiearchy, and taking out the top members can effectively break up the whole organization. also, there is a high demand for trust, since their plots are shady and secret and they try to stay under the radar, so betrayal usually means death. however, they can be infiltrated by undercover agents. in fact, terrorists groups are usually more welcoming to anyone that is willing to serve than are crime syndicates\n \n organized terrorism can be dealt with. its not beyond us, its not even improbable. with the right activities we could easily break up the major terrorist networks in the middle east. the small ad hoc teams and solo operatives may take much more man-power, but their damage and threat is limited, so their demise can follow after the large networks are dealt with\n \n with that said, i cannot see how liberating countries or bringing democracy to people fit into the overall objective. whats more, for the cost, man-power and time invested, i cant see how anybody could think that this is a useful way to spend our resources... unless we arent bothering with this war on terror thing anymore, but they didnt tell us",

   "\n conversion is not necessary. we dont need them to stop being muslims, we just need a few scholars to twist the interpretation of their koran so that they are guided out of the murderous mode. this could be done without desecrating islam itself. but with the right motivation we could get prominent \"muslim\" (our guys in reality) figures to speak against bin laden and the whole jihad culture. planting these \"scholars\" all over the middle east could possibly shift the mindset away from violence. you have to remember, not all muslims are violent, or even fundamentalist\n \n \n the plan im describing is similar. just as all our attention has been subtley shifted so that everybody is seeing saddam as our biggest enemy and not al qaeda, its the same principle. we steer the muslim focus away from the us occupation and onto something else. or better yet, steer the terrorist forces away from attacking americans and towards some more constructive goal.\n \n \n\n \n Steering Muslim focus away from the occupation would be nearly impossible as muslims people are being killed.

Bin Laden and other Islamic extremist groups invariably refer to us in the same vein as Israel and always as Zionists. The invasion and occupation of Iraq, even though ruled by a dictator, had zero to do with our primary conflict (al Qaeda), was incapable of harming us even with WMDs and was the result of a special interest desire. \n \n I'll have to agree to disagree with the possibility of propoganda ever having any possible measurable change on Islamic extremist goals. I think they're after freedom from Western influences, including 'the little US' Israel, and changing those goals stands about as much chance as changing Bush's Christian Crusader mentality as shaped by special interests and blind public support of those policies. Few nations have ever been or ever will be governed by the people, leaders formulate and implement policy.

   "#1 Work on achieving a better international opinion. In this case, going to war without being attacked, and without specific links to terrorism, makes us a greater target. this does not mean the international community controls the US, on the contrary, through smart politics, we can control their opinion of us, to suit our selfish needs. Only bushies submit that winning a war without violence is sissy....just because bush never read the art of war, or rather, anything since his college days, isn't justification for pre-emptive violence without consensus.\n\n Like Jimmy Carter did? He decided to fight the Soviet Union by boycotting the Olympics. Effective strategy, huh? emoticon_xdonno \n Reagan, on the other hand, dealt with the Evil Empire from a position of strength. He kept them from building an airbase for Soviet Bear Bombers in Grenada, kept them from obtaining a critically-needed cold weather port in Afghanistan and forced them to implode while trying to keep up with US military spending. Rhetoric alone never scared a anyone into laying down his arms.\n \n\n #2 Fix the freaking mess that is our intelligence community. The entire way of life sounds like it's a mess, and isn't geared around their mission...to provide plentiful, accurate intelligence to our government. Fixing the intelligence community requires that you admit there are problems with it. Which I seriously doubt Bush and his administration would do unless they were forced to. Power corrupts and blinds. If you no longer have the power to examine and fix what is broken, you will not be able to compete long term. Luckily, we get a regime change every 4-8 years. Bush can only do \"so much\" damage.\n\n Arab-speaking and looking CIA candidates aren't exactly lining up by the hundreds to become spooks and most terrorist organizations require some display of loyalty, like shooting a random passer-by . An old Presidential Executive Order prevented us from using less-than-saintly agents to do the dirty work, so we weren't allowed to flip existing pond scum to our side.\n \n\n #3 Out of the 50% of our governmen't revenue that goes to military spending, a significant percentage should be redistributed specifically to defense of our land, and in the intelligence abroad. The cold-war tactics of acting like we can build a star wars defense system (which was and still is a sham), was meant to psychologically cripple Russia. Should we not re-focus our spending from those ridiculous research expenditures that don't actually do anything for America now and focus them on our new enemy, terrorism? yes. That means pulling some funding from one area of defense and putting it into another, good luck getting Bush to do that, he doesnt' read, and think anything that cut any defense spending is \"evil and unamerican\" (even if they are redistributed to places that make America safer and stronger).\n\n I'd argue that we shouldn't stop \"Star Wars\" efforts because other nations are beginning to acquire ICBM capabilities. If we were really serious about protecting America, we'd divert some of the military funding to border patrol and increased INS deportation efforts as well. What use is it increasing airport security when every year 300,000 illegal aliens walk across the border unmolested? \n \n\n #4 Quit getting caught doing **** that we decry. I.e. \n - Starting a war and killing thousands of civilians because we wanted to. \n -Torturing prisoners when we denounce the target of our pre-emptive war as being a torturer. \n - Being misled by those that use religious beliefs to support their motivations while denouncing others who use religion to back their goals (osama and many others).\n - Using subtle implications to steer the entire international community, including the average American, to believe that there were links to WMDs and Al Queda in Iraq, when there were none\n that's a start..\n\n If you were misled into believing that AQ and Iraq were connected, you weren't paying attention.\n \n\n \n \"Defeating terrorism\" is impossible, just as defeating ignorance is impossible. You can make reduce the impact it has on the world though, but you cannot \"defeat it.\" What's it? An idea? A way of fighting? Many americans, even our government have comitted acts of terrorism. The only difference is that in this case, Americans died, so we move to prevent it. Which I'm all for, I just don't think we're saying the right things when we do say them.\n \n -Mach\n\n \n I think that we need to learn how to live in a world where terrorism is a way of life. Now that AQ knows that it can severely cripple the economy of the largest trading nation in the world with one terrorist act, what will stop others from doing the same. If we had not become a bunch of sheeple in response to 9-11, then their terrorist act would have had little more than a local impact on our economy.

Our enemies had to cheer when we invaded Iraq and proceeded to drive the price of oil up to where our trade imbalance and military deficits started spinning up like a turboprop. And that doesn't touch the actual costs of Iraq or homeland security, ever increasing on a daily basis. I keep searching for projections of what our current homeland security costs will expand to as a budget category with a future domestic attack, but that's not a popular subject. Maybe the emotional public believes the political drivel claiming that we're winning the war on terror, but few of those people can actually balance their personal checkbooks and probably believe another attack will be stopped by everyone removing their shoes when entering airports.

He also doesn't read and goes to bed at 9-10pm..which might not leave him much time to work with the pentagon on planning.... \n \n \nArab-speaking and looking CIA candidates aren't exactly lining up by the hundreds to become spooks and most terrorist organizations require some display of loyalty, like shooting a random passer-by . An old Presidential Executive Order prevented us from using less-than-saintly agents to do the dirty work, so we weren't allowed to flip existing pond scum to our side.\n\n Not lining up? I have yet to succeed in anything in life by kicking back and letting it come to me. I'd never hire a recruiter that spoke like that ;)\n \n Secondly, you're focused only on obtaining more spies. I'm talking about the entire system. You know, like the 9/11 comission findings? You heard about that comission right? The one that bush wasn't go to speak to, then decided he would, then held Cheney's hand while talking to them for just a few hours? \n \n Thirdly, the former diretor of the CIA thinks that a positive overhaul of the CIA will take about 5 years or so. Meaning, had it been overhauled 5 years ago by Clinton...or Bush1...or Reagan..then despite your hardship in finding spies, we'd be where the CIA director would have wanted us to be as far as the intelligence agency is concerned. Meaning, he must have acknowledge that the agency needed an overhaul.\n \n \nI'd argue that we shouldn't stop \"Star Wars\" efforts because other nations are beginning to acquire ICBM capabilities. If we were really serious about protecting America, we'd divert some of the military funding to border patrol and increased INS deportation efforts as well. What use is it increasing airport security when every year 300,000 illegal aliens walk across the border unmolested? \n \n Star Wars doesn't work, at least that's what I've read. It's next to impossible to shoot down missiles, there is no effective \"shooting down ICBM\" strategy that works vs a nation with significant nuclear capability. It all ends in WWIII either way. Welcome to nuclear winter. \n \n Regarding border patrol, fund that too, I don't disagree, why would I? It blows my mind that I know people that have to wait years to get into the country legally, yet others stroll in without a dime to their name or education.\n \n \nIf you were misled into believing that AQ and Iraq were connected, you weren't paying attention.\n\n Nice, hindsight. You really believe that or are you just being silly? Shall I drag out the quotes?? We're talking about the public, not me personally.\n \n \nI think that we need to learn how to live in a world where terrorism is a way of life. Now that AQ knows that it can severely cripple the economy of the largest trading nation in the world with one terrorist act, what will stop others from doing the same. If we had not become a bunch of sheeple in response to 9-11, then their terrorist act would have had little more than a local impact on our economy. I can't remember in the history of mankind when the loss of 3,000 lives cost $Hundreds of Billions\n\n \n I'm not sure I see a strategy here. Although I'd be interested to hear one.\n \n -Mach",

   "No, not like Jimmy Carter. You can have the strawman back, no thanks.\n\n No, take him...I insist. ;)\n \n\n Rhetoric is your second fallacy. I never suggested \"Rhetoric\" as an effective means of..well, anything other than maybe a political campaign :) \n\n My mistake. I thought that you wanted to talk our enemies to death. :)\n \n\n I'm obviously talking about everything other than boots on the ground war. Not...as you say...rhetoric. Economic vice grip, UN pressure, neighboring countries pressuing you, immediate/contained retaliation if they shoot at our aircraft, masive intelligence operations. Working on gathering support from other nations on our plans...if we think our plans are worth that is. \n \n You amuse me when you disagree with economically crippling a country as a tactic to persuade, yet you say not but a few paragrahs down that the US was crippled economically by terrorism and that was a bad thing. So which is it? Is it bad or OK? Can you do this without killing 3000 civilians? You bet you can. But it's harder to think about than pulling a trigger isn't it? Exactly why Bush can't pursue ANY policy that has \"nuance.\" Bush said so himself...he doesn't do \"nuance\". He also doesn't read and goes to bed at 9-10pm..which might not leave him much time to work with the pentagon on planning.... \n\n \n Economic boycotts have been tried on many terrorist nations, including Iraq. Unfortunately, the frogs, Russians, Chinese and Germans continued to do business with Iraq illegally. THEY continuously pumped $Billions directly into Saddam's pockets and kept his regime in power long after intelligence reports said his rule would collapse. When your allies undercut an economic boycott, how effective do you think it can be?\n \n\n Not lining up? I have yet to succeed in anything in life by kicking back and letting it come to me. I'd never hire a recruiter that spoke like that ;)\n\n My point was that chiorboys, as required by the Executive Order, weren't about to risk their lives as spooks. To have successful spooks, you need to recruit from the gutter, not the penthouse.\n \n\n Secondly, you're focused only on obtaining more spies. I'm talking about the entire system. You know, like the 9/11 comission findings? You heard about that comission right? The one that bush wasn't go to speak to, then decided he would, then held Cheney's hand while talking to them for just a few hours? \n \n\n Was that the commission that had one of the architects of \"The Wall\" sitting in judgement of the folks whose hands she tied? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n Thirdly, the former diretor of the CIA thinks that a positive overhaul of the CIA will take about 5 years or so. Meaning, had it been overhauled 5 years ago by Clinton...or Bush1...or Reagan..then despite your hardship in finding spies, we'd be where the CIA director would have wanted us to be as far as the intelligence agency is concerned. Meaning, he must have acknowledge that the agency needed an overhaul.\n\n I agree that it needs to be overhauled. We need to allow the CIA to talk with the FBI and to recruit thugs as spies. We also need to engage in covert operations to supply weapons to Iran's youth. THAT'S where the key to ending Islamic Fundamentalism lies, the youth.\n \n \n Star Wars doesn't work, at least that's what I've read. It's next to impossible to shoot down missiles, there is no effective \"shooting down ICBM\" strategy that works vs a nation with significant nuclear capability. It all ends in WWIII either way. Welcome to nuclear winter.\n\n Star War's could never stop a massive attack, but it could, theoretically, stop a lone missile from a terrorist state.

   "Economic boycotts have been tried on many terrorist nations, including Iraq. Unfortunately, the frogs, Russians, Chinese and Germans continued to do business with Iraq illegally. THEY continuously pumped $Billions directly into Saddam's pockets and kept his regime in power long after intelligence reports said his rule would collapse. When your allies undercut an economic boycott, how effective do you think it can be?\n\n \n Economic boycotts have never been an effective tool. We have tried them in several situations and thay hev never worked. In cuba, Fidels numbers are as high as ever. Instead fo being seen as the casue of teh economic woes, he is seen as the brave leader, standing up to the Americans (and America is seen as the cause of the problem). The same was true in Iraq. Saddam became more popular during the trade sanctions. He, too, was seen as standing up to the Americans, who were killing Iraqi babies by depriving them of food and medicine.\n \n Sanctions have always deprived the little people of food, medicine, water, etc.... While having little or no effect on the rulers with whom we are displeased. \n \n \nMy point was that chiorboys, as required by the Executive Order, weren't about to risk their lives as spooks. To have successful spooks, you need to recruit from the gutter, not the penthouse\n.\n \n A truer statement has never been made. We have a real problem both in our intelligence community as well as our federal law enforcement community with recruiting from the ivy league, then expecting them to fight street crime and deal with the kind of unsavory characters you are forced to deal with in intelligence work. It is rediculous.\n \n \nI agree that it needs to be overhauled. We need to allow the CIA to talk with the FBI and to recruit thugs as spies. We also need to engage in covert operations to supply weapons to Iran's youth. THAT'S where the key to ending Islamic Fundamentalism lies, the youth.\n\n \n Right again. In order to make funadamental changes to the value system of a whole group of people requires time and the change must come from withing. You can force them at the end of a gun, but only if you are going to hold that gun on them forever. Otherwise, the minute you turn your back they will stab you in it.\n \n \nStar War's could never stop a massive attack, but it could, theoretically, stop a lone missile from a terrorist state. I'm not as concerned with nuclear winter as I am with a large flash in a localized population center like NY or DC. I believe that the next use of a nuclear weapon won't be WWIII, it'll be a terrorist act as in the \"Sum of All Fears\", possibly via the air.\n\n \n With tens of thousands of containers coming into US prots every day, and only a relatively small number of those being searched, not to mention the porosity of our borders, I don; tthink that terrorists or rogue nations are likely to go to the trouble of developing long range missiles to deliver their nuclear payloads. If we can't keep a mexican gardner form crossing the border illegally, how could we possibly expect to stop a terrorist with financial and tactical backing from wandering across the border with a nuke? \n \n \n \nThe strategy is to stop acting like sheeple. Stop getting spooked everytime a terrorist act takes place and don't over-react. OBL shouldn't have ANY impact of stock performance, oil prices, etc., Although I despise FDR with every fiber in my body, he did have one thing right \" We have nothing to fear but fear itself\". If terrorist acts lose their impact, they will become ineffective weapons. They are only effective if WE let them be.\n My strategy would be to quietly fight terrorism tooth and nail but with \"business as usual\" for everyone outside of the combatants.\n\n \n It is the \"security\" costs that are killing us. Unfortuantly, there are a lot of folks out there betting that the US will loose the \"war on terror\" (even more unfortunate, they are probably right). This is why every new attack brings a fall in the stock market.\n \n As far as the oil market, while it is also being driven largely by fear, it is also to some exten being driven by real world factors, like the fact that pipelines and processing facilities in the ME are being targeted, which is causing limited shortages.",

Combine this with baby boomers retiring in a few years and declining wage growth due to competition with China and India and I dont see a bright economic future for the US.\n\n \n For the very reasons you state about the US economy, we accepted a purchase offer for our primary residence just yesterday. My plan was sell while the market is still overvalued and prior to the presidential election. Regardless of who's elected, interest rates will go up to satisfy foreign investors in our treasury issues, turning our exploding public debt into a monster. \n \n We had purchased land in a state that has stringent constitutional restrictions against assumption of public debt and requires any expansion of government services or tax increases to be approved by a majority popular vote. We've completed the design of our new home with construction starting on 10/15. \n \n Our investments are now mostly in AAA insured muni bonds, leaning toward education and emergency services debt, which is normally a legislated priority payment in most states. I'm also watching the dollar and the Euro.\n \n Not much of a statement of confidence in the US economy? I'm able to understand when 2+2 doesn't equal 4 regardless of government rhetoric. With our current, irrevocable spending levels and reduced tax base, our service economy driven by 75-85% consumer and government debt based expansion and spending just doesn't have any recovery margin. Sooner or later the international financial community will begin to lose patience with our irresponsible policies as China and other emerging industrial and service nations continue their expansion on sound financial bases. At that point, we're going to be in for some rough times, including major economic recessions and scary taxes regardless of how many wars are pursued to refocus the general public.\n \n I do feel ashamed that we've collectively put the wage earners and youth of our country in such a horrible position, but I'm personally ready for a sound financial lifeboat.",

The actual impact on the earth's surface from the open pit mining process, while it seems immense now, will actually be very minimal once all the reclamation processes are completed. I've seen open pit coal strip mines in southern Sask from the 50's and 60's that are now beautiful wildlife areas, and the reclamation effort spent on these sites was nearly zero.\n \n Unfortunately, as stated, the cost of this environmental stewardship on a per barrel basis makes competition with ME oil a struggle.\n\n \n I weas talking the environmental costs (rebuyulding, replanting, etc....) in addition to just the extraction costs. It seems that there are really two options on this one, the cheap way, dig out the sand and leave huge holes full of petroleum sludge in the bottom, or dig it out and rehabilitate the area. \n \n I misunderstood your post (I see that now). I was under the impression that you were merely counting the extraction costs, not the environmental impact/reclamation costs associated with the venture.",

Not directly of course, but Soros is so successful that his investments cause trends which lead to the currency sliding in his direction. When he bets against a currency, investors follow and that sometimes causes a crash that wouldn't have occured pre-Soros. I definately wouldn't call the guy a Socialist but he is a radical and a convicted criminal in Russia.",

Buffett and many others operating independently of Soros have been been making continual, consistently large fortunes off the dollar's demise since we so astutely decided to invade Iraq and financially bleed ourselves out while polishing GDP numbers for political purposes. It didn't take a lot of brains to quickly understand the US public had no comprehension of what poor shape our finances were in before they swallowed the Iraq and homeland security bait. A run like Soros is capable of making could drive fed interest rates through the roof just to keep jumpy treasury issue investors from bolting in a situation Japan and China couldn't prop up.",
