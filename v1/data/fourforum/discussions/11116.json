   "In another post, trebor posted commentary on a TX raid on a Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints compound in Eldorado TX.\n \n \n\n One a related (non-medical issue), the government has surrounded and shut down a FLDS compound in Texas. They are checking on the 'safety of the children'\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/04/04/texas.ranch/index.html\n\n \n While we can discuss whether that was a correct thing to do (I believe it was), I do find it a bit...odd, that the TX officials used buses belonging to First Baptist Church of Eldorado to transport the kids away.\n \n I personally hope the FLDS cultists snag the ACLU to sueify the hinies off of the TX officials for violation of church and state and their civil rights in the use of buses belonging to a competitng religion.\n While the TX officials may have been prosecuting the culties based on secular laws...the implication is they were doing so with a religious conviction that just happens to contradict the FLDS's beliefs and practices.\n \n Why couldn't the TX officials find and use perfectly fine charter buses or school buses???\n \n This has to be one of the most bone headed things I've ever seen someone do. \n \n \n Sorry, I can't find a pic of the evidenc, it's on AoL's version of the story.\n http://news.aol.com/story/_a/girls-removed-from-polygamist-ranch/20080404201909990001",

   "Actually, it all depends on the reasoning and means that the officials acquired the buses.\n \n If I showed up with a bus bearing a burning cross on it and Aryan Brotherhood printed across the front to make a raid on a Black Muslim building that's been engaged in criminal activities (see also: Your Black Muslim Bakery in CA.) you can bet your bottom dollar you'd hear about it. The impression being that the gov't officials are being supported by a specific church that's opposed to your beliefs AND who's religious convictions brought about changes in your church in the past (Mormonism abandoning polygammy) AND who's religious convictions CONTINUE to oppose your belief systems and religious traditions...takes a lot of the air out of cracking down on molesting cultists being done for secular reasons.\n \n The issue to the lawsuit isn't compensation. It's publicity.\n And the use of Baptist buses with clearly visible printing on them leaves the sour taste that this raid wasn't done because of secualrist issues but because of religious differences.\n \n \n \"Your honor, this isn't a case of our peaceful and constitutionally protected commune engaging in illegal activities, which it wasn't, but a case of the local churches and their owned police officials gathering together in conspiracy to attack us based on religious prejudice.\n That they were nominal secular officials transporting the members of this peaceful commune to a public location is not at issue. \n That they loaded the people onto church owned buses was a clear statement to us and all who saw that this act was motivated by religious discrimination.\"\n \n \n Seriously, anyone with an ounce of thought in this PC driven country would have planned to avoid the use of religious equipment by Chruch A to attack curch B.\n \n I wonder how Archy would feel if he was loaded onto a bus with a red crescent to be transported to a location where people 100% opposed to his belief system and favorable to the Islamic one would seek to prosecute him on his religious practices?\n \n IMO, this is a snafu of the worst proportions and a decent PR opening for the FLDS to seek to push the notion that it's religious discrimination. \n No different that any opening is used to push racial discrimination by the police for black civil rights activists.\n \n \n Several dozen confused girls stared out from within a shuttle bus borrowed from the First Baptist Church of Eldorado...\n \n Borrowed...without compensation?\n \n From some of the articles I've seen, school buses were also used.\n They should have been all that was used IMO. Nice public transportation.\n And one account said that 30 Game Warden vehicles were used. \n It's clear that non-religious vehicles were present in bountiful numbers and should easily have been enough without having to 'borrow' some from a church.\n When you plan a raid of this size and with as many gov't organizations involved, it's reasonable to think that transportation would also have been planned for.\n But, in all likelihood, they probably found more people on the compound than they were expecting and sought reinforcements as quickly as possible from as close as possible and the church was the only readily available source.\n Still...for fringe groups this will be another potential proof for them that it's an opposing religion belif system that's behind all this.",

   "I wonder how Archy would feel if he was loaded onto a bus with a red crescent to be transported to a location where people 100% opposed to his belief system and favorable to the Islamic one would seek to prosecute him on his religious practices?\n\n \n Let's use your analogy but make it more accurate and I'll answer your question. First of all, I would realize that I wasn't being transported in the bus as a criminal, but to protective custody as those girls were because they had broken no laws; and secondly, I was transported in an official christian church bus even though I was being retrieved from a christian cult such as the Branch Davidians, for example. And most importantly, those girls weren't being transported to this other church who's name was on the bus but to a PUBLIC FACILITY for their own safety. \n \n So if it was me in that situation, and it just so happened that the officials borrowed a bus from the local mosque and used it to transport me and a bunch of my friends apart from my parents, I think my parents fate would be foremost on my mind, and not the name on the bus which told me nothing about where I would actually end up. Now, if that bus had the \"TEXAS CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM\" printed on the side of it, being a kid, I might be much more afraid of that, thinking that I was being transported to Prison than if they actually thought they were being sent to a mosque or a baptist church.\n \n But you know that none of this happened in a vacuum. These kids were told where they were going and had adult women on the bus with them who answered any questions they had about what was happening to them and why it was happening to them. So your claim that a lawsuit is viable just because this generation has gone crazy with political correctness is ludicrous.",

No arrests had been made. \n \n Meisner said welfare officials were looking for foster homes for the girls, most of whom have rarely been outside the insular world of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. They were being housed for now at a civic center, she said. \n \n \"We're dealing with children that aren't accustomed to the outside world, so we're trying to be very sensitive to their needs,\" Meisner said. \n \n Authorities had interviewed about half the girls since arriving Thursday evening at the remote compound with law enforcers, she said. Interviews were expected to continue over the weekend. \n \n The investigation began with a call alleging physical abuse of a 16-year-old girl living there, Meisner said. \n \n On Friday afternoon, the Department of Public Safety officials began executing a search warrant. \n \n The warrant seeks records dealing with the birth of children to a 16-year-old and any records listing a marriage between a 50-year-old man and the girl, according to the San Angelo Standard-Times, which cited court records released late Friday in Tom Green County. Prosecutors in Tom Green, a larger county north of Eldorado, were handling the case. \n \n An arrest warrant was issued, but the individual that public safety officials are looking for had not been located Friday evening, said spokeswoman Tela Mange. She said she could not reveal whose name was on the warrant. \n \n \"We have been working very closely with the adults at the ranch, and they have been assisting us in our search,\" she said. \n \n The ranch covers roughly 1,700 acres. It is north of this two stoplight town, down a narrow paved road. Authorities blocked access to the compound's gate, keeping onlookers miles away. \n \n Only the compound's 80-foot-tall, gleaming white temple is visible on the wind-swept desert horizon. \n \n State officials said they did not know how many people lived at the retreat, but local officials in 2006 put the number at about 150, as members of the reclusive church moved from a community on the Arizona-Utah line...\n\n \n Don't you find it odd that children are taken away, removed from their families and to be placed into foster care* on an unsubstantiated allegation of abuse made by someone who can't be identified or even located or proven to exist?\n Does anyone think that such a situation would happen in any other case other than in one dealing with 'them thar crazy cultist whose religion gives us the willies'.\n Arch, would you think it acceptable for ALL the children of your church to be removed because some 'mysterious person' stated they were being abused and one adult member had been convicted of statuatory rape (yet only given a 3 year probation sentence)?\n \n *Foster care...I wonder if any of these children will be placed with FLDS or LDS families...or with ones who are opposed to the FLDS way of life and begin a campaign of counter-sectarian brainwashing.\n I've worked with a juvenile youth facility in the past. My experience is that those connected will dinegrate the children's way of life and family members and feed upon assumptions that all FLDS polygamists are also child molesters and that the children must have been abused...why else whould they be in CSP care?\n In the end, there's potential for the insinuation of false memories into some of the children as the children are barraged by inexperienced officials seeking 'proof'. Very few people are equipped to deal with the insular mindset of a cultist, particuarly that belonging to a child.\n \n \n Hopefully, the kids will be given a chance to see how the rest of the world lives for a change.\n Where you don't have to marry someone you don't want to...unless you're a member of a culturally accepted religion like Islam or Hinduism or anyone else who follows the practice of arranged marriages...",

   "@trebor,\n Laws that are passed that your find immoral, unethical and unjust...you're typically not bound by on an internal level.

State sponsored euthanasia of mentally retarded people. The sterilization of anyone with 2 or more children. The burning of your religious texts. \n Have you ever engaged in a criminal activity and thought nothing of it. Infringement on intellectual property rights. Speeding. Stealing something 'extra' if you thought the prices were unjustly too high.\n \n You'll find morality and legality play tug-of-war all the time.\n You can always side with the 'law' and you seem to imply OR, you can go with your own convictions (even if they're ones you were brainwashed to believe).\n \n You'll also note over the many years where the laws change. Most religions have an 'eternal truth/unchanging nature' to them.\n And one is often required to obey 'gods laws' over 'mans' at all times.\n \n Making a claim of 'well, it's the law' also side steps the debate potential (on a debate forum) of the subject and can be seen as an auto-pilot response cultivated by indoctrination. ;)\n \n \n In the end, as of yet, this mysterious 16 year old girl hasn't been found...nor even been proven to exist.\n She may very well be in hiding as some speculate, she might be in CPS care but remaining quiet due to cultic pressures placed on her.\n Or, she may simply be a fabrication of the officials in charge and used as a justification to enact religious persecution against an undesirable cult, nuisance and eyesore to the homogenous community at large. \n In our liberal western society, we can't fathom that women might desire to wear a burkah or hajab on their own in the middle-east and we pontificate on freeing them from their culturally backwards and repressive societies there...in the name of equality and democracy...of course.\n If we can't stand that, we certainly can't stand something similar in our own back yards.\n \n So, did probable cause exist or was it manufactured?\n Will anyone care?\n \n And while the implication is that you believe these women are slaves/brood mares, they actually aren't. \n For their culture, they are normal. Some of them accept it. Some don't. Just like in ALL cultures. 16 year old 'rebels' against her cultire...what's new?\n We poke fun at it and find it disgusting because it clashes with our beliefs.\n Our indoctrinated beliefs...taught from the cradle.\n \n So, what should we do?\n \n My answer is, and will probably always be...might makes right. We got the might, so we do what we think is right...and screw the small group that doesn't comply.\n Oh...and point out the irony and hypocrisy along the way (but that's just a personal thing)\n \n I'll have to re-read that constitutional thingy on freedom of religion again to find the 'unless we don't agree with your practice' part.\n Anyone know the ages of the 'women' who married the founding fathers at the time of the wedding?\n \n \nYou're complete gripe was based on using one christian church's bus in order to transport a christian cults members children to safety which was soundly refuted. Now you're expanding the debate to these other area's and focussing your arguments at me as if I have been debating against these arguments and am somehow being evasive when it's you who's changing the subject\n\n Archy, FLDS are not 'christian'.\n Debates can be expanded and this one has to do with appearnce issues.\n Useing a competing religions resources to enforce religious based laws on a targeted competing religion who's practices were outlawed by the dominant religious culture...\n The OP and expansion deals with persecution complex issues (that you share as noted).\n Furthermore, nothing was 'soundly' refuted.\n Honestly it's imposible to soundly refute it as no one is a telepath or in possession of all the facts as of yet.\n As said by me, it may very well have been an honest oversight by officials who needed more transportation vehicles and the only ones immediatly available were from the baptist church or, it could be a continuance of a conspiracy against a minority sect.\n The former caters more to forgivable reason, the latter provides for a PR campaign and continal fun in the realms of conspiracy theorist and religious lunacy.\n For these FLDS people who constantly preach about the 'End Times' when the evil secular government will raid them, destroy their way of life, shatter families and gloat over it...the end is NOW. They must have some killer prophets amongst their numbers.\n \n As to focusing on you Archy, you're a noted hypocrit.\n I do not believe your response is the same one that you'd give if the tables were turned onto your 'religion'. I doubt you would be dismissive of the use of said religious vehicles by a secular institute against your church. The fact that you side step the question and try to imply that I have changed the subject (I haven't) goes to show your evasiveness once again.\n I focus on you because you said it was a non-issue...and it's not.\n It could be used by the FLDS to cast a shadow of doubt onto the motivations of the raid. Trial related stuff.\n And when dealing with something this costly, huge and publically known, you don't want such things to surface. If sermons by El Dorado Baptist can be found to be deliberatly attacking the cultist in the compound 'down the road' and it can be shown that some of the officials in charge attended said church...you have the formation of doubt. A skilled ACLU lawsuit done for PR media purposes can get this 'tried in the public opinion' to taint potential jurors too.\n Then we can have China lambast the US for it's persecution of 'fringe religions'...oh the irony there.\n \n As to the link to the CNN, that was merely quoting Trebor's initial commentary in another thread to go on a tangent (done here rather than hijacking that thread) dealing with the bus issue. Nothing really about 'checking for safety'...I could care less about their safety. I only deal with side issues as they are raised.\n My 'gripe' is on the use of the buses.\n \n \n As to the findings on 'abuse and pregnancy by minors'...as said, I've worked in youth shelters.\n I can also go to any typical American city and find a score of children who are pregnant and under the age of consent.\n What will be needed is DNA testing on the children and males of the community to find proof beyond a shadow of a doubt that 'dirty old men' are responsible and it isn't a case of 'well, kids will be kids' which is prevalent in many Christian families and is the mantra behind sex education in public schools.\n I'd also be curious as to what evidence of physical abuse has been presented/found.\n I've heard a lot of things exagerated to 'abuse' over time.\n Would you believe that this story was pushed as 'abuse'.\n 13 yr old girl: 'when I was 5, my father swung me near some stairs like he was going to toss me down. He didn't. But, he could have. I remember being scared.'\n This was 'remembered' 8 years after the fact when the girl was asked to present a case to establish whether the girl had been abused or not. She had no other stories to relate.\n Or, a 15 year old boy: 'my parents berated me all the time. When I came in about 30th out of 100 in a school race, they said 'Good job, you can do better next time'. Better next time?' emphasis added by the boy to make the 2nd half of the sentence sound like a slur.",

   "@trebor,\n Laws that are passed that your find immoral, unethical and unjust...you're typically not bound by on an internal level. Although the mob that supports them can gang up on you and shovel their beliefs down your throat at the point of a gun armed police officer.\n Ask yourself, how far you'd go to counter something legal that you really opposed. State sponsored euthanasia of mentally retarded people. The sterilization of anyone with 2 or more children. The burning of your religious texts. \n Have you ever engaged in a criminal activity and thought nothing of it. Infringement on intellectual property rights. Speeding. Stealing something 'extra' if you thought the prices were unjustly too high.\n \n You'll find morality and legality play tug-of-war all the time.\n You can always side with the 'law' and you seem to imply OR, you can go with your own convictions (even if they're ones you were brainwashed to believe).\n \n You'll also note over the many years where the laws change. Most religions have an 'eternal truth/unchanging nature' to them.\n And one is often required to obey 'gods laws' over 'mans' at all times.\n \n Making a claim of 'well, it's the law' also side steps the debate potential (on a debate forum) of the subject and can be seen as an auto-pilot response cultivated by indoctrination. ;)\n \n \n In the end, as of yet, this mysterious 16 year old girl hasn't been found...nor even been proven to exist.\n She may very well be in hiding as some speculate, she might be in CPS care but remaining quiet due to cultic pressures placed on her.\n Or, she may simply be a fabrication of the officials in charge and used as a justification to enact religious persecution against an undesirable cult, nuisance and eyesore to the homogenous community at large. \n In our liberal western society, we can't fathom that women might desire to wear a burkah or hajab on their own in the middle-east and we pontificate on freeing them from their culturally backwards and repressive societies there...in the name of equality and democracy...of course.\n If we can't stand that, we certainly can't stand something similar in our own back yards.\n \n So, did probable cause exist or was it manufactured?\n Will anyone care?\n \n And while the implication is that you believe these women are slaves/brood mares, they actually aren't. \n For their culture, they are normal. Some of them accept it. Some don't. Just like in ALL cultures. 16 year old 'rebels' against her cultire...what's new?\n We poke fun at it and find it disgusting because it clashes with our beliefs.\n Our indoctrinated beliefs...taught from the cradle.\n \n So, what should we do?\n \n My answer is, and will probably always be...might makes right. We got the might, so we do what we think is right...and screw the small group that doesn't comply.\n Oh...and point out the irony and hypocrisy along the way (but that's just a personal thing)\n \n I'll have to re-read that constitutional thingy on freedom of religion again to find the 'unless we don't agree with your practice' part.\n Anyone know the ages of the 'women' who married the founding fathers at the time of the wedding?\n \n \n Archy, FLDS are not 'christian'.\n Debates can be expanded and this one has to do with appearnce issues.\n Useing a competing religions resources to enforce religious based laws on a targeted competing religion who's practices were outlawed by the dominant religious culture...\n The OP and expansion deals with persecution complex issues (that you share as noted).\n Furthermore, nothing was 'soundly' refuted.\n Honestly it's imposible to soundly refute it as no one is a telepath or in possession of all the facts as of yet.\n As said by me, it may very well have been an honest oversight by officials who needed more transportation vehicles and the only ones immediatly available were from the baptist church or, it could be a continuance of a conspiracy against a minority sect.\n The former caters more to forgivable reason, the latter provides for a PR campaign and continal fun in the realms of conspiracy theorist and religious lunacy.\n For these FLDS people who constantly preach about the 'End Times' when the evil secular government will raid them, destroy their way of life, shatter families and gloat over it...the end is NOW. They must have some killer prophets amongst their numbers.\n \n As to focusing on you Archy, you're a noted hypocrit.\n I do not believe your response is the same one that you'd give if the tables were turned onto your 'religion'. I doubt you would be dismissive of the use of said religious vehicles by a secular institute against your church. The fact that you side step the question and try to imply that I have changed the subject (I haven't) goes to show your evasiveness once again.\n I focus on you because you said it was a non-issue...and it's not.\n It could be used by the FLDS to cast a shadow of doubt onto the motivations of the raid. Trial related stuff.\n And when dealing with something this costly, huge and publically known, you don't want such things to surface. If sermons by El Dorado Baptist can be found to be deliberatly attacking the cultist in the compound 'down the road' and it can be shown that some of the officials in charge attended said church...you have the formation of doubt. A skilled ACLU lawsuit done for PR media purposes can get this 'tried in the public opinion' to taint potential jurors too.\n Then we can have China lambast the US for it's persecution of 'fringe religions'...oh the irony there.\n \n As to the link to the CNN, that was merely quoting Trebor's initial commentary in another thread to go on a tangent (done here rather than hijacking that thread) dealing with the bus issue. Nothing really about 'checking for safety'...I could care less about their safety. I only deal with side issues as they are raised.\n My 'gripe' is on the use of the buses.\n \n \n As to the findings on 'abuse and pregnancy by minors'...as said, I've worked in youth shelters.\n I can also go to any typical American city and find a score of children who are pregnant and under the age of consent.\n What will be needed is DNA testing on the children and males of the community to find proof beyond a shadow of a doubt that 'dirty old men' are responsible and it isn't a case of 'well, kids will be kids' which is prevalent in many Christian families and is the mantra behind sex education in public schools.\n I'd also be curious as to what evidence of physical abuse has been presented/found.\n I've heard a lot of things exagerated to 'abuse' over time.\n Would you believe that this story was pushed as 'abuse'.\n 13 yr old girl: 'when I was 5, my father swung me near some stairs like he was going to toss me down. He didn't. But, he could have. I remember being scared.'\n This was 'remembered' 8 years after the fact when the girl was asked to present a case to establish whether the girl had been abused or not. She had no other stories to relate.\n Or, a 15 year old boy: 'my parents berated me all the time. When I came in about 30th out of 100 in a school race, they said 'Good job, you can do better next time'. Better next time?' emphasis added by the boy to make the 2nd half of the sentence sound like a slur.\n\n \n Yet, when they went to the compound, they found a number of underage children that are 'with child'. Many of those are showing signs of physical abuse. I am sorry, but having underage kids knocked up is evidence this illegal activity is wide spread in the FLDS compound.",

I even listed 2 documented examples of alleged abuse.\n Since this thread was started on the 'appearance of impropriety' issue, I could cast doubt onto the unbiased nature of a culturally indoctrinated police force who are leading this investigation.\n Do recall, that the '16 year old girl' who allegedly reported the case has yet to be found. As said, conspiracy theory at this point can says she doesn't exist.\n \n What I'm waiting on is the proof that said pregnant minors were knocked up by dirty old men.\n As well as proof that physical abuse took place.\n \n Yes, I fully expect such allegations to be substantiated but, your commentary and desire to believe 'allegations' as 'proof' smacks of bias...culturally ingrained bias.\n \n \n Sorry for playing devils advocate but constantly I read through many postings here and see bias heaped upon bias without most posters even being aware of it.

   "Well evidently they don't know that since they named themselves \"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\". Having had threads started over the fact that I have referred to them as a CULT, I would personally agree with you that the church isn't really christian. But that opinion by us has nothing at all to do with how they view themselves.\n\n They believe themselves to be the true believers and all others to be false.\n Pretty much like most religions.\n Thus, a Baptist is anathema to them. Regardless of how someone tries to spin it. Thus, your comments on 'christians buses' being used to transport 'christians' is in error based on their beliefs.\n \n \nA noted hypocrite? Oh really. You mean by a bunch of secular humanists and atheists who interpret the bible based on what makes them feel the most comfortable? Great, being judged a hypocrite by someone with your christian insight is no threat at all to my walk with Christ Zardoz. So have fun labeling me.\n\n Ummmm...\n Tehehehe.

It would be why the Government is arresting a church full of traditional christian believers who are no different than the first apostles that followed Jesus 2000 years ago?\n\n It's not a 'secular bus' but a Muslim one. Reread my post.\n I can assure you, that I firmly believe you'd read some nefarious anti-christian plot into such action.\n I base this belief on the plethora of 'Christian' evangelical works that state such. And, there isn't much that is 'traditional' with a Charismatic Pentacostalish church. You are VASTLY different to the Christian of 2,000 years ago.\n Even so to the Christians of 200 years ago. Your practices are long considered heretical by the traditional Christian churches.\n But, that's one of the common lies the pastors of congregations like yours pushes. That 'you're doing it the way it was supposed to be done...the way it was done...way back when.'\n And being typically ignorant of the history of your own faith, you fall for it.\n Your last sentence contrasted with the numerous postings you've made here stating your beliefs and practices compared to knowledge of Christian history supports this.\n This is how Satan gets in Archy. Convinces you that your abberant practices are right.\n \n \nAs to the bolded: How incredibly shallow of you, and sad too. You don't care about their safety but just about the busses that drove them away from the only home many of them ever knew? Your priorities are so incredibly twisted I don't even know how to respond to you. So I wont respond at all. emoticon_ic emoticon_xdonno\n\n It wasn't the subject of this thread. If we want to go off on a tangent, we can. Why should I care about something I'm not addressing? if I'm concerned over the way these children have been 'abused' then I should also be concerned over the way you've abused your own children through indoctrinating them into your belief system as minors...which I'm not. I've got less important things to make fun of.\n \n And, Archy, attacking my post because 'there are more important issues' doesn't answer anything. We can discuss the other issues here, in another thread. If someone wants to make one, they can feel free.\n Being casually dismissive of commentary can be done to anyone.\n Maybe I should deride your posts as being shallow or you having twisted priorities when I can point out something 'more important' (in a relative manner as you do).\n \n In the end, you have cultic practices.\n Nearly every parent does.\n We all raise our children in some way that someone somewhere will find objectionable.\n For countless centuries, practices like the FLDS's were acceptable. In many places of the world, they still are.\n Not all places are like the US or the Westernized world.\n There are many factors that allow us to have this thing we invented called 'childhood' to be enacted on our children that others don't have.\n As little as a century ago, it didn't even exist in the US.\n And, it's possible that in another century it will be gone.\n \n With pubescent people getting married and bearing children.\n With 'minors' fighting once again in wars or working fields or doing things that their little hands are more adapted for.\n And with all living insular, brutal and short lives while being spoon fed dogmatic beliefs.\n It's pretty much the way the world has always been and in most areas, still is.\n With only the wealthy, elite ruling classes being afforded differently.\n \n We're just ashamed of the truth in our back yards because it defies all we say we're against. A democracy doens't have this happen!\n How dare these people desire to live a regressive life!\n Why, it's just like a small European town during the dark ages on that compound!\n They're undoing all the ideas we have worked hard to achieve...because they want too (ironic that when you're a minor, we say they don't want too but, when they magically become adults (even though they were conditioned to believe such) they (the males) all of a sudden become the bad guys).\n Gah!\n Off with their brainwashed heads!\n \n See, what we need to do is counter-brainwash them to believe our way of life is bestest...and scapegoat the old brainwashed males so the blame falls somewhere.\n Once again, Us vs Them.\n Us = good moral people.\n Them = dirty old sexually perverted men.\n \n I'm just thankful that my side has more power than their side.\n Then I wouldn't have to own up to being brainwashed by my culture or face being prosecuted for laws I don't believe in and didn't have any say in making.\n \n Hot damn.\n I can't wait to cover this in the news.\n Maybe we'll see more convictions for accessory to 'rapes' that were never proven to have taken place.\n Man, I wonder if someone will lynch one of these perverted cultists in prison like they sometimes do with other molesters. \n It's like; \"I don't care if your daddy, daddy's daddy and daddy's granddaddy said all this was okay and you never got to hear any contradiction to those rules until now...Imma sticking you with this shank I made out of a pen!\"\n Justice by Just Us.\n Sweeeeet.\n \n Isn'y it neat how a quirk of birth has us accpeting that dirty old men should be strung up or locked up for ever...rather than having us taught 'old enough to bleed, old enough to breed.'",

The FLDS and LDS are not the same group at all. It may be that being owned by the LDS means it may not be objective, but not likely because it has anything to do with the FLDS, which it doesn't.\n \n Since the link isn't working for some people, here's the article.\n  YFZ RANCH, Texas &#8212; The children's shoes still sit neatly, side by side where they last left them. Child-sized shovels and miniature wheelbarrows sit on the porch of their three-story, log cabin-like home. The only noise now emanating from this 1,700-acre compound is the rustle of the wind, birds chirping, the occasional scurry of a roadrunner or a truck traveling along the dirt roads.\n \n \"It's miserable. It's too quiet,\" says Nancy, struggling to keep her emotional voice loud enough to be heard.\n \n This grandmother and others at the reclusive ranch belonging to the Fundamentalist LDS Church on Saturday allowed the Deseret News onto their land and into their homes, which were raided last week by Texas authorities. All 416 children who lived there were removed and placed into temporary state custody. It was the first time they had allowed the media access to places they consider private and sacred. During interviews with ranch residents, FLDS officials insisted that questions remain focused on the children's plight and declined to discuss other topics, including allegations of physical and sexual abuse. Those who spoke asked that only their first names be used. Collectively, their hearts are broken but their spirits undaunted.\n \n \"If you know what it's like to have a little child look you in the eyes, throw their arms around your neck, smile and give you a hug, then you know what it's like (here now),\" she said, turning her head and sobbing into her shoulder.\n \n The leader of the Yearning For Zion Ranch says he doesn't understand how the government could sweep in and seize all their children based on an unproven allegation.\n \n \"This whole situation is abusive and out of hand,\" said Merril Jessop, a presiding elder in the FLDS Church. \"The nearest thing I have ever seen comparable to this, even on the TV shows, is Nazi Germany.\"\n \n \"The only thing we ask of the governor and citizens of Texas,\" Jessop said, \"is to give every man, woman and child due process and an attorney before they destroy their lives.\"\n \n Jessop extended Texas' governor an invitation to come and see where these children are now and what conditions they are being placed under and then to come and see what kind of home they were taken from. Jessop then went one further, inviting a fellow Texan, President George Bush, to come and see what the state is doing to its citizens. \"What can be more important than the safety and protection of the children of America?\" he asked.\n \n 'Children are our life'\n \n Nancy was at the ranch when Texas rangers and other authorities began taking away the children. She said they knocked on the door of her home, walked in, separated the children, began interviewing \"and didn't give us an explanation of what they were doing,\" she said. She and other mothers declined to answer the officers' questions about which child belonged to who. \"They told us we're going to take the children unless you tell us who are their mothers. But we still weren't saying anything,\" she recalled. Then she heard them call for backup. Nancy, who was holding a baby in her arms, said one officer \"poked their face into our face\" and loudly said, \"Give me that baby!\"\n \n \"I said, 'I'm not going to do that,'\" she said.\n \n Although child welfare workers allowed most of the mothers to accompany their children to the temporary shelters, Nancy said she was not allowed to go. She stood helpless in the doorway and watched as her children, grandchildren and family members were loaded onto buses.\n \n \"The children would cry and hang onto their mothers,\" she said, trembling and wiping away tears.\n \n \"I get my strength from my Heavenly Father, but I can't believe something like this could even happen in America.... How could they take families and tear the children away? They're mentally abusing those children.\"\n \n 'Nowhere to go'\n \n Monica, a mother of five children between the ages of 11 and 3, said she wants the world to know her children were happy and safe at home.\n \n \"We love our children. We love family life. Our children are our life. We do all we can to make sure they are cared for and have an education,\" she said. \"They have manners and are trained well in loving and blessing others.\"\n \n She was out of state for an appointment when she heard that her home was being raided. She quickly returned to the ranch but wasn't allowed inside. \"I had nowhere to go,\" said Monica, 34. Her sister is taking care of her 3-year-old at a makeshift shelter in San Angelo, about 50 miles away. A cousin is looking after the others. She tried to join the 139 mothers that were allowed to accompany their children, but the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services won't allow her inside.\n \n \"I have driven past the area where they are, and it's completely surrounded by police,\" she said. \"I'm sure I could walk up to the door and get arrested ... and then what's going to happen to my children?\"\n \n When she was finally allowed to return to her home on the ranch, because of an ongoing search of the property by authorities, she said nothing was the same.\n \n \"Can you imagine what it's like to come back to nothing? Empty, ransacked homes, many things were taken, no pictures left.\"\n \n She was able to find some pictures of when her children were younger, but all others were confiscated.\n \n \"I want the world to know that there is a nothing stronger than love and there is an inborn, God-given love between a mother and her children, and all a mother wants for her children is the very best\" Monica said.\n \n Despite her sorrow and frustration, she says she has faith that she will see her children again.\n \n \"I know I can't give up. I have to stay at it,\" she said. \"I know with Heavenly Father's help I will be able to get them back.\"\n \n 'I couldn't believe it'\n \n Shannon, a mother who was also off the ranch when officers served the search warrants, said she's also tried several times to see her three children but has been refused.\n \n \"Every day I've called them. They put me off saying they don't have the authority to let me in and there's no proof the children are mine. I tell them the children know who their mother is, and I know who my children are,\" she said.\n \n The 30-year-old says she provided child welfare officials with identification and even birth certificates proving she is her children's mother. She says she and other mothers were told those documents could have been fake.\n \n \"I couldn't believe it. I wondered if we were in America or Russia,\" Shannon said. \"I kept thinking, 'How can they do that?' They're breaking every rule. They're breaking every law.\"\n \n Shannon has been told that her youngest child, who is just 2 years old, clings to her caretaker in the shelter. \"She's sick right now and needs her mother.\" Texas officials say they removed the children because they believe they're being abused or neglected. The raid was authorized by a judge after workers at a family domestic hotline reported receiving calls from a pregnant 16-year-old girl claiming she was being abused and was afraid to leave the ranch. Shannon insists the children were not in any harmful environment at the ranch and were well-loved and cared for.\n \n \"We are not child abusers. We take very good care of them. These are innocent and sweet children,\" she said. \"The only abuse my children have ever had is since they've been taken away.\"",

   "LDS and FLDS are not the same.\n They are quite opposed to each other.\n Think 'Catholics a few decades after the Protestan reformation'...but not as hostile.\n \n \nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is criticizing international news media outlets for failing to distinguish between the mainstream LDS Church and the Fundamentalist LDS Church.\n \"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints discontinued polygamy officially in 1890. More than a century later, some news reports, especially those outside the U.S., still fail to draw clear distinctions whenever stories arise about polygamy in the Intermountain West,\" the LDS Church said in a statement posted on its Web site.\n \n The LDS Church praised many news media outlets across the country for noting the difference between the two churches. However, church officials were critical of foreign media reports that ran photographs of the Mormon temple in Salt Lake City next to stories of the polygamous compound raid in Texas and headlines that use the term \"Mormon\" without a distinction.\n \n \"You would think that after over 100 years, media organizations would understand the difference,\" Elder M. Russell Ballard said in the LDS Church's statement on Friday. \"You can't blame the public for being confused when some of those reporting on these stories keep getting them wrong.\"\n \n The LDS Church was particularly critical of the French news agency Agence France-Presse for the photograph mistake, and Russian and Mexican media outlets that incorrectly referred to the FLDS Church as being the LDS Church.\n The FLDS Church is legally incorporated as the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and has been since the 1940s. It is one of many polygamous sects that broke away from the mainstream LDS Church decades ago over the practice of polygamy, but still incorporates Mormon doctrine in its beliefs.\n \n LDS Church leaders have said there is no such thing as a 'fundamentalist Mormon,' but there are an estimated 40,000 in Utah and surrounding states who consider themselves as such. Like the mainstream LDS Church, fundamentalists trace their beliefs to Joseph Smith, who founded the Mormon faith in 1830\n\n \n \n On a side note, in the synopsis I write on these stories, I use \"polygamist FLDS\", \"FLDS\" (or spell it out properly) to denote this group.",

   "I'm fairly familiar with cults and ex-cult members. \n Some family members are / were cultists.\n I could write a book...have been asked to.\n \n As to being anti-gov't.\n Not the case.\n \n The gov't should do everything by the book and as free from bias as possible.\n This case, to me, smacks of a sloppy and unprofessional job.\n Thus my comments on dotting i's and crossing t's.\n The end result very well could be many expensive (read: wasteful and poor use of tax money) lawsuits against the authorities.\n Wins for the cultist there strengthen their positions and opens the door for future cultic abuses and fear by authorities from taking appropriate action.\n \n Personally, I'd have force fed the lot cyanide laced kool-aid (the name brand stuff) and wiped them out. But, that wouldn't have been as pretty as nuking them from orbit (it's the only way to be sure).\n \n As to polygamy, while it's illegal in theory, there are many practices that resemble it that are not illegal.\n Polyamourous relationships abound.\n Couples even have 'open marriages'.\n Others turn blind eyes to cheating (see also Hillary C.).\n How many times do I have to watch a talk show or court TV show to see a man who has children all over the place. Show titles like \"My man ain't not your baby's daddy, 'ho!\" are fairly common.\n \n Yet, our society did away with most laws dealing with that. Divorce in most cases is 'irreconsilable differences...and adultry doesn't matter one iota.\n \n \n So, that shouldn't be a problem.\n It's the kids.\n \n But, as I pointed out. We have tons of that already in our secular society.\n Oh...and we only prosecute them if someone comes forward with a complaint of statuatory rape. \n So is it cultic behavior?\n I could build a wall the size of one in China with the number of pastors who push cultism off on their congregations in America alone.\n Of course, it'd stink after a few days in the sun.\n But, you could see it from orbit...so you can better nuke it.\n \n \n Now, to the meat of your link.\n 1) It's a 2nd party testimony. Those aren't always the most accurate.\n 2) There was no 'rape' for Jeffs to have been a party to. No one was ever charged let alone convicted of a rape charge against the girl mentioned. I guess you can be an accessory to a crime that was never proven to have happened.\n 3) Yes, FLDS preach a lot of garbage. Name one religion that doesn't? \n 4) Hearsay on how many wifes Jeff's dad had ...'something like 75'. If the poster is an ex-Catholic because of a little lie one official once told him, I can be opposed to his story because of one unsubstantiated claim. \n 5) Yes, ex-cultic members are extremely self destructive and prone to anti-social behavior. My pure breed Irish Wolfhound was poisoned by one in the throws of suicidal behavior as an experiment to \"see if it'd work.\"\n 6) And just as the poor women are indoctrinated into their roles, so too are the men. They find they must toe the line or lose out not only on the celestial kingdom but on their only known way of living. And they KNOW that the outside world is 100% hostile to them merely for who there are. So, the whole cult is self replicating. Continuing the cycle of nonsense. \n 7) the links in the post, I've actually thought on contacting Rick Ross as an expert witness in a past court case but it never went that far. That and from what I gathered, Ross messed up the Waco thing with his advice. \n 8) The poster admits to being 28 years older than his, former cultist, wife. Smells fishy to me. \n Rough math puts the poster in his 60's.\n Wife 'escaped' as a teen, add on 20 years for 'deprograming herself' and he's 28 years older than she (8 when rejected Catholicism which was 20 years before she was born).\n \n In my book, he's a manipulative, dirty old man. emoticon_xgood\n \n edit:\n from link: \"I rejected organized religion (Catholicism) sixty years ago (long before my wife was born). Her experience has confirmed my earlier conclusions regarding the negative effects of religion\".\n \n So he's 68 (wife is 40).\n I also question how one can 'reject something' at the age of 8.\n It's like hearing the boy Levi from the movie Jesus Camp state be became a born again saved Christian at age 4...because 'He wanted more out of life.'",

   "SAN ANTONIO (May 29) - In a crushing blow to the state's massive seizure of children from a polygamist sect's ranch, the Texas Supreme Court ruled Thursday that child welfare officials overstepped their authority and the children should go back to their parents.\n \n The high court affirmed a decision by an appellate court last week, saying Child Protective Services failed to show an immediate danger to the more than 400 children swept up from the Yearning For Zion Ranch nearly two months ago.\n \n \"On the record before us, removal of the children was not warranted,\" the justices said in their ruling issued in Austin.\n \n The high court let stand the appellate court's order that Texas District Judge Barbara Walther return the children from foster care to their parents. It's not clear how soon that may happen, but the appellate court ordered her to do it within a reasonable time period.\n \n The ruling shatters one of the largest child-custody cases in U.S. history. State officials said the removals were necessary to end a cycle of sexual abuse at the ranch in which teenage girls were forced to marry and have sex with older men, but parents denied any abuse and said they were being persecuted for their religious beliefs.\n \n The case before the court technically only applies to 124 children of the 38 mothers who filed a complaint that prompted the ruling, but it significantly affects nearly all the children since they were removed under identical circumstances.\n \n The ranch is run by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which teaches that polygamy brings glorification in heaven. It is a breakaway sect of the Mormon church, which renounced polygamy more than a century ago.\n \n Texas officials claimed at one point that there were 31 teenage girls at the ranch who were pregnant or had been pregnant, but later conceded that about half of those mothers, if not more, were adults. One was 27.\n \n Under Texas law, children can be taken from their parents if there's a danger to their physical safety, an urgent need for protection and if officials made a reasonable effort to keep the children in their homes. The high court agreed with the appellate court that the seizures fell short of that standard.\n \n Linky.\n \n Commentary:\n \"Smells like lawsuit time.\"",
