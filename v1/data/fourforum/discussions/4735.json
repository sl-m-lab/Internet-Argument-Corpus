   "Where does it say \"This part is historical fact\" or \"This part is just a metaphor\" ?\n Did you just decide which is which on your own or did some priest decide?\n\n actually, the sections of the bible are implicitly denoted as to what to expect where. \"psalms\" are literally songs and poetry, \"proverbs\" are sayings of wisdom. \"genesis\" means the beginning. \"exodus\" is the journey of the israelites. the books of the prophets are books of prophesy and the life of the prophets. \"samuel\", \"kings\" and \"chronicles\" are books about the succession of judges and kings that ruled israel in those times. its pretty clear-cut\n \n \nIf it does say these things, and you don't believe them, then maybe you really need to think about what you've been occupying yourself with all this time.\n\n understanding how the bible is structured doesnt require belief in it\n \n \nWhy did you ever really need this book and why do you think you still need it?\n I'm sure the book is so familiar to you because you grew up with it since being a kid. \n That makes it all the harder to give up.\n\n precisely so\n \n \nIf you don't believe it then just accept that you don't and stop hanging on to the idea that you will be punished in hell for taking back your life and your mind from religion.\n\n when did you see me hanging on to that idea?\n \n \nIf I were you I'd give up christianity for a while and see how it feels.\n Just lay down that book for a while and stop going to the sunday socials.\n After this, if your life didn't go down the tubes you might just live the rest of it in mental freedom.\n If it did, then maybe you needed religion afterall.\n You can always go back.\n\n you probably took my post out of context",

   "It sounds like you are saying that you think these stories have absolutely no value/relevancy beyond a literal presentation of an event.\n If that were the case, what would be the purpose of them being included in the bible? There are millions of other historical events that could have been included if all it was was an historical account. But they weren't.\n This, IMHO, is one of the problems with interpreting these stories literally. One tends to not look beyond the literal meaning. This is sad, as there is so much more going on than just what is happening on the surface.\n\n im not saying tere is no value, just that whatever value there is isnt apparent to me.\n \n my speculation on why these events ended up in the bible is they had some significance to the jewish culture. the culture, already indoctrinated with the belief that God has chosen them specifically out of all the nations of the world, was necessarily full of references of great exploits of God in the past as a testament that God was truly for israel, and that the idea be preserved.\n \n jesus christ was a jew. christianity then must necessarily subscribe to the God of jewish culture. therefore the christian bible will be a collection of jewish/israeli history with reference to their God",
