   "\n New evidence that natural selection is a general driving force behind the origin of species\n \n NASHVILLE, Tenn. - Charles Darwin would undoubtedly be both pleased and chagrined.\n \n The famous scientist would be pleased because a study published online this week provides the first clear evidence that natural selection, his favored mechanism of evolution, drives the process of species formation in a wide variety of plants and animals. But he would be chagrined because it has taken nearly 150 years to do so.\n \n What Darwin did in his revolutionary treatise, \"On the Origin of Species,\" was to explain how much of the extraordinary variety of biological traits possessed by plants and animals arises from a single process, natural selection. Since then a large number of studies and observations have supported and extended his original work. However, linking natural selection to the origin of the 30 to 100 million different species estimated to inhabit the earth, has proven considerably more elusive....\n \n ....\"The fact that the association is statistically significant despite the crudeness of our estimates suggests that the true biological association is very strong,\" Funk says. \"Darwin's famous book was called 'On the Origin of Species,' but it was really about natural selection on traits rather than species formation. Since our study suggests that natural selection is a general cause of species formation, it seems that Darwin chose an appropriate title after all.\"\n \n For more news about Vanderbilt research, visit Exploration, Vanderbilt's online research magazine, at www.exploration.vanderbilt.edu\n \n\n \n The original news release is here.....",

   "Over at DaveScot's blog they \"critique\" the new analysis:\n \n http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/864\n \n \nFebruary 28, 2006\n New Evidence Supports Natural Selection\n \n The most tested theory in science - Natural Selection - has new and improved evidence to support it says Pim Van Meurs on Panda's Thumb.\n \n Excuse me, but haven't the NeoDarwinian dogmatists been saying for years that Natural Selection is as well tested as the theory of gravity?\n \n Do we hear headlines like New Evidence Supports Theory of Gravity or New Evidence Shows Things Don't Fall Up? ROFL\n \n Who are these clowns trying to fool? :-)\n Filed under: Intelligent Design - DaveScot @ 1:31 am\n \n\n \n The comments are worth it too:\n \n \n\n DaveScot - YOU NEED TO READ THE ABSTRACT. YOU ARE GIVING THE DARWINISTS WAY TOO MUCH CREDIT.\n \n Sorry for shouting, but the funny thing is that, at least according to the abstract, there doesn't seem to be anything in the article remotely resembling natural selection. This is _only adaptation_. It doesn't specify the _mechanism_ of adaptation. It is _assumed_ to be natural selection. This is yet another instance of Darwinist bluffing. All they have shown is that in different ecological environments, species change to adapt to their environments. What they have not shown is that the mechanism behind this is RM + NS or even just NS.\n \n Comment by johnnyb - February 28, 2006 @ 10:12 am\n\n \n johnnyb didn't think it through. When the authors refer to \"ecological adaptation\" what does he think they mean? What mechanism besides mutation and natural selection are known to biology as engines of ecological adaptation? Somebody please correct me if I'm wrong, but there isn't one. The authors imply throughout the paper that ecological adaptation is a result of natural selection. \n \n They do bring up a good point though, IMO. And that is ever since Origin of Species Darwin and \"Darwinists\" have claimed that natural selection is (or can be) responsible for all the diversity of life we see, all of the species. It took until 2006 for someone to do a very complicated statistical analysis of ecological data to actually provide some evidence for this claim. I think the authors shed light on why doing this sort of thing is so difficult.\n \n http://www.vanderbilt.edu/register/articles?id=24940\n \n \n\"We thought that the idea itself was important, that this is a really powerful approach to a very major question,\" said Funk, \"but we thought there was no way in the world that we were actually going to get statistically significant results.\" The reason for his doubt was the incompleteness and lack of uniformity of ecological data. \"There are all these species out there and so few of them are known in intimate detail, so any kind of ecological characterization - through no fault of ecologists - will be limited in accuracy and precision,\" Funk said.\n\n \n I think the FSM threw these guys a bone. They cherrypicked which taxa would give them the most statistically significant results. If they were to expand the method to include more and more taxa, they'd see the Noodly Appendage of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Ramen.",
