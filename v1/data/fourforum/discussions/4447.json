   "Is the overall trend plotted over time, that life on earth is getting \"better\" in your estimation?\n\n \n Yup. Life on earth is generally getting better over time.\n \n \n \nIf so, why do we belly-ache constantly about how horrible governments, politicians, etc., are...are they not getting better on average?\n \n\n \n \"Better\"? I don`t really understand what you mean by \"better\". Less corrupt? more attentive to public oppinion? More charesmatic? Faster execution of new laws? More cost-efficient staff and procedures? Or perhaps more inclined to cater to your interests? ;) Because I think this is the number one reason we keep on complaining about politicians and governments; they don`t do as \"I\" want them to do. We are basicly spoiled brats.\n \n \nSecond, isn't change, violence, and competition just part of human nature? We will probably only see real shifts in our governing paradigm when we either medicate ourselves to be less emotion-drive, or we physically alter or enhance our bodies to be less emotion-driven.\n \n -Mach\n\n \n Every emotion is part of human nature. Love is part of human nature and that hasn`t stopped us from killing eacgother through time. Lust is a part of human nature, but most don`t go around raping anyone they find attractive. Greed is human nature, and yet people help strangers in times of need. Friendship is part of human nature, co-operation is part of human nature, etc etc. I`m quite sceptic to general constraints on progress based on the argument of human nature...",

   "Quote \"I don't think there's any point in piling up more such instances because I'm not sure that these sort of material improvements which make life \"better\", will count for much if this discussion is about \"feelings\". End quote\n \n \n Neat thread. I see material or technological enhancements as being related to ones feelings. For instance , if I lose my hand in a farming accident, and the hand gets sewn back on and operative again, will that action in itself not bear a huge weight in my future feelings ? I will not feel less of a person, I will not feel like I am no longer attractive, because of a stub, and I will not feel less productive in society. Simple analogy, but just my way of rationalizing things...\n \n I think as a society and as individuals, we are better off than most of the world, needless to say. We could not have accomplished our status in the world, if it were not for a centralized government, one based on democratic beliefs and actions, supposedly controlled by the voting majority. A country without a captain at the helm (govt) , would be a chaotic society . True , the political chaos going on now is unsettling thats for sure. But if one looks at it hard, on a personal level, life today aint so bad afterall. jmo",
