   "Who knew?!?! My home was being infitrated with homosexual messages coming from Spongesquare BobPants, holding hands and all with his friend Patrick. I should have known, but it took the good doctor James Dobson of Focus on the Family to bring it to my attention.\n \n The ever-vigilant Dobson has warned me (in the knick of time, mind you) that SpongePants Squarebob has released a video along with Barney and Jimmy Neutrino, which attempts to promote TOLERANCE, but we aren't so easily fooled, no sirree Bobsquare PantsSponge.\n \n So spread the word, we need to get this boycott of SquareSponge PantsBob going, before it's too late and tolerance seeps into the minds of our innocent children.",
