   "The Killing of George Tiller: A \"Pro-life\" Murder?\n \"Pro-life\" as the self-description of the anti-abortion movement has a fundamental flaw at its heart. The moral absolute of \"life\" is not applied consistently, in my view, by the majority of those in this movement. Many in the \"pro-life\" anti-abortion movement seem to me to only be pro-life in the case of abortion -- unlike those who hold an ethic of life across a range of moral issues, not only abortion but also war and the death penalty, This makes \"pro-life\" in regard to abortion not only an inconsistent ethic, but an unstable one.\n \n Nothing exposes this fundamental inconsistency and instability in the ethic of life as a description of the anti-abortion movement more than \"pro-life\" murder.\n \n .... Violence has been a part of the anti-abortion movement from the beginning, from the overt violence of the murder of other abortion providers to the covert violence of harassing women trying to get to clinics for reproductive services.\n \n Violence is a logical outcome of the extreme self-righteousness of those who claim the \"pro-life\" label as an absolute and yet who do not have an actual, consistent ethic of life such as the views held by pacifists. Dr. Charles Kimball, a Baptist minister and professor of religion at Wake Forest University, well explains this logical connection in his book When Religion Becomes Evil. According to Kimball, two warning signs that indicate a religious viewpoint is becoming evil are \"absolute truth claims\" and \"the end justifies any means.\" Violence, in Kimball's view, is an evil.\n\n On Faith: The Killing of George Tiller: A \"Pro-life\" Murder? - Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite\n \n Murder is murder and abortion is not, to steal a phrase from Rabbi Arthur Waskow:\n \nSo another physician has been murdered for making it possible for women to actually use their constitutional right to choose an abortion.\n \n All honor to Dr. George Tiller, who joins the list of martyrs for ethical decency and human rights, killed for healing with compassion. He is a religious martyr in the fullest classical sense, killed in his own church as he arrived to worship, killed for acting in accord with his religious commitments and his moral and ethical choices.\n \n And all dishonor to those vicious attackers like Bill O'Reilly who have egged on the kind of violence that finally murdered Dr. Tiller. And who have blasphemously invoked the name of God to justify these incitements to murder.\n\n On Faith: Murder is Murder and Abortion is Not - Arthur Waskow",

   "Our very own native-born terrorists, our carefully nurtured religious extremists, our native jihadists:\n \nSunday's cowardly assassination of abortion doctor George Tiller demonstrates once again that the U.S. is not all that different from Pakistan.\n \n One thing that these two violent societies share is having a group of rabid religious fundamentalists who are each on a jihad against those in their nation with whom they disagree, and who are ready to kill and maim their enemies without mercy or hesitation. The other thing -- perhaps the more dangerous thing -- that they share is a government apparatus in which certain elements are overtly or surreptitiously supportive of the jihadists, and in which other elements are cowed into silence and inaction.\n\n Dave Lindorff: Abortion Doctor is a Victim of America&#039;s &#039;Taliban&#039; | BuzzFlash.org",

   "It is illogical to assign a 'potential life' more \"value\" than an actual life. The man who killed that doctor was a murderer. Right to Life people who try to justify his actions are hypocrites. \n \n Since a fetus is unable to exist outside of a woman's uterus, it is morally repugnant to force an actual person - a woman- to subject her own body to nuturing a life that she is not willing to carry. That doctor performed other medical treatments besides abortions. He helped women stay healthy. No one cares about that either. \n \n No one is \"for\" abortion. I have spent my entire life protecting and nuturing children, and counseled many dozens of women against having abortions.\n However, I will never support a return to the days when women were faced with no options for an unwanted pregnancy other than coat hangers and butcher shops. That is unthinkable in a democratic and supposedly civilized society. \n \n We should strive to educate our young people about real birth control and STD prevention. We should also try to help children that are already BORN and living in horrible situations. Try going to a funeral for a youngster who was killed in a drive by. \n There are people living in this country who are wondering if they can FEED their children. They are not so lucky to be sitting around fretting over the fate of the unborn. \n \n Yes, abortion is a tragedy. There are lots of tragedies in life. Taking away clean, medical options from people who are already seriously limited in their options, is NOT being helpful. Neither is sitting in judgement and thumping on your bible. \n \n Why aren't all you passionate defenders of the unborn funding research into artificial wombs (which would help premature infants also); fetal transplants (would you volunteer)? Until you come up with a way to take an embryo out of a woman's body who doesn't want it - and put it somewhere else where it can grow - than this whole debate comes down to enslaving women as social incubators, or allowing them to make a choice. \n \n God gave women free will. Who are you to take it away?",

   "Left and right...\n \nThree people have been arrested in connection with last months deadly double homicide in Arivaca that left a nine-year-old and her father dead. One of the people arrested for the homicide is the National Executive Director of the Minuteman American Defense group (M.A.D.), a group known for patrolling the border, and is dedicated to \"Defending America's Borders\" according to their website - http://minutemenamericandefense.org/\n \n Jason Eugene Bush, 38, Shawna Forde, 42 and Albert Robert Gaxiola, 43, were all taken into custody and charged in connection with the murders of 29-year-old Raul Flores and 8-year-old Brisenia Flores. Both were killed during an alleged home invasion.\n \n According to authorities, Bush, Forde, and Gaxiola broke into the home of the Flores family just after midnight on May 30th. At the time, the mother, father and daughter were home. The invaders reportedly shot the three members of the Flores family, killing the father, Raul, and the daughter, Brisenia. The invaders then left the scene.\n\n The Raw Story Minuteman leader arrested for double homicide\n \n Interesting to note that:\n \nThe group's Web site ... places the group as actively involved in the \"tea parties\" which swept right-wing media around tax day. \n\n No doubt they call themselves \"pro-lifers\" as well.\n \n My! My! My! How easy it is to get a gun in America.\n \n And what scaredy cats Americans are if they don't have their precious guns.",
