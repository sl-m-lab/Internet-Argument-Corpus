   "Greetings to All:\n \n People are saved today through obedience to the gospel, which is the 'good news' that Jesus Christ (the Son of God) was crucified for our sins on the cross at Calvary to be buried in a tomb, until on the third day God raised Him from the dead (1Cor. 15:1-4). It is not like anyone can simply pick up a book and receive salvation through acknowledging the historical record. After all, most of the people on earth have heard the story of Jesus. Paul says,\n \n \n\"How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher?\" Rom. 10:14. \n \n \n The good news of Christ dying for our sins is the message carried by the Evangelist (Eph. 4:11). He is the 'preacher' of the verse above. He is carrying the gospel message, but he is also carrying something else that the unsaved must receive to complete the process, i.e., the Holy Spirit Himself (see 1Cor. 6:19). Paul writes,\n \n \n\"For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it {the} righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, \"BUT THE RIGHTEOUS {man} SHALL LIVE BY FAITH.\" Rom. 1:16+17.\n\n \n The righteousness of God is our ticket to eternal life, and note how it is revealed from 'faith to faith.' What does this mean? It means that a spiritual transaction (redemption) is taking place every time a person 'hears' and believes the gospel unto salvation. Paul says, \"So faith {comes} from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.\" Rom. 10:17. This 'hearing' is not about physically hearing with our ears. It is about placing ourselves into the position of obedience to the message being preached. For example: \n \n Suppose you instruct your small child not to play in the street. Later on you look out the front window to find them chasing a ball across traffic. So you run out and bring him back into the yard and say at the top of your lungs, \"I told you not to cross the street, do you 'hear' me?! Of course the child hears you, because you are shouting. But, you are asking if the youngster is now willing to be obedient to your words. That is the 'hearing' of Romans 10:17. When you are willing to be obedient (Rom. 16:25-27 (26)) to the gospel, then God hands you the faith to believe it. \n \n The 'faith' to believe is the gift of God. As it is written, \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, {it is} the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.\" Eph. 2:8+9. We are introduced to God's grace by receiving that gift of faith. \"Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope of the glory of God.\" Rom. 5:1+2.\n \n The Holy Spirit travels from the body of the preacher to the body of the believer, as this spiritual transaction takes place. As it is written, \"In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation--having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of {God's own} possession, to the praise of His glory.\" Eph. 1:13+14. The words 'sealed in Him' means the Spirit of God baptized you into the body of Christ. \"For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.\" 1Cor. 12:13. Paul tells the Romans about how this process works, \n \n \n\"Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.\" Rom. 6:3+4.\n \n \n That is our spiritual baptism into His body on the cross, so that we could then die with Him, be buried with Him to also be raised with Him from the dead. God then, \"seated us with Him in the heavenly {places} in Christ Jesus.\" Eph. 2:4-7 (6). \n \n And also the Galatians, \n \n \n\"For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\" Gal. 3:26-28.\n\n \n The Apostle Paul tells us that the Spirit of God is inside us.\n \n \n\"However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him. If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.\" Rom. 8:9-11.\n\n \n Most everyone has heard this verse of Text, \"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.\" John 3:16. So there are believers and unbelievers. And look what follows shortly after, \"He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been JUDGED ALREADY, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.\" John 3:18.\n \n I submit to you that all of us are now standing before the Almighty beyond the realm of time and space. Some of us have been 'clothed with Christ,' and some are still standing naked in their sins. Take careful note of Paul's words about the saved, \n \n \n\"Blessed {be} the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly {places} in Christ, just as He chose us in Him BEFORE the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless BEFORE HIM. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in THE BELOVED.\" Eph. 1:3-6.\n\n \n Again, we are all (saved and unsaved) standing before Him and before the foundation of the world. Everyone who does not believe HAS BEEN JUDGED ALREADY, while some of us have been 'clothed with Christ' (Gal. 3:27). God's blessings are to those who are found 'in' Christ, i.e., inside of His Beloved Son. That means when God Almighty looks at us, He sees Christ. It is NOT about praying Jesus into anything! It is about hearing and believing the gospel. God Almighty has fashioned our gospel and sent it into the world so that all who believe will be saved. As it is written, \n \n \n\"For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not {come to} know God, God was well-pleased through the foolishness of the MESSAGE PREACHED to save those who believe. For indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom; but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness, but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\" 1Cor. 1:21-24.\n\n \n God's omnipresence is no guarantee of salvation to anyone. If any attribute of God could save one soul, then Christ came and died for nothing. Remember that \"we have redemption through His blood.\" Eph. 1:7 (Col. 1:20). If being a good boy could guarantee eternal life with the Almighty, then there would be no reason for Him to send Christ into creation to die for the ungodly. What does Scripture say? \"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" Rom. 6:23. Note again that eternal life is 'in' Christ Jesus our Lord. Obedience to the gospel is your ticket to being 'in' Christ. \n \n Once you are truly saved, then nothing can \"separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" Rom. 8:39. Paul writes, \n \n \"Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth. For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.\" Col. 3:1-4.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------\n \n This salvation message is from another of my posts on this form, and I consider it some of my best work. Terral\n \n Paul also had to answer the critics about the freedom He had through Grace Doctrine. Shall we sin, because we are under grace? May it never be! Before salvation the cycle of sin remains constant in the natural man's life. A true member of the body of Christ does not follow the Spirit out of fear and trembling, like a practicing Jew does the Law. We seek the things above, where Christ is BECAUSE we are forgiven, and because we are eternally grateful to our Father in heaven. \n \n He is put His Spirit in our mortal bodies, which gives us the strength to say 'No' to the flesh. How are we going to thank Him? Through the flesh? No. The regenerated man has that choice, and throughout his life will grow stronger 'in' Christ, if he will continue to feed upon His Word. Many among the denominations will never get it, because they have yet to experience the power of God's grace first hand. They practice the same rituals over and over again, and live under the persuasion of the 'deluding influence' that has them chained to their religion. \n \n The only way to break that spell is to follow the same footsteps of every soul who has heard and believed the Gospel; head straight to Calvary. Come to realize that if you were the only person living on this planet in need of a Savior, then He would still come and die for you. The thing you should be asking yourself, \" Is His blood sufficient for me? \" If you must add water baptism to Christ's shed blood, to make it good enough, then His blood is not sufficient for you. If you must add a single work to Christ's sacrifice for your redemption, then His blood is just not good enough for your justification before God. God has made the provision for all men to be saved. Men say 'No' by trying to add things to Christ's FINISHED work at Calvary. \n \n However, if you can stand at the foot of the cross and look up at Him, and say, \"Yes, God, your Son's blood is sufficient to cover my sins, and the sins of the whole world!,\" then the deluding influence will lose his power over you. The blindness of 2Cor. 4:3+4 will fall from your eyes like scales. And suddenly you also will be baptized into His body (1Cor. 12:13) on the cross, and you will die the very moment He died (Rom. 6:3). You will be laid with Him in the tomb and be there three days. And then, when God raises Christ from the dead (Rom. 6:4), then you will be raised with Him (Eph. 1:20); 'in' Him. Only then will you be seated 'in' Christ in the heavenly places (Eph. 2:4-7). And from that day forward, when God Almighty looks at you, He will see His Only Beloved Son, because you have been 'clothed with Christ.' Gal. 3:27. \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------\n \n PS. Beware of counterfeit gospel messages, because they are more numerous than one would care to count. Every presentation of the gospel should include a reference to His shed \"blood,\" that He died for our sins. How could anyone think it possible for the unsaved to simply pray Jesus into their heart?
