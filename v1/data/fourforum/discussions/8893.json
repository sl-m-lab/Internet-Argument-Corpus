   "Well, I think that the Pope was absolutely right. Well-done, he put it baldly, that's it! I totally agree with him, you see. Besides, I don't think it was offending in no way. It is the bitter truth and nothing hurts like the truth. So I think that the Pope did not have to apology for what he said. If Moslems got offended - it's their problem. It has long become clear that all Moslems are potential terrorists btw. That's all about their religion - Allah says them to kill us \"infidels\" huh. That's what proves the remarks of the Pope - after his speech a dozen of Iranian terrorist organizations (like Mujahideen Shura Council in Iraq and Al-Qaeda) promised to attack Rome and kill the Pope. That's sufficient evidence, isn't it? To crown it all, at the place where I happen to live people are often afraid to get on a bus if they see a Moslem had got on it too. What if he is a suicide terrorist, right? Damn, I wish America would cleanse the earth of this wickedness named Islam!",

   "Hi Favor.\n \n \n There is nothing wrong with picking out parts of any religious text like the Pope did. If it's written in the holy books, and not taken out of context, then there is nothing wrong with discussing it.\n \n Everyone knows the Bible is full of plenty of the same exact sort of things that the Quran and the Torah have in them. I just hope you wouldn't be offended if Muslims picked apart the Bible with all the head chopping (and throwing the heads over the walls of enemy camps), killing all the children in a village, killing everyone in a village for that matter. And Jesus said he came with a Sword to! The Torah, well, I don't know much about it, but isn't that idiot Leviticus in there? He's the one that says you should kill your disobedient children. That is extremely sick and violent if you ask me!\n \n The Pope of course is the head of the Church of the Molestors. I don't think he has a moral leg to stand on to judge anyone.",
