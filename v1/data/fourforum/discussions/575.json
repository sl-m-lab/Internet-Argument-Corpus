U.S. and U.K. leaders have repeatedly rejected that, saying the war began because Iraq held illegal weapons and threatened other countries. \n \n Blair has said he wants Iraqi oil revenues to be held in a United Nations-run trust fund and spent on rebuilding Iraq. Secretary of State Colin Powell said yesterday the U.S. may encourage Iraq to set up an oil revenue-sharing system that would distribute some proceeds from what he called the ''marvelous treasure'' to Iraqi citizens. \n \n Oil production in Iraq was halted before the U.S.-led attack that toppled President Saddam Hussein. According to UN data, the nation is losing about $55 million a day in oil revenue as the U.S., the European Union and the Iraqi people debate postwar reconstruction plans. \n \n Porritt's commission was set up in 2000 to advise the U.K. government on making economic and business activity compatible with environmental-protection policies. The body reports directly to Blair. \n \n This isn't the first time Porritt has criticized the U.K. government. In October 2000, he said Blair and his ministers had failed to fulfill election promises on ecological issues. \n \n Last Updated: May 1, 2003 06:39 EDT ",

   "Remedial education for those who think a war with Iraq is for oil:\n \n 1) The United States does NOT depend on Iraqi oil for its petroleum needs. Currently under the UN food for oil program US companies are purchasing 100,000-200,000 bbd of the 2,000,000 bbd the Iraqi government is allowed to sell. US oil companies have NEVER bought Iraqi oil directly from the Iraqi government. The Iraqi oil purchased normally goes through an oil broker, often one of the Russian oil brokerage companies. \n \n 2) The US imports less than 20% of its imported oil use from the Middle East. Primarily that oil is supplied by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Sources of American oil by amount and chart:\n \n http://www.ott.doe.gov/facts/archives/fotw246.shtml\n \n 3) An estimated 30% of Iraqi oil is sold initially to Russian firms (i.e., Emerkom, Kalymneftegas, Machinoimport, Rosnefteimpex, Sidanco, Slavneft, Soyuzneftegaz, Tatneft, and Zarubzhneft). The remaining 70% of Iraq's oil is first purchased by companies from many countries, including Cyprus, Sudan, Pakistan, China, Vietnam, Egypt, Italy, Ukraine, and others. Iraqi oil is normally then resold to a variety of oil companies and middlemen before being purchased by end users. \n \n 4) US purchases of Iraqi sourced oil was used primarily for foreign aid. Little if any was processed in the US. The bulk of the oil was for countries in Asia requiring US foreign energy assistance. Energy assistance nations include North Korea, the Philippines, and several South Asian nations.\n \n 5) US refineries are not optimized to refine Iraqi oil. Iraqi oil reserves vary widely in quality, with API gravities in the 24o to 42o range. Iraq's main export crudes come from the country's two largest active fields: Rumaila and Kirkuk. The southern Rumaila field produces three streams: Basra Regular (normally 34o API, 2.1% sulfur, but apparently deteriorating); Basra Medium (30o API, 2.6% sulfur); and Basra Heavy (22o-24o API, 3.4% sulfur). The northern Kirkuk field, first discovered in 1927, normally produces 37o API, 2% sulfur crude, although the API gravity reportedly has fallen in recent years. An additional export crude, known as \"Fao Blend,\" is heavier and more sour, with a 27o API and 2.9% sulfur.\n \n 6) Overall, the top suppliers of oil to the United States during the first nine months of 2002 were Canada (1.9 MMBD), Saudi Arabia (1.5 MMBD), Mexico (1.5 MMBD), and Venezuela (1.4 MMBD). \n \n 7) Iraq's oil supply is NOT vital to global energy supplies. While Iraq has the world's second largest \"known\" petroleum reserves it does not export enough to be a major player. Removing Iraq's oil exports will not hurt the global economy. This was proven in 1990-91 when Iraqi oil exports were cut off during their invasion of Kuwait. It was proven again after the war when Iraqi oil was sanctioned by the UN for several months. It was proven yet again in 1999 when Iraq cut off its oil exports in protest to UN actions.\n \n 8.) Iraq DOES have the ability to threaten global energy supplies. Their WMD capability threatens energy supplies from other Middle Eastern nations. The use of a bio, chemical, or nuclear weapon against a oil field, refinery, pipeline, port facility will have global and long term affects on the global economy.\n \n 9) The use of WMDs on an oil facility will result in long term clean up and maybe months to years to return production to acceptable levels.\n \n 10) The use of WMDs on these facilities will cause global insecurity concerning energy supplies.\n \n 11) The use of WMDs against these facilities will cause a MASSIVE increase in global energy prices. This increase isn't in terms of adding one or two US dollars to the cost of barrel of oil, but we are talking price increase from 500-2000%. \n \n 12) The use of WMDs on these supplies will result in a massive global shortage of energy. This will result in the cost of daily life to increase on a proportional matter. Food, clothing, electricity, gas, and transportation costs will increase 500-2000%. \n 13) That will cause a world wide economic depression that makes the 1930's look like an economic boom.\n \n 14) Unemployment and loss of economic security will be at levels never before witnessed by the modern human race.\n \n 15) The US have never taken a nation's wealth after a nation is defeated in war by the US. Take for example the cases of Germany and Japan during WW2, the US spent billions of dollars to rebuild those nations and did not take reparations.\n \n 16) The US will spend billions on rebuilding Iraq, much more than the oil that Iraq can export to the US alone.\n \n 17) The US has returned self government to all the nations the US has defeated in War.\n \n 18) The projected cost of a war against Saddam will cost US taxpayers approximately US$60-80 Billion plus US$20-40 Billion to rebuild Iraq, with a potential total cost of US$80-120 Billion. Anyone who thinks this war is for economic gain needs to go back to school to learn basic math.",
