   "Rupert Murdoch's gang of mind rapists on Fox.\n \n Rush Limbaugh.\n \n The thousands of others who daily pollute the publicly-owned airwaves and rape the minds of unsuspecting Americans who obligingly bend over and get nailed over and over again.\n \nAmerica lets radio and TV broadcasters use public airwaves worth more than half a trillion dollars for free. In return, we require that broadcasters serve the public interest: devoting at least some airtime for worthy programs that inform voters, support local arts and culture and educate our children - in other words, that aspire to something beyond just minimizing costs and maximizing revenue.\n \n Using the public airwaves is a privilege - a lucrative one - not a right, and I fear the F.C.C. has not done enough to stand up for the public interest. Our policies should reward broadcasters that honor their pledge to serve that interest and penalize those that don't.\n \n The F.C.C. already has powerful leverage to hold broadcasters to their end of the bargain. Every eight years, broadcasters must prove that they have served the public interest in order to get license renewal. If they can't, the license goes to someone else who will. It's a tough but fair system - if the commission does its job.\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/02/opinion/02copps.html\n \n Is the public being served by this endless, repetitious rape?",

   "Devil take it! Of course, conservatives have a right to free speech.\n \n But then, so do liberals but they don't get any mainstream exposure in America and right to exercise their right to free speech because American media has been taken over by extremist right wing monopolies.\n\n \n Bull pucky!!! The liberals have just as much access to the airwaves as conservatives do. The problem they have is getting free americans to waste their time listening to the hate filled drivel they spew. That has proven to be an impossible thing to accomplish, but that isn't anyones fault but the lefts who have no message worth adhering to. \n \n Remember Air America? It had millions of dollars invested in it and was offered time slots on hundreds of stations nation wide to start with? But lo and behold, advertisers refused to support it because listenership was nil. Even liberals can't stand to listen to the drivel these mooks spew.\n \n \nUm, the fairness doctrine. But, I guess the idea of fair play is totally a foreign idea to you, OS.\n\n \n Fair play? Fair play to a leftist is forcing their philosophy down the throats of everyone else whether they like it or not. Making it in a free market place without government protection is considered an unfair practice to you philosophical cowards.\n \n \nOnly the monopolistic bully boy thing for you. It's so stinkin' manly.\n \n And, in truth, cowardly, because all bullies are shrinking little cowards inside.\n\n \n There's nothing bully boy about competing in the free market and having what you offer accepted by the masses. That's capitalism; which is why it offends you, right? What is so pathetic is that you refuse to admit that your liberal sources fail at every turn even though they are still being pushed on cable and the networks. Just look at the ratings for MSNBC, FOX, and CNN. Are you implying that FOX has some monopoly which prevents people from watching the other two networks? Because we know better, don't we! The fact is that the same can be said for CBS, NBC and ABC also. None of these state media centers can compete with the independent FOX NETWORK which just reports and let's us decide. \n \n Here simone, here are the current cable news ratings for all of the shows and time slots you will recognize as of thursday, Dec 3rd. I intentionally used a regular news day of no consequence. Read it and weep, and I know you will weep when you see how FOX destroys the competition in virtually every single category and time slot. Now go on and claim they have some unfair advantage or monopoly, I dare you... emoticon_xdonno http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/12/04/cable-news-ratings-for-thursday-december-3-2009/35325 And here's a graph if you're capable of understanding it: http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/12/03/fox-news-near-2009-primetime-ratings-peak-while-msnbc-cnn-are-atnear-lows/35169",

The evidence to support programming is collected by the operator and then is reviewed by the FCC. The operator is in violation of law, not just contractual obligation regarding what it airs. The wording nor the remedies available to the FCC don't prohibit the operator from expressing it's right to free speech, which in turn doesn't guarantee the right to say whatever whenever.

   "\n I'm talking about mainstream America, where people are poorly educated. And, poorly informed, especially if they watch Faux News all day.\n\n \n <Flush<\n \n Republicans Better Educated\n \n Republicans in the general public tend to be better educated than Democrats. In the 1994-2002 General Social Surveys (GSS), Republicans have over 6/10ths of a year more education on average than Democrats. Republicans also have a higher final mean educational degree. Further, Republicans scored better than Democrats on two word tests in the GSS--a short vocabulary test and a modified analogies test.\n \n If one breaks down the data by party affiliation and political orientation, the most highly educated group is conservative Republicans, who also score highest on the vocabulary and analogical reasoning tests. Liberal Democrats score only insignificantly lower than conservative Republicans. The least educated subgroups are moderate and conservative Democrats, who also score at the bottom (or very near the bottom) on vocabulary and analogy tests. - Prof. Jim Lindgren, law professor at Northwestern University and director of the Demography of Diversity Project\n \n More below:\n \n VDARE.com: 11/14/04 - The 2004 IQ Wars: So Much For The Candidates-What About The Voters?\n \n Conservatives and Christians Give More to Charities, ABC says\n \n As Doug explores in his post below, people of faith give far more to charities than non-religious people, and conservatives give more to the poor than do liberals. That's the finding of a study by author Arthur Brooks and the conclusion trumpeted by a John Stossel report on ABC this week. \n The report says: \n \"The single biggest predictor of whether someone will be charitable is his or her religious participation. Religious people are more likely to give to charity, and when they give, they give more money: four times as much. And Arthur Brooks told me that giving goes beyond their own religious organization: \"Actually, the truth is that they're giving to more than their churches,\" he says. \"The religious Americans are more likely to give to every kind of cause and charity, including explicitly non-religious charities.\"\n Christian conviction and conservative ideology increases the likelihood that an individual will give to charities-and not just to their churches, but to a variety of religious and secular causes. \n As Christians, we give out of obligation-Scripture tells us to help the poor-but even more out of gratitude to God for his goodness. \n \n Liberals who see care for the poor as a government responsibility, give far less as individuals. At the same time, they describe conservatives as non-caring, and Christians as exclusionary and hypocritical. This could not be further from the truth, and these findings document it. \n \n Stones Cry Out: Conservatives and Christians Give More to Charities, ABC says\n \n Liberals are uneducated tightwads.",

   "Does that include Sen. Robert \"KKK\" Byrd, too? ;)\n\n \n And don't forget Al Gore Sr led the fight for the democrats in their unified fight against the civil rights act and integration right up until 1964 when Johnson submitted a watered down version of the much stronger bill the Republicans had before him. They only did this because the national public outcry became more than the democrats could continue to squash and avoid. I marvel at how the blacks have been such staunch supporters of the party which held them down for so long and has continued to do for decades by making political promises every 4 years which they never fulfilled. All they have done for minorities is create a welfare state which held them in poverty.",
