   "Lesbian couple files for first same-sex divorce in Canada\n TORONTO (AP) - A lesbian couple is seeking what is believed to be Canada's first same-sex divorce in Ontario Superior Court. \n The women, identified according to their lawyers' initials as M.M., a 41-year-old born in Toronto, and J.H., a 61-year-old born in Ottawa, were married on June 18, 2003, one week after the Ontario Court of Appeal legalized same-sex marriage in the province. \n \n The couple separated five days after the wedding, ending an almost 10-year relationship, J.H.'s lawyer Julie Hannaford said. \n \n \"This is the first same-sex divorce case in Canada to our knowledge,\" M.M.'s lawyer, Martha McCarthy, said in court documents. \n \n The petition, filed in the Superior Court of Justice last month, was to be heard Sept. 13. It will add a new facet to the contentious legal debate over same-sex marriage. The Supreme Court of Canada is holding hearings on the legality of same-sex marriages in the fall. \n \n The ruling Liberal government has vowed to legalize same-sex marriage across the country although polls have shown about half of Canadians are against the move. \n \n So far, courts in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and the Yukon territory - overseeing some 70% of the country's 31 million people - have ruled that the right for gays and lesbians to marry is guaranteed by the Canadian constitution's Charter of Rights. \n \n However, the federal Divorce Act hasn't been amended to apply to same-sex couples. \n \n M.M. and her lawyer are asking the court to grant the divorce and declare the Divorce Act's definition of spouse unconstitutional. The divorce law defines a spouse as \"a man or woman who are married to each other.\" \n \n The government says it wants to go further and strike down the entire definition of spouse in the act. \n \n M.M. said the couple have no possibility of reconciliation. They signed a separation agreement on April 30. Grounds for divorce in Canada are separation, adultery and cruelty.\n \n \n http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2004-07-22-divorce_x.htm\n \n \n \n Dear Dr. Harley,\n I've often heard that living together before marriage is perilous and that statistics bear that out. My friend is planning to move in with his girlfriend. I told him what I've heard but have not actually seen these statistics. He questioned my stats, imagine that! If it's not too much trouble I would appreciate any hard info on these stats and their sources. \n \n Thanks in advance. \n \n W.K.\n \n \n \n Dear W.K.,\n My own numbers (85% failure rate among those who live together before marriage), comes from my own research and extrapolations of studies I've read in the past. Since I have not published any of these, nor do I intend to publish them, I'll direct you to some recent studies done by others. \n \n One study that you may find interesting was done by Bennett, Blan, and Bloom (American Sociological Review, 1988, Vol 53: 127-138) entitled, \"Commitment and the Modern Union: Assessing the Link Between Premarital Cohabitation and Subsequent Marital Stability.\" \n \n The point made by the authors is that, overall, the risk of divorce after living together is 80% higher than the risk of divorce after not living together, which is already too high. In other words, those who live together before marriage are almost twice as likely to divorce than those who did not live together. But they also point out that the risk of divorce is even higher if you don't live together more than three years prior to marriage. The longer you live together prior to marriage, the less the risk of divorce until after 8 years of living together, when the risk of divorce is equal to those who have not lived together. \n \n Another interesting study was conducted by Hall and Zhao (Cohabitation and Divorce in Canada, Journal of Marriage and the Family, May 1995: 421-427). They write, \n \n \n The popular belief that cohabitation is an effective strategy in a high-divorce society rests on the common-sense notion that getting to know one another before marrying should improve the quality and stability of marriage. However, in this instance, it is looking more and more as if common sense is a poor guide.\n Their study showed that cohabitation itself was shown to account for a higher divorce rate, rather than factors that might have led to cohabitation, such as parental divorce, age at marriage, stepchildren, religion, and other factors. In other words, other factors being equal, you are much more likely to divorce if you live together first. \n \n DeMaris and MacDonald (Premarital Cohabitation and Marital Instability: A Test of the unconventionality Hypothesis, Journal of Marriage and the Family, May 1993: 399-407), echo Hall and Zhao. They found that the unconventionality of those who live together does not explain their subsequent struggle when married. There is something about living together first that creates marital problems later. They write: \n \n \n Despite a widespread public faith in premarital cohabitation as a testing ground for marital incompatibility, research to date indicates that cohabitors' marriages are less satisfactory and more unstable than those of noncohabitors.\n Undoubtedly there are some self-selection factors that make people who live together more prone to marital problems later. But the gist of current research is that these factors are not enough to explain the astonishingly huge effect. Simply stated, if you live together before marriage, you will be fighting an uphill battle to save your marriage. \n \n If you like to spend your evenings hidden among the periodicals of your local library, here are some other studies that show how risky it is to live together before marriage: \n \n \n Balakrishnan, Rao, et. al., (1987) A hazard model analysis of the covariates of marriage dissolution in Canada.

   "Until statistics for Mass. are available, the closest thing we may have to compare to heterosexual marriages are gay civil unions in Vermont.\n \n On another thread, mana'ia brought up the issue that civil union divorces have occured. I didn't have the statistics on me at that moment, but mentioned that I was aware civil union divorces happened very rarely. Mana'ia quickly became quiet on the issue. I believe he had looked up the statistics for himself.\n \n Here are those statistics now, compared to heterosexual marriage divorces in Vermont....\n \n \n For 2002, the divorce rates....\n \n Civil Union divorce rate= 0.53% \n \n Marriage divorce rate= 42.47%\n \n http://www.gaydemographics.org/USA/states/vermont/2000Census_state_vt_civilunions.htm\n \n Poor Mana'ia is left clinging to every gay divorce that happens, only hoping and praying there will be more, which I guess is an attempt to prove that heterosexuals are superior. If divorce rates prove one group has superior relationships to another group, that must mean that gay relationships are superior.",
