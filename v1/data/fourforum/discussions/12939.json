   "\"Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come\" for starters. \n\n \n Great point Jo, now post where I stated a day and hour when the Lord is returning and you will then be making a valid point for once. How is stating that I believe the Apocalypse will occur in our lifetime placing a day and time to the event? Have you forgotten that the NT also says this?\n 1Pe 5:8 Be vigilant, watch. Your adversary [the] devil as a roaring lion walks about seeking whom he may devour. \n Don't you think that God wants us to watch the signs of the times so we recognize when He will be returning to us?\n \n Jesus also said this in Matt 24 which is a last days prophecy. Maybe you should read the whole chapter:\n Mat 24:42 \"Therefore be on the alert, for you do not know which day your Lord is coming. \n Mat 24:43 \"But be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what time of the night the thief was coming, he would have been on the alert and would not have allowed his house to be broken into. \n Mat 24:44 \"For this reason you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not think {He will.} \n \n \nPlus the fact that people have been predicting the apocalypse \"within our lifetime\" for almost 2000 years. \n\n \n Yeah, so what? All that means is that we are a lot closer to His return today than they were then. How is this any type of argument that He couldn't be returning in our lifetime?\n \n \nNot to say it won't happen, but to make such a declaration is arrogant in the extreme, perhaps to the point of blasphemy, in claiming to know the mind of God.\n\n \n Arrogant? Really? Blasphemous? You don't say! What is arrogant or blasphemous in any way about stating my beliefs based on my interpretation of the end times prophecies? And how is it claiming to know the mind of God in any way? Didn't I quote passages above where God commands us to be alert and vigilant in watching for the signs of His return? \n \n You constantly disappoint me Jo in your consistant spiritual blindness and shallowness as you ignore so much of Gods word as it applies to a well rounded perspective regarding the relationship He desires to have with us.\n \n Here, seriously, give it a read in context, as just one prophecy, and tell me I'm wrong in daring to state my beliefs.\n Blue Letter Bible - Gospel of Matthew 24 (NASB - New American Standard Bible)",

In order for him to do this the temple has to be rebuilt. In order for the temple to be rebuilt the right kind of sacrificial cow has to be used. It has to do with the purification of the temple. As commanded by the law of Moses.\n \n Red Heifer - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \nThe existence of a red heifer that conforms with all of the rigid requirements imposed by halakha is a biological anomaly. The animal must be entirely of one color, and there are a series of tests listed by the rabbis to ensure this, for instance, the hair of the cow must be absolutely straight (to ensure that the cow had not previously been yoked, as this is a disqualifier). According to Jewish tradition, only nine Red Heifers were actually slaughtered in the period extending from Moses to the destruction of the Second Temple. Mishnah Parah recounts eight, stating that Moses prepared the first, Ezra the second, Simon the Just and Yochanan the High Priest prepared two each, and Eliechonnai ben Hakkot and Hanameel the Egyptian prepared one each. (Mishna Parah 3:4)\n \n The absolute rarity of the animal, combined with the mystical ritual in which it is used, have given the Red Heifer special status in Jewish tradition. It is cited as the prime example of a chok, or biblical law for which there is no apparent logic, and is therefore of absolute Divine origin. Because the state of ritual purity obtained through the ashes of a Red Heifer is a necessary prerequisite for participating in any Temple service, efforts have been made in modern times by Jews wanting to rebuild the Temple to locate a red heifer and recreate the ritual. Most recently, a cow that was considered a potential candidate was disqualified because it sprouted several black hairs\n\n \n So no red cow, no rebuilt temple, no anti christ.",

Oh yeah...by fighting Al Qaeda in Iraq we were just making more terrorists (how many times has this little jem been pulled out). So logic dictates that by fighting them in Afghanistan, we make them happy and less likely to want to kill us, right? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Yes, I am. The reason I am asking you is simple. Just what good do you think that would actually do in the way of stemming the tide of terrorism? Al Qaeda isn't so much of a group as it is an ideology. Islamic terrorism is real target...Al Qaeda just scratches the surface. If we are going to give up fighting in Iraq, why not give up fighting in Afghanistan as well. What makes Afghanistan more justified than Iraq? If we are not going to go after ALL islamic extremists, we might as well call it a day and bring everyone home for a beer at the VFW.\n \n Expand your viewpoint a little and look at the big picture",
