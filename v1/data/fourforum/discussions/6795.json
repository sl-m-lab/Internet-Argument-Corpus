   "To me chemical weapons are more like Nerve Gas, Sarin etc. White phosphorus and Mark 77 firebombs ( New and improved Napalm ) are horrific weapons and were banned from using on live targets.\n \n White phosphorus though in action is more like an explosive or just being dosed with gasoline. The horrible thing is that using water to put out the burning only makes it worse.\n \n That the US military has been using WP and Napalm in Iraq should have been widely known. On a US news channel I remember seeing a tank firing a WP round into a house, leaving the very burnt remains of those within. Also on Iraqi Dispatch you can see the remains of Iraqi's from Fallujah who were very dead and very burnt.",
