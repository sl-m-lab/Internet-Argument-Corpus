   "Any more questions on the country where all of our National Guard should be permanently stationed?\n\n \n No kidding. \n \n With the guard already at maximum deployment (our local group...radar maintenance techs usually, are manning looter patrol right now....A friend in the unit told me \"it is the first time they have ever issued me a weapon\"), it will be interesting to see how they deal with Rita. Resources are already stretched to the max dealing with Katrina.\n \n Rita has a couple of things in its favor, though, at least response wise. First, Theya re already setting up a response as opposed to waiting until it is over. Second, nobody in texas was stupid enough ot build, and then maintain, a city below sea level. \n \n On the downside, we are already devoting significant resources to katrina, and our refinery repair types are already busy in lousiana, so any refinery outages in texas are not likely to be quick (can you say $4 gas??)",

These people should not be lumped together with the XXXXXX and lazy buggers who couldn't be shitted to leave.\n\n \n Houston is a slightly different situation than New Orleans. While new orleans is below seal level, houston is not. Just this single fact makes a hurricane in houston more survivable than one in New Orleans. Additionally, Houston has MUCH, MUCH stricter building codes than New Orleans. The buildings in Houston are built to withstand a category 4 storm. Flood waters in houston will drain on their own, they don't have to be pumped out. \n \n I know a few people in houston who are not leaving. One is my uncle. He is a surgeon and feels morally compelled to stay around to help with casualties. One is an older couple that tried to get out yesterday, and after spending the entire day on the highway, they had only made it about 15 miles, and things were getting WORSE. They were at 1/4 tank of gas, and decided that weathering the storm in the city would be better than trying to weather it in their car on the highway somewhere, and that it would be better to conserve that last bit of gas than run out of gas on the highway, so they got off and went home. The third guy I know who is staying is staying to keep an eye on his business. That is kind of a unique situation in that his business, due to some of the equipment they use and hazards associated with their processes, has 10 inch thick reinforced concrete walls and a 6\" concrete deck for the roof. He is trying to get their warehouse area cleaned out to use as a shelter if need be after the storm. My uncle and the old couple I mentioned earlier are going to stay with him and his family at the plant during the hurricane. I am not particularly worried about their safety (the building is designed to withstand a direct hit from a tornado with only cosmetic damage).",

With Katrina, a third of my state's National Guard is now deployed. And those are what's called the effective portion, including their transportation equipment, Humvees and trucks that are the mainstay of disaster relief. An additional 1,000 were sent to LA via aircraft, and reports are already coming back about lack of on-site transportation. \n \n According to a local office for the district's congressional representative, emails and calls with demands to return our National Guard from Iraq are steadily increasing as Katrina has made people realize the feds have put all states in a precarious position in the event of a disaster.",

I have nothing but sympathy for all of those people who are trying to get out and are stuck along the highway. Like Katrina, I imagine many lessons will be learned with this evacuation, and hopefully in the future it will go better. It does already show that a significantly larger percentage of the population is heeding the evac order, which is a refreshing revelation. I have absolutely no problem with doctors, nurses, police, emergency service workers, and any other essential personel staying, that is their job. \n \n That being said, there is still that small percentage of stubborn, foolish people who refuse to leave their homes. I actually saw some guy on the news this morning talking about how he was praying, and that god will protect him, so there is no need for him to leave. In my opinion, that is pure lunacy.

He heard a radio report that the river was going to rush up and flood the town. And that all the residents should evacuate their homes. But the man said, 'I'm religious. I pray. God loves me. God will save me.' The waters rose up. A guy in a row boat came along and he shouted, 'Hey, hey you! You in there. The town is flooding. Let me take you to safety.' But the man shouted back, 'I'm religious. I pray. God loves me. God will save me.' A helicopter was hovering overhead. And a guy with a megaphone shouted, 'Hey you, you down there. The town is flooding. Let me drop this ladder and I'll take you to safety.' But the man shouted back that he was religious, that he prayed, that God loved him and that God will take him to safety. Well... the man drowned. And standing at the gates of St. Peter, he demanded an audience with God. 'Lord,' he said, 'I'm a religious man, I pray. I thought you loved me. Why did this happen?' God said, 'I sent you a radio report, a helicopter, and a guy in a rowboat. What the hell are you doing here?\n",
