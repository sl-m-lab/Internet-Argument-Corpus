   "Actually Wez, you may have got me on that one. It is hard to find a link more than a year old where MJ comments on anything. However, in his case, most of the time it is someone else doing the talking for him anyway. The point is, he uses his financial situation (ie. a financial consultant giving sworn testimony for the defense during his trial about MJ being in financial straights). Now you have to believe that this was a ploy to garner sympathy for the aging pop star who was so devastated over the charges he was facing that he could not even manage his own money.\n\n \n It wasn't meant to be a counter-argument, I was just wondering if it was something the media had concocted, or whether there was any truth in the matter.:)\n \n -Wez",

   " Now you have to believe that this was a ploy to garner sympathy for the aging pop star who was so devastated over the charges he was facing that he could not even manage his own money.\n\n \n I doubt that he ever managed his own money. An estate that size requires professional management. Figure a business manager, a full-time accountant and three clerical support people for day-to-day activity. A tax professional for quarterly and year-end tax filings, maybe five hours/wk, and retained legal counsel for performing/financial contracts and tax matters. He's still trying to live at a standard from when his income was based on investments and superstar status. He hasn't had any performing income to amount to anything for several years but we don't know what his current overhead is or his actual income. Everyone he employs would be under a non-disclosure contract that would destroy them if they broke it.",

Twenty-some years? He's had a longer childhood than anyone on earth. It's time to grow up.",

   "I'll go for innocent on serious charges.\n \n I think the guy's crazy, but I don't think he's a paedophile.\n \n -Wez\n\n \n Funny, the jurors disagreed in post trial interviews. They think he is a paedophile, but that the state didn't show it in this case.\n \n I had read the original complaint. Very weak case. Not sure why they even bothered. I had hoped with the witness and evidence tampering indictments tacked on at the last minute they had their ace in the hole for getting him on something.",
