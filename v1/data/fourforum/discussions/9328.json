If the government only gave civil unions to everyone (heteros and gays alike) and the churches got to do the religious side of it, Civil Unons would be excellent. Unfortunately, those opposing gay marriage would never agree to such a thing.\n \n \nMany who voted for this said as much. They're hoping that in a few years gays will actually get full rights.

It's just that they're trying to impose their religious beliefs into the political arena. They want their religion to carry the weight of law. If only they would stop to consider what can happen when you go down that path. Like you said, no one is trying to stop churches from performing whatever ceremonies they like; that's a protected right that no one wants to touch. But once you start basing laws on religion that right becomes seriously undermined. If you start dragging religion into law, at some point you have to say which religion you're basing laws on. At this point it's Christianity, but not all Christian sects believe the same things. Pretty soon you could have one sect saying that it should be their beliefs over some other sect's that laws should be based on. If they get their way that would lead essentially to government endorsement of one specific sect, and then so much for the freedoms of those who believe differently...",
