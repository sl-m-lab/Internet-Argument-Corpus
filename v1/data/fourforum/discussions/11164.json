It was very good, not a comedy as some may attempt to describe it. It had a little of Ben Stein's mysteriousness and humor to it, but it was generally serious, and some may say, depressing. It was nice to see the people whose writings I had seen on the net, but had never seen speak before or even a picture of - Myers, Ruse, Berlinski, etc. \n \n I'll address the six points from your first link, that's all I have time for tonight. \n \n 1) Nitpicking. The movie wasn't attempting to link euginics and the holocaust to Darwin himself nearly as much as it was showing its relationship with Darwinism in general. \n \n I don't think linking Darwinism and societal atrocities are an unprovoked first assertion.

It's up to anyone who actually watched the movie to decide if these people just weren't intelligent enough to make the grade, while ALL the Ward Churchill's of the academic world seldom seem to have any problems. \n \n 5) \n....Expelled frequently repeats that design-based explanations (not to mention religious ones) are \"forbidden\" by \"big science.\" It never explains why, however. Evolution and the rest of \"big science\" are just described as having an atheistic preference. \n\n \n HELLO!! THAT'S WHY!!

This isn't an example of one Holocaust-like instance of mass death; no, this is continual, yet nobody has made a fuss about it in the scientific community.

However only 210Po haloes are found along such cracks. 210Po has longest half life (138 days) of the Po isotopes involved in these haloes.\n Reference: Polonium Radiohalos: Still \"A Very Tiny Mystery\" by Andrew Snelling, ICR Impact #326.

The biotite formed metamorphically as minerals in the walls of the dike migrated into the calcite. Biotite from the Faraday Mine came from a granite pegmatite which intruded a paragneiss which formed from highly metamorphosed sediments. Thus all of the locations Gentry examined show evidence of an extensive history predating the formation of the micas; they show an appearance of age older than the three minutes his polonium halo theory allows. It is possible God created this appearance of age, but that reduces Gentry's argument to the omphalos argument, for which evidence is irrelevant.\n While Talk Origins may have a point here, it needs to be noted the alleged evidence for extensive history assumes uniformitarian geology.

The prepared fossil specimen was flexible, but actual cellular material was not present. The paper is open access here. Again you present your faith as fact.

Schweitzer,1,2,3* Jennifer L. Wittmeyer,1 John R. Horner,3 Jan K. Toporski4\n Soft tissues are preserved within hindlimb elements of Tyrannosaurus rex (Museum of the Rockies specimen 1125). Removal of the mineral phase reveals transparent, flexible, hollow blood vessels containing small round microstructures that can be expressed from the vessels into solution. Some regions of the demineralized bone matrix are highly fibrous, and the matrix possesses elasticity and resilience. Three populations of microstructures have cell-like morphology. Thus, some dinosaurian soft tissues may retain some of their original flexibility, elasticity, and resilience.\n \nPoint 3: Argument from personal incredulity.

They extracted viable and testable material otherwise this wouldn't have been a story of interest to anyone at all. \n  \n In a related study, a team led by Mary Higby Schweitzer of North Carolina State University conducted tests that also revealed the presence of collagen in the T. rex remains.\n \n In one experiment, antibodies that normally react in the presence of chicken collagen reacted strongly to the dinosaur protein, suggesting a similar molecular identity.\n \n For the protein sequencing study, Asara's team isolated seven fragmentary chains of amino acids&#8212;the building blocks of proteins&#8212;from the T. rex specimen. \n http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/04/070412-dino-tissues.html\n \n So pandion, learn, then speak.\n \n And by the way, i'm not the only sceptic regarding this discovery.

But if they are right, then we all need to rethink how molecules survive in the geological environment.\"\n \n Schweitzer and her collaborators, including paleontologist John Horner of Montana State University, agree that their discovery should prompt such a rethinking, which could lead to changes in how fieldwork is conducted.\n Regarding the bolded above, What amazes me about such seemingly intelligent people is that they will rethink how molecules survive in the geological environment rather than consider that their dating techniques are irreparably flawed and the T-Rex isn't anywhere near 70 million years old.

They clearly stated that some material was present that displayed elasticity and flexibility. They did not claim the material was original. They stated that after preperation of the specimen (demineralization) some fibrous material was present. As pandion pointed out they only recovered a few protien fragments. There is no dino DNA (much as I wish there were).

Oh the ocean that he didn't believe existed (the 'huge pacific area') was called Tethys, and encircled the entire planet (The remenants are in Tunisa amongst other places).

You probably think it's the devil, and that's tragic. In response to your (rather predictable) threat of hell-fire, I'll merely say that if God judges you on whether you belong to his club or not, then that's kind of a sad judgement on creation...\n \n \nWhat amazes me about such seemingly intelligent people is that they will rethink how molecules survive in the geological environment rather than consider that their dating techniques are irreparably flawed and the T-Rex isn't anywhere near 70 million years old. That is the only rational explanation for this evidence.\n\n \n It amazes me how you manage to jump to the wrong conclusion so often. Given all the supporting data for an old earth doesn't it seem more logical that we don't yet understand the process, rather than all the other data is wrong based on this one off?",

What's not amazing to me at all is that you expect scientists to look at one interesting occurrence and -- instead of analyzing what we've thought to be true -- throw out all of the data we have that confirms radiometric dating's accuracy and geologic time scales. This is like punching \"2+2=\" into a calculator and getting \"4\" ten thousand times, then getting a \"0\" once due to a strange anomaly and declaring that we have sufficient reason to disbelieve that four is the correct answer.\n\n \n Your analogy fails on all levels as usual. And it isn't even rational because nothing about evo has been proven absolutely at all, which means it's all just wishful thinking on your part, which I've been patiently explaining to you forever now, it seems. \n \n I mean, you're acting like tons of 70 million year old fossils have given testing results and I'm saying this one destroys that track record because it doesn't. That would be a valid analogy.
