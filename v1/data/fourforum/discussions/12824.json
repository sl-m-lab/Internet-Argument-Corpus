   "  Prosecutor targeting teen gun crime \n With his staff on track to file twice as many juvenile cases in adult court this year compared with last year, King County Prosecutor Dan Satterberg is searching for ways to stiffen penalties faced by violent teenagers. .....\n \n Of 19 cases so far this year that Satterberg transferred from juvenile to felony court - the same number as in all of last year - the majority have involved guns and gangs. .....\n \n Satterberg, who serves on the state Sentencing Guidelines Commission, said he would like to see a change in sentences for all juveniles linked to gun crimes, not just the ones with a prior criminal history or who have used the gun to commit another crime, such as a robbery.\n\n However, I personally don't believe that the prosecutors call for changes in sentences for all juveniles linked to gun crimes holds any water. Gun crimes involving teens just can't happen! We have already crated laws against teens owning guns. Therefore it just can't be happening! We already took care of this problem by making a law! emoticon_smile",

Apparently they have some use for semi-autos afterall.[/quote] \n \n \n Still trying to abuse gun trace data I see and speaking from the other side of your mouth advocating gun/Constitutional abuse.\n \n You are clueless - CLUELESS: THE MISUSE OF BATF FIREARMS TRACING DATA\n \n \nStated less delicately, the FBI's statistical experts do not believe that gun traces provide reliable information about the general use of guns in crime. Lobbyists and politicians who attempt to use trace data for this purpose should explain why they think that they are right and the FBI is wrong. \n To advocates of restrictive gun laws, BATF traces are like psychoanalyst's inkblots: the viewer always finds in them exactly what he wants to see. Thus, BATF traces are used to create allegedly \"scientific\" data to promote the banning of small and inexpensive guns, [65] to demonize certain large handguns, [66] to prove that the Brady Act is working, [67] to prove that the federal assault weapons ban is working, [68] to prove that more controls are needed on \"assault weapons,\" [69] to make the case for eliminating firearms dealer licenses for persons who operate small businesses from their home, [70] and to prove that gun rationing laws work. [71]\n \n The (mis)use of BATF tracing reports by gun control lobbyists has often worked. The federal \"assault weapons\" ban, the Virginia gun rationing law, and the federal elimination of home-based businesses from the ranks of licensed firearms dealers all became law with the significant help of claims made about BATF traces. Proposals for further controls, such as federal licensing of gun owners, federal gun purchase rationing, and state and federal bans on small handguns are all predicated on the allegedly scientific information derived from BATF traces.\n\n \n The burden of proof re:Reynosa gun seizure is your problem to justify any attempt to limit 2A rights of American citizens. You are going to have a problem and you know it, that is why you post your propaganda and run! emoticon_xbye",

   "This is interesting!\n   Boys with 'Warrior Gene' More Likely to Join Gangs \n Boys who have a so-called \"warrior gene\" are more likely to join gangs and also more likely to be among the most violent members and to use weapons, a new study finds. \n \n \"While gangs typically have been regarded as a sociological phenomenon, our investigation shows that variants of a specific MAOA gene, known as a 'low-activity 3-repeat allele,' play a significant role,\" said biosocial criminologist Kevin M. Beaver of Florida State University. \n \n \"Previous research has linked low-activity MAOA variants to a wide range of antisocial, even violent, behavior, but our study confirms that these variants can predict gang membership,\" says Beaver, the Florida State researcher. \"Moreover, we found that variants of this gene could distinguish gang members who were markedly more likely to behave violently and use weapons from members who were less likely to do either.\"\n\n So there is a nature component making nurturing even more important. People of the Left, isn&#8217;t this what you claim to be good at? Making a good peace loving society? I say it is time for you community organizers to do some REAL work, rather than trying to find scams in order to take 2nd Amendment Rights away from the law-abiding, who obviously are NOT the problem.\n \n Or is the later the ONLY thing you care about?\n \n You do know, if you do not fix the underlying problems of crime and violence, you are only going to have a worse problem if We the People were stupid enough to let you disarm them. These vicious predators will have a field day, with the weak, not to mention the elderly which are a disproportionate number of society today. \n \n The police can't be everywhere, and it is a constitutional fact that they do not have to protect each individual. Just the community at large.\n \n Or does this study only make your desire to CONTROL us even more acute? Some Testing and controlling, making a never ending list of unenforceable laws! \n \n You do know that most of society is wired the exact same way with absolutely no adverse aggression problems. It is called business!",

The Mexican military and some of our own law enforcement are complicit in drug related crime...and gun smuggling or else it would not exist. Your weak attempts to blame the 2A and folks who exercise their rights instead of the criminals is a rather tiring exercise in futility.\n \n You are the one who keeps parroting canned anti rights responses and getting them disproven and shoved back from whence they came.

A purpose-built 9mm handgun, which is easier to conceal than a shotgun, is available for \u00a31,000-\u00a31,400 on the back streets of Britain while those wanting \"a gangster image\" can buy a  machine gun  for \u00a3800.\n Even though those interviewed were in prison, many still viewed gun crime as a \"viable career option\" enabling them to overcome their deprived backgrounds to secure wealth and status.

It also pointed to a large firearms black market. \n \n Almost two-thirds had been bought illegally from friends, family or on the street, with an even higher proportion, 66 per cent, of knives coming from illicit sources. And many carried their weapons regularly despite tough laws against possession in public places. Almost one-third of knife-owning prisoners regularly went out on the streets with their weapons tucked into pockets, boots, clothing or bags, while 14 per cent of gun owners said they carried their firearms with them.

War on Guns and Days of Our Trailers have more.\n \n Basically, he&#8217;s saying, &#8220;OK&#8212;the &#8216;90%&#8217; thing was a lie, but take our word for it that too many American guns are being smuggled to Mexico, so freedom in the U.S. has to be curtailed.&#8221;\n \n Now AG Eric Holder has joined in, saying essentially the same thing.\n \n Some question that figure, since not all seized weapons are traced, but when asked whether the figure is a myth, Mr. Holder replied that, regardless of the actual statistic, the vast majority of weapons, particularly the high-powered ones, are coming from the US and are aggravating the Mexican government&#8217;s efforts.\n \n Never mind the numbers (now that you&#8217;ve caught us lying about them)&#8212;they&#8217;re still too high!\n \n By the way, at the same news conference, according to the Washington Post, Holder claimed that the U.S. is not seeking to implement more restrictive gun legislation (despite Holder, most of the rest of the Obama administration, the White House itself, etc., being reliable advocates for just that).\n \n Holder agreed that the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of weapons used by the cartels come from north of the border. &#8220;This is a reality we have to face in the United States,&#8221; Holder said, adding that the United States is not seeking to change any of its gun laws to slow weapons smuggling.\n \n &#8220;I don&#8217;t think our Second Amendment will stand in the way of what we have begun,&#8221; Holder said.\n \n The thing is, when Holder says that he doesn&#8217;t think that the &#8220;Second Amendment will stand in the way . . . &#8221; it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean he&#8217;s ruling out draconian gun laws. He signed an amicus brief taking the position that the Second Amendment wouldn&#8217;t &#8220;stand in the way&#8221; of D.C.&#8216;s complete ban of handguns. He, in fact, even after the Heller decision, has expressed the belief that the Second Amendment will pose no obstacle to banning &#8220;cop killer&#8221; bullets (whatever those are), closing the mythical &#8220;gun show loophole,&#8221; and banning so-called &#8220;assault weapons.&#8221;\n \n Why should we believe anything he and his ideological allies say?",

The greatest increase was in retail handgun sales, which were up 3%. Long gun sales were up 1.8%. Ammunition sales were up 3.5%.\n \n Wagner specified that these figures represent dollars generated, not actual volume of firearms and ammunition sold.\n \n However, the bottom line is that there are millions more firearms in circulation, which some gun control advocates have been arguing for years would result in more death and crime.\n \n Said Wagner: &#8220;The point of that release was just to help the media understand that the guys at the Violence Policy Center and Brady Center are selling a lie when they continue to tell people that more guns equals more bad news.&#8221;\n \n See I can use \"unbiast\" sources too!",

Thus, BATF traces are used to create allegedly \"scientific\" data to promote the banning of small and inexpensive guns, [65] to demonize certain large handguns, [66] to prove that the Brady Act is working, [67] to prove that the federal assault weapons ban is working, [68] to prove that more controls are needed on \"assault weapons,\" [69] to make the case for eliminating firearms dealer licenses for persons who operate small businesses from their home, [70] and to prove that gun rationing laws work.

Are you trying to tell me that in California you can own an AR rifle, and it doesn't have to be registered at all?\n \n \nMe too. What you call punishing law-abiding gun owners I call regulation.\n\n \n And I call it unnecessary and an infringement on our rights! And I'm more than tired of having to point out this fact every single day. From now on it's up to you to try and prove the point. You want more gun control in this country, it's for you to prove that the problems you perceive are serious enough that we absolutely must enact further restrictions on the few rights we have left because there's simply no other alternative.\n \n You're making the argument that we must sacrifice more liberties for perceived security.

It's your support for a system of regulation that is easily defeated. You are to blame for that system.\n\n \n I fail to see how the system in place is the problem. But then again I don't favor the UK way of things where anyone wishing to own a gun has to supply good reason for why they should be allowed to own one (with self and home defense not being considered good reason) and having to supply five letters from upstanding citizens testifying that you're of good and moral character and unlikely to prove to be a danger to anyone if you're allowed to own a gun.\n \n You want more regulations and restrictions. I refuse to comply with your selfish and shortsighted desires.

Are the police just guessing and pulling the number out of their @$$?\n \n \nWhat makes firearms easy to get for you makes them easy to get for criminals. It's just that simple.\n\n \n Now you're the one talking BS. No criminal may ever, ever buy a gun from any legal channels, there's an absolute prohibition on it. The only avenues criminals have is the illegal black market, and this exists in every single country around the world. It's not like America is unique in this problem or anything.\n \n \nThe threat posed by criminals is magnified by their easy access to firearms, supported by you.\n\n \n No it isn't. If a criminal wants you dead, you're gonna be dead even if they can't get a gun. If they can't shoot you in a drive-by they could just plant a bomb in your car, or storm in while you're in the shower and cut your throat, or any other number of nasty methods for making people dead.\n \n What truly magnifies the threat of criminals, is the fact that they're free to roam around without any restraints.

   "I'm back, and I want to get into the discussion about sales, tracing, and registration. Sinjin I've read what you have posted, and I want to reply to some of it.\n \n \n Traceable to the manufacturer, not the retail purchaser. So you could go buy any number of them and give them to all your criminal friends and no one would ever know. \n\n \n \n My understanding is that they run a background check to see if you can legally buy, that's all. Is that incorrect? Question- In Texas, do they record the purchasers info and tie it to the serial numbers of the purchased weapons(say rifles for instance)? Wouldn't that be like registration, which they don't do? \n\n \n The original purchaser is always recorded. All dealers are required to maintain records on site of all sales from which the purchaser can be identified. The record is really a copy of the federal firearms transaction form you fill out when you purchase a gun. The form has all the purchaser information required at the sale (name, address, SS#, DoB, form of photo ID used). The form also records the weapon sold by manufacturer, model, caliber, and serial number. These records are required to be kept forever and may be inspected by BATFE. If a dealer goes out of business then he must send all these records to BATFE for safe-keeping. It is a dispersed form of registration which permits law enforcement investigation without abandoning the legitimate privacy rights of individual citizens.\n \n The trace we do now happens like this. We have to first recover a gun. We contact BATFE and give them the manufacturer/model/serial number. BATFE then contacts the manufacturer, which tells BATFE which dealer the gun was shipped to and when. BATFE then contacts the dealer to determine who bought the gun. The dealer gives BATFE the name, address, SS#, DoB, etc. he recorded for the sale. All this info gets reported to the LE agency who requested the trace, and the local agency takes over the investigation from there.\n \n This system does not track secondary market sales/transfers between private individuals. It is entirely possible that a gun recovered at a murder scene would have been bought from a dealer 20 years ago, then stolen from that owner, then sold to someone else who did not know it was stolen, then traded to another person for a guitar, then later sold to the murder suspect. We have no effective method of following these transfers after a gun is stolen. \n \n Criminal prosecution is not based upon ownership of a gun, however. It is based upon possession or use. That requires evidence which a trace does not provide. Sometimes a trace tells us the gun we found was purchased 20 years ago in another state by someone who is already dead. Sometimes the trace tells us the gun was purchased by the suspect's girlfriend six months ago. In the latter instance the trace could lead us to a possible witness against a suspect. But in all cases the trace is nothing more than background info which helps the investigation. It is rarely, if ever, relevant evidence for prosecution.

   "And how exactly do you propose that? You can't have inspections without actually doing the inspection in a physical manner.\nI can think of one way right off the top of my head. All you need is a camera and a newspaper. \n \n \nAgain, how exactly do you propose that? Don't just throw something out there because it sounds good, unless you're fully willing to go into a detailed explanation of just how your plan would work and could be carried out in a practical manner.\nI'm afraid I don't have any detailed plan for you. I'm only interested in ideas worth pursuing. One doesn't need a complete plan to brainstorm. \n \n \nAnd how does this relate to the discussion at hand? Tax returns and car registrations are done through the mail, how is this relevant? Are you proposing that next we should maybe commit annual inspections of licensed car owners to make sure they still have their vehicles?\nThe point being just because there is millions of people to deal with doesn't make something impossible.\n \n \nATF Form 3310.4, filled out by the dealer anytime somebody buys more than one handgun in a five business day period. Those that buy multiple guns are monitored by the ATF on suspicion of being straw purchasers. How many times do I have to tell you this before you get it!?\nSo basically if I only buy one handgun a week the form isn't applicable. I'm limited to providing my criminal friends with no more than 52 handguns a year. Swell. \n \n \nExcuse me?\nOh, you mean \"assault weapons\". Got any specifics on those you claim trace to CA?\n \n \nThe types of rifles that're being seized on their way to Mexico are likely ARs and AKs, or similar models that qualify as \"assault weapons\" under New York, California and New Jersey law.\nNot \"on their way to Mexico\", in Mexico. \n \n \nAnd I call it unnecessary and an infringement on our rights! And I'm more than tired of having to point out this fact every single day.\nYou can call it a peanut butter sandwich if you like, it's just your opinion.\n \n \nFrom now on it's up to you to try and prove the point. You want more gun control in this country, it's for you to prove that the problems you perceive are serious enough that we absolutely must enact further restrictions on the few rights we have left because there's simply no other alternative.\nWhat if I refuse?\n \n \nYou're making the argument that we must sacrifice more liberties for perceived security. The burden of proof is on your shoulders as to why your view is the correct one.\nWhere's the sacrifice if you still have the RKBA?\n \n \nYou think leaving people guilty of murder, drug dealing and gun running, out on the streets where they can do the most damage, is going to help at all?\nNo, I don't.\n \n \nI fail to see how the system in place is the problem.\nStraw purchases go largely undetected and you don't see a problem?\n \n \nBut then again I don't favor the UK way of things where anyone wishing to own a gun has to supply good reason for why they should be allowed to own one (with self and home defense not being considered good reason) and having to supply five letters from upstanding citizens testifying that you're of good and moral character and unlikely to prove to be a danger to anyone if you're allowed to own a gun.\nMe neither. Maybe somewhere in between where we are and where they are.\n \n \nYou want more regulations and restrictions. I refuse to comply with your selfish and shortsighted desires.\nRegulations but not necessarily restrictions. You needn't comply with my desires unless they end up as laws. \n \n \nWork with what you do have, or go to a country where your dreams and ideal beliefs are the norm.\nYou presume to tell me to leave and you're the immigrant?\n \n \nIf they're not reported stolen then how was the 200,000 number reached? Are the police just guessing and pulling the number out of their @$$?\nNo.\n \n \nNow you're the one talking BS. No criminal may ever, ever buy a gun from any legal channels, there's an absolute prohibition on it. The only avenues criminals have is the illegal black market, and this exists in every single country around the world. It's not like America is unique in this problem or anything.\nUnique in the magnitude of the problem. And gun stores aren't the \"black market\". You just need someone without a record to help you.\n \n \nNo it isn't. If a criminal wants you dead, you're gonna be dead even if they can't get a gun. If they can't shoot you in a drive-by they could just plant a bomb in your car, or storm in while you're in the shower and cut your throat, or any other number of nasty methods for making people dead.\nWho needs any of that in the US where a gun is easily obtained?\n \n \nWhat truly magnifies the threat of criminals, is the fact that they're free to roam around without any restraints. They can walk up and down the streets like they own them, because you and people like you don't think that locking them up is the answer to anything.\nYou're lying again.",

   "I'm growing tired of this constant back and forth banter with an opponent who clearly lacks long-term thought processing skills, as well as an inability to come up with a practical application for what he proposes as \"answers to problems we currently have\". The constant quoting and smacking down is wearing on my nerves and what little civility I have left since first coming to this place.\n \n Sinjin-\n \n You claim that you have workable solutions to deal with the problem of \"straw purchasers\", but when pushed for details you come up empty, all you have is a soundbyte. When the shortcomings of your idea are pointed out and its explained why your plan won't work and just what your failure will achieve, you blow it all off and simply claim that we're wrong and that we don't know what we're talking about.\n \n Any inspection scheme is going to be in violation of the Fourth Amendment and be smacked down. Even if it isn't, it's only going to accomplish a massive strain on a budget that can't take anymore stupid ideas, and take police away from the streets where they can do their best work, and instead task them with monitoring honest citizens because \"they might just do something illegal one day\". Prior restraint and guilt without a trial aren't what we're about, and we're not going to become this way either.\n \n Your constant comparisons of gun laws to speed limits, and inspects to tax filings are just more proof that you're not cut out for this discussion. If you were the post exactly how inspections could be done by mail, just as tax returns are filed, it would be no problem to eviscerate your plan and show you how it would fail.\n \n The only answer you have is more paperwork for the people who aren't doing anything wrong, because for some reason that escapes me, you just can't get it through your head that the 80 million legal gun owners in this country are not now and never have been, the problem with criminals getting guns, and neither is the current system that it's place. The fact that you can't tell the good guys and the bad guys apart is evidence that you shouldn't be trying to tell us what's wrong with the system in place. I'm growing weary of having to beat you over the head with this fact everytime you make a post.\n \n As Bryan pointed out in his post, you're very wrong. The system in place records the purchase of every single gun to the individual who bought it, and that's all we need. You can propose whatever mandatory registration system you want, it's still not going to stop people with bad intentions from reselling to criminals, and then immediately afterward reporting their gun stolen to cover their butts and shield themselves from any and all liability.\n \n Going after the person who no longer has the gun isn't going to accomplish anything, that's the long and short of it. You take out one small fish, ten more will pop up to take their place. And the big fishes are professionals who do gun trafficking for a career and know all the ins and outs and loopholes. There's simply no way you can stop them, or slow them down; especially when the laws we have aren't being used as they should be. No law you can propose is going to make a difference.\n \n Your contempt for the rights of Americans makes me sick. It also makes me search the 'net for statutes to see if people who share similar ideals can be treated as domestic terrorists. You've tried to claim that regulation after regulation after regulation is no infringement on our Second Amendment rights. That's the kind of logic that lead DC to claiming that their total handgun ban was fully constitutional and legal. Your train of thought is severely derailed. \n \n Having a right is a moot point if there are too many laws in place that keep you from lawfully exercising it; your First Amendment right to free speech means nothing if you can be thrown in prison without a trial just for talking in public.\n \n I'm tired of all this s**t. Blaming the victims of crime, the gun collectors, the gun owners, the manufacturers, the licensed sellers and everybody else except the criminals who actually commit the crimes is counterproductive to arriving at a solution. You're too busy complaining about \"we need to limit people to buying only one gun a month\" and \"we need to serialize ammunition\" and \"we need to sue the gun manufacturers for billions of dollars\" to actually address the real problem.\n \n Your continued blaming of us, despite the amount of evidence we've provided to the contrary, shows that you simply don't care about the truth. You don't care about saving lives, you're all about furthering an agenda you agree with.\n \n Blaming gun owners for the actions of criminals, is like claiming \"the only way to address the number of people who're sick and dying from diseases, is to continue supplying medicine and treatment to the people who are perfectly healthy and without illness\" or \"the only way to crack down on child pornographers is to focus on parents who own computers and cameras\".\n \n You want us to believe that you really care about actual crime fighting and saving lives and making a better place for your kids to live in? Then go away, come back, and stop talking about agendas that're without serious crime fighting benefit.",

   " We have granted a ton of Infringements on rights that our Founders called Inalienable. I call the further burdening our Constitution with the further gun control that you demand, being Piggish! That's all. \n\n \nI understand but you've \"granted\" nothing as I've said before. You fought every law tooth and nail. And where laws were passed, the gun lobby has had success in watering those laws down.\n\n Well first let me say that this is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. When I say we granted these infringements, it is in that spirit! However, In the 1990's, Charles Schemer was fond of saying that even pro-gun people are calling for more gun laws, which was absolutely true, before the Anti-gun side went crazy and started disrespected both us and our Constitution and our Constitutional Process. \n \n We tried to work with our Fellow citizens and give them a few laws even though we were pretty sure they would not work! Back then, Sarah Brady would constantly say, paraphrased, \"We know you have a Constitutional Right.\" \"But all we are asking for is a background check when someone buys a handgun.\" \"Nothing More!\" So we gave in on that and a bunch more to boot. Are you satisfied? Do you respect us for allowing these infringements? I say No! \n \n If you ask me, you guys lost your Fellow Citizen Minds, totally disrespecting us, and our Constitutionally Recognized as Protected Rights, and that disrespect continues even till today!

   " Wouldn't requiring the recording of all subsequent transfers of ownership assist LE investigations? \n\n \n Yes. More information is always better than less. Having a better ability to &#8220;walk out to the end of the possession chain&#8221; of a recovered firearm would help narrow the list of suspects and potentially provide witnesses who could say the ultimate suspect acquired the gun from them on X date. I&#8217;m not saying this information has no relevance, it is just far less important than some of the other facts I listed earlier. This also assumes, of course, that an effective scheme could be devised to record secondary market transfers. I know of no constitutionally permissible way to create such a scheme which could require felons and others who can&#8217;t have guns to register transfers they are involved in or guns they possess.\n \n \n And wouldn't that in conjunction with mandatory theft/loss reporting be even more helpful in identifying suspects and their associates? \n\n \n Probably not. Mandatory theft/loss reporting only identifies when a gun was stolen&#8212;it does nothing to identify the thief. Larceny breaks the traceable chain of possession&#8212;whether or not a mandatory registration of possession/transfer law exists. The thief will not want to register the gun he just stole. And he cannot be required to register his newly acquired possession of the gun, nor will he be required to register a subsequent sale/transfer of the stolen gun. To make him do so would unconstitutionally force him to incriminate himself in the larceny/possession of stolen property crime. I also doubt a new purchaser from the thief would record his possession/purchase&#8212;even if he could otherwise lawfully possess the gun. Say A has a gun stolen by B, who then offers to sell it to C. If C says &#8220;OK let&#8217;s register the transfer and my new possession as the law directs&#8221; then B will say no and keep the gun&#8212;and the gun stays off the database. If C agrees to buy the gun without registering the transfer, then he has chosen to violate the mandatory registration rules, and he will not later register the gun possession and expose himself to prosecution for failing to register the his original purchase from B. C will, like B, keep the gun to himself and off the registration database unless he finds a Mr. D who will also agree to purchase the gun on the illegal secondary market. Once the gun is stolen it will stay out of the registration database unless and until law enforcement recovers it and returns it to Mr. A.\n \n Let me address the home inspection requirement issue for a moment. 4th. amendment case law strikes a balance between the legitimate need of the government&#8217;s investigation against the strength of the privacy interest involved. There is a sliding scale of allowable government intrusion based in large part on the legitimate privacy interests involved&#8212;which will vary depending on the location and/or things to be searched. \n \n I have written several search warrants for homes in my career. A home is the most difficult place to obtain judicial permission to search by law enforcement because (rightly, in my opinion) SCOTUS has long declared that a man&#8217;s home is where he enjoys the greatest &#8220;expectation of privacy.&#8221; For example, if you have probable cause to believe that both a stopped car and a home have marijuana stored inside them, then you can immediately search the car without a warrant but must obtain a warrant to search the home because the expectation of privacy in a car is far less than that of a home. \n \n If we are talking about requiring home inspections for gun ownership then in my opinion we are allowing the government to arbitrarily invade the most securely private area a man possesses&#8212;without the slightest suspicion or even inference against him of having committed an offense. \n \n In my opinion it would also be bad public policy to create this home invasion permission exception because it would surely have a chilling effect on the free exercise of a protected right&#8212;not unlike the chilling effect that would descend on the free exercise of religion from making a bad proposal to have home inspections of known Islamic fundamentalists to ensure they are not making homemade IEDs. In addition, a home inspection scheme would create an Orwellian reality whereby &#8220;all citizens rights are equal, but some are more equal than others&#8221;&#8212;that the government is allowed to believe a gun owner&#8217;s right to privacy in his home is less than non-gun owner&#8217;s&#8212;despite the due process/equal protection provisions of the constitution&#8212;and all merely because one of the two chooses to exercise a protected constitutional right. \n \n Now maybe there are non-gun owners out there who say &#8220;sure, go ahead and do it, it will not affect me.&#8221; For those who would say this, let me ask this question: What happens later when an overeager politician uses the firearm home inspection rule as justification for demanding that you also open your home to random inspection of some item you have which he does not like? \n \n \nBrian already talked about the Criminals and what is valuable to the Justice System so that stands supreme as he is the expert in the field&#8230;. \n \n \n Wasn&#8217;t it Mark Twain who said &#8220;An expert is just some guy from out of town&#8221;?\n \n ---\n \n &#8220;The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.&#8221; Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, New haven, 1921.",
