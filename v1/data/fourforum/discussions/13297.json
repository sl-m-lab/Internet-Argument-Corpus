Obama had only been in a few months, and already they were complaining that he hadn't achieved everything on his dance-card... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n\n \n Again, your rose-colored vision of the current administration is mind-boggling. Obama has managed to rack up more debt in 6 months than GW did in his first 7 years. It was Obama that warned that not passing the stimulus package would cause the unemployment to top 8%. It is 2% higher than that WITH the stimulus package. And Obama's plan is to spend even more, most of it at least 3 years in the future that will surely NOT have an impact on the current economy. He has seized the current financial condition as a false premise to introduce far-reaching socialism into American business and our personal lives. \n And your claim that Republicans are holding up progress is a bold-faced lie. Congress is controlled, filibuster-proof, I might add, by the Democrats. The Republicans can't stop the Democrats from doing anything that they want to do. It's Blue Dog Democrats that aren't drinking the Obama-aid.\n \n\n Where did he say that?\n He took office in January.\n No major part of HIS stimulus direction was enacted until much later, and IN FEBRUARY the unemployment was already 8.1%\n United States Unemployment Rate\n \n Ergo, I find your claim a little fishy... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n\n In this report that he had prepared on Jan 8,2009. And it appears that it is me that is shooting fish in a barrel. Every time you doubt my veracity, I feel obliged to whack you in the face (figuratively, of course) with a big smelly dead fish. ;)\n \n \n\n First, the likely scale of employment loss is extremely large. The U.S. economy has already lost\n nearly 2.6 million jobs since the business cycle peak in December 2007. In the absence of stimulus,\n the economy could lose another 3 to 4 million more. Thus, we are working to counter a potential\n total job loss of at least 5 million. As Figure 1 shows, even with the large prototypical package, the\n unemployment rate in 2010Q4 is predicted to be approximately 7.0%, which is well below the\n approximately 8.8% that would result in the absence of a plan.1\n Figure 1, page 4\n http://otrans.3cdn.net/45593e8ecbd339d074_l3m6bt1te.pdf\n \n \n \n Well, the rate exceeded the 8.8% he predicted if we did nothing. Congratulations Obama! You just flushed $1Trillion down the sewer for nothing, emoticon_xgood\n \n\n I really hate hearing people talk about the results of the stimulus.\n It's like shoveling water out of a flooded boat, in the dark. All you really know is that you have improved the situation.\n Since it's in the dark, you don't know what the real flooding rate is. Nor do you know how much is going to affect what where...\n \n\n I don't blame him for the initial loss of jobs, but I certainly blame him for spending over $1Trillion with less than ZERO impact on the unemployment rate. Would you pay a hooker for negative stimulation? Oh wait......never mind. Strike that last comment. emoticon_ic\n \n \n\n It's funny how Bush had EIGHT FREAKIN' YEARS, and you give him no blame for the economic results thereof.\n Obama is trying to combat a boat ALREADY TAKING ON FLOODING WATER, and you want to blame him for it...\n \n No. He is not to blame for the current junk that we've seen in the economy.\n There is NO rational economic justification for alluding that Obama has any responsibility for those \"lost 2.5 million jobs\".\n \n\n \n I blame Clinton and Bush for the economic mess. As for the US debt itself, I've been very consistent in calling Bush a drunken sailor on shore leave. \n I blame Obama for spending money with ZERO results. \n \n\n You want to blame Obama for Afghanistan?\n Wow. If that doesn't SCREAM your partisan nature, I don't know what does...\n Can you explain, for the record, what Obama's actual actions were in Afghanistan that resulted in what problem??? emoticon_emb\n\n \n Obama's inactions in Afghanistan are causing the issues there.
