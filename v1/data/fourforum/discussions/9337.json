   "What caused the housing bubble, and the unfolding crash?\n \n A. subprime loans\n B. non-traditional mortgage loans\n C. very low mortgage rates\n D. real estate speculators\n E. real estate agents\n F. insufficient regulation and supervision\n G. consumers' non-fear of debt\n H. all of the above\n I. none of the above\n \n Answer: I\n \n These are all symptoms of the underlying cause. Identifying the cause requires an analysis of the housing market.\n \n The housing market does not work unless investors are willing to purchase the mortgage loans and accept the associated risks. Mortgages are long-term commitments so they present significant credit and liquidity risks. Pooling the loans diversifies the risk, and structuring the bond pools substantially reduces the risks for the highest quality bonds by shifting the risks to the lower quality bonds. This incites investors with different objectives to purchase the various mortgage backed security (MBS) bonds, thereby providing the necessary cash for funding.\n \n The housing bubble has produced astonishing growth in outstanding MBS. Investors have willingly purchased the bonds, regardless of underwriting standards, collateral protection, borrower quality, and concentrations of risk. Had investors refused, the housing bubble would have fizzled long before reaching epidemic levels. Why did investors accept such risks? This question points to the root causes of the housing bubble.\n \n History will eventually sort out the details, but I suspect the following causes:\n \n 1. Mr. Bernanke's often-cited 'global savings glut' is a big part of the problem. Emerging countries (especially in Asia) and oil-producing countries have amassed trillions of dollars in savings. They exported their goods to America, and we paid them with dollars. To propel their exports into America (and keep America's economy growing), these countries reinvested their dollar profits into dollar assets. The glut of dollars forced interest rates downward and asset prices upward (oil, metals, housing, etc.).\n \n 2. The exporters, flush with dollars and wary of America's scandal-ridden financial markets, purchased vast amounts of American debt - government bonds, corporate bonds, and asset-backed securities, including MBS. Central banks in exporting countries generally prefer debt to equity due to the perceived safety of IOUs. The exporters have purchased primarily higher-quality tranches of the MBS pools.\n \n 3. Domestic firms grew tired of unattractive yields as the yield curve fell and flattened. Going further down the yield curve produced no benefit, so going down the credit curve was the next alternative. To boost returns, domestic firms increased their holdings of higher-yielding but credit sensitive bonds, including MBS. Domestic firms have also purchased primarily higher-quality MBS tranches.\n \n 4. It's not just MBS though. All classes of American debt have skyrocketed - corporate debt, consumer debt, and government debt. Flush investors have gobbled up all types of American debt.\n \n 5. No MBS transaction succeeds unless someone is willing to hold the lower-quality bonds. I've searched high and low, and found very little information about who is buying these bonds. It appears hedge funds have purchased substantial amounts. It is also apparent that many of the BBB rated bonds have been repackaged into CDO bonds which were subsequently sold to insurance companies, banks, pension funds, and central banks in foreign countries.\n \n I'm speculating about who bought how much of what. But the underlying premise remains valid. Investors flush with cash, anxious for income, and ambivalent to risk have purchased trillions of dollars of MBS bonds, providing the liquidity necessary to inflate the housing bubble.\n \n Speculation, misinformation, and lax regulation contributed to the bubble, but the bubble would not exist if investors didn't provide the funding. This concept is at the heart of capitalism. People, organizations, and even countries would commit disastrous errors if the providers of capital didn't discriminate between good and bad ideas. When capital flows to the best ideas, the bad ideas are eliminated, or at least limited, thereby reducing the damage uninformed people would do to themselves and society. In the case of the housing bubble, investors have not efficiently discriminated between good and bad ideas, and they will pay dearly when the market corrects.\n \n Jeff",

   "Informative post. I'm in agreement with all of your points but feel the contrast with historical equity market failures has been omitted. Somewhere, someone is going to own those pieces of land covered with shoddy, inflated-value residences. This failure won't be a matter of factories or office furniture going on the auction block for pennies on the dollar, we're looking at a potential societal disruption on a par with the dust bowl days multiplied many, many times. Where are the dislocated people going?",

   "Many renters now own homes. They will soon be renters again. Rental vacancies are high, and plenty of space is available. It may turn out that the highest and best use for McMansions is as rental properties.\n \n Home equity is going to be destroyed. Those who are willing and able to stay in their homes are facing many years of declining real home values. It took California 10 years to recover from the 1989 bubble. This crash will last at least that long, and it is a nationwide problem because toxic loan products were embraced in every area of America.\n \n The government reaction will accentuate the problem. The mortgage market is going to be subjected heavy-handed regulations. The government hand outs will surely be discussed, and maybe even legislated in an attempt to help 'unfortunate' Americans. The government can't fix this problem, but it certainly can prolong and magnify it.\n \n Class action lawyers are already soliciting home owners who were 'deceived'. There will be billions of $ spent on suits and defenses.\n \n The final outcome might be moderately painful in economic terms, or it might be devastating. If foreigners become wary of American bond markets, and the $ falls, the devastating scenario may lead to a crushing depression. If the housing bubble were the only problem, we'd probably be OK. But the federal deficit, the trade imbalance, the weak dollar, and shameful consumer debt are all going to be major factors in the final outcome.\n \n This economy is precariously balanced on a shaky foundation. It's hard to imagine a good ending to the excesses of the past 10 years.\n \n Jeff",
