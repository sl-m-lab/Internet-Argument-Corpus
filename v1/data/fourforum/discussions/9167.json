I do not think people are overreacting because they fear gay people. I think they have taken the only route possible to preserve the democratic process given that judges have shown the willingness to overrule the preferences of duly elected legislatures.\n\n There are two big problems with your line of reasoning. First, the Mass court did nothing that they weren't supposed to do. They ruled that a state practice violated the state constitution; that's exactly what they're paid for. Secondly, if the reaction around the country was really to judicial activism, and not about gays per se, then wouldn't we be seeing amendments that actually address judicial activism? We haven't; it's all been about keeping gays from getting married. The timing of these amendments has nothing to do with how gays got the right to marry in Mass; if the legislature had passed a law to that effect we'd be seeing the same thing. The problem is that people are afraid that their gay neighbors are going to jet out to Mass, get married, and come home and demand to be treated just like any other married couple, and alot of people seem to be unable to deal with that idea.\n \n \n\n As a side note, this feeling, in my opinion, is increased anytime somebody advances the idea that the marriage laws of the several states violate the Federal Constitution.\n \n\n Some probably do. While the states have full reign to decide who they will marry or not, the Constitution does not allow one state to set aside the legal proceedings of another. So, laws that say \"we won't marry gays\" are legal, but laws that say \"we won't recognize your out of state gay marriage\", probably not.\n \n \n\n While I understand that Matthew is upset that the laws don't reflect his view, I think he has adopted a perspective that is more likely to hurt rather than help his belief. That is the main point I wish to make.\n \n\n Well, he certainly doesn't present his case in a manner likely to win people over, I'll give you that.\n \n \n\n I should also mention that I believe it is the only legitimate way it can proceed, as I do not think the constitution has anything to say about marriage.\n\n The federal constitution? No, not much. But we are mostly talking about state courts here.",

   "There is no right to heterosexual marriage in the constition either. Heterosexuals get to marry. So here we have heterosexuals and gay people being treated differently.\n\n \n Actually, this is not so. Everyone is treated equally. EVERYONE has to meet the criteria in marriage statutes in order to be married. No marriage statutes say that homosexuals cannot marry. The law is being applied equally to everyone in this instance.\n \n \nIn a state where there is no gender restriction on marriage and the constitution says that all must be treated equally. How is going to court to pursue equal marriage wrong?\n\n \n The constitution most certainly does not say that all must be treated equally. Does the constitution require that we treat murders the same as we treat non-murderers? No, it does not.\n \n \nIsn't that why the court exists to ensure that all people are treated equally and that equal protectons, if there is one in the constitution, is being inforced?\n\n \n No, courts don't exist to ensure that all people are treated equally. Equal protection is a procedural guarantee, not a substantive one.",

   "There are two big problems with your line of reasoning. First, the Mass court did nothing that they weren't supposed to do. They ruled that a state practice violated the state constitution; that's exactly what they're paid for.\n\n \n I think this response misses the point. Of course they ruled that a government action violated the state constition, but we cannot infer from this that they have done \"exactly what they're paid for (I understand this to mean that they have acted legitimately).\" If the proper way to measure legitimacy was to simply see if the court overturned a statute on the grounds that it violated the constitution, then we would have to say all kinds of disastrous things. We would be forced to say that the Taney court was only doing what it was paid for when it determined the Missouri Compromise to be unconstitutional. We would have to say that when Lochner Court held a New York maximum working hour law to be unconstitutional, it was only doing what it was paid for. These two cases are widely accepted as incorrect by legal scholars and jurists, even though the court purported to overturn the respective legislation because it was unconstitutional. Just because a court says it has acted appropriately does not mean that it actually has. We must look past their holding, and to their reasoning.\n \n \nSecondly, if the reaction around the country was really to judicial activism, and not about gays per se, then wouldn't we be seeing amendments that actually address judicial activism? We haven't; it's all been about keeping gays from getting married. The timing of these amendments has nothing to do with how gays got the right to marry in Mass; if the legislature had passed a law to that effect we'd be seeing the same thing. The problem is that people are afraid that their gay neighbors are going to jet out to Mass, get married, and come home and demand to be treated just like any other married couple, and alot of people seem to be unable to deal with that idea.\n\n \n This seems to be a reversal from your statement here earlier in this thread.\n \n While I do not doubt that some people are happy that their policy preference is what is being enacted in these amendments, the amendments would not exist without the Goodridge decision. No one to my knowledge even contemplated making an amendment about marriage until Goodridge. This seems to me to be primarily a response to what people view as activism.\n \n By the way, I disagree that if a legislature had done it instead of a court, that the same response would have happened. For example, there was no such response to Vermont's move toward civil unions, which was enacted by a legislature. I don't doubt that some legislatures in other states may have taken up the issue, but I doubt that it would have been elevated to the level of a constitutional amendment.\n \n \n \nSome probably do. While the states have full reign to decide who they will marry or not, the Constitution does not allow one state to set aside the legal proceedings of another. So, laws that say \"we won't marry gays\" are legal, but laws that say \"we won't recognize your out of state gay marriage\", probably not.\n\n \n I tend to agree with you that there are significant constitutional problems with \"laws that say 'we won't recognize your out of state gay marriage.'\" It will be interesting to see what SCOTUS does with DOMA, which I think is sure to be challenged eventually.\n \n \nWell, he certainly doesn't present his case in a manner likely to win people over, I'll give you that.\n\n \n Which I thought was a primary purpose of a discussion board. An even greater problem, I think, is that I rarely see anyone in these forums who appears to be sympathetic to gay marriage ever criticize him. I think such criticism would actually elevate the level of discussion in these forums. But that, of course, is only my opinion.\n \n \nThe federal constitution? No, not much. But we are mostly talking about state courts here.\n\n \n Well, I am glad that we at least agree that the federal constitution does not have much to say about marriage. A lot of people seem to disagree with this assessment.",

   "I think this response misses the point.\n\n Well, I was responding to this statement of yours:\n \"I think they have taken the only route possible to preserve the democratic process given that judges have shown the willingness to overrule the preferences of duly elected legislatures.\"\n That statements seems to say not that you think the judges made a bad call, but that they were violating the process by which government is run. As far as I can see they weren't. For that matter, I also don't think they made a bad call.\n \n \n\n We must look past their holding, and to their reasoning.\n\n I've looked at their reasoning, and it's solid. I've heard no legal argument put forward that says otherwise. If you have please share.\n \n \n\n This seems to be a reversal from your statement here earlier in this thread.\n\n Not at all. Once any state, by any means, legalized gay marriage we were bound to see a conservative backlash.\n \n \n\n No one to my knowledge even contemplated making an amendment about marriage until Goodridge. This seems to me to be primarily a response to what people view as activism.\n .\n\n Like I asked before, if this is a reaction to activism, than why do none of the amendments address activism?\n \n \n\n By the way, I disagree that if a legislature had done it instead of a court, that the same response would have happened. For example, there was no such response to Vermont's move toward civil unions, which was enacted by a legislature.\n\n But those civil unions aren't binding anywhere else, are they? They were no threat to the status quos in other states. They were only available to citizens of Vermont, and had no legal weight once someone was out of state. Also, alot of people are particularly protective of the term \"marriage\". There are people here who are totally happy giving gays all sorts of rights, as long as you call the process by which they get those rights anything other than \"marriage\". If Vermont had passed a law, via the legislature, allowing gays to marry I have no doubt we'd have exactly the same backlash around the country. The only difference is that the catch phrase \"activist judge\" would be replaced by \"radical legislatures\", or something along those lines.\n \n \n\n I tend to agree with you that there are significant constitutional problems with \"laws that say 'we won't recognize your out of state gay marriage.'\" It will be interesting to see what SCOTUS does with DOMA, which I think is sure to be challenged eventually.\n\n Yeah, that should be interesting.\n \n \n\n An even greater problem, I think, is that I rarely see anyone in these forums who appears to be sympathetic to gay marriage ever criticize him. \n \n\n It happens.
