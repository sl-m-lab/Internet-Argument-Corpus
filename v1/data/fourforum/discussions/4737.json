Back then the death penalty did not mean anything so cruel punishment could be hangings and kids under 18 (it was ok then). If you believe in the living constitution, today you would say..well our society does view things that way anyway, so cruel punishment really means anyone over 18 because we have progressed as a society.\n \n I hope that clears up some confussion about the topic.\n \n I prefer the orginalist view because it is the most consistent and had the most backing (as in principal) to it...Just want to get some views then I can explain more.",

The only way an amendment is changed is by law not a judges ruling..how does this not make sense? Changing a law via the way it says to (amending, congress) does not mean a \"living constitution\"..i can't stress that enough....In fact I am going to define both again right now:\n \n LIVING CONSTITUTION:\n The idea that the constitutional meaning of passages in the constitution change over time to live up to the \"changing standards of deceny\" in the world. No actually laws or amendments are done, rather the meaning of something is just changed. EXAMPLE: 1973-Freedom of speech is put as an amendment for the Constitution of X country...it says you can \"you have the freedom of speech\"....2003- The court rules due to the changing standards of decency free speech really means today that you can only speak freely...not write freely....THIS WOULD BE A LIVING CONSTITUTION DECISION.\n \n ORIGINALIST THEORY:\n The Constitution means what it meant when it was written and does not that meaning doesn't change unless another law overrides it or changes it. Such as amendments or laws passed by congress, states. EXAMPLE: 1973- Freedom of speech is amendment in X country....2003- A case that says \"you cant, write what you want it only says freedom of speech\"...the court rules no...it means you can write and speak because that is what it meant when it was written.\n \n If you still don't believe this then take a class somewhere about the constitution or look it up in a law book.

   "If one interprets the constitution as an originalist (as I voted) then there is absolutely no provision in the consitution that would prohibit a state from establishing a religion, restricting speech or the press. \n \n The first ammendment makes no mention of state law, only what congress can do.\n \n I could be totally wrong, but I have challenged a few people (none lawyers) to prove to me that there is such a thing as \"freedom of religion\" or \"free speech\" in the United States according to the consitution. There are no such guarantees. The original wording's purpose was to keep from interfering with states' rights. If a state wanted to restrict speech, then let them, as long as congress wasn't involved (according to the wording).\n \n But, using a \"living consitution\" interpretation, the supreme court has ruled numerous times that, say, teaching creationism in public schools is unconstitutional. They say things like \"The Establishment Clause forbids the enactment of any law \"respecting an establishment of religion\" .\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard.html#Held\n \n But it doesn't say that.
