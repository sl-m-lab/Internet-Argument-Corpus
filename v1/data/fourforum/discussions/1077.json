Since I haven't really seen any.\n\n \n I think that is accurate to a degree. In the first place, currently all that land actually belongs to Israel. I don't think they have actually given it away just yet. 2nd, I think it would be necessary to put the fence in the place of encroachment if it is to be an effective security barrier. \n \n i am uncertain if they have located all of the tunnels. There are many that run to egypt. Therefore, the fence will help but there needs to be more.",
