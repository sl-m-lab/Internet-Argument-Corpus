I am surprised (or maybe not seenig some of the people around here :)) no one here mentioned myths of the region contemporary to this one. El was a great god who had many sons.

   "To add to my previous post, first of all, there is a WRONG translation into English. The Biblical texts use the word ELOHIM, which means GODS. The translation is intententionally made that way so that the Elohim of Genesis-1 will not appear for what they are, namely the supreme gods of Canaan. Falsifiers of the text refuse to admit that -- as the text shows -- the Elohim created Man in THEIR own image: one male and one female. These Canaanite Gods had children. In one non-Bliblical account [See Ugarit and Ebla tablets], Yahweh was one of the sons of the Elohim. But this is another story.\n \n In the Bible, neither the Elohim nor Yahweh had children, nor did they create angels (or Gabrie'El, Satana'El, Micha'El or other ministers of El, the male god), the nephilim, or talking serpents. All the Biblical references to gods (other than the ones in Genesis1-2), the sons of gods, the angels or archangels, the nephilism (giants), the evils spirits, the desease causing spirits, etc., come from pre-Biblical sources. \n \n \n \n -\n -\n Indeed, all such stories and Genesis-2 come from the Caucasian/Indo-European background of the Hebrews, whereas Genesis-1 and other occasional tales come from the Arab [Semitic] background of the Hebrews. The etymologies of the two Biblical deities and of the two ethnicities which merged so as to constitute the Hebrew people, which eventually became Abraham's Israel, headed by El, and then the Moses-reformed Israel, headed by Yahweh, and the eventual split between Judaea (after Moses) and \"Israel\" [Galilee] (after Abraham). Jesus was a Galilean and his God was El, and, in the words of some of our contemporaries, an anti-Semite!\n \n The finally redacted or Hebrew Bible was written down mainly from the standpoint of the Judaeans. (It does not include any of the Galilean/Essene scriptures in the last couple of centuries B.C.... as the Bible was safeguarded in Yahweh's temple in Jerusalem (Judaea). Notice the canonical blank between the 3rd century B.C. and 70 A.D. or thereafter..... Yah stopped communicating with the Judaeans -- for those who believe that the Bible is the word of God or Theos (a convenient English or Greek word which obliterates the distinction between El and Yah). The temple of Galilee was destroyed much earlier than the one in Judea.",

Yahweh was one of these gods, as was ba'al. In fact, its pretty clear that the israelites believed and accepted the existence of gods belonging to other countries. Its all there, quite an interesting read.\n\n \n Care to quote specifically what wiki say's and where it say's it, so we can discuss the precise content in its proper context? Here's how I understand it to be.\n Next, we need to see what \"El\" meant in biblical usage...\n \n \"El\" is used as an alternate term for the strong God--so ZPEB (in. loc):\n El--Largely poetic description of the one and only true God of Israel; often in Heb., used with the definite article, the (true) God, although no such article is needed to define the true God (Num 12.13). But the term, basically meaning \"strength,\" can be used as an adjective and also in reference to men of might and rank (Ezek 31:11), such as Nebuchadnezzar, or it may refer to the angels (Ps 29.1)\n El was sometimes used of the Israelites in opposition to local Canaanite usage! So, EBC:5.211-212:\n El was a common designation for the head of the Canaanite pantheon. The Israelites generally avoided referring to Yahweh by this designation, lest there be any confusion that their God was the same as the Canaanite El...Israel believed that Yahweh was everything the Canaanites claimed for El and for his son Baal and even more...In the poetical sections of the OT, the inspired authors freely adapted Canaanite literary expressions to the service of Yahweh. In their hearts the psalmists were committed to Yahweh and knew that El was a figment of the imagination. Yet they borrowed the descriptions, perfections, and acts attributed to El. At times a clear polemical force shines through, as the psalmists defend their faith that only Yahweh is El and that there is no other El than Yahweh! Other times the psalmists creatively employ literary motifs in the service of Yahweh.\n The biblical El is \"thus a general term and does not refer to the personal name of the Ugaritic god El\", except in clearly polemical contexts. [MM:139]\n Israel essentially 'emptied' some of their terms for deity of pagan content, and infused those terms with content from the revelation of God at Sinai. So, Livingston [PCE:182]:\n These names were rid of their pagan polytheism and naturism and given a strong personal content while at the same time stressing the majesty, holiness, oneness, and uniqueness of deity.\n In the psalms, the term \"my God (El)\" was generally equivalent to \"my Father\" [EBC:5.200]\n http://www.christian-thinktank.com/elwho.html",

And how do you explain the dating of these structures that were presumably built before civilized humans were supposed to have existed as anything more than hunter gatherers. Here's what wiki say's:\n Until c. 10,000 years ago, most humans lived as hunter-gatherers. They generally lived in small nomadic groups known as band societies. The advent of agriculture prompted the Neolithic Revolution, when access to food surplus led to the formation of permanent human settlements, the domestication of animals and the use of metal tools. Agriculture encouraged trade and cooperation, and led to complex society. Because of the significance of this date for human society, it is the epoch of the Holocene calendar or Human Era.\n About 6,000 years ago, the first proto-states developed in Mesopotamia, Egypt and the Indus Valley. Military forces were formed for protection, and government bureaucracies for administration. States cooperated and competed for resources, in some cases waging wars. Around 2,000-3,000 years ago, some states, such as Persia, India, China, Rome, and Greece, developed through conquest into the first expansive empires. Influential religions, such as Judaism, originating in the Middle East, and Hinduism, a religious tradition that originated in South Asia, also rose to prominence at this time.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human#Transition_to_civilization",

You specifically asked for a non-religious site didn't you? Why would you expect a scientific site that is from an archeological perspective to refer to the Great flood at all under these circumstances? This discovery is about structures that could be man made and are of an age prior to when humanity was believed to be sophisticated enough to design or build such massive architecture. \n \n Are you unable to make the connection that based on when the flood is believed to have occurred, compared to the suspected age of these structures, and that if these structures are what they appear to be, then they would have had to have been built by a pre-flood civilization.? Or is it your intention to just reject any evidence put forth on principle because I posted it? Here's what you asked for!\n \n \n \n Hum. \"pre-flood construction\". Let's see a link from a non religious web site that causee these structures 'pre-flood'\n\n \n And that is exactly what I produced. Here is more evidence that scientists on the scene believe it is man made in opposition to what Robert Schoch believes from the same link.\n Professor Masaki Kimura, a geologist at Ryukyu University in Okinawa, was the first scientist to investigate the site and has concluded that the mysterious five-layer structure was man-made. \"The object has not been manufactured by nature. If that had been the case, one would expect debris from erosion to have collected around the site, but there are no rock fragments there,\" he said.\n \n The discovery of what appears to be a road surrounding the building was further evidence that the structure was made by humans, he added.\n \n Robert Schoch, professor of geology at Boston University, dived at the site last month. \"It basically looks like a series of huge steps, each about a metre high. Essentially, it's a cliff face like the side of a stepped pyramid. It's a very interesting structure,\" he said. \"It's possible that natural water erosion combined with the process of cracked rocks splitting created such a structure, but I haven't come across such processes creating a structure as sharp as this.\"\n \n Further evidence that the structure is the work of humans came with the discovery of smaller underwater stone mounds nearby. Like the main building, these mini-ziggurats are made of stepped slabs and are about 10m wide and 2m high.\n \n Kimura said it was too early to know who built the monument or its purpose. \"The structure could be an ancient religious shrine, possibly celebrating an ancient deity resembling the god Nirai-Kanai, whom locals say gave happiness to the people of Okinawa from beyond the sea. This could be evidence of a new culture as there are no records of a people intelligent enough to have built such a monument 10,000 years ago,\" he said.\n \n \"This could only have been done by a people with a high degree of technology, probably coming from the Asian continent, where the oldest civilisations originate. There would have to have been some sort of machinery involved to have created such a huge structure.\"\n \n Teruaki Ishii, professor of geology at Tokyo University, said the structure dated back to at least 8000BC when the land on which it was constructed was submerged at the end of the last ice age. \"I hope this site is artificial as it would be very exciting. But at this time I feel it is too early to say. I think the structure could be natural, but part of it may have been made,\" he said.\n \n The first signs of civilisation in Japan are traced to the Neolithic period around 9000BC. The people at this time lived as hunters and food- gatherers. There is nothing in the archeological record to suggest the presence of a culture advanced enough to have built a structure like the ziggurat.\n \n British archeologists are, however, cautiously enthusiastic about the discovery which will be featured this summer in a Channel 4 documentary.\n \n Jim Mower, an archeologist at University College London, said: \"If it is confirmed that the site is as old as 10,000 years and is man-made, then this is going to change an awful lot of the previous thinking on southeast Asian history. It would put the people who made the monument on a par with the ancient civilisation of Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley.\"\n Does this look like a natural structure to you? http://www.cyberspaceorbit.com/phikent/japan/japan_8.jpg\n \n Or this 90% perfectly formed corner of a massive block? http://www.cyberspaceorbit.com/phikent/japan/japan_2.jpg Can you show me any naturally formed structure that is as perfectly formed as this? \n \n Wouldn't it be reasonable to suspect that because this was found underwater, that it may have been originally built in a valley and was submerged in the Great Flood?\n One of the greatest discoveries in the history of archaeology was made last summer, off Japan There, spread over an amazing 311 miles on the ocean floor, are the well-preserved remains of an ancient city. Or at the very least, a number of closely related sites.\n \n In the waters around Okinawa and beyond to the small island of Yonaguni, divers located eight separate locations beginning in March 1995. That first sighting was equivocal - a provocative, squared structure, so encrusted with coral that its manmade identity was uncertain. Then, as recently as the summer of 1996, a sports diver accidentally discovered a huge, angular platform about 40 feet below the surface, off the southwestern shore of Okinawa. The feature&#8217;s artificial provenance was beyond question. Widening their search, teams of more divers found another, different monument nearby. Then another, and another. They beheld long streets, grand boulevards, majestic staircases, magnificent archways, enormous blocks of perfectly cut and fitted stone - all harmoniously welded together in a linear architecture unlike anything they had ever seen before.",

No part of the monument is constructed of separate blocks of rock that have been placed into position. This is an important point, for carved and Arranged rock blocks would definitively indicate a man-made origin for the structure - - yet I could find no such evidence.\n\n \n And here: from Schoch himself. \nRobert Schoch, professor of geology at Boston University, dived at the site last month. \"It basically looks like a series of huge steps, each about a metre high. Essentially, it's a cliff face like the side of a stepped pyramid. It's a very interesting structure,\" he said. \"It's possible that natural water erosion combined with the process of cracked rocks splitting created such a structure, but I haven't come across such processes creating a structure as sharp as this.\"\n\n \n So, I don't know why you feel qualified to insist that Robert Schoch is the final authority regarding this issue, but nothing that I have seen proves that assessment at all. Especially since he himself makes no such absolute claims at all. In addition to this, Schoch supports me in another area which is the age of the Sphinx. General Egyptologists insist that it was constructed around 2500 BC, yet Schoch insists that evidence shows it to be dated at 5000 BC. That makes the Sphinx 7000 years old today. Creating the same dilemma as the Japan site creates regarding pre flood construction and another civilization in another part of the world sophisticated enough to construct such a massive artifact. Now I suppose that you will now attempt to disprove the expert you just held up as an authority of the Japan site.\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDofx2hKZRQ",

   "You're pulling a kronus on me as usual huh, trebor? You specifically asked for a non-religious site didn't you? Why would you expect a scientific site that is from an archeological perspective to refer to the Great flood at all under these circumstances? This discovery is about structures that could be man made and are of an age prior to when humanity was believed to be sophisticated enough to design or build such massive architecture. \n \n Are you unable to make the connection that based on when the flood is believed to have occurred, compared to the suspected age of these structures, and that if these structures are what they appear to be, then they would have had to have been built by a pre-flood civilization.? Or is it your intention to just reject any evidence put forth on principle because I posted it? Here's what you asked for!\n \n \n \n And that is exactly what I produced. Here is more evidence that scientists on the scene believe it is man made in opposition to what Robert Schoch believes from the same link.\n Professor Masaki Kimura, a geologist at Ryukyu University in Okinawa, was the first scientist to investigate the site and has concluded that the mysterious five-layer structure was man-made. \"The object has not been manufactured by nature. If that had been the case, one would expect debris from erosion to have collected around the site, but there are no rock fragments there,\" he said.\n \n The discovery of what appears to be a road surrounding the building was further evidence that the structure was made by humans, he added.\n \n Robert Schoch, professor of geology at Boston University, dived at the site last month. \"It basically looks like a series of huge steps, each about a metre high. Essentially, it's a cliff face like the side of a stepped pyramid. It's a very interesting structure,\" he said. \"It's possible that natural water erosion combined with the process of cracked rocks splitting created such a structure, but I haven't come across such processes creating a structure as sharp as this.\"\n \n Further evidence that the structure is the work of humans came with the discovery of smaller underwater stone mounds nearby. Like the main building, these mini-ziggurats are made of stepped slabs and are about 10m wide and 2m high.\n \n Kimura said it was too early to know who built the monument or its purpose. \"The structure could be an ancient religious shrine, possibly celebrating an ancient deity resembling the god Nirai-Kanai, whom locals say gave happiness to the people of Okinawa from beyond the sea. This could be evidence of a new culture as there are no records of a people intelligent enough to have built such a monument 10,000 years ago,\" he said.\n \n \"This could only have been done by a people with a high degree of technology, probably coming from the Asian continent, where the oldest civilisations originate. There would have to have been some sort of machinery involved to have created such a huge structure.\"\n \n Teruaki Ishii, professor of geology at Tokyo University, said the structure dated back to at least 8000BC when the land on which it was constructed was submerged at the end of the last ice age. \"I hope this site is artificial as it would be very exciting. But at this time I feel it is too early to say. I think the structure could be natural, but part of it may have been made,\" he said.\n \n The first signs of civilisation in Japan are traced to the Neolithic period around 9000BC. The people at this time lived as hunters and food- gatherers. There is nothing in the archeological record to suggest the presence of a culture advanced enough to have built a structure like the ziggurat.\n \n British archeologists are, however, cautiously enthusiastic about the discovery which will be featured this summer in a Channel 4 documentary.\n \n Jim Mower, an archeologist at University College London, said: \"If it is confirmed that the site is as old as 10,000 years and is man-made, then this is going to change an awful lot of the previous thinking on southeast Asian history. It would put the people who made the monument on a par with the ancient civilisation of Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley.\"\n Does this look like a natural structure to you? http://www.cyberspaceorbit.com/phikent/japan/japan_8.jpg\n \n Or this 90% perfectly formed corner of a massive block? http://www.cyberspaceorbit.com/phikent/japan/japan_2.jpg Can you show me any naturally formed structure that is as perfectly formed as this? \n \n Wouldn't it be reasonable to suspect that because this was found underwater, that it may have been originally built in a valley and was submerged in the Great Flood?\n One of the greatest discoveries in the history of archaeology was made last summer, off Japan There, spread over an amazing 311 miles on the ocean floor, are the well-preserved remains of an ancient city. Or at the very least, a number of closely related sites.\n \n In the waters around Okinawa and beyond to the small island of Yonaguni, divers located eight separate locations beginning in March 1995. That first sighting was equivocal - a provocative, squared structure, so encrusted with coral that its manmade identity was uncertain. Then, as recently as the summer of 1996, a sports diver accidentally discovered a huge, angular platform about 40 feet below the surface, off the southwestern shore of Okinawa.

However the photographs available on the Internet show (with a varying degree of clarity) parts of the structure with precise geometrical shapes, in varying complexity. Although this may be taken as a strong hint of human presence, some natural formations, such as the Giant's Causeway, or natural staircase structures on Old Rag Mountain[2], present similar shapes.

A lot of excitement from the lunatic fringe. but that isn't science.\n\n \n So, no matter what information I responded with regarding ancient pre-flood sites, you would have rejected it based on your shallow disbelief in Noah's flood, right? So what you're saying is that whenever you ask me a question, I must read BETWEEN the lines and look for the catch because you'll never be honest or sincere in your approach. You define a kronus trebor, and you're a dishonest jerk too. And of course this type of evidence from experts like Schoch from sinjins link is just ignored by you, why? Because it isn't peer reviewed? And yet you don't seem to require peer review when these guys reject that it is an artificially constructed structure. Why is that trebor? You shouldn't be able to think unless a peer review board tells you what you must believe. Independent thought is beyond you after all.\n I think it should be considered a primarily natural structure until more evidence is found to the contrary. However, by no means do I feel that this is an absolutely closed case. The question of its genesis - - artificial versus natural - - may not be an all or nothing question. We should also consider the possibility that the Yonaguni Monument is fundamentally a natural structure that was utilized, enhanced, and modified by humans in ancient times. The Yonaguni Monument may even have been a quarry from which blocks were cut, utilizing natural bedding, joint, and fracture planes of the rock, and thence removed for the purpose of constructing other structures which are long since gone.\n \n On Yonaguni Island and elsewhere in the Okinawa area there appears to be an ancient tradition of modifying, enhancing, and improving on nature. On Yonaguni there are very old tombs (age unknown, but possibly on the order of thousands of years old) that stylistically appear to be comparable to the \"architecture\" of the Yonaguni Monument. There is still other evidence of some kind of human working of the local stone on Yonaguni. Scattered over the island are apparently very ancient (age unknown), obviously human-carved, stone \"vessels.\" These are composed of local rock, and clearly were neither made nor transported to the island in modern (that is, in the last 500 years or so) times. These stone vessels remain somewhat of a mystery, as does the Yonaguni Monument and other underwater structures reported in the Okinawa area.\n \n On Yonaguni beautifully crafted ancient stone tools have been found that could have been used to both shape some of the stone vessels and other objects, as well as to modify the Yonaguni Monument that is now found underwater. Even if it is a primarily natural structure, it may have been reshaped to serve as foundation for stone, timber, or mud buildings that have since been destroyed. Or it may have even served as some form of boat dock for an early seafaring people.\n \n I believe that the art and architecture of the area may have been influenced by the natural geomorphology of the Yonaguni Monument and similar structures. There may have been a complex interplay between nature and artificiality, natural forms and man-made structures, in very ancient times. Perhaps rather than being the work of humans per se, the Yonaguni Monument directly influenced the art and architecture of humans some 8,000 to 10,000 years ago, thus helping to initiate a stylistic tradition that continues to this day.\n \nNot true. You have some people making claims.. but as far as I can see.. there is no peer review of the photos.. and no examination with sonar, xrays or any other ground penetrating equipment. There seems to be a lot of work to be done to investigate the claims. .. and by no means is it for sure that these structures are artificial\n\n \n And by no means is it for sure that they are natural with no human manipulation. I feel sorry for people like you who haven't the sense of discernment or common sense that God gave an ant in that unless a board of scientist who may very well have an unknown agenda to promote ot protect tells you what to think, you don't even dare trust your own eyes or senses. Saying any more on this to the likes of you is obviously a waste of time. \n \n \nAlthough you partly quoted from it. you saw it too. I guess you have cognative disconnect in showing that some geologists disagree.\n \n And from http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Yonaguni\n \n\n \n No trebor, there's no cognitive disconnect on my part at all as this is the first time this link has been posted. And you're posting it as evidence that Yonaguni is a natural formation, right? Well you own link belies that belief as it also say's this.\n The Yonaguni monument\n Main article: Yonaguni#Seabed structures:\n \n This island has recently become well known for massive sunken rock and stone structures known as the Yonaguni monument which surround the island. If man-made, the monument is likely an ancient temple complex, antedating all known buildings[1]. It would also be evidence of a prior civilization once located many meters above the Ice Age shoreline.\n According to your link, no absolute judgement that it is a completely natural formation has been determined at all. \n However, it could be merely a geological curiosity where conditions have been just right to create squared off megalithic blocks reminiscent of Stonehenge and Easter Island. If so, a sufficient explanation for the lack of debris and rubble falling to the floor around the find needs to be developed in full.\n This part is both funny and curious as they imply that on one hand it could be a geological curiosity with juuuust the right conditions to create squared of megalithic blocks reminiscent of Stonehenge and Easter Island. Evidently these mental giants have forgotten that nobody denies that Stonehenge and Easter Island are accepted as man made artifacts. Modern man just can't figure out how they did it with their limited technology. So just admit that your world view is so incredibly fragile that it wont allow you to accept any info that could throw off the timeline that you rely on regarding your accepted history of modern man. You must reject anything you can't readily explain, no matter how compelling the evidence is. emoticon_xdonno",

I'm sick of the dishonesty and moving of the goal posts every time you guys can't deal with unanswerable questions. And within the info I have posted, it refers to artifacts that could have worked stone such as this. I even posted it in red letters just above, yet you ignored it. Here it is again along with more info that only requires some common sense to appreciate.\n The question of its genesis - - artificial versus natural - - may not be an all or nothing question. We should also consider the possibility that the Yonaguni Monument is fundamentally a natural structure that was utilized, enhanced, and modified by humans in ancient times. The Yonaguni Monument may even have been a quarry from which blocks were cut, utilizing natural bedding, joint, and fracture planes of the rock, and thence removed for the purpose of constructing other structures which are long since gone.\n \n On Yonaguni Island and elsewhere in the Okinawa area there appears to be an ancient tradition of modifying, enhancing, and improving on nature. On Yonaguni there are very old tombs (age unknown, but possibly on the order of thousands of years old) that stylistically appear to be comparable to the \"architecture\" of the Yonaguni Monument. There is still other evidence of some kind of human working of the local stone on Yonaguni. Scattered over the island are apparently very ancient (age unknown), obviously human-carved, stone \"vessels.\" These are composed of local rock, and clearly were neither made nor transported to the island in modern (that is, in the last 500 years or so) times. These stone vessels remain somewhat of a mystery, as does the Yonaguni Monument and other underwater structures reported in the Okinawa area.\n \n On Yonaguni beautifully crafted ancient stone tools have been found that could have been used to both shape some of the stone vessels and other objects, as well as to modify the Yonaguni Monument that is now found underwater. Even if it is a primarily natural structure, it may have been reshaped to serve as foundation for stone, timber, or mud buildings that have since been destroyed. Or it may have even served as some form of boat dock for an early seafaring people.And remember, this info came from the link that sinjin posted in order to refute Yonaguni as being a possible artificially manufactured site. So none of the sources posted by the nay sayers accomplish their goal of refuting the possibility that this monument is man made at all. http://www.robertschoch.net/Enigmatic%20Yonaguni%20Underwater%20RMS%20CT.htm",

   "This part is both funny and curious as they imply that on one hand it could be a geological curiosity with juuuust the right conditions to create squared of megalithic blocks reminiscent of Stonehenge and Easter Island.\n\n \n They didn't remind me of Stonehenge.

If you want one we can't figure out, check out the pyramids.\n\n \n Obviously the pyramids. But although scientists have tried to reproduce how they first transported such massive stones 200 miles to Stonehenge, their next problem has been to figure out how they lifted multi tiered levels of approximately 20, 30 and 40 ton rocks.

But 2 more points here. #1) regarding the detail you mention, according to evolution claims, 8-10,000 years ago, we were a hunter gatherer species with no capabilities to build such massive structures at all anywhere on Earth as the Sphinx or these structures in Japan which cover more than 300 acres. and #2) Look back to the beginning of this part of the debate and tell me what point I intended to make?

   "They have theories only, but no sure answers as to how they accomplished it.\n\n \n And they never will. Unless you have a TARDIS handy. All we can work on is models.\n \n \n \nFirst off, regarding China, 5,000 years is a long distance away from 8-10,000 years, as time goes. \n\n \n Yes and no. Depends on your scale bar. In terms of civilizations 3 - 5,000 years is a reasonable period of time.\n \n \n#1) regarding the detail you mention, according to evolution claims, 8-10,000 years ago, we were a hunter gatherer species with no capabilities to build such massive structures at all anywhere on Earth as the Sphinx or these structures in Japan which cover more than 300 acres.\n\n \n Wrong. Evolution makes no such claims. I know you think all intellectual issues are based on ToE, but they aren't. Archaeology says that 10,000 years ago we were a reasonable migratory species in Europe, but that we were more than capable of constructing structures and using tools. I'm not sure what Homo sapiens was doing in warmer climes.\n \n \nand #2) Look back to the beginning of this part of the debate and tell me what point I intended to make? \n\n \n I'm not sure, but you appear to be delving into the pre-Adamite heresy. You seem to be claiming that there was a pre-existing technologically advanced civilization.\n \n \nHe clearly understood that we weren't discussing the flood, but were discussing the time period when such ancient structures were built. Yet now he is asking for evidence of the flood.\n\n \n You used the term \"considered pre-flood\", suggesting that the archaeologists put them in the category of structures created before the Noachian flood. Given that there is no such category, that's what trebor wanted you to link to. You answered by saying these structures were older than the date attributed to the flood. That's begging the question and then requires proof of the flood occuring to create said category.\n \n I must admit this does all seem a bit of a silly argument, but that's just me.",
