   "What proof do you have that owning guns will prevent mass murder? -VOR\n \n ___________________________________________\n \n I don't have any proof that owning guns will prevent civil mass murder. I own firearms for my personal defense against pschyos like these:\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/06/08/japan.stabbling.sociologist/\n \n If I were a teacher at the school. That pshcyo would be dead and none of the kids hurt. If VOR were a teacher at the school? Then what? Dial 911.\n \n BTW notice the crazy killed all the kids at the school with a sword in a gun free zone(which is all of Japan)!\n \n Browing from other threads: Murder is an issue with violence. Now I will include the mentally ill. Again from other threads, address the prevention of violence and you will address the prevention of murder without any gun control. Address the prevention of violence; you will stop murder by guns, knives, swords, hands, feet, rope, crowbars, lead pipes, and pointy sticks.\n \n Address violence in this country and I won't need to carry a .45 or have one next to the bed. Take away all guns from criminals and I will still need a .45, they are still violent. \n \n F*ck guncontrol and stop the violence!\n \n My $.02",

What you propose is the easy copout. It is much easier for politcians and the Bradys to push for gun control and dodge the real issue of societys' problem with violence.\n \n Plus guncontrol will restrict all people, innocent and guilty, by restricting God given rights. The policy is Draconian. It makes no distinction between innocent and felon.\n \n Give me a guncontrol law that will only punish the guilty and felons. Then you will start to sound reasonsable. You sound unreasonsable when you try to punish God fearing law abiding citizens and felons with the same law.",

   "Yeah, gun control laws are just the governments quick-fix approach to civil unrest. \n If a gun is illegal that would be the least of our worries if someone decides to go on a rampage.\n If someone wants a badly gun they'll get it, legally or not. \n \n By banning them we would simply be pushing the whole civilian gun market into the illeagal world. \n It would mean criminals would profit more not to mention the old \"in for a penny, in for a pound\" mentality would mean gun rampages would be worse because instead of using their .38 \"weekend fun\" pistols they'll switch to automatic assault weapons (which, imported illegally from the middle east/asia, kalashnikov rifles are CHEAPER then domestic US pistols).\n \n Tight gun laws would make the law abiding unhappy, the criminals richer and the high school shootings worse.",
