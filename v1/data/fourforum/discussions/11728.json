   "Let's see, which Party was the President from which wrote, endorsed and signed the Don't ask Don't tell policy into Law? It was a democrat. And didn't that same Democratic President sign the Defense of Marriage Act? Sure it was. In fact it was the first black President. So the real question is, which Political Party gives more pro homosexual lip service to that community in order to garner its support? To that question, the answer is surely the Democrats. But that just stands to reason because we all know they will say what ever the group they are speaking to wants to hear in order to get their vote.\n \n The problem with that Party is that once they get the votes and the power, they do nothing to fulfill the campaign promises they made. For example, the Dems have controlled the House and the Senate for 2 years now, can you name any pro-homosexual legislation they have brought forth and passed? I can't think of any. But we all know that when they were running in their respective State races, they all spoke to their local homosexual groups and made promises that they haven't kept.\n \n Just like when Obama and Biden have spoken to homosexual groups they have sworn to support Gay marriage, yet in each of their debates they claimed they opposed redefining marriage to mean anything other than that of a man and a woman. That is a stance that directly opposes Gay Marriage, and that's because they were speaking to a larger group of heterosexuals which is the majority demographic in America.\n \n The point is, if you can't believe anything these propagators of cheap lip service say's, then why would you vote for them at all? Because surely they are lying to someone. Why would you possibly believe they would betray the larger voting block for your tiny, yet very loud minority? So delude yourself if you like, but there is a huge difference between saying they are pro-homosexual and actually being pro-homosexual. \n \n When it comes to the American Left who have proven time and again that they have no moral center at all, what is funny is that you are gullible enough to believe anything that they say. emoticon_xgood",

She said the pro-gay position was so unpopular that she she could not vote that way or she would not be re-elected. If she was not in office she therefore could not help the gay community.

Either that or you don't care.

Maybe they'll come to their senses in this one.\n\n \n Maybe that 25% of the gay community realizes it's better to work within a Political Party that doesn't lie to them, because they understand that by working within such a Party, once they make promises to the homosexual community, they wont just be offering cheap lip service which you have gotten from the lying democrats for 40 years now.\n \n Sarah Palin made no promises to the gay lobbies when running for Governor of Alaska. But when a bill came across her desk which would have prevented homosexual partners from visiting each other in the hospital, receiving insurance benefits, and partaking in other civil partnership rights, SHE VETOED IT! As both a conservative and a born again christian, she vetoed it because she cared about what was fair, not about what was politically expedient which is the hallmark of the democratic party which governs by Polls and popular opinion.\n \n So you go right ahead and buy into the cheap lip service by an immoral political party which cares nothing for you, your so called equal rights or your cause in reality. I guess when one looks at each of your value systems, it makes sense that you would identify with them, and want to place your faith in them. After all, all we born agains offer you is eternal salvation through Jesus Christ if only you will place your faith in Him rather than in your very corruptible flesh. emoticon_rolleyes",

Even though they had just a slim majority in congress, and a president who was promising to veto what a vast majority of Americans wanted, they tried anyways.\n And they lost, but they didn't wait until the election year to put it up there.\n They also tried for hate crimes legislation, which again has majority support.\n \n Republicans? Voting drive lip service.\n Democrats? They tried for what should have been the easiest items, and got shot down by a virulently anti-gay Republican base that didn't care what the majority wanted.\n \n \n \nAgain, anyone who thinks that any candidate is perfect is delusional. But what does it say about people who either can't recognize when they are being lied to by the politicians they support, or worse yet, they realize it and support them anyway. Now that epitomizes self delusion and self deception.\n\n And you should know cause you're the king of those issues... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n But seriously, WHAT LIES have the democrats told gays?\n You have this boring habit of accusing others of \"lying\" when you should feel guilty for your own dishonesty...\n \n \n \nWhat is sad lesz, is that you just admitted that everything you represent is anti-christian and a Godless value system and you don't even realize it.

Either way, it speaks more to your bad character than to christians whom you so easily condemn.\n\n As is often the case, you try to extrapolate condemnation for a MINORITY segment of EXTREME Christians, and pretend we're talking about the whole.\n I would also label the few Christians who want to dictate my rights based on my life with my partner as \"fascists\".\n \n But I would ALSO point out that there are a LOT of Christians who disagree with these narrow-minded Christian fascists.\n \n \n \nMaybe that 25% of the gay community realizes it's better to work within a Political Party that doesn't lie to them, because they understand that by working within such a Party, once they make promises to the homosexual community, they wont just be offering cheap lip service which you have gotten from the lying democrats for 40 years now.\n\n \"25%\"???\n It's funny to see you toss out that whopper, while at the same time accusing others of lying.\n And \"working within the Republican party\"???\n Puh-LEAZE!!!\n Show me ANY ADVANCE that the log cabin republicans have ACTUALLY MADE within their party???\n \n You want to talk delusional?\n At least some Republican groups have had the good sense to withhold endorsement for Bush and anti-gay cronies when he refuses to give even the most basic of protections...\n \n \n \nSarah Palin made no promises to the gay lobbies when running for Governor of Alaska. But when a bill came across her desk which would have prevented homosexual partners from visiting each other in the hospital, receiving insurance benefits, and partaking in other civil partnership rights, SHE VETOED IT!\n\n I'm sorry, but can you link me to what you THINK you're talking about?\n As usual, you haven't a clue what's really going on...",

Democrats have supported gay rights issues, which Republicans seldom do. It's been largely the Democrats who have thwarted GOP efforts to curb equal rights for gay Americans.

The only time the GOP doesn't lie about its view of gay citizens is when it openly votes against their rights! The GOP just doesn't believe in individual or equal rights any more.
