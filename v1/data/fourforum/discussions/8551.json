   "Hello,\n \n Mental health is affected by one thing or the other, in every single moment in our lifetimes. We all touched by prejudice inappropriate materials, war, hate, influences, actions and so forth.\n \n Some of us however must deal with symptoms including, violent outbursts, mood swings, panic attacks, hallucinations, delusions, illusions, and so forth. It was not enough that the world is troublesome that these individuals had to be struck with an unforeseen force that controls their lives every single day, making it even more difficult than the average to survive.\n \n Louies.",
