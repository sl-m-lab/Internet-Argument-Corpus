   "It seems to me that if the founding fathers of this country were very bright, and I think they were, then their intentions to form a \"Christian Nation\" would be clearly evident in our founding documents. I mean, aside from their private writings where no indication of such intent can be found, wouldn't such intent be clear in the very documents that declared and established this country?\n \n To that end, I have examined some of the early documents, written by these founding fathers, upon which this nation was founded. First, there is the Declaration of Independence. While the view of the founding fathers was that the Declaration did not found a new nation, but rather returned the power to govern to the source, i.e., the people, this document is often cited as evidence of a \"Christian Nation\" by advocates of a repressive theocracy. The Declaration of Independence left the 13 Colonies without a legislative body and without law. As the founding fathers expressed at the time, the people were returned to the state of nature.\n \n Second, I have examined the eleven constitutions, written concurrently with or immediately after the Declaration in 1776 and 1777, which reestablished governments in ten of the newly independent states, and also established the independent Republic of New Connecticut (now known as Vermont) from the disputed territories that were claimed by Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New York. Three colonies (Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut) didn't draft and adopt constitutions until later and instead reverted to a previous charter.\n \n Third, I examined the Articles of Confederation, the initial founding document of The United States of America, The Constitution itself, and the Bill of Rights.\n \n So here are some questions about these documents. Keep in mind that the intent of the founding fathers to form a \"Christian Nation\" should be quite clear in these documents, if that were their intent.\n \n 1. The Declaration shows the intention to form a \"Christian Nation\" in that it mentions Jesus Christ how many times? a. zero, b. one, c. three, d. five.\n \n Of course, everyone knows the answer. This initial document of the United States mentions Jesus zero times. A bit peculiar upon the founding of a \"Christian Nation,\" don't you think?\n \n 2. The Declaration shows the intention to form a \"Christian Nation\" in that it mentions God how many times? a. zero, b. one, c. three, d. five.\n \n I'm sure you all got this right too. God is mentioned one time. Sadly for the \"Christian Nation\" crowd, \"Nature and Nature's God\" is an expression typical of deism, written by Thomas Jefferson, an undisputed deist. The deity was typically mentioned as the \"Creator,\" or \"Divine Providence\" (also in the Declaration). The idea was that nature was established by the deity who then had no further part in the course of events - thus, \"Nature's God.\"\n \n 3. How many times in the 11 state constitutions of 1776 & 1777 is Jesus mentioned?. a. zero, b. one, c. five, d. eleven.\n \n A hint. It's more than zero. It's true. Even at the state level, in founding Christian governments, the drafters of the state constitutions failed to mention Jesus Christ more than a single time, specified in the oath taken by the legislators in a single state, Delaware. While it may not have been a Christian Nation, at least in Delaware only Christians and liars could be members of the legislature.\n \n 4. How many times in the 11 state constitutions of 1776 & 1777 is the word \"Christian\" used? a. zero, b. three, c. six, d. nine\n \n Bet you thought you had this one too. The correct answer is six times in three of the 11 constitutions. But that isn't necessarily a good thing for the \"Christian Nation\" advocates. Let's consider New York first. Article XXXV of the Constitution of New York of April, 1777 states in part, \"That all such parts of...common law, and...statutes and acts...as may be construed to establish or maintain any particular denomination of Christians or their ministers, ...are repugnant to this constitution,...and they hereby are, abrogated and rejected.\"\n \n The Constitution of Virginia of June 1776 states in Sec 16 of the Bill of Rights, \"That religion, or the duty which we owe to our Creator...can be directed only by reason and conviction...and therefore all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience; and that it is the mutual duty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other.\" That isn't really establishing a \"Christian\" government but an encouragement to the people to respect the right of each person to practice religion as he sees fit.\n \n Finally, there is the Maryland Constitution of November, 1776. Christianity is mentioned twice in Article XXXIII where it states that every man has the right and duty to worship God any such a manner as seems most acceptable to him. It mentions Christians when it specifically extends the same right to those \"professing the Christian religion.\" In that same article, the legislature is authorized to levy taxes for the support of religion. However, control of where that money is to be spent is retained by the citizen rather than being given to the established state religion. Further on, in Articles XXXV and again in Article LV, a belief in the \"Christian Religion,\" along with requirements to reject the sovereignty of the King and to swear allegiance to the state, is specified as a requirement to hold elective or appointive office. It also states that no further religious test is required. It is interesting to note that the Supreme Court found a similar provision in the Maryland Constitution unconstitutional when a man appointed as a notary public was denied that commission by a court clerk because he refused to declare his belief in God. (Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488 (1961))\n \n At any rate, here in the Constitution of Maryland we do find intent to form a \"Christian Nation.\" However, I don't think that two of the 13 states that we have found so far are enough to ascribe that view to the founding fathers from all states.\n \n 5. How many times in the 11 state constitutions of 1776 & 1777 is there a reference to the \"Creator?\" a. zero, b. four, c. eight, d. twelve\n \n Did you take a lucky guess and say eight? Then you are wrong because it is four. In the Constitution of New York of April, 1777 the Declaration of Independence is quoted, all of it. Thus, just as the Declaration contains one reference to the Creator, so does the Constitution of New York.\n \n In the Constitution of Pennsylvania of September, 1776, the form of the oath to be taken by members of the state assembly contains the word \"Creator.\" \"I do believe in one God, the creator and governor of the universe, the rewarder of the good and the punisher of the wicked. And I do acknowledge the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be given by Divine inspiration.\" It goes on to state that there should be no further religious test. Here was the perfect place to specify a \"Christian Nation\" (or at least a Christian State) and it misses the mark. It doesn't require a belief in Christianity and thus, even deists could be members of the state assembly. Thus, Benjamin Franklin was not only a member, but the President of the Executive Council.\n \n Since the Constitution of Vermont of July, 1777 was an almost verbatim copy of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, it contains one reference to a \"Creator\" in the oath sworn by members of the state legislature.\n \n The single mention of a \"Creator\" in the Constitution of Virginia has already been mentioned in question 4. Remember that it was in reference to the duty to practice religion and that every man is free to do so as he sees fit.\n \n Also remember that use of \"Creator\" for the deity was typical of deists and apparently acceptable for Christians.\n \n 6. How many times in the 11 state constitutions of 1776 & 1777 is there a reference to \"God?\" a. zero, b. eight, c. eighteen, d. twenty-eight.\n \n Of course, the mention of God is not an indication that one is a Christian. Such a claim would be silly in the extreme. However, the 11 state constitutions mention God a total of twenty eight times. Delaware = 2 - both times in the profession of faith for legislators. Georgia = 4 - in all cases as \"so help me God\" in the form of the oaths for various offices. Maryland = 1 - in the previously mentioned (in question 4) statement of freedom of religion from Article XXXIII. New Jersey = 1 - in a rather forceful statement of religious freedom in Article XVIII. New York = 2 - the first being the previously mentioned quote of the entire Declaration of Independence and the second being in Article XXXIX, where it prohibits ministers of religion from holding any state office. Peculiar if the intent was to establish a \"Christian Nation.\" North Carolina = 2 - once in a weak statement of religious freedom, and once in Article XXXII, where denial of God or the Protestant faith prohibits service in any state office. (So that makes 3 \"Christian Nations.\") Pennsylvania = 3 - twice in Article II, a forceful statement of religious freedom, and once in Sect. 10, in the oath taken by legislators. South Carolina = 1 - in the oath taken by legislators. Vermont = 12 - 9 are in the form of various oaths, and 3 are in the statement of religious freedom.\n \n 7. In how many of the 13 original states plus the Republic of Vermont were members of the clergy allowed to sit in the legislature? a. fourteen, b. nine, c. five, d. three.\n \n I presume that the answer is five, since nine states expressly forbade members of the clergy from being elected to the legislature. Some were stricter than others and prohibited clergy members from holding any office in government or commission in the militia. The states were Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, New York, South Carolina, and New Hampshire.\n \n 8. How many total times did the Articles of Confederation mention God, Jesus, Christian, Creator, or religion? a. zero, b. three, c. five, d. seven\n \n You're getting the hang of this by now, aren't you? Yes, it's true. The initial founding document of the United States of America, the Articles of Confederation, contained references to any of the above zero times. Wouldn't it be more logical that if it were the intent of the men who wrote the Articles of Confederation to establish a \"Christian Nation\" there would be some mention of Jesus, God, or religion?\n \n 9. How many times does the Constitution of the United States mention God, Jesus, Creator, or Christian? a. zero, b. three, c. five, d. seven.\n \n I'm sure you got this one right too. Again, the answer is zero times. It's a peculiar state of affairs for a document that is purported to establish a \"Christian Nation.\"\n \n 10. How many times does the Constitution of the United States make any reference to religion? a. zero, b. one, c. two, d. three.\n \n I know that it seems strange for a \"Christian Nation,\" but the answer is once, in 3. of Article VI. \"but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.\"\n \n 11. How many times does the Bill of Rights mention God, Jesus, Creator, Christian, or make any reference to religion? a. zero, b. one, c. two, d. three.\n \n You all got this one too, right? The answer is, of course, one time in the First Amendment. \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;\" Again, strange if the purpose was the establishment of a \"Christian Nation.\"\n \n 12. How many of the 13 original colonies had an established religion at one time or another in their history? a. thirteen, b. twelve, c. eight, d. five.\n \n Every one of them with the exception of Rhode Island. One of the final works of James Madison before he left for the Continental Convention of 1787 was to defeat a bill that would have paid \"teachers of Christian religion\" from taxes, and then to reintroduce Jefferson's religious freedom bill that essentially disestablished the Anglican church in Virginia. The last state to have an established church was the Congregational church of Massachusetts. There is a letter from Thomas Jefferson to John Adams congratulating Adams on the occasion.\n \n 13. \"Christian Nation\" advocates claim that they are correct because most of the people of the 13 colonies were Christians. In reality, according to historians, what percentage of the people actually attended any church at around the time of the Revolution? a. 75-90%, b. 50-75%, c. 20-50%, d. 5-20%.\n \n Did you guess d? Right. For example, Lynn R. Buzzard, executive director of the Christian Legal Society states that not only were a good many of the revolutionary leaders deists, but that perhaps as little as 5% of the populace were church members. Other sources (I have 5 more) place the number as low as 4% up to 10-15%.\n \n 14. True or false. The Constitution of the United States does not mention the separation of church and state.\n \n A big talking point with the \"Christian Nation\" crowd, it is true. But our Constitution is based on the principle that any power not granted to the federal government by the Constitution is reserved to the people and the states. Thus, since no religious powers are granted, the federal government has no right to legislate in religious matters. At least this is what was argued at the time of the ratification of the Constitution. Nevertheless, the First Amendment formalized the restriction on the Congress. It was actually Thomas Jefferson who stated that the purpose of the First Amendment was to erect a \"wall of separation\" between church and state.\n \n And isn't it funny that \"Christian Nation\" advocates think that it is meaningful that the separation of church and state isn't specifically mentioned, and yet have no problem with the fact that God, Jesus, and Christian Nation aren't mentioned either?\n \n 15. How many of the first 7 Presidents of the United States were Christians? a. zero, b. two, c. four, d. six.\n \n According to the Reverend Bird Wilson, an Episcopal minister in Albany, \"among all our presidents from Washington downward, not one was a professor of religion.\" Rev. Wilson, in the same sermon in 1831 asserted that the founders of our nation were nearly all Infidels, and that of the presidents who had to that time been elected, not a one had professed a belief in Christianity. Those Presidents were Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, J.Q. Adams, and Jackson. During his time as President Jackson was never known to attend church. However, after he left the Presidency and retired to Nashville, he joined the First Presbyterian Church. He was over 70 at the time.\n \n It seems to me that if it was the intention to found a \"Christian Nation\" that their intent would be quite clear. The founding fathers of at least three states had no problem in making their intentions known. To participate in those governments a citizen had to be a Christian. In others, it seems that deism would also have been acceptable. But in our \"Christian Nation\" matters of religion are dealt with only in the form of restrictions on the part of the government to interfere with the free practice of any religion. To me the intent to form a secular nation is quite clear.\n \n Tell us how you did on this quiz.",

   "Rather than responding to your childish and very inaccurate quiz which makes massive fallacious assumptions and asks all of the wrong questions regarding your bogus claim that born again evangelicals \"which is implied but not stated categorically by you,\" or any knowledgable americans believe the founders ever intended to form a CHRISTIAN NATION, Let me offer the truth regarding their intention in forming this new country. \n \n I mean, any schmuck should be able to deduce that it was England that had a State Religion which was in fact a christian sect, and the Puritans left England in order to escape that forced and oppressive religious indoctrination. So why would our founders attempt to create a form of government that imposed any type of state religion upon its citizenry? It makes absolutely no sense so the complete premise of this thread is not only stupid but bogus, to the max. \n \n In all of your mindless rant you never pointed out one true original intent of the founding Fathers. Simply put, the founders were painfully clear that the Government \"could not\" EVER impose any State Religion on the People who in fact are the reason for the government existing for the people, by the people and of the people.\n \n How this intent could ever be interpreted by anyone as the founders wanting to create a \"CHRISTIAN NATION\" is beyond me. The only people who make this claim are militant atheists who are seeking to create a red herring issue in order to further erase God from the public square through a manufactured paranoia of a non existent religious intrusion or expansion by Christians.\n \n What is in fact reality and has always been a reality in America is that Christianity is to be freely practiced without fear of intimidation just as every other religion is free to be practiced by however large or small a segment of the population.\n \n When Madalyn Murray O'Hair successfully had prayer and bible reading in public schools declared unconstitutional in 1963, she affectively created an issue where none had existed prior to her godless crusade. I know this because I was a 10 year old moslem child in public school at the very time of the ruling and I was never forced to say any type of christian prayer or any prayer at all in school. \n \n We were not pressured to pray or made to feel guilty if we didn't pray. I went to school with JWs who wouldn't pledge allegiance to the flag and don't remember any of them ever being harassed for practicing that part of their religion. \n \n Atheists must create nonexistent issues in order to further oppress the freedom of religion that must always exist in America while never being forced on anyone to practice any specific religion at all. It was this fundamental freedom of religion that made America the great melting pot that became the richest, freest and most industrious nation in the history of the planet, in the shortest amount of time.\n \n Only in this country could immigrants come here, and one generation later have children who had assimilated to become successful first generation americans with full confidence that the government existed to protect them and their rights as full and equal citizens. \n \n It is the radical agenda of divide and conquer from the militant atheist that has done so much damage to the unity that once existed in this country. Those who must demonize anyone who holds to spiritual values are the people who have created dissent and mistrust to the point of damaging the very confidence in the republic for which we once stood as a people, rather than the fragmented groups of peoples we are today in this fractured country of US vs THEM. \n \n That atmosphere exists because of you and your ilk pandion, not me and mine. And this libelous and inaccurate thread is solid evidence of the ignorance and divisiveness that defines your type.",

That's pretty shrill. It's hard to discuss things with a small child having a tantrum, but I'll try. First, you state that my quiz is inaccurate. Please point out those inaccuracies. Be specific. What did I get wrong. For example, where is your god mentioned in the Constitution? Secondly, the christian nation claim is quite common from ignorant christians. If you had paid attention you would have heard it from the both Presidents Bush, Newt Gingrich, Sarah Palin, Rick Santorum, Michele Bachmann, etc. I certainly would never think that anyone who had actually read the Constitution or any of the historical documents would think that this was founded as a christian nation.

By the way, the Puritans left England to establish a colony where they could enforce their own oppressive religious indoctrination.

You are aware that the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay Colony actually used to hang religious dissenters, aren't you?\n \nSo why would our founders attempt to create a form of government that imposed any type of state religion upon its citizenry? It makes absolutely no sense so the complete premise of this thread is not only stupid but bogus, to the max.\n\n I don't know why, but 12 of the 13 original colonies did so. And, as mentioned, I have heard such claims from christians all my life. Perhaps you remember Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, 530 U.S. 290 (2000). It was a case that involved prayer at school events. That case and the aftermath, including cross burning on the lawns of Jewish families by the christians who blamed the Jews, was on the news around here almost every night. Interviews with the citizens of Santa Fe were often aired wherein they quite clearly stated that this is a christian nation. So it seems that you are insulting christians with your whinning.\n \nIn all of your mindless rant you never pointed out one true original intent of the founding Fathers.

You didn't read the OP did you? Of course I am well aware that efforts (by christians) to introduce religion into our government were defeated. I am aware that most of the leading founding fathers were not christian, but Deists. Even John Adams denied the divinity of Christ - he was a Unitarian you know. Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, Thomas Paine, Paul Revere, William Dawes, George Washington and others were Deists.\n \nHow this intent could ever be interpreted by anyone as the founders wanting to create a \"CHRISTIAN NATION\" is beyond me.\n\n Me too, but there are enough ignorant chrisians that make the claim.\n \nThe only people who make this claim are militant atheists who are seeking to create a red herring issue in order to further erase God from the public square through a manufactured paranoia of a non existent religious intrusion or expansion by Christians.\n\n So you are aware of the efforts by christians to introduce religion into government and to erect religious symbols on public buildings? How on earth did you miss their justification for doing so? I guess you weren't paying attention.\n \nWhat is in fact reality and has always been a reality in America is that Christianity is to be freely practiced without fear of intimidation just as every other religion is free to be practiced by however large or small a segment of the population.\n\n Except that has never been the case. Christians have always been only too willing to oppress other religions. They still are, as far as I can see.\n \nWhen Madalyn Murray O'Hair successfully had prayer and bible reading in public schools declared unconstitutional in 1963, she affectively created an issue where none had existed prior to her godless crusade.

Further, god has no place in a public school. The silly mythology of religion should be taught in churches, not in schools.\n \n I'll just ignore the rest of your non-responsive, silly rant.

   "Wow! That's pretty shrill. It's hard to discuss things with a small child having a tantrum, but I'll try. First, you state that my quiz is inaccurate. Please point out those inaccuracies. Be specific. What did I get wrong. For example, where is your god mentioned in the Constitution? Secondly, the christian nation claim is quite common from ignorant christians. If you had paid attention you would have heard it from the both Presidents Bush, Newt Gingrich, Sarah Palin, Rick Santorum, Michele Bachmann, etc. I certainly would never think that anyone who had actually read the Constitution or any of the historical documents would think that this was founded as a christian nation. Someone expressed that idea to me. I was stunned.\n \nI mean, any schmuck should be able to deduce that it was England that had a State Religion which was in fact a christian sect, and the Puritans left England in order to escape that forced and oppressive religious indoctrination.\nAny schmuck should be able to deduce that the OP has nothing to do with England and any of the christian cults. By the way, the Puritans left England to establish a colony where they could enforce their own oppressive religious indoctrination. Any schmuck who can read and has made an effort knows that the Puritans established one of the most oppressive governments ever. You are aware that the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay Colony actually used to hang religious dissenters, aren't you?\n \n I don't know why, but 12 of the 13 original colonies did so. And, as mentioned, I have heard such claims from christians all my life. Perhaps you remember Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, 530 U.S. 290 (2000). It was a case that involved prayer at school events. That case and the aftermath, including cross burning on the lawns of Jewish families by the christians who blamed the Jews, was on the news around here almost every night. Interviews with the citizens of Santa Fe were often aired wherein they quite clearly stated that this is a christian nation. So it seems that you are insulting christians with your whinning.\n \n Could you point out where I even hinted that the intent of the founding fathers was to form a christian nation? You didn't read the OP did you? Of course I am well aware that efforts (by christians) to introduce religion into our government were defeated. I am aware that most of the leading founding fathers were not christian, but Deists. Even John Adams denied the divinity of Christ - he was a Unitarian you know. Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, Thomas Paine, Paul Revere, William Dawes, George Washington and others were Deists.\n \n Me too, but there are enough ignorant chrisians that make the claim.\n \n So you are aware of the efforts by christians to introduce religion into government and to erect religious symbols on public buildings? How on earth did you miss their justification for doing so? I guess you weren't paying attention.\n \n Except that has never been the case. Christians have always been only too willing to oppress other religions. They still are, as far as I can see.\n \n But you didn't attend all of the schools where children were forced to pray. Further, god has no place in a public school. The silly mythology of religion should be taught in churches, not in schools.\n \n I'll just ignore the rest of your non-responsive, silly rant. Perhaps you should read the OP before you make yourself look even sillier. You might actually address the topic in future posts.\n\n \n Sorry you find the truth to be so shrill. (I've quoted my post in question so objective observers can judge for themselves which of us is shrill.) But since you prefer the lie to the truth which is all you ramble on here with, its no surprise to me that you choose to see it that way.\n \n As for your 3rd degree and continued questioning of me as if i'm obligated to answer your stupid questions, let me say that I answered you and made my point in the quoted post. Why I would even attempt to reason with someone who would post such a ridiculously inaccurate thread subject with absolutely no supporting evidence that christians like me actually do claim this country was created to be a christian oligarchy simply boggles my mind.\n \n You people create an issue of logical irrelevance by accusing christians of claiming this Country was founded to be a Christian Nation, and continue to insist we believe that in spite of the fact that I, a self proclaimed born again Christian is insisting REPEATEDLY that I reject that claim and oppose any attempt to make this country a christian oligarchy with every fibre of my being.\n \n To summarize pandion, before attempting to weigh me down by challenging me to respond to your tedious, shallow and ignorant drivel, please first proffer evidence that what you are claiming is founded in any kind of reality at all. Ok? emoticon_xgood\n \n \nRather than responding to your childish and very inaccurate quiz which makes massive fallacious assumptions and asks all of the wrong questions regarding your bogus claim that born again evangelicals \"which is implied but not stated categorically by you,\" or any knowledgable americans believe the founders ever intended to form a CHRISTIAN NATION, Let me offer the truth regarding their intention in forming this new country. \n \n I mean, any schmuck should be able to deduce that it was England that had a State Religion which was in fact a christian sect, and the Puritans left England in order to escape that forced and oppressive religious indoctrination. So why would our founders attempt to create a form of government that imposed any type of state religion upon its citizenry? It makes absolutely no sense so the complete premise of this thread is not only stupid but bogus, to the max. \n \n In all of your mindless rant you never pointed out one true original intent of the founding Fathers. Simply put, the founders were painfully clear that the Government \"could not\" EVER impose any State Religion on the People who in fact are the reason for the government existing for the people, by the people and of the people.\n \n How this intent could ever be interpreted by anyone as the founders wanting to create a \"CHRISTIAN NATION\" is beyond me. The only people who make this claim are militant atheists who are seeking to create a red herring issue in order to further erase God from the public square through a manufactured paranoia of a non existent religious intrusion or expansion by Christians.\n \n What is in fact reality and has always been a reality in America is that Christianity is to be freely practiced without fear of intimidation just as every other religion is free to be practiced by however large or small a segment of the population.\n \n When Madalyn Murray O'Hair successfully had prayer and bible reading in public schools declared unconstitutional in 1963, she affectively created an issue where none had existed prior to her godless crusade. I know this because I was a 10 year old moslem child in public school at the very time of the ruling and I was never forced to say any type of christian prayer or any prayer at all in school. \n \n We were not pressured to pray or made to feel guilty if we didn't pray. I went to school with JWs who wouldn't pledge allegiance to the flag and don't remember any of them ever being harassed for practicing that part of their religion. \n \n Atheists must create nonexistent issues in order to further oppress the freedom of religion that must always exist in America while never being forced on anyone to practice any specific religion at all. It was this fundamental freedom of religion that made America the great melting pot that became the richest, freest and most industrious nation in the history of the planet, in the shortest amount of time.\n \n Only in this country could immigrants come here, and one generation later have children who had assimilated to become successful first generation americans with full confidence that the government existed to protect them and their rights as full and equal citizens. \n \n It is the radical agenda of divide and conquer from the militant atheist that has done so much damage to the unity that once existed in this country. Those who must demonize anyone who holds to spiritual values are the people who have created dissent and mistrust to the point of damaging the very confidence in the republic for which we once stood as a people, rather than the fragmented groups of peoples we are today in this fractured country of US vs THEM. \n \n That atmosphere exists because of you and your ilk pandion, not me and mine. And this libelous and inaccurate thread is solid evidence of the ignorance and divisiveness that defines your type.\n",

Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, Thomas Paine, Paul Revere, William Dawes, George Washington and others were Deists.\n\n \n <Flush< \n \n See my prior posts on the religious beliefs of the founding fathers. And to go further, let's look at what a deist is and what a number of your examples are on record as saying.\n \n One of the standard definitions of Deism, then and now, is this: \n \n Deism is defined in Webster's Encyclopedic Dictionary, 1941, as: \"[From Latin Deus, God.Deity] The doctrine or creed of a Deist.\" And Deist is defined in the same dictionary as: \"One who believes in the existence of a God or supreme being but denies revealed religion, basing his belief on the light of nature and reason.\" \n \n A true deist was one who believed God created the universe and then sat back and (1) did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations and, (2) did not give (divine) revelation to man. \n \n Benjamin Franklin, for example, did not fit this mold. Franklin said the following during the Constitutional Convention: \n \n \"I've lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing Proofs I see of this Truth &#8212;That God governs in the Affairs of Men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his Notice, is it probable that an Empire can rise without his Aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that except the Lord build the House they labor in vain who build it. I firmly believe this, &#8212;and I also believe that without his concurring Aid, we shall succeed in this political Building no better than the Builders of Babel: We shall be divided by our little partial local interests; our Projects will be confounded, and we ourselves shall become a Reproach and Bye word down to future Ages.\" - Speech to the Constitutional Convention (June 28, 1787)\n \n It&#8217;s pretty obvious that Franklin believed in a God who did involve himself in the affairs of men and nations, and Franklin also alludes to the New Testament as &#8220;Sacred Writings&#8221; which also reveal God&#8217;s revelation to man. So scratch Franklin as a true deist.\n \n George Washington was an open promoter of Christianity. For example, in his speech on May 12, 1779, he claimed that what children needed to learn &#8220;above all&#8221; was the &#8220;religion of Jesus Christ,&#8221; and that to learn this would make them &#8220;greater and happier than they already are&#8221;; on May 2, 1778, he charged his soldiers at Valley Forge that &#8220;To the distinguished character of patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian&#8221;; and when he resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the military on June 8, 1783, he reminded the nation that &#8220;without a humble imitation&#8221; of &#8220;the Divine Author of our blessed religion&#8221; we &#8220;can never hope to be a happy nation.&#8221; Washington's own adopted daughter declared of Washington that you might as well question his patriotism as to question his Christianity.\n \n In addition, the inscription on Washington's tomb at Mount Vernon is this:\n \n WITHIN THIS ENCLOSURE REST THE REMAINS OF GENL. GEORGE WASHINGTON.\" Over the door of the inner tomb is inscribed: \"I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE.\"\n \n James Madison trained for ministry with the Rev. Dr. John Witherspoon, and Madison's writings are replete with declarations of his faith in God and in Christ. In fact, for proof of this, one only need read his letter to Attorney General Bradford wherein Madison laments that public officials are not bold enough about their Christian faith in public and that public officials should be &#8220;fervent advocates in the cause of Christ.&#8221; And while Madison did allude to a &#8220;wall of separation,&#8221; contemporary writers frequently refuse to allow Madison to provide his own definition of that &#8220;wall.&#8221; According to Madison, the purpose of that &#8220;wall&#8221; was only to prevent Congress from passing a national law to establish a national religion. \n \n Several of your other examples have serious issues too.\n \n If these are true deists then you are muddying the waters of what a deist actually believed - a common trick of liberals and atheists.",

Others believed that the creator took some part and that it was worthwhile to pray. Whichever, they were not christians since they denied the trinity and the divinity of Jesus.

The best I can compromise with is that America was founded upon Christian ideals and values but never was the Christian Religion determined to be or intended to be the religion of record for all of its citizens. Never did the founders intend to or impress upon the citizenry that christianity was the desired religion of our Government. To claim otherwise is to pervert reality and to misstate what true christians believe of promote.\n\n \n The Poll Also found that 62 percent of Americans believe theirs to be a Christian nation - which, despite being down from 69 percent last year, is a formidable number. \n \n It is in Fact you Right wing Fundies who claim the U.S. is a Nation of GOD... Why keep denying it dude, you know it's truth...lol..\n \n I see though.. When presented with Evidence that the U.S. is in FACT not now nor ever has been a Nation founded on Religion you suddenly change your tune and claim it's a Atheist Conspiracy.. LMAO..\n \n How would YOUR god feel about you denying him?... Ooooo I bet that one hurt didn't it Podunk....emoticon_xkillemoticon_xkill",

   "How about you get your facts straight.. Jefferson was a Deist....\n\n \n Tsk, tsk...\n \n You evidently haven't been paying attention, which is why you still love that tax and spend slug Obama.\n \n Remember, a strict deist was one who believed God was like a watchmaker, who wound up the universe and thereafter did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. Plus, a deist did not believe in divine revelation (like God-given scripture). Jefferson obviously believed otherwise.\n \n Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said: \n \n \"Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have \n removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the\n people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are\n not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my\n country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice\n cannot sleep forever.\" (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781)\n \n Now why do you suppose Jefferson trembled for his nation if God would not pass judgment on a sinful people? Duh. You're ABSOLUTELY BUSTED, turkey.\n \n In addition he said the following:\n \n \"I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we\n are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their\n native land and planted them in a country flowing with all\n the necessities and comforts of life.\" (Monday, March 4,\n 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address) \n \n So, once more, Jefferson did believe in a God who involved himself in the affairs of men and nations. YOU'RE BUSTED AGAIN, turkey. \n \n Do you have the ability to learn and admit when you're wrong?\n \n Jefferson a deist? HA! Go sell that down the road to the liberals. They'll buy into anything.",

They are all alike founded on fables and mythology. Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of this coercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites; to support roguery and error all over the earth.\" \n \n \"Christianity...(has become) the most perverted system that ever shone on man. ...Rogueries, absurdities and untruths were perpetrated upon the teachings of Jesus by a large band of dupes and importers led by Paul, the first great corrupter of the teaching of Jesus.\"\n \n \"The clergy converted the simple teachings of Jesus into an engine for enslaving mankind and adulterated by artificial constructions into a contrivance to filch wealth and power to themselves...these clergy, in fact, constitute the real Anti-Christ. \n \n \n George Washington: Free Mason / Deist.\n \"I am persuaded, you will permit me to observe that the path of true piety is so plain as to require but little political direction. To this consideration we ought to ascribe the absence of any regulation, respecting religion, from the Magna-Charta [Constitution] of our country\" (George Washington, 1789). \n \n \n James Madison: Deist \n \"What influence in fact have Christian ecclesiastical establishments had on civil society? In many instances they have been upholding the thrones of political tyranny. In no instance have they been seen as the guardians of the liberties of the people. Rulers who wished to subvert the public liberty have found in the clergy convenient auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate liberty, does not need the clergy.\"\n \n Thomas Paine: Deist..\n \"I would not dare to so dishonor my Creator God by attaching His name to that book (the Bible).\"\n \"Among the most detestable villains in history, you could not find one worse than Moses. Here is an order, attributed to 'God' to butcher the boys, to massacre the mothers and to debauch and rape the daughters. I would not dare so dishonor my Creator's name by (attaching) it to this filthy book (the Bible).\"\n \n \n Benjamin Franklin. Deist..\n Franklin is clearly a Deist in most of his views and confesses as much in his writings. Unlike Deists like Thomas Paine or Ethan Allen, however, Franklin was pro-Christian. He attended church and supported churches monetarily. He believed religion played a positive role in society, and the Bible was a strong moral guide. Like most Deists, he questioned the Trinity and the resurrection, and was skeptical of the miracles of Jesus. Most of Franklin's thoughts on religion were not professed openly, but were generally inferred from the sheer volume of his philosophical writings and his satirical comments on religion. \n \n Samuel Adams was a Puritan. \n \n \n http://www.earlyamericanhistory.net/founding_fathers.htm",

Which documents would you like to hear about? Articles of Association, Declaration of Independence, Articles of Confederation, or the Constitution? Lets start with the Declaration and the Constitution.\n \n Signers of the Declaration:\n John Adams: Unitarian (not-christian)\n Samuel Adams: Congregationalist\n Josiah Bartlett: Religious liberal (nominally Congregationalist)\n Carter Braxton: Religious liberal\n Charles Carroll: Roman Catholic\n Samuel Chase: ??\n Abraham Clark: Presbyterian\n George Clymer: ??\n William Ellery: ??\n William Floyd: ??\n Benjamin Franklin: Deist (Free Mason)\n Elbridge Gerry: Nominally Congregationalist\n Button Gwinnett: ??\n Lyman Hall: ??\n John Hancock: Deist\n Benjamin Harrison: ??\n John Hart: ??\n Joseph Hewes: ??\n Thomas Heyward Jr.: ??\n William Hooper: ??\n Stephen Hopkins: Deist\n Francis Hopkinson: Presbyterian or Anglican\n Samuel Huntington: Orthodox christian (probably Congregationalist)\n Thomas Jefferson: Deist\n Francis Lightfoot Lee: ??\n Richard Henry Lee: ??\n Francis Lewis: ??\n Philip Livingston: orthodox christian\n Thomas Lynch Jr.: ??\n Thomas McKean: ??\n Arthur Middleton: ??\n Lewis Morris: Deist\n Robert Morris: ??

The reason is simple; they didn't talk about it. Christian nation zealots thus ascribe the state religion of the cololy from which them came. Thus, Jefferson is Anglican, Hancock is Congregationalist, and so on. There is also the fact of the high corelation between deism and Free Masonry.\n \n I have a list of 177 \"founding fathers\", signers of the meaningful documents or important figures. Where I have found an authoritative source, I have noted their state, religious views (professed and nominal), Free Masonry, education and other notes. For example both William Dawes and Paul Revere were deists (nominally Congregationalists).\n \n Information on the above can be found in the following books:\n Joseph J. Ellis. 2007. The Founding Fathers: The Essential Guide to the Men Who Made America. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Hoboken (Encyclopedia Britajjica Book)\n \n Ronald B. Flowers. 1994. That Godless Court.

That's how I know that Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe were Deists. both Adams were Unitarians and Jackson was non-religious until he was more than 70.",

Having read what several historians had to say in the matter, in his private correspondence Washington never once referred to god, Jesus, or stated that he was a christian. Further, as he was dying, he did not request a clergyman. Washington was never confirmed and never participated in communion. He apparently attended services as a favor to his wife.

It just happens to be a nation with christians living here.\n \n Many christian nation zealots point to the Declaration of Independence as evidence. They are confused. They think that religious sounding language is always christian.\n We hold these truths to be self-evident,Certainly not a christian concept since in christianity truth is revealed in a book of mythology. Self evident truth is a concept from the deists of the enlightenment.that all men are created equal;Again, not a christian concept. Christianity has always recognized that nobility and royalty are superior to common people. Of course, the attitudes of the southern christians prevented a prohibition against slavery in the original Constitution. All southern christians knew that blacks were inferior. We still hear the same opinion from various christian organizations, like the KKK, or the Arian Brotherhood.that they are endowed by their Creator with inherent and inalienable rights;Yet once more, certainly not a christian idea. Christians have always been willing to take away the rights of anyone who disagreed. Take the Puritans for example. Or Calvin's Geneva. Or the Spanish Inquisition. And there is no mention of Jesus, or even god for that matter. Later Jefferson refers to nature's god - deist, not christian.that among these, are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;Taking away life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness has never been a problem for christians. Christians have always been willing to take away all three from anyone who disagreed with their mythology. And, of course, the pursuit of happiness would have been sinful for many christians.that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed;Not a christian concept. Kings were king by the grace of god. They claimed that their power to rule came from god, not from the people governed.that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.[Nope. Not christian. In christian governments the people don't have the right to replace it. Just look at Muslim countries for examples as to how christian countries operated in the past.\n \n The above is, of course, the original 1st draft of the Declaration of Independence, written by a universally acknowledged deist. And the ideas are those of deism, not christianity.",

   "You can make a strong argument that James Madison was a Christian (Episcopalian)\n\n Actually you can't. Like Washington and Jefferson, Madison was a vestryman in his local parish. But he did not practice any religion. He seldom attended church, he was not confirmed, and he did not receive the sacraments. He was educated at what was probably the sole christian school remaining at the time (Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, and William and Mary all being nests of the enlightenment and deism), The College of New Jersey (now Princeton). Nevertheless, there is little evidence that he remained a christian after he left school.\n \nalthough I admit this is not as clear cut as Washington being a Christian.\n\n But there is actually no evidence that Washington was a christian. He wasn't confirmed, he never received the sacraments, and he rarely attended services. Never once did he mention Jesus or God or religion an any private writings. Anyone who disputes this has the obligation to cite the source. There was a book written in the mid 1800s that painted Washington as a christian. Most of it was fiction. Read the books that I suggested for more information. The famous picture of Washington kneeling in prayer beside his horse while at Valley Forge is also a fiction, based on a story by a lying christian that has been positively debunked.\n \nThat would put these guys at 4 Christian, 1 Unitarian, and 2 Deist.\n\n Not that it matters, but:\n John Adams - Unitarian\n Benjamin Franklin -Deist\n Alexander Hamilton - ??\n John Jay - Anglican or Presbyterian, it isn't clear\n Thomas Jefferson - Deist\n James Madison - Deist\n George Washington - Deist\n That's one, maybe two, christians. There is some evidence that Hamilton may have been a christian but there is also evidence that he may have been a deist. He is an unknown.\n \n That makes one Unitarian, one christian of undetermined cult, one unknown, and four deists. There actually is not doubt about the deists or the Unitarian.\n \n Anyone who disagrees needs to offer sources to support their assertion.",

   "The Constitutional Convention began on May 14, 1787. James Madison, sometimes called the \"father of the Constitution\", and subsequently the author of the Bill of Rights, was present for every session. He took a seat at the front and recorded the debates. On June 28, Benjamin Franklin read a short speech in which he moved that the convention pass a motion \"...imploring the assistance of Heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations...\". Franklin was an undisputed deist, although he did believe that the deity took an interest in the affairs of men. Notice that Franklin did not implore the assistance of Jesus or god, but heaven. Typical of a weak, but non-christian deist.\n \n The reason that Madison records Franklin's motion word for word is that Franklin had written it out the night before, and after delivering the speech, handed the text to Madison.\n \n Madison notes that there was some short discussion in which Alexander Hamilton opposed the motion. There was then a motion for adjournment that was seconded and passed. Franklin's motion was never voted on and was never brought up again.\n \n Seems strange that if Hamilton was a christian that he would oppose a weak deist prayer. But he did.",

I think anyone who will candidly do as I have done, will come to the conclusion that he was a Deist and nothing more.\"\n -- The Reverend Bird Wilson, an Episcopal minister in Albany, New York\n \n \"Dr. Rush told me (he had it from Asa Green) that when the clergy addressed General Washington, on his departure from the government, it was observed in their consultation that he had never, on any occasion, said a word to the public which showed a belief in the Christian religion, and they thought they should so pen their address as to force him at length to disclose publicly whether he was a Christian or not. However, he observed, the old fox was too cunning for them. He answered every article of their address particularly, except that, which he passed over without notice.\"\n -- Thomas Jefferson, quoted from Jefferson's Works, Vol. iv., p. 572\n \n \"I know that Gouverneur Morris, who claimed to be in his secrets, and believed himself to be so, has often told me that General Washington believed no more in that system [Christianity] than he did.\"\n -- Thomas Jefferson, in his private journal, February, 1800, quoted from Jefferson's Works, Vol. iv., p. 572\n \n \"I never witnessed his private devotions.

Washington was at least not sentimental, and he had nothing about him of the Pharisee that displays his religion at street corners or out in the woods in the sight of observers, or where his portrait could be taken by 'our special artist'!\"\n -- The Reverend M J Savage, quoted from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, p. 22\n \n \"With respect to the inquiry you make, I can only state the following facts: that as pastor of the Episcopal Church, observing that, on sacramental Sundays George Washington, immediately after the desk and pulpit services, went out with the greater part of the congregation -- always leaving Mrs. Washington with the other communicants -- she invariably being one -- I considered it my duty, in a sermon on public worship, to state the unhappy tendency of example, particularly of those in elevated stations, who uniformly turned their backs on the Lord's Supper. I acknowledge the remark was intended for the President; and as such he received it. A few days after, in conversation, I believe, with a Senator of the United States, he told me he had dined the day before with the President, who, in the course of conversation at the table, said that, on the previous Sunday, he had received a very just rebuke from the pulpit for always leaving the church before the administration of the sacrament; that he honored the preacher for his integrity and candor; that he had never sufficiently considered the influence of his example, and that he would not again give cause for the repetition of the reproof; and that, as he had never been a communicant, were he to become one then, it would be imputed to an ostentatious display of religious zeal, arising altogether from his elevated station. Accordingly, he never afterwards came on the morning of sacrament Sunday, though at other times he was a constant attendant in the morning.\"\n -- The Reverend Doctor James Abercrombie, in a letter to a friend in 1833\n \n \"In regard to the subject of your inquiry, truth requires me to say that General Washington never received the communion in the churches of which I am the parochial minister. Mrs. Washington was an habitual communicant. I have been written to by many on that point, and have been obliged to answer them am as I now do you.\"\n -- The Right Reverend William White, the first bishop of Pennsylvania\n \n \"Though the General attended the churches in which Dr. White officiated, whenever he was in Philadelphia during the Revolutionary War, and afterwards while President of the United States, he was never a communicant in them.\"\n -- The Reverend Bird Wilson, an Episcopal minister in Albany, New York\n \n \"The founders of our nation were nearly all Infidels, and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected [Washington; Adams; Jefferson; Madison; Monroe; Adams; Jackson] not a one had professed a belief in Christianity....\n \"Among all our presidents from Washington downward, not one was a professor of religion, at least not of more than Unitarianism.\"\n -- The Reverend Doctor Bird Wilson, an Episcopal minister in Albany, New York\n \n It should be noted that Washington never kneeled to pray. Thus, the bogus story (and picture) of him kneeling in the woods at Valley Forge praying is an invention, some might say a lie.",
