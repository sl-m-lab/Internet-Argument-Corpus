   "No one has given any evidence of these extrodinary events from outside the bible.. so, my skepitism is quite real, and I beleive, quite reasonable.\n\n \n Have some egg on your face, Trebor:\n \n THE SUN DARKENED AT NOON\n \n Circa 750 B.C.\n \n According to Amos 1:1, Amos prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah, king of Judah (767-739 B.C.), and Jeroboam, king of Israel (782-753 B.C.). The name \"Amos\" is derived from the Hebrew term meaning, \"lift a burden,\" or \"burden-bearer\" (note Isaiah 9:4, speaking of the coming Messiah as one who would carry our burdens, and also Matthew 11:28). His calling by God was to foretell of pending judgments upon a number of surrounding nations, and particularly of a coming judgment upon Israel. As is common with other Biblical prophets, along with the promise of impending judgment, God also gave Amos a glimpse of events that would soon occur in the life of the coming Messiah, though the significance of what was prophesied may or may not have been made known to Amos. And so it is in the Old Testament book of Amos that we find a prophecy that for many centuries was looked upon with wonder and curiosity:\n \n \"'In that day,' declares the Sovereign Lord, 'I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight....I will make that time like mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.'\" (Amos 8:9-10)\n \n It probably wasn't until the day of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in 32 A.D. that the prophecy of Amos took on clarity and meaning, for in Matthew 27:45 Jesus had just been nailed to the cross when the Bible records:\n \n \"From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.\"\n \n Just as the \"Star of Bethlehem\" marked the birth of Christ, so now God brought forth another celestial miracle to pronounce His death. This prophecy is one of those that is beyond the control of mortal man, and as such it dispels the theory that Christ could have manipulated events so as to make it appear that He was the Messiah. But is there any evidence that this really occurred? Did the sun go dark at noonday? In his book, Evidence That Demands a Verdict (Volume 1, pages 81-87), Josh McDowell provides the following historical evidence that what took place at Calvary was more that just fanciful mythology:\n \n Concerning the Samaritan-born historian Thallus, circa 52 A.D: (The writings of Thallus no longer exist, yet were alluded to by the historian Julius Africanus, as follows): \"Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away this darkness as an eclipse of the sun - unreasonably, as it seems to me - unreasonably, of course, because a solar eclipse could not take place at the time of a full moon, and it was at the season of the Paschal full moon that Christ died.\"\n \n Likewise, Africanus wrote concerning the writings of another first century historian by the name of Phlegon: \"....during the time of Tiberius Caesar an eclipse of the sun occurred during the full moon.\" \n \n Phlegon is also mentioned by the historian Origen in his work, \"Contra Celsum,\" book 2, sections 14, 39, and 59: \"Phlegon mentioned the eclipse that took place during the crucifixion of the Lord Christ....and this is shown by the historical account itself of Tiberius Caesar.\" Apparently at one time there were historical accounts of the strange darkness that came over the land that were kept in the official archives of Tiberius Caesar, though they are likely lost to history.\n \n Finally, the 2nd century Roman born jurist and theologian Tertullian referred to a Roman archives report of an \"unexplained darkness that took place during the reign of Tiberius Caesar, as can be seen in the archives of Pontius Pilate.\"\n \n The darkness spoken of in the book of Matthew occurred between noon and three P.M. in the afternoon (from the sixth to the ninth hours, as the Jews were noted as referring to the sixth and the ninth hours of daylight). Note that a solar eclipse will take less than an hour to complete, and a total solar eclipse lasts just a few minutes. This, coupled with the fact that a solar eclipse cannot occur during a full moon (the moon would be on the 'other' side of the earth), provides further evidence that what occurred was something other than an eclipse of the sun. Just what it was no one can say for sure, just that from recorded historical sources there was a strange darkness during the time of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. From God's perspective, it surely was a time of mourning for His only begotten son. \n \n Jesus once said, \"I am the light of the world.\" So it shouldn't be surprising that during his death there might be a time of darkness over the land. \n \n \n REFERENCE: McDowell, Josh.

   "A bit about the darkness legend.\n \n \n \n \nJohn makes no mention of any such events, nor does Paul or any other New Testament author. Such a story has obvious mythic overtones and can easily be doubted. That a solar eclipse should mark the death of a king was common lore among Greeks and other Mediterranean peoples (Herodotus 7.37, Plutarch Pelopidas 31.3 and Aemilius Paulus 17.7-11, Dio Cassius 55.29.3, John Lydus De Ostentis 70.a), and that such events corresponded with earthquakes was also a scientific superstition (Aristotle Meteorology 367.b.2, Pliny Natural History 2.195, Virgil Georgics 2.47.478-80). It was also typical to assimilate eclipses to major historic events, even when they did not originally correspond, or to invent eclipses for this purpose (Pr\u00e9aux claims to have counted 200 examples in extant literature; Boeuffle and Newton have also remarked on this tendency). The gospel stories also make a solar eclipse impossible: the crucifixion passover happened during a full moon, and the darkness supposedly lasted three hours (indeed, Julius Africanus claimed it covered the whole world). Such an impossible event would not fail to be recorded in the works of Seneca, Pliny, Josephus or other historians, yet it is not mentioned anywhere else outside of Christian rhetoric ...\n (http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/thallus.html)\n \n\n \n \n \n Most scholars have assumed that Africanus is here quoting Phlegon, too, as a witness to the darkness story--although we know for a fact that Phlegon wrote in the 140's AD, and was fond of fantastic stories, so it would not be surprising to find him borrowing this one from Christian literature. But Martin Routh noticed some telling details: the sentence mentioning Phlegon is grammatically and logically out of place.\n \n In Greek, new sentences are marked by certain special words, usually left untranslated, such as MEN or DE or OUN, etc. The Phlegon sentence is not marked. That is like not leaving a period at the end of the preceding sentence. Also, Africanus has just finished attacking Thallus' idea of a solar eclipse, yet here cites Phlegon favorably, who calls it the same exact thing. Moreover, the flow of thought is broken by this sentence. Africanus has begun a rhetorical argument with the phrase \"let it be so,\" which is otherwise interrupted by interjecting a historical note about Phlegon. Remove that sentence (and the added \"Clearly this is our eclipse!\") and we have a continuous stream of thought that makes more sense. The Phlegon sentence, for all of these reasons, does not belong here.\n (http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/thallus.html)\n \n",

   "Hmmm, well, Brown was spot on with the idiotic policy of self-flagellation of folks in the Opus Dei. 'Twas there that I learned all about the wonderfulness of the cilice (a spiked leg band).\n \n http://www.rickross.com/reference/opus/opus9.html\n\n \n Ah, a spiky subject indeed (in many ways). I am no member of Opus Dei, but I have read up on it, and, being Catholic, have decided to try to understand why an institution so grossly attacked for crimes and practises so brutal as the ones cited has been accepted fully as part of the Church. \n \n Now, the concept of self-mortification has been the object of grotesque propaganda, and of myopic analysis. First of all, self-mortification is a practise preached by Opus Dei, but it is much wider and profound than a simply harming oneself. Self-mortification is a doctrine through which a person decides to inconvenience or trouble himself with unnecessary burdens, and offer that extra \"suffering\" to God as sacrifice. So, in a way, instead of offering gold or animals, we offer ourselves, although in a very graphic manner. So, depending on your attitude and personality, there will be different kinds of self-mortification for different people. For example, if it is difficult for you to wake up in morning, your self-mortification could be to try to sit up immediately when the alarm goes off (regardless of what you have to do later), and then offer that extra effort as sacrifice to God. Or, for instance, if you like long hot showers, you could try, from time to time, to shower for less time and in slightly cooler water, etc. The doctrine of Opus Dei states that, after a myriad of these small sacrifices every day, one strengthens the will to do what reason commands, and in so doing becomes ever more virtuous. As you begin to dominate the initial sacrifices, you may want to go a step further, and, for example, force yourself to become a volunteer at a hospital or orphanage, even though you have to tighten your schedule, or you hate volunteering. Then, you can go up and force yourself to go to mass everyday, confess more frequently (the once a week standard is not general, you set your own goals, with the assistance of a \"spiritual guide\" that you find within Opus Dei). Of course, your self-mortification must never interfere with your primary responsibilities, which are your most important offering to God. This is way many people are members of Opus Dei and it is not known: they are regular laypeople that work and study, and they try to do it the best they can, as well as offering these little sacrifices. The cilice and the flagellation are very high and (I must say) grotesque forms of self-mortification, they are of course not compulsory, but they do denote a profound commitment: you can offer your own flesh to God, as he did to us. \n \n Now, doubtless you will have something to say here, Simone.",
