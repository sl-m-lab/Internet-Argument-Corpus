   "You can download the entire thing here:\n \n http://budget.house.gov/UploadedFiles/PathToProsperityFY2012.pdf\n \n It is 73 pages long. I can sum it up for you:\n \n We are going to defund Obamas health care bill and NPR now. Everything else we are going to do in the future.\n \n Exactly how STUPID do these guys think we are? More importantly, how stupid do they think our investors are???? \n \n Lets look at history and reality. When Clinton left office, the budget in place would have led to the complete elimination of our deficit, plus a REAL surplus, despite the fact it called for lower taxes. Do you know how many of the cost cutting measures in Clintons budget survived? ZERO. The big fat GOOSE EGG. NOT A SINGLE ONE survived Bush and the republican congress.\n \n When Bush left office, his budget plan would have had us operating with a deficit of only $20 billion next year....and lower taxes. Care to guess how many of his cost cutting measures survived Obama and the democratic congress??? ZERO. The big fat GOOSE EGG. NOT A SINGLE ONE.\n \n The AMT has been \"patched\" to avoid gutting the middle class every year for over a decade now. \n \n THIS YEAR, we are going to spend like a bunch of drunken sailors in a whore house. IN THE FUTURE, though, ahhhhh....yeaaaaa, we are going to get our fiscally responsible grove on. \n \n Basically the entire thing is designed to NOT anger the baby boomers, we can screw them, they will vote us out of office, but we assume that the next group of politicians wont mind screwing their constituents and being voted out of office. It is pathetic. \n \n There are a few things that strike me as particularly poorly thought out. Article link (for those who dont want to download 73 pages of stupidity):\n \n GOP Budget Plan Alters Government's Role - WSJ.com\n \n \nThe Republican plan wouldn't balance the budget until the late 2030s. Mr. Ryan conceded balance could be reached faster with tax increases, but he said that would slow economic growth and damage U.S. competitiveness. \n\n \n Yep. 2030. If we assume that future politicians are more fiscally conservative and dont mind being voted out of office. Doesn't apply to the current crop....they keep spending. Just assumes that in the future politicians are more self destructive.\n \n \nThe federal portion of Medicaid, the health-care program for the poor, would be converted to a block grant to states, which would shrink over time, saving $750 billion over the next 10 years from projected costs.\n\n \n This one I actually like. I cant wait to see what kind of strings are attached. There have been some studies done on the most effective ways for states to provide health care for lower income people and the results have ALWAYS been the same...the most cost effective way is for the state to directly employ doctors and build hospitals and then charge for services on an income based sliding scale. That is the way most county health departments in my state work. There is none of this \"help you buy insurance\" XXXX. They hire some doctors and tell them to fix people. \n \n \nThe plan would convert the federal food stamp program to block grants, with eligibility contingent on holding a job or entering job training\n\n \n Does it also instruct the federal reserve to make 0% unemployment their primary policy goal???? If we are going to have a system where policy requires that we keep 4% of the population unemployed, we kind of need to make provisions to feed those unemployed people. Otherwise they shoot you. More food stamp recipients = less crime. That has been shown over and over. A hungry man WILL rob you and kill you. And if they are already doing that, they lose nothing by raping your wife, daughter, and any pets you might have. \n \n \nIt would eliminate the federal housing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,trim the federal work force by 10%, freeze federal worker pay through 2015 and raise their contributions to their retirement plans.\n\n \n Pretty much all of this I can support, in theory, but if you look at the actual 73 page pile of steaming XXXX you will find that they cut the work force by waiting for people to retire. More of that \"they will do it in the future...now we just keep spending\".\n \n \nErskine Bowles, the co-chairman of the debt commission, said no deal could be done unless both parties agreed to sacrifice some of their priorities. By protecting defense and tax cuts, the Ryan plan moves away from that idea, he said.\n \n \"If you're going to get bipartisan support, there's going to have to be shared sacrifice in every corner of the budget,\" he said.\n\n \n Here is something I can agree with. It is not part of the 73 page waste of time. \n \n I dont know if they have just decided that taking the most extreme position from the start is the best way to wind up with what they want, or if they are actually dumb enough to think this might actually fly. \n \n And I have to add this from the 73 pages of toilet paper:\n \n \nWhile there would be no disruptions in the current Medicare fee-for-service program for those currently enrolled or becoming eligible in the next ten years, all seniors would have the choice to opt into the new Medicare program once it begins in 2022. No senior would be forced to stay in the old program. This budget gives seniors the freedom to choose a plan that works best for them and guarantees health security throughout their retirement years.\n\n \n Any one of those seniors can CHOOSE to go with the program that only covers (CBO estimates) 32% of their health care costs, as opposed to the one that covers 80%. They can CHOOSE that....if they are retarded. They have that freedom! They will not be forced to stay in the old program that saves them thousands of dollars!! \n \n I am sure the founding fathers are weeping right now at the freedom our seniors are enjoying!!!\n \n So basically you have a report here from republicans that assumes huge amounts of savings in the future. Of course, none of the reductions they count on are ever actually going to happen, because politicians in the future ALSO will want to be re-elected....just like the politicians in congress are not making the cuts this year that the Bush budget had them making. If you step into the way back machine and look at the Bush budget plan, congress was supposed to have made nearly a trillion dollars in spending cuts since Bush left office. We can all see how THAT has worked out. \n \n And their \"savings\" are computed by comparing them to Obama budget, which is also composed of a bunch of XXXX that also IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.  It is a big theoretical circle jerk. \n \n I'm sorry, but if the savings are not happening NOW, there is nothing to say they will happen AT ALL. Assuming that in the future we will have a bunch of fiscally responsible congressmen whose life goal is to serve one term and then get voted out by a bunch of irate seniors, or strung up by a pitchfork carrying mob of starving poor people, is not an economic policy. It is an exercise in stupidity. \n \n This is not balancing the budget. This is not introducing fiscal responsibility. This is congress saying \"Somebody will deal with it in the future\".",

   "Despite my better judgment I decided to give the ol' plan a read. First off, this isn't really a budget but more or a guideline. Honestly, saying what you are going to do is not as good as actually doing it. \n \n The first thing that came across was the part about federal employees. It reads as follows:\n Boost private-sector employment by slowing the explosive growth of the public sector, achieving a 10 percent reduction over the next three years in the federal workforce through attrition, coupled with a pay freeze for the next five years and reforms to government workers' generous benefit packages.\n\n Now, that came across a little harsh to me. Truth be told a majority of federal workers are just trying to do their job and are not the deadbeats they are portrayed as. I have to deal with federal workers on a weekly basis and generally they work with me and do the best they can within a system that is not friendly to them. The problems mainly come with too many \"manager\" type positions, pay rates that are probably excessive, and benefits that are probably excessive. Seems like I'm saying the same thing, right? Maybe so, but I'm not stupid enough to put that in my budget plan. The last thing you want to do is alienate your workers when cause of the problem was not them but Congress itself. \n \n Next up was the \"reducing waste\" and from what I can tell that gives us a savings of a few hundred million because we are going to sell former Nuclear test sites as premium real estate. Sounds like a plan...\n \n After that I read the corporate \"welfare\" part. You want to end corporate welfare? Make Congress a 90 day session and require them to balance a budget. Once companies figure out that they can't get what they want in 90 days the problem will solve itself. Anyway, this is chalked up to pandering.\n \n \u0095 Establish a cap on discretionary spending for fiscal year 2012, and outline a path for enforceable statutory caps for the next decade.\n \u0095 Establish a binding cap on total spending as a percentage of the economy at levels projected to result from this budget resolution. Caps on the total size of government would be enforced by sequester.\n \u0095Require any increase in debt levels to be accompanied by spending reductions to levels set this budget resolution. If Congress fails to achieve these spending reductions, there will be an across-the-board spending reduction at the end of the year.\n \u0095 Create a budget point of order against legislation that would increase net mandatory spending beyond the ten-year window of the budget resolution, a limitation that can help check congressional appetite to create costly open-ended entitlement programs.\n \u0095 Close the loophole that allows discretionary limits to be circumvented through advance appropriations.\n \u0095 Take mandatory spending off of autopilot by requiring regular congressional review of mandatory spending programs, and outline path\nOk, these aren't all bad. The \"% of GDP\" for federal spending is a joke though. It makes little sense and I'm not sure what their end game is for this.\n But a flawed federal-state matching formula has fueled runaway state spending - and the results in terms of state debt are plain to see. Medicaid is now the largest line-item on most states' budgets - surpassing even education - and accounted for 22 percent of total state spending in 2010.\n\n Somewhere right now there are 50 governors giving Paul Ryan the finger. This \"path to prosperity\" assumes states just LOVE medicaid and are expanding it because the citizens of each state love spending cuts to education and roadways in favor of complying with bogus Medicaid requirements. We can get into this one if you want but I'm VERY familiar with the Virginia state budget and this is not reality. States would drop Medicaid like a bad habit if they could. Return Pell grants to their pre-stimulus levels to curb rising tuition inflation and make sure aid is targeted to the truly needy.\nHow about no more Pell grants. The evidence is mounting that it only helps tuition increases. Let's not pretend it even remotely helps college \"affordability\". \n \n And I'm done...I got to page 43 and called it quits. It basically seems this is a republican wish list with the deficit reduction cloak. The only reductions seem to be a little in military (which they didn't say when this would happen..as far I read at least) and a little bit of discretionary spending. *YAWN*. Looks like the only real plan I've seen is still the original Budget Deficit Commission.",

   "To be fair to the republicans, the democrats can't be going around doing responses like this one: Opinion: People's budget or roadmap to ruin? - Rep. Keith Ellison and Rep. Raul Grijalva - POLITICO.com\n After months of symbolic legislation aimed at pleasing its political base, the House Republican majority Tuesday unveiled its plan for America's future. Sadly - but not surprisingly - it looks a lot like the standard right-wing schemes that reward Wall Street while kicking more Americans out of the middle class.\n\n Kinda funny considering one of the authors voted for the Wall Street bailout. \n \n It goes on to say how the bill helps the rich and ruins the middle class, blah blah blah. My biggest beef with democrats has always been that they see things at a surface level...or at least act like it. For example they see \"end Pell Grants\" and conclude that is anti-education without bothering to think about the consequences of the program, if it achieves its goal, or if it is paid for. Sadly, the average American doesn't have time to research every issue and therefore will just default to the \"less money for education = bad\" approach. \n \n If democrats feel playing to people's ignorance is a winning strategy for our country than they are no better than the republicans they complain about.",

   "Despite my better judgment I decided to give the ol' plan a read. First off, this isn't really a budget but more or a guideline. Honestly, saying what you are going to do is not as good as actually doing it. \n\n \n I had forgotten it was due to be released yesterday. I kept seeing that treasuries were dropping but could not figure out why, and the media claim that it was over remarks Bernanke made monday morning was just plain stupid. It was not until I got a heads up in an Email and went back and looked that I realized that treasuries started dropping about an hour after the report was released. Coincidence?? I think not. \n \n A lot of people were really hoping that the republicans would actually put something worthwhile in this. Instead, for all the talk they did, it is just a partisan position paper with no substance at all. \n \n \n \n \nNow, that came across a little harsh to me.

Maybe so, but I'm not stupid enough to put that in my budget plan. The last thing you want to do is alienate your workers when cause of the problem was not them but Congress itself. \n\n \n Agreed. While I think the federal workforce DOES need to be cut, it needs to be targeted cuts. Just assuming that every federal agency can take a 10% cut and still function is foolish. The problem is that the portions they should cut also seem to be the portions republicans have been hired to support, like the department of agriculture (would anybody really notice if there were 20% fewer people at the department of agriculture??) or departments that the republicans lunatic paranoia tells them we need MORE of, mostly law enforcement. \n \n \nNext up was the \"reducing waste\" and from what I can tell that gives us a savings of a few hundred million because we are going to sell former Nuclear test sites as premium real estate. Sounds like a plan...\n\n \n This is mostly a case of XXXXXX in congress not understanding what they are outraged about. Do you want a free federal building? I can seriously hook you up with one. Absolutely free of charge. One is a 91,000 sq ft office building that needs $18 million in asbestos abatement. The other is 175,000 sq ft of production space that is radioactive. 2 years ago I could have TOTALLY gotten you 2 million square feet of warehouse and manufacturing space so heavily contaminated with nitrates that you had to wear a biohazard suit just to get within 100 feet. True. There was a fence. \n \n \nAfter that I read the corporate \"welfare\" part. You want to end corporate welfare? Make Congress a 90 day session and require them to balance a budget. Once companies figure out that they can't get what they want in 90 days the problem will solve itself. Anyway, this is chalked up to pandering.\n \n\n \n They can add that!!!! It will start in 2030, because politicians then wont want to be re-elected. \n \n \nSomewhere right now there are 50 governors giving Paul Ryan the finger. This \"path to prosperity\" assumes states just LOVE medicaid and are expanding it because the citizens of each state love spending cuts to education and roadways in favor of complying with bogus Medicaid requirements.

Let's not pretend it even remotely helps college \"affordability\". \n\n \n This is the problem!! They use a wall street designed definition of \"affordability\" that has nothing to do with price, it is all about being able to make the payments, while wall street collects its cut. That is the goal of the whole \"affordability\" dance. We completely forget that the best way to make something AFFORDABLE is to find ways to reduce the price. \n \n \nAnd I'm done...I got to page 43 and called it quits.

Military spending is low as a percentage of GDP therefore we aren't spending enough on it? Get real. First off, that number is totally BS anyway. Secondly, we could have the military spending of Israel (on a per capita basis) and save $100 billion a year. Yes, Israel who basically gets their money from us AND is hated by every country surrounding them. Last I check we have an ocean between any country that doesn't like us and we got that covered with our laser beam warships. If we assumed Canada's military budget and then doubled it we would save $500 billion a year. \n \n I'm also not convinced across the board cuts are a bad thing (you brought this up before). Every state was able to say 5-15% cuts for every department and nothing really went wrong. Virginia did it the past 2 years and looks like this year too (to some extent). I think that is a good starting point and from there cut the stuff that the federal government SHOULD NOT be doing (which is basically most of it).",
