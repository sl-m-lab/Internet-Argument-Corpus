   "Once part of Brady II the federal arsenal license.\n \n Section 204 - \n Prohibits a person from possessing more than 20 firearms or more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition unless the person is a licensed dealer or has been issued an arsenal license. Direct the Secretary of the Treasury to issue such a license if specified conditions are met, including the payment of a $300 fee for a three-year license period. Subjects the holder of such a license to all requirements pertaining to licensed dealers. Sets penalties for violations. \n \n \n SEC. 312. DEFINITION OF FIREARM EXPANDED TO INCLUDE COMPONENT PARTS.\n \n Section 921(a)(3)(B) of title 18, United States Code, is amended by\n striking \"or receiver\" and inserting \", receiver, barrel, stock, ammunition\n magazine, or any part of the action\".\n \n Any person who owns 20 or more firearms or more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition or primers (e.g. two \"bricks\" of .22 rimfire ammo) would be required to get an \"arsenal\" license. To obtain a federal arsenal license, a person would need to be fingerprinted, obtain permission of local zoning authorities, and pay a $300 tax every three years. His or Her home would be subjected to unannounced, warrantless inspection by the government up to three times a year. \"Arsenal\" owners would also have to obtain a $100,000 dollar insurance policy.\n \n \"Brady II\" redefines \"firearm\" to include magazines and \"any part of the action\" (such as pins, springs, or screws). Thus, if a person has two Colt pistols, three Remington rifles, and four magazines (of any size) for each gun, then he own an \"arsenal.\" Or if he owned two guns, six magazines, and a box of disassembled gun parts that contained five springs, five pins, and five screws, then he would own 23 \"firearms\" and would have to obtain an \"arsenal\" license.",

Sex real or imagined since no definate proof beyond he says she says has come out versus burning children alive. I vote turning children into crispy critters is far more heinous than alleged child abuse. As to the cause of all this, it was IMHO a botched photo op by the BATFE. What ever happened to a single man walking up to the front door, knocking and handing over a warrant? It was like they were going to flee any surrounded and in the open. No instead the BATFE charges in shooting the dogs first. Imagine if you will the horror of calling 911 and finding out its 911 killing you and the kids.",

Because it did not happen with a gun! \n   From a study by the U of Tennessee medical school \nUsing exaggerated figures allows health advocate sages to capitalize on the emotionalism of childhood fatalities and thereby evade legitimate questions about their proposal to ban and confiscate handguns as a means of reducing such (p.570)tragedies. We offer the following questions which, of course, are never mentioned in the health advocacy literature on children and guns: If so sweeping a measure as confiscating 230 million firearms is justified because some 273 children under age fifteen die in firearm accidents annually, is the less intrusive measure of banning child bicycles justified by the death of three times as many children in bicycle accidents annually?[226] If confiscating over 80 million handguns is justified because approximately fifteen children under age five die in handgun accidents annually, is a ban on cigarette lighters justified by the fact that four times as many children in that age group die from playing with then annually?\n \n Consider the fact that over 400% more children under age fifteen die in drownings than in gun accidents;[227] twenty times as many children under age five drown in bathtubs and home swimming pools as are killed in handgun accidents.[228] Few people need a bathtub (as opposed to a shower stall) or a swimming pool. If the tragedy of accidental childhood gun fatalities justifies confiscating over 80 million handguns, or all of the more than 230 million firearms, do the much greater numbers of tragic childhood drownings justify a licensing system under which only the disabled and others who show they \"truly need\" a bathtub or swimming pool will be allowed to have them?[229]\n\n It should be noted that accidents with guns is way down as compared with the time of the writing of this.\n \n   Firearm-Related Fatalities at Record Lows; -- Accidents Among Youths Down Significantly \n NEWTOWN, Conn.&#8212;A new report from the National Safety Council shows that accidental firearm-related fatalities remain at record lows, and accidents involving youths continue to decline significantly. \n \n The downward trends are occurring even as firearm ownership rises in the U.S.\n \n Statistics in the council's 2007 \"Injury Facts\" report show a 40 percent decrease in accidental firearm-related fatalities over a 10-year period ending in 2005.\n",

   "You digression into law suits or your inability to get insurance, jail time or poor people is diversionary.\n\n You need to live in the Real World. I have seen a lot of people who have gone to jail over the wording of the law. All unreasonable! \n \n We here in Ohio had a law that was made after the 1968 Riots, when the Black Panthers were carrying guns out in the open and in their cars. One of the favorite sayings at that time was Off the Pigs. Meaning kill the cops! \n \n So they asked the legislature to change these laws. They did so that no one could legally transport a firearm, anywhere or any time. The police guaranteed us they would not abuse this special privilege given to them. \n \n Well, all of a sudden, and just recently, some Anti-gun losers in Government started to prosecute people for transporting a firearm. And guess what. It ended up costing them their 2nd amendment Rights on top of it. It got bad enough that we had to get the law changed. And that was not easy! \n \n Also the Ohio Supreme Court said Open Carry was guaranteed by our Ohio Constitution, but in community after community the police departments tried to bully us out of our rights to Open Carry. Person after person in each community was put in the ground with guns shoved into the back of their necks while they were handcuffed and browbeaten. \n \n We even had the Ohio AG send out a ruling telling the police departments that this was the law. However, the cops decided differently. They threw people in jail in communities like Cleveland, postponed court appearance after court appearance at the last minute making it as costly as they could, waiting till the last minute to drop the charges. \n \n Do you know what that cost the people involved? \n \n Finally, Ohioans for Concealed Carry started paying for all of this and it miraculously is stopping. \n \n So do you want to tell me again, about all of your good intentions, and badly written laws, that you want to enforce on people's 2nd Amendment Rights!",

(about 25%) There are said to be 2.3 million gun owners in Canada, and yet 200,000 refused to register, and said put me in jail. Otherwise, they are law-abiding citizens; so 6 provinces choose not to prosecute, which is the right and just decision when government steps over its appointed limits. After all, who's government is it anyways? Does the government belong to the people? Or do the people belong to the government? \n \n 2003 article\n   1.6 million shun gun registry \n Ottawa - The grace period to register rifles and other long firearms ended yesterday with about 1.6 million shotguns and rifles - about one of every five such weapons in the country - still outside of the national database.\n But the federal government is not rushing to track down and charge people with unregistered long weapons.\n \n Overall, about 6.3 million firearms are registered with the Canadian Firearms Centre, short of the government's estimate of 7.9 million long firearms in Canada.\n \n In addition, Ottawa estimates there are 2.3 million firearms owners in Canada, of which about 200,000 have not signed up for a licence.\n Critics of the registry say the law will make criminals out of otherwise law-abiding gun owners.\n \n Canadian Alliance MP Garry Breitkreuz said the huge number of unregistered weapons and unlicensed gun owners is a sign of the system's failure. He urged Ottawa to scrap the costly registry, which requires all gun owners to get a licence and register their firearms.\n \n \"[This] creates a whole new class of paper criminals in this country,\" he said.\n Mr. Breitkreuz said he is not reassured by Ottawa's promise that no one will be prosecuted simply for the late registration of a firearm.\n \n The registry was initially estimated by the Liberal government in 1995 to cost $2-million, after licensing fees were collected, but is now pegged to cost $1-billion by 2005. The Canadian Alliance said the money should have been used to increase the number of police officers in the country.\n \n .

   "07/01/04\n  Martin targets gun registry \n OTTAWA -- How do you get rid of the gun registry without getting rid of the gun registry?\n \n Some time this year, the most mismanaged government program in Canadian history (try to think of something else that cost 500 times the original estimate) is expected to pass the $1-billion mark in spending, a year ahead of the Auditor-General's gloomy estimate.\n \n But the truth is, the Paul Martin government absolutely must dismantle the registry, and yet there is absolutely no way it can, and in both cases the reasons are political.\n \n Mr. Martin has launched a review of all government programs, with an aim to ferreting out and eliminating anything wasteful or obsolete. By any rational measure, the gun registry would top the list.\n \n Aside from the accumulated costs, the registry's annual budget is $113-million, and, as often as not, the government has to go back to Parliament for supplementary funding. Within a few years, costs are expected to pass the $2-billion mark.\n\n \n So 2 Billion dollars to register 6.3 million guns. Lets do the math. 2 billion divided by 6.3 million equals 317 dollars a gun.\n \n We have 300 million guns, so using the Canadian figures that works out to a whopping 634 Billion Dollars! Good plan Huh.",

   "Lets talk about Canada's failed gun registry. \n \n Canada's gun registration cost a Billion dollars to register 6.3 million guns, and 1.6 million guns did not become registered. (about 25%) There are said to be 2.3 million gun owners in Canada, and yet 200,000 refused to register, and said put me in jail. Otherwise, they are law-abiding citizens; so 6 provinces choose not to prosecute, which is the right and just decision when government steps over its appointed limits. After all, who's government is it anyways? Does the government belong to the people? Or do the people belong to the government? \n \n 2003 article\n   1.6 million shun gun registry \n\n \n I don't think facts and evidence such as this matters to leftists. That includes those who deny they are. After all 60 or 80 million firearm owners alone is a lot of keystrokes to record data on. Which means a lot of data entry peeps. Not to mention the peeps to collect data. On the flip side how do you deal with the ones who choose civil disobedience? If you criminalize those who won't register then does that mean incarceration? Now you are adding to the overcrowding of jails. Other than a bottomless money pit, what benefit to society does this scam offer? ",

   "How exactly would writing down my name, or your name, or the serial number of a firearm help arrest criminals or make you safer? Although at first glance, gun registration has a sort of tantalizing appeal, on reflection you have to wonder whether gun lists would be an instrument of crime control at all. Canada had handgun registration since 1934 yet not one crime solved by it. If it neither prevents nor solves crime then what motive could you have to do it. Then of course there is the question of fees. A nominal fee at first to cover costs which rapidly climbs until one simply can't afford it. On the flip side if you taxed proponents of registration a nominal fee to cover costs they'd scream. But hey its for the public good, right? Just a little inconvience to fight crime.\n \n The unfortunate answer is that, no matter how good it feels when the words first pass your ears, registering law abiding gun owners doesn't stop or slow down criminals. In fact it focuses in exactly the opposite direction. It is an allocation of resources that has no chance of achieving its goal, if that goal is the reduction of crime. If the goal is confiscation then it is a necessary step. \n \n With gun registration, the government has the right to deny a person permission to own a gun. This seems to be a direct contradiction of the premise \"innocent until proven guilty\". Not only that but once registered it is too easy to change the classification of a particular firearm from legal to illegal. How many times have you heard the pitiful bleat of, \"you don't need an AK47 to hunt deer.\"",

I think your side should take a good hard look at that. \n \n I know your side wants to paint all of us as Radical, Racist, Government Hating Trouble makers, but if one actually believes that, one would be ignoring some very critical danger signs to our Republic. Unless we get a good grip on this, your side and ours is heading for a REAL clash.\n \n That is what we are trying, and succeeding, to head off.\n \n Besides the Patriot Act abusive stuff that both sides hate, just look at who submitted Amics briefs for the original Parker Vs. D.C. case. Look at who defended them. Not the NRA, but two non gun owning lawyers in Levy and Gura, who put up more than one million dollars of there own money, and several State Governments to include Ohio who also submitted briefs. Everyone sat up and took notice to that, except the gun banners. The Gun Banners still wanted to live in their own little dream world. \n \n Then look at the Amics briefs for our side in the following Heller case. 31 States, the Vice President, and 250 members of Congress. Again, Who has ever heard of such a thing? Pleadings :: Parker v. District of Columbia, et al. \n \n Even after we won that 2nd Amendment challenge, you guys still want to slam us with all kinds of draconian gun control to include the VERY LAST thing you guys should be asking for. Gun Registration! But you guys want what you want, despite the Constitution's Bill of Rights, and want it anyway. You don&#8217;t in anyway care what we think, or want. If you could, you guys would shove it down our throats, and tell us to go sit and spin! \n \n Sinjin, my friend. We take the Constitution seriously! The Bill of Rights lays out very specific limits to our Government. There are exceptions to government, and to your side in this particular instance, that you should not want, go, or even ask for. But you, and some in the Government, desperately still WANT to even go there, despite what we think, and despite what the Constitution says.\n \n What do you expect us to do? Just throw away OUR beliefs, our history, everything we have been taught in schools about our Constitution, and our Constitution itself, for your Liberal Dreams of a European Utopian pipe dream Society?\n \n Sinjin, my friend, there are people who actually say, and the absolutely mean, Leave the Second Amendment to our Constitution alone and we wont have to kill you. I take them seriously, and so should you! \n \n Just recently Montana proposed, passed, and the Governor signed, legislation that says if guns and ammo are made in the State of Montana, are beyond the U.S. government laws, purview, and restrictions. \n \n WHO HAS EVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING? \n \n Now Texas and Utah have picked up that ball and are starting to run with it. I suspect even more states will follow. We have Tea Parties, and other state Governments are talking about asserting the 9th and 10th Amendment Rights. Freedom seems to be braking out all over. There is a change coming, but I doubt if it was the Change that Barack Obama was envisioning. \n \n It is not we who will make the next Tim McVeigh.

Obama continues to justify his title as the Greatest Gun Salesman of All Time. Sturm, Ruger's corporate report, in pdf. Firearm sales up 55%, production up 69%, but not keeping pace with demand, backorders are up to nearly half a million firearms.

Winchester Ammunition, on a company Web site, says, \"our team is literally working around the clock to make quality ammunition available for purchase.\"\n\n And yes, they are scouring the Internet in order to get, and stockpile, what they feel they need. WHY is that? Why are they so leery of you.\n   Sudden Gun Ammunition Shortage \n We spoke to a gun shop owner near Stevens Point who says his internet sales are skyrocketing. He says the orders are from all over the country. \n \n Feedback from his customers indicates people are having a difficult time finding ammunition in stores. \n\n Why do you think these conditions exist if the American People are Soooooo willing to sign on to your agenda?\n \n What do you think they are planning to do, if you go too far in their opinion? \n \n Besides the talk of Draconian gun control, we also have this American people Constitution friendly proposal. \n   Next step? No guns allowed for right-wing 'extremists' -- Bill empowers attorney general to forbid firearms for those 'suspected dangerous' \n A new gun law being considered in Congress, if aligned with Department of Homeland Security memos labeling everyday Americans as potential \"threats,\" could potentially deny firearms to pro-lifers, gun-rights advocates, tax protesters, animal rights activists, and a host of others - any already on the expansive DHS watch list for potential \"extremism.\"\n \n Gun rights advocates, however, object to the bill's language, arguing that it enables the federal government to suspend a person's Second Amendment rights without any trial or legal proof and only upon suspicion of being \"dangerous.\"\n \n ..... a recent DHS memo that warned against potential violence from \"right-wing extremists,\" ....\n \n \"By those standards, I'm one of (DHS Secretary) Janet Napolitano's terrorists,\" Pratt said. \"This bill would enable the attorney general to put all of the people who voted against Obama on no-gun lists, because according to the DHS, they're all potential terrorists. Actually, we could rename this bill the Janet Napolitano Frenzied Fantasy Implementation Act of 2009.\"\n \n For example, the lexicon defined the \"tax resistance movement\" - also referred to in the report as the tax protest movement or the tax freedom movement - as \"groups or individuals who vehemently believe taxes violate their constitutional rights. Among their beliefs are that wages are not income, that paying income taxes is voluntary, and that the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which allowed Congress to levy taxes on income, was not properly ratified.\" (Tea Party attendees?) \n \n   As WND reported, the relative of a Louisiana driver claims her brother-in-law has already been unfairly targeted by police simply for having a supposedly subversive, \"Don't Tread on Me\" bumper sticker on his car.\n\n And what, pray tell, is all of this about? \n   Oath Keeper Sheriff Richard Mack interview after Oath Keepers muster on Lexington Green, April 19,2009. \n \n All I am asking you to do is to take a good look. Take stock of what you are seeing and hearing. All of these, your fellow Americans good law-abiding citizens, are not purchasing up all of the guns and ammo they can get their hands on, just to license and register them, because you say so. Nor do they plan, in any, to tell the government everything they want to know. \n \n I am one person who attended a few gun shows last year, and stood in long lines in the freezing rain and snow conditions, and that is my read, from talking to several people while waiting in line to get in. What I am thinking is, you have just received a very big warning. We the People are speaking very loudly. But are you listening?\n \n You can't teach people that this country belongs to them, and teach people that the Government is their employees, and then not expect them to believe it and demand that to be the case. You cannot teach people about the Bill of Rights and how limited government is supposed to work, obeying the Supreme Law of the Land, and not expect them to demand it! \n \n That is what we were taught to expect from our Government!

   "The Waco Siege was investigated:\n \nTheir study lasted lasted \"14 months, employed 74 personnel, and cost approximately $17 million. The Office of Special Counsel interviewed exactly 1,001 witnesses, reviewed over 2.3 million pages of documents, and examined thousands of pounds of physical evidence.\" They concluded:\n \n The government of the United States and its agents are not responsible for the April 19, 1993, tragedy at Waco. The government:\n (a) did not cause the fire;\n (b) did not direct gunfire at the Branch Davidian complex; and\n (c) did not improperly employ the armed forces of the United States.\n \n Responsibility for the tragedy of Waco rests with certain of the Branch Davidians and their leader, Vernon Howell, also known as David Koresh, who:\n (a) shot and killed four ATF agents on February 28, 1993, and wounded \n 20 others;\n (b) refused to exit the complex peacefully during the 51-day standoff \n that followed the ATF raid despite extensive efforts and \n concessions by negotiators for the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n (FBI);\n (c) directed gunfire at FBI agents who were inserting tear gas into the \n complex on April 19, 1993;\n (d) spread fuel throughout the main structure of the complex and \n ignited it in at least three places causing the fire which resulted in \n the deaths of those Branch Davidians not killed by their own \n gunfire; and bullet \n (e) killed some of their own people by gunfire, including at least five \n children.\n \n While the Special Counsel has concluded that the United States government is not responsible for the tragedy at Waco on April 19, 1993, the Special Counsel states with equal certainty that an FBI agent fired three pyrotechnic tear gas rounds at 8:08 a.m. on April 19, 1993, at the concrete construction pit approximately 75 feet from the living quarters of the Davidian complex. The pyrotechnic tear gas rounds did not start the fire that consumed the complex four hours later.\n \n The Special Counsel has also concluded that certain FBI and Department of Justice officials failed to disclose to the Attorney General, Congress, the courts, counsel for the Davidians, and the public, evidence and information about the use of pyrotechnic tear gas rounds until August 1999. This failure resulted from a combination of the inappropriate handling of evidence and the dereliction of duty by FBI and Department of Justice employees. As more fully set out below, the Special Counsel has concluded that some of these employees also obstructed the investigation. [Two lines are censored at this point.]\n\n The Danforth report on the Branch Davidian tragedy\n \n Too bad this report was released after Oklahoma City bombing. Perhaps if it had come out sooner McVeigh could have been convinced to pay less attention to what the pro-gun side was saying at the time about the tragedy and thus the bombing might have been prevented.",

   "Didn't you suggest some folks, politically aligned with yourself btw, would kill me for my opinions?\n I choose not to participate in a debate where calls for my death are part of the exchanges.\n\n First of all they are not politically aligned with me. I voted Democrat for the majority of my adult life. I started voting Republican to get the Democrats attention,   but now there are many in the Democratic Party I can now vote for.  Even though I am a lot more selective on who I chose to voter rfor these days. \n \n Next. No I did not say that, and you know that. All I did say was, that I take these guys seriously and so should you. But for clarification, and so you can get as much mileage out of your ploy, Ill explain FURTHER even though my original post did an effective job. It is not about you or me per say, because these guys don't know who you and I are, nor do they care. \n \n What I was speaking of is the mood of some about the dismantling of our Constitution. The Supreme Court even declared it an Individual Right, and It is a First Right an Essential Right but you guys act like you won. You guys keep keep taking. And the question they ask is, Just what will make you stop? Given this.\n \n And so it this.  Rights and Responsibilities  \n Fundamental Rights\n \n This relationship of citizen and state is fundamental to democracy. In the words of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776:\n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\n \n More specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly, and the right to equal protection before the law. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy, but it does constitute a set of the irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold. Since they exist independently of government, in Jefferson's view, these rights cannot be legislated away, nor should they be subject to the whim of an electoral majority.(Meaning you) \n\n And here our Government recognizes: \n  Rule of Law: Fundamental Rights of Citizens Democracies exist to serve their people \n Democracies rest on the principle that government exists to serve the people. In other words, the people are citizens of the democratic state, not its subjects.\n\n So if the courts nor the Federal Government will will protect the Constitution, who will? \n \n  Human Rights \n(The following one-pager is taken from the U.S. Department of State publication, Principles of Democracy.)\n &#8226; To maintain human rights, citizens in any free society need to be vigilant. Citizen responsibility &#8211; through a variety of participatory activities &#8211; ensures that government remains accountable to the people.\n\n \n   former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&#8217;Connor says. \n The Bill of Rights The Bill of Rights guarantees Americans&#8217; freedoms, but citizens must ensure their rights are protected, \n From our U.S. Government website to boot!\n \n So at what point do they stop talking, voting and start taking action on the words that are posted on our Government's website? However a better question might be, When would you stop talking and start acting if our Constitution was in jeopardy? Ever? Answer that Sinjin!\n \n   Mike Vanderboegh: More gun laws would mean civil war \n There are some of us \"cold dead hands\" types, perhaps 3 percent of gun owners, who would kill anyone who tried to further restrict our God-given liberty. Don't extrapolate from your own cowardice and assume that just because you would do anything the government told you to do that we would.\n",

   "  Americans stocking up on Ammo causes severe shortages \n For buyers of firearms ammunition, the story has been bleak lately. Newly-stocked ammunition is bought out within hours. Distributors are unable to fill retailers' orders. At a recent Texas gun show, suppliers arrived with three semi-trailers full of ammunition, which was bought out within hours. \n\n \n I saw an AR15 listing at my favorite gun store's website. For those who don't know, that is the Semi-auto version of our Military's current rifle. When he puts something up on the site, that means he has been re-supplied and has them in stock. That also means he has a large quantity of them too. A supply that is far beyond his backorders, and feels the need to advertise them. That was 9am. By 10am they were all gone, and he was taking more backorders again. \n \n So gun controllers, what in the World is going on? What do you think is in the minds of Americans when, ever since it looked like Obama was going to be elected, that was October, gun and ammo sales went through the roof. We are now more than a 100 days into his administration, and Obama has sent a clear signal that the would not push for an assault weapons Ban, nor even dismantle the Tiahrt Amendment. And yet guns and ammo manufactures are running 24 7, and they STILL cannot keep up with the demand? The American People continue to clamoring for more guns and ammo. \n \n Honestly, I am totally perplexed and amazed at this turn of events! Money is tight, and this even seems to be a very odd occurrence to me. Yet I am one who approves of and welcomes it. \n \n   Editorial: Obama ducks \n .... the president made clear that his administration would not push to reinstate the assault-weapons ban that Congress and former President George W. Bush allowed to expire in 2004.\n \n Now, Obama has taken a pass on repealing the Bush-era laws that shield gun traffickers and their suppliers. \n \n ......Last week, handgun-control advocates revealed that the president's 2010 budget reaffirms the so-called Tiahrt Amendment, which hamstrings law enforcement in tracing guns used in crimes.\n",

   "  Gun sales going ballistic -- Fears of regulation, crime spur sales of firearms and ammo \nWest said a customer of his recently stocked up on .223-caliber rounds, a caliber often used in assault-style weapons. The customer bought 1,000 rounds a few months ago through a mail order company.\n \n Shortly after the purchase, he received a visit from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, whose interest was apparently piqued by a large-scale purchase of that caliber.\n \n \"His wife was home. He was at church,\" West said.\n\n \n   Gun laws and unintended consequences \n That's not the only recent incident in which the Department of Homeland Security has tipped its hand about its concern about the increased firearms and ammunition sales. In the (now infamous) \"right wing extrermism\" memo (pdf file), for example, the increased purchases were cited as reason for concern (emphasis added).\n \n - (U//FOUO) On the current front, legislation has been proposed this year requiring mandatory registration of all firearms in the United States. Similar legislation was introduced in 2008 in several states proposing mandatory tagging and registration of ammunition. It is unclear if either bill will be passed into law; nonetheless, a correlation may exist between the potential passage of gun control legislation and increased hoarding of ammunition, weapons stockpiling, and paramilitary training activities among rightwing extremists.\n \n (U//FOUO) Open source reporting of wartime ammunition shortages has likely spurred rightwing extremists-as well as law-abiding Americans-to make bulk purchases of ammunition. These shortages have increased the cost of ammunition, further exacerbating rightwing extremist paranoia and leading to further stockpiling activity. Both rightwing extremists and law-abiding citizens share a belief that rising crime rates attributed to a slumping economy make the purchase of legitimate firearms a wise move at this time.\n \n Notice, by the way, the distinction made between \"right wing extremists,\" on the one hand, and \"law-abiding Americans,\" on the other, despite the fact that the term \"right wing extremist\" is apparently to be applied to a very broad swath of the population, whether the \"extremist\" has broken any laws, or not.\n \n Here's a piece of free advice for those alarmed about the accelerated pace of firearms and ammunition purchases: stop making us think they're necessary.\n\n Ah the Democrats! You got to love their suspicion of people who pass an FBI background check every time we purchase a firearm! To borrow a line from a distant campaign, Its the Economy stupid, I would like to say to our Democratic controlled government, It's the Criminals Stupid!\n \n One piece of advice for our Government (from my experience) on how to find the people who mean us harm. You already know who they are. They are a vociferous bunch, and they will tell you everything you want to know. Just ask them! emoticon_ic",
