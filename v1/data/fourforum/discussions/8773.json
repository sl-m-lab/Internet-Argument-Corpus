One of the ladies in the secretarial pool at my old company had an ex who did not pay their child support. The guy had some major medical problems and had been forced to switch jobs to one that paid about half as much as the old one. She went to have his wages garnished and he contested the garnishment. They ended up back in court and basically his child support went from $600 per month per child to $100 per month for BOTH children. \n \n Apparently in Ks not only is your child support payment based on your income, but certain expenses can be deducted from that income, such as abnormally high medical bills. In that case they applied the adjustment retroactively, so instead of oweing her like $7200, he ended up owing her $600.\n \n I don't know if anything similar applies in this case, but if so, you may want to do some checking to make sure you don't end up shooting yourself in the foot.",

That is when you are talking uncontrolled or extraordinary expenses (medical bills, etc....).\n \n In this case, you are talking child support, which is a static expense.

In the states I was familiar with garnishment consisted of 65% of after-tax wages, employer paid directly to the state. \n \n Those enforcement actions were facilitated by federal legislation under the deadbeat dad act, requiring all employers to notify the state of employment of new workers within a ten-day period.
