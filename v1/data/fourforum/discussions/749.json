They intended for it to be a republic. In this country, everything is checked, and that should include the will of the people. Remember, each branch of the federal government is checked by every other branch, and in some cases, all three branches can be checked by the states. The will of the people should also be checked. Hitler came to power in the Weimer government because he convinced uneducated (and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean by grade level; I mean that they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand the situation the government was in) that he could help solve the problem. The electoral college was set up to prevent a person like him from coming to power. A person has to convince a majority of 538 people--who know what the issues are--that they are the best candidate. \n \n What about the one person-one vote theory. Doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the electoral college violate that? Actually, yes, it violates the theory, but it is obvious that that theory was not intended by our founding fathers. In the senate, Montana (pop. 883,000) gets 2 senators and California (pop. 33 million) also gets 2 senators. Already, we see a violation of one person-one vote. If we do away with the electoral college, we also must do away with the senate. In fact, of the four bodies in our government, only one (the house of representatives) satisfies the one person-one vote theory.\n \n James Madison, in Federalist No. 10, also states that the goal was a republic, not a democracy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe consent of the governed is the basis of the government, but the consent should not be reduced to a simple majority rule.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

It really is a rather arcane topic for 99% of the people.\n \n \nBut yet, your voting power is still virturally zero without the electoral college, so abolishing it wouldn't help much.\n\n \n Well, elections are often close nationally; 4 since WWII were virtual ties (1948, 1960, 1976 and 2000). In such an election, your voting power is the probability that, without your vote, it is a tie (if even # of votes) or within 1 vote (if odd). To calculate this properly, you need to model the probability of a voter showing up, of voting for each candidate, and the correlation between the two. That is hard, but a simplified model might just assume that the number of voters is fixed and each flips a coin. Say there are exactly 100 million voters. If you know what a binomial distribution is and how to approximate is by a normal distribution, you can type \"=NORMSDIST(1/SQRT(25000000))-0.5\" in Excel, and you'll get 0.0000797... as the result. That is approx. 1 divided by 12,500. This is not what one would normally call \"virtually zero\". (It is less than the probability of getting four-of-a-kind, but more than that of getting a straight flush, in a poker hand w/o exchanges.)\n \n Now an analogous model for Utah or DC would have each voter toss a biased coin with 80% or so chance for one party. Let there be 500,000 voters; then your Excel formula becomes \"=NORMSDIST(150000/SQRT(80000))-NORMSDIST(150001/SQRT(80000))\" and the result is way beyond Excel's precision, so it will give you a zero. A more powerful calculator (Mathematica 4.2) gives the result of approx. 10 to the -61075th power, which is a number so small it is impossible to comprehend. (Divide one by the number of atoms in the universe, raise that to 100th power, and you are still not there!)\n \n As I said, this is an oversimplified model, but I hope you can see the point.\n \n \nSince everyone's voting power is increased, each person has a greater chance of their vote turning the election. \n\n \n Yes, but that is still not a practical result, it doesn't describe people's actions. What I had in mind is that, theoretically, higher voting power should mean higher voter turnout (since it is more rational to vote if your vote matters). However, there is no evidence that this effect exists.",

   "The reason for the electoral college back when they came up with the idea was so that each state essentially casts a vote, with concessions given for population differences, for Presidential elections. Put simply, the states each cast a vote for President, some just get a little bigger vote than others do. This was in an attempt to make certain that no group of people was alienated. while accounting for the wishes of the whole.\n If you want a good example of why this is take a look at a map of the states each colored in one of two colors (say red and blue) that correspond to Bush or Gore. If blue states represent a state Bush won and red states represent a state Gore won America would look like a blue car with a pin stripe.\n Gore won states like California, and New York which have huge electoral vote counts due to their large populations, but he didn't win in nearly as many states as Bush did. Virtually the entire south voted for Bush, and most of the west and midwest did too. If you have popular votes then literally a candidate could sweep liberal votes in New York, California, do fair in every other state and STILL WIN. \n What you have just said is the traditional south, the midwest, and the traditional west can potentially have virtually no say in who becomes President because New York and California are huge. You have an entire nation dictated by the wants of two states with values not everyone holds. This is of course theoretical, but it is also possible.\n To make things simpler if each state had only one vote..G Bush would have won by a landslide.",

   "wjim,\n \n A problem I've been having...\n \n Suppose in a presidental election a state has a total of 8 million citizens who cast their vote. Now 4.1 million vote for John Doe and the other 3.9 vote for Billy Bob. Because of the system all 3.9 million of those votes are disregarded and they have no say at the national level at which our president serves. \n \n So now the 3.9 million have lost their say. Then when you have examples such as the 2000 election Al Gore had the most votes but Bush still won.\n \n Is that really fair? Doesn't this mean the American people really don't have who they wanted as president thanks to this system?\n\n \n Who the people want to be President matters just as much as who people want to be judges: it doesn't. What matters is who the electors want to be President. The United States was not founded to guarantee the principles of one person-one vote. If it was, we would have to do away with the Senate and the Supreme Court, too. You have equal representation: in the House of Reps. Outside of that, you are not guaranteed equal represenatation.\n \n Furthermore, the people are not guaranteed the right to vote for President. Yes, it is true. The constitution guarantees you the right to vote for your congressman and senator, but not for the President. The constitution gives the states the right to choose how the electors are selected. Currently, all of the states choose to have an election to determine the electors that are selected, but if a state wanted to have the electors selected by the legislature (which is what used to be done anyway,) they would have the constitutional right to do so.",

A Democrat friend of mine in Texas says that her vote hasn't counted in a presidential election in years. Demoralizing voters seems counter-productive.\n \n - The electoral numbers can elect a president who doesn't win the popular vote. Talk about a great way to divide the country. My guy won! No, my  guy won!\n \n - The arguments about the electoral college giving all the small states a big voice is a load of rubbish. What it does is focus everyone's attention on a small handful of swing states. How many times did you hear political analysts talk about Rhode Island vs. Florida/Ohio?\n \n - Electors in many states can legally vote for whoever they want, regardless of who the majority of people in that state voted for. I don't want to entrust some nameless elector (can you name yours?) with this kind of power. This mechanism was put into the system to protect the people from themselves, which seems overly cynical for the society we have now.\n \n - Instant runoff voting is the only way we're ever going to break out of the two-party system (fast becoming a one-party system)\n \n - Florida, Florida, Florida.
