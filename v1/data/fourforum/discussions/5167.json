   "The other week I was discussing methods for teaching children to be responsible for themselves with my fiancee. We don't have kids yet, but definately plan on it.\n \n My plan was to buy the kids their own sets of cutlery and dishes, and to have them wash them themselves. I figure if you start doing this at the right age, do it with them, and make it as fun as possible (playing with bubbles and stuff) then the kids will learn from an early age to wash their own dishes. If, as they get older, they don't want to wash them, then thats fine. But then they will be stuck using dirty dishes. This will (hopefully) teach them that there are consequences to being lazy.\n \n I believe this theory can be used in all sorts of instances, like putting dirty clothes in the hamper, putting away toys, etc.\n \n My fiancee thinks this is a silly idea, although I suspect that is because she is very resistant to new ideas and this wasn't how she was raised.\n \n What do you good people think?",

I agree with you on the yelling is worse than spanking, but I'm going to completely disagree with you on the structure.\n It's just a matter of opinion. \n I was raised completely without structure, but I learned how to make my own decisions at an early age because of it. Never been in jail, Never in trouble with the law, school, etc.\n Structure is good, but that depends on what kind of structure you're talking about.\n Grounding and curfews are stupid in my opinion. Never had them, and never needed them. If I couldn't perform my task the next day because I was out too late then night before, I accepted the consequences and learned that way. I'd rather learn WHY it was a good Idea to be home at a certain time, rather just to be told.\n Grounding? All that does is create hostility, because half the time, the child doesn't even comprehend why they're being punished. Make them deal with their consequences.\n Now with that said....\n Adapt,\n It's a good idea, but it sounds almost like you're planning on teaching your child ADULT responisbilities. That might just be a bad idea. You don't want your kids latching on to adult responsibilites right away do you? I wouldn't give a 5 year old a credit card.\n Stick with something like teaching them to put away their toys first or something. If they don't, they disappear, or the have to work to get them back... something of the sort. The dishes thing... the right Idea but I wouldn't use that example specifically.",

And fortunantly, much like a an infants circumcision (OUCH! emoticon_wow ) they will be to young to ever remember you ever spanking them at all. Yet that \"parental\" intimidation remains.\n\n \n Hehehe you go that right. We never did the whole newspaper thing, but spankings do not actually have to cause any pain as long as the kid knows they are being punished. I have a 2 yr old. I will give here a little swat ont he butt and sometimes she will look at me to see if I am spanking, or playing. If I am spanking, she starts crying and is inconsolable. If I am playing she laughs.\n \n We put here in time out sometimes, usually when she is tired and cranky and I can't get her to take a nap (she always falls asleep in time out, after a suitable period of grieving for her situation). I never put her in time out unless it is called for, but when she is tied it does not take long for her to do something that warrants time out.\n \n The funny thing about time out at our house is that it is indistinguishable from regular. We have a rocking chair in our living room that she has kind of claimed as her own. She lays in the chair and watches TV. when she is in time out, she lays in the chair, usually watching TV. The only diffrence is that she knows she is in time out. When she gets older, she will probably figure things out a little better and we will actually have to remove her to another room for time out. Half the time she gets out of time out, gets up, walks around the room a couple of times, then sits back down in the chair.\n \n All dependant on the child in question, of course. My daugther cna be reduce to tears...literally crying until she vomits, by a stern look and a pointed finger (from me, doesn't work for my wife). Just the fact that she is in trouble breaks her little heart. Nto all kids are like that (I know I wasn't).",

For most kids, your idea should work fine, so long as you help them and teach them how to do things properly (e.g., tidying room isn't stuffing things under bed; washing dishes isn't spraying them with water, but actually scrubbing and so on).\n \n My parents rarely set limits on me. They left me to do what I wanted, so long as I took responsibility for that (bar education, but I wanted to do well in that anyway, so it made little difference). A classic example was when I wanted to jump out of a first story window into our pond. I asked if I could.

However, when it came down to it I dont think that they would actually eat off of dirty plates. Taking in consideration their age. If they're old enough to do dishes, then they're old enough to know that eating off of a dirty plate is not a good idea. However, I do think bluffing them into thinking that might help. I dont know for sure as I have never used this method. \n But if the child thinks they may have to do that it may give them more incentive to do their chore of doing the dishes.",
