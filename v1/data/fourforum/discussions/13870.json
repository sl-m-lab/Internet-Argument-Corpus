   "I've just been wondering why all the anti-Zionists are complaining about how Israel violates the rights of Arab citizens. In fact, the Arab Government focus on human rights is nothing more than a political tool to demonize Israel. They have no real concern for human rights. I thought the Tyranny of Arab countries was common knowledge, but some are either too stupid or biased to accept it.\n \n Myths & Facts - Human Rights in Arab Countries\n \n \nMYTH: \"The governments of Arab states grant basic human rights to their citizens.\"\n \n FACT:\n \n While much attention has been focused on alleged Israeli human rights violations in the volatile West Bank and Gaza, the popular press has chosen to virtually ignore violations of fundamental human rights that take place daily in almost every Arab country. According to annual reports compiled by the State Department, most of the Arab states are ruled by oppressive, dictatorial regimes, which deny their citizens basic freedoms of political expression, speech, press and due process. The Arab Human Development Report published by a group of Arab researchers from the UN Development Program concluded that out of the seven regions of the world, Arab countries had the lowest freedom score. They also had the lowest ranking for \"voice and accountability,\" a measure of various aspects of the political process, civil liberties, political rights and independence of the media.1\n\n \n Saying that most Arab countries respect human rights is either a statement of utter ignorance, or a blatant lie. \n \n All the bold text except for \"MYTH\" and \"FACT\" is added by me.\n \n \nMYTH: \"Women's rights are now protected in the Arab world.\"\n \n FACT:In most Arab countries, the Shari'a, or Islamic law, defines the rules of traditional social behavior. Under the law, women are accorded a role inferior to that of men, and are therefore discriminated against with regard to personal rights and freedoms.\n \n As Middle East expert Daniel Pipes explains: \"In the Islamic view...female sexuality is thought of as being so powerful that it constitutes a real danger to society.\" Therefore, unrestrained females constitute \"the most dangerous challenge facing males trying to carry out God's commands.\" In combination, females' \"desires and their irresistible attractiveness give women a power over men which rivals God's.\"2\n \n \"Left to themselves,\" Pipes continues, \"men might well fall victim to women and abandon God,\" resulting in civil disorder among believers. In traditional thought, Pipes notes, women pose an internal threat to Islamic society similar to the external one represented by the infidel.\n \n So the Arabs not only deny women rights, but they strive to prevent women's rights as they believe it would be a bad thing. I hope all women from Western countries reading this stop and consider how lucky they are that they weren't born in any of these countries.\n \n Traditionally, the Arab woman marries at a young age to a man of her father's choice. A husband is entitled to divorce any time, even against his wife's will, by merely declaring verbally that this is his intention.\n \n Women in marriage countries don't even get to decide who they marry, and they can be forced to marry someone they don't love or maybe even completely despise. If you think that's bad, it gets worse.\n \n ..............................\n \n Wife-beating is a relatively common practice in Arab countries, and abused women have little recourse. As the State Department has noted regarding Jordan (and most of the Arab world): \"Wife beating is technically grounds for divorce, but the husband may seek to demonstrate that he has authority from the Koran to correct an irreligious or disobedient wife by striking her.\"\n \n So a woman may be forced to live with a wife-beater, and can be beaten for disobedience. I thought this was common knowledge, and I'm surprised that I even have to say this: married women in Arab countries are basically slaves to their husband. That's not even the worst part.\n \n ..............................\n \n According to the UN, \"utilization of Arab women's capabilities through political and economic participation remains the lowest in the world in quantitative terms....In some countries with elected national assemblies, women are still denied the right to vote or hold office. And one in ever two Arab women can neither read nor write.\"\n \n This reminds me of slaves on southern plantations in the 1800s. Plantation owners preferred less educated slaves, as they would be less likely to realize what a sucky life they had and rebel. The only thing they wanted their slaves to know was how to pick cotton. Likewise, the only thing the Arabs want their women to know is how to serve their husbands. The worst is yet to come.\n \n Moroccan law excuses the murder or injury of a wife who is caught in the act of committing adultery; yet women are punished for harming their husbands under the same circumstances.\n \n\n \n \nMYTH: \"Freedom for Palestinians in the Palestinian Authority includes the right to sell land to Jews.\"\n \n FACT: In 1996, the Palestinian Authority (PA) Mufti, Ikremah Sabri, issued a fatwa (religious decree), banning the sale of Arab and Muslim property to Jews. Anyone who violated the order was to be killed. At least seven land dealers were killed that year. Six years later, the head of the PA's General Intelligence Service in the West Bank, General Tawfik Tirawi, admitted his men were responsible for the murders.8\n \n On May 5, 1997, Palestinian Authority Justice Minister Freih Abu Middein announced that the death penalty would be imposed on anyone convicted of ceding \"one inch\" to Israel. Later that month, two Arab land dealers were killed. PA officials denied any involvement in the killings. A year later, another Palestinian suspected of selling land to Jews was murdered. The PA has also arrested suspected land dealers for violating the Jordanian law (in force in the West Bank), which prohibits the sale of land to foreigners.9 \n \n\n \n Another blatant lie from the Arabs.\n \n \nMYTH: \"The Palestinian Authority held a free, democratic election in 2005.\"\n \n FACT:\n Elections are not synonymous with democracy. Several Arab countries hold elections, including Egypt and Syria, but they have only one candidate, and there is no doubt about the outcome. The dictators are always reelected with nearly 100 percent of the vote. In those nations, no one seriously claims the elections are democratic.\n \n In the case of the Palestinian Authority (PA) elections held in January 2005, the standards were higher. These were advertised as an example of democracy and, compared to other Arab states, the voting was a considerable advancement toward free elections.\n \n Still, the election could hardly be called competitive as the outcome was never in doubt. Seven candidates ran for president, but the only question was the size of Mahmoud Abbas' margin of victory. He won with 62.3 percent of the vote. His nearest challenger was Mustafa Barghouti with 19.8 percent.12\n \n\n \n No person knowledgeable about the issue can say that the leaders of these countries are democratically elected with a straight face. \n \n Before you dismiss the article as Jewish propaganda, you'll have to prove that the entire bibliography for the article is also just Jewish propaganda or is biased in Israel's favor.\n \n \n\n 1 - Arab Human Development Report 2002, NY: UN, 2002.\n 2 - Daniel Pipes, In the Path of God: Islam and Political Power, (NY: Basic Books, 1983), p. 177.\n 3 - Arab Human Development Report 2002, NY: UN, 2002.\n 4 - U.S. State Department, Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1999.\n 5 - Martin Peretz, \"Remembering Saudi Arabia,\" The New Republic, (January 28, 2002).\n 6 - USA Today, (April 29, 2002).\n 7 - Al-Quds Al-Arabi (London), (December 4, 1999).\n 8 - Jerusalem Post, ,(August 19, 2002).\n 9 - State Department.

   "\n At least one source says the Saudi royal family members are the ones the suicide bombers are attacking.\n \n Saudi Suicide Bombing: Senior Prince Injured\n \n I don't think the sheiks are enamoured of the jihadists. It was the sheiks that booted OBL out of the country. \n\n They funded and built the radical Muslim mosques. Now the chickens are coming back to roost. \n SAUDI ARABIA'S EXPORT OF RADICAL ISLAM\n \n\n The Israelis, but they didn't do it on our behalf, that's for sure.\n \n Many say we should not have gone into Iraq to save the Iraqis to begin with. Perhaps this \"ally\" called \"Israel\" could have done that for us?\n\n We, purposefully, kept Israel out of the Iraq War so that we would have other arab states support. Eliciting the help of Israel would have been a bad PR move. That doesn't mean that they weren't helpful, however. Israel has always provided the US with good intelligence.\n As for our removing SH. It was the right move, but probably not the best way to do it. Under the circumstances, with our UNSC allies being bribed by SH to not sanction military action, I don't see how we could have gone about it differently, however. \n \n\n OK, and why do we need to continue training those folks? Or do you claim they need our help.\n\n Would you deny help from the world's only superpower if you were surrounded by antagonists?\n \n\n \n An attack on Israel would not be considered an attack on the United States.\n \n Formal U.S.-Israel Agreements\n \n Contrast that with the agreement we have with South Korea, signed in 1953.\n \n When push comes to shove, Israel is on its own. Thus it is not our ally in the military sense.\n\n The agreement with Korea was to prevent Chinese aggression. We really weren't too concerned with sand jockey aggression. They fight about as well as they dance. ;)\n \n\n So it's for show, as I stated.\n\n No, it was for appeasement as I stated.\n \n\n OK, so why do you care what happens over there, then. I sure don't. Let the games begin.\n\n We're not ready to cut the cheap oil apron strings yet and Israel is a good place to watch our \"friends in the ME\" from.",
