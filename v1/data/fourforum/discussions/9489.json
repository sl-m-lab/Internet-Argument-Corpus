   "PZ Myers' blog entry:\n \n \n \n I'm going to be interviewed tonight by Karl Mogel for his Mindcast podcast. I'm not sure how this is going to work; I think it'll just be made available at some later date. Maybe he'll pop in and explain how you can listen to it. I do know you can find past episodes in the iTunes store.\n \n He promised me he'd ask some hard questions, and also some hard questions of his other guest, the illustrious Ken Miller. We won't be on the same segment, sorry...there could be some vigorous argument if we were, and poor Karl might not be able to get in a word edgewise. It is an interesting combination, though: the extremely helpful and well-regarded speaker and biologist who is also an apologist for religion, and the pirate evilutionist with a knife between his teeth who brooks no compromise in his war against religion. We'll have to see what Karl does with the possibilities.\n \n \n \n Marc, stuff it.",
