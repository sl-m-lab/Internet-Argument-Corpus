   "PIPA and globescan just released this report:\n \n http://www.globescan.com/news_archives/bbcpoll.html\n \n \nAccording to a new BBC World Service Poll of twenty-one countries from all regions of the world, the reelection of President Bush is seen as negative for world peace and security by a majority in sixteen countries and a plurality in another two.\n \n On average across all countries, 58 percent said that Bush's reelection was negative, while 26 percent said that it was positive for global security.\n\n \n Ok, this part is bad\n \n BUT, if you scroll down to the \"negative feelings about Americans\" section, you will see that those numbers are actually down 2% from the last such poll (that was done by pew).\n \n Little confused, though, as it doesn't clearly state anywhere whether the new folks who feel \"mainly negative\" about the American people include those who feel \"worse\" about the american people due to Bushs re-election. It would have been interesting to see this broken down more.",

It would have been interesting to see this broken down more.\n\n \n I've just been studying the figures in the BBC World Service Poll (for which you gave a link). \n \n The numbers for Britain are \"only\" 64% negative, 29% postive (slightly above average negativity for all the countries in the list). I say \"only\" because I'm a bit surprised that Mr Bush gets nearly a one third approval rating among the British people who were asked for their opinion - and for this reason. There are about 10 national newspapers published in Britain and only ONE of them ever editorialises in Bush's favor. All of the TV channels are united in their strong disapproval of President Bush and everything he stands for.\n \n Most people seem to acquire their political opinions from the \"hidden agenda\" pursued by the press and television, and only a few people have the rational disposition and confidence in their own judgement that will enable them to question the received wisdom. On this basis, I'm surprised that 29% have been recorded as reaching independent conclusions - perhaps having resisted the trend of majority opinion. That doesn't mean to say that I think the 29% are necessarily \"right\". But I'm pleased that a significant number of British people do not appear to be gripped by unreflecting anti-Americanism despite Bush's obvious limitations as a politician and miscalculations in Iraq and elsewhere.",

I just know that the rest of them don't truly hate the US either.\n\n \n \n Yes.....they just love us so much it hurts, which they misread as hate....\n \n Christ, is this some kind of twisted joke? One to many Bush speeches (Bin laden, with his half billion dollars....just envies our wealth).\n \n Unfortunatly the world has seen (and now it is just up to americans to open their eyes) that the American system has failed. We have gone from the worlds biggest creditor to the worlds biggest debtor nation. Our industrial infrastructure is all but completely gone, and many years ago we decided to chuck all moral considerations in regard to foreign policy in favor of keeping our sinking ship afloat.\n \n We have the highest crime in the western world, more laws and regulations on the books than any other 3 nations on the planet (in order to control our population in a failing economy) and the largest prison population in the western world. \n \n We are running a trillion dollar trade deficit, as well as a yearly budgetary deficit measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Our economy is being supported almost entirely by foreign nations (a point apparently lost on the american people) in order to suck what they can out of our consumer market before the eventual (and almost certain) collapse. We are raising interest rates despite the flat demand for expansion capitol, and already our bod issues have surpassed canadas in return (becuase they are considered a higher risk...people are not willing to buy them at previous, low interest rates).\n \n Somehow i don't think that jealosy is the problem here. If people are looking for freedom, the US is a pretty poor choice, since a nation with over 300,000,000 laws and regulations on the books, and a higer per capita population of enforcement officials than anywhere else on the planet, would hardly be the place to start. \n \n If people are looking for an economy to emulate, ours, which is driven almost entirely by debt, both public and private, is probably not the one they are after.",
