   "Same-sex marriage opponent solicits gay advocate business\n \n By The Associated Press\n \n A former state senator who sponsored a ban on same-sex marriage has solicited a lobbying contract with Tennessee's largest gay rights advocacy group.\n \n The president of the Tennessee Equality Project isn't making former Republican state Sen. Jeff Miller of Cleveland wait for a response to his Jan. 23 letter asking the group to consider hiring him as a lobbyist.\n \n Project president Chris Sanders said Miller's solicitation was \"certainly not one that we're going to follow up on.\"\n \n \"I suppose he thinks helping pass discriminatory bills would make him an effective advocate for the gay, lesbian and transgender community,\" Sanders said Monday.\n \n Tennessee voters in November overwhelmingly approved the constitutional amendment, directed at \"solemnizing the relationship of one man and one woman.\"\n \n Miller did not immediately return telephone messages seeking comment on Tuesday.\n \n Miller, an attorney, last week sent numerous letters soliciting lobbying business, noting he intends to become a lobbyist when his mandatory one-year waiting period ends in November. Miller said in the letter that he served 12 years in the General Assembly and held positions that included Senate Republican Caucus chairman.\n \n \"I have worked closely with and become dear friends with many holding office and those who keep the wheels turning behind the scenes,\" Miller wrote.\n \n Miller resigned the caucus post last year during a special session on ethics prompted by the Operation Tennessee Waltz arrests of several current and former state lawmakers. He has acknowledged accepting $1,000 from Chattanooga lobbyist Charles Love during the FBI's Tennessee Waltz bribery sting. Miller, who was not charged, has said the $1,000 was a campaign contribution.\n \n Former aides to Miller were called before a federal grand jury last year.\n \n Miller was Senate sponsor of the marriage protection amendment, and three days after legislators voted to put the measure on the ballot, Miller's wife filed for divorce, accusing him of \"inappropriate marital conduct\" with a legislative employee. The Millers divorced last year.\n \n \"The hypocrisy was troubling,\" Sanders said.\n \n In the solicitation letter, Miller noted that while he cannot yet lobby under ethical guidelines he is \"more than happy to offer you any advice you may need regarding the legislative process, potentially applicable rules of law and procedure, steps utilized in making policy decisions, or simply to be a go-to person on a particular issue.\"\n \n Tennessee Ethics Commission attorney Ann Turner said that Miller can work as a consultant as long as he does not communicate with his former colleagues or state officials.\n \n \"The definition of lobbying in the statute says communicating with a state legislative or executive official for the purpose of influencing,\" Turner said.\n http://tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070130/NEWS0201/70130019/1001/NEWS",
