   "Jerigo,\n Did you understand what was said? I think you were given sound info from Kronus, unkerpaulie, and .Uniform.\n \n When you were formed in your mother&#8217;s womb i.e. from the time of conception, God gave you a soul. That soul knows God, was created by God, and realizes who God is. In the book of Luke, chapter 1 verses 41 and 44 it says:\n \n\n 41 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost&#8230;\n 44 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.\n\n \n So, it is important to know that when we are being formed, God&#8217;s spirit is with us. Being filled with His Spirit comes when we accept Him and ask Him to take over our life. In the book or Romans, chapter 5 verse 5 we read:\n \n\n 5 And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us. \n\n \n &#8220;&#8230;whom He has given us.&#8221; Refers to His presence always. He &#8220;knocks&#8221; at the door Revelations 3:20 &#8211;\n \n\n 20 Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him, and he with me.\n\n &#8230;and we can either let Him in or turn Him away.\n \n As far as leaving us &#8211; He never will. Matthew 28:20 &#8211;\n \n\n 20 &#8230;and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.\"\n\n \n But, we can turn away from Him and, even though we once did those things pleasing to God, can die in our sins.\n \n I hope this helps.",

   "Hi Jerigo:\n \n \nJerigo << will god leave your heart or not? People often say that if you are \"saved\" then the \"holy spirit\" enters your heart, or that if you sin enough the \"holy spirit\" will leave your heart. \n \n \n Your questions are pertaining to the Doctrine of Eternal Security. Your line of questioning leads me to believe you have been exposed to one of the Protestant denominations. There is some of Billy Graham in your words, as he likes to use phrases about praying Jesus into your heart. Before we address your concerns about the Holy Spirit leaving your heart, let us establish what a person must do to be saved in the first place. \n \n People are saved today through obedience to the gospel, which is the 'good news' that Jesus Christ (the Son of God) was crucified for our sins on the cross at Calvary to be buried in a tomb, until God raised Him from the dead (1Cor. 15:1-4). It is not like anyone can simply pick up a book and receive salvation through acknowledging the historical record. After all, most of the people on earth have heard the story of Jesus. Paul says,\n \n \n\"How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher?\" Rom. 10:14.\n \n \n The good news of Christ dying for our sins is the message carried by the Evangelist (Eph. 4:11). He is the 'preacher' of the verse above. He is carrying the gospel message, but he is also carrying something else that the unsaved must receive to complete the process, i.e., the Holy Spirit Himself (see 1Cor. 6:19). Paul writes,\n \n \n\"For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it {the} righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, \"BUT THE RIGHTEOUS {man} SHALL LIVE BY FAITH.\" Rom. 1:16+17.\n\n \n The righteousness of God is our ticket to eternal life, and note how it is revealed from 'faith to faith.' What does this mean? It means that a spiritual transaction (redemption) is taking place every time a person 'hears' and believes the gospel unto salvation. Paul says, \"So faith {comes} from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.\" Rom. 10:17. This 'hearing' is not about physically hearing with our ears. It is about placing ourselves into the position of obedience to the message being preached. For example:\n \n Suppose you instruct your small child not to play in the street. Later on you look out the front window to find them chasing a ball across traffic. So you run out and bring him back into the yard and say at the top of your lungs, \"I told you not to cross the street, do you 'hear' me?! Of course the child hears you, because you are shouting. But, you are asking if the youngster is now willing to be obedient to your words. That is the 'hearing' of Romans 10:17. When you are willing to be obedient (Rom. 16:25-27 (26)) to the gospel, then God hands you the faith to believe it. \n \n The 'faith' to believe is the gift of God. As it is written, \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, {it is} the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.\" Eph. 2:8+9. We are introduced to God's grace by receiving that gift of faith. \"Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope of the glory of God.\" Rom. 5:1+2.\n \n The Holy Spirit travels from the body of the preacher to the body of the believer, as this spiritual transaction takes place. As it is written, \"In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation--having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of {God's own} possession, to the praise of His glory.\" Eph. 1:13+14. The words 'sealed in Him' means the Spirit of God baptized you into the body of Christ. \"For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.\" 1Cor. 12:13. Paul tells the Romans about how this process works, \n \n \n\"Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.\" Rom. 6:3+4.\n \n \n That is our spiritual baptism into His body on the cross, so that we could then die with Him, be buried with Him to also be raised with Him from the dead. God then, \"seated us with Him in the heavenly {places} in Christ Jesus.\" Eph. 2:4-7 (6). \n \n And also the Galatians, \n \n \n\"For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\" Gal. 3:26-28.\n\n \n The Apostle Paul tells us that the Spirit of God is inside us.\n \n \n\"However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him. If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.\" Rom. 8:9-11.\n\n \n Now from this position of being saved, let us examine your questions:\n \n \nJerigo << My question contradicts that theory, because of the word omnipresent that word means that god is everywhere at all times. So doesn't that mean that if god is everywhere at all times than he is in every ones heart at the same time.\n \n \n Scripture says of Christ, \"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by Him all things were created, {both} in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities--all things have been created through Him and for Him. He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.\" Col. 1:15-17. So the force of gravity itself is one attribute of God's Word. \n \n Almighty God is the Creator, and His Word/Son/Christ is the hard drive. Creation represents the data on that hard drive. We know from verses like 2Cor. 5:19 that God indwells His Word/Son. So, yes, The Almighty is everywhere and in every single thing. Even with all of those things being true, God's omnipresence has nothing at all to do with our salvation. Others on this thread have already addressed the 'free will' aspect. Please allow me to take it one step farther.\n \n Most everyone has heard this verse of Text, \"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.\" John 3:16. So there are believers and unbelievers. And look what follows shortly after, \"He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been JUDGED ALREADY, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.\" John 3:18.\n \n I submit to you that all of us are now standing before the Almighty beyond the realm of time and space. Some of us have been 'clothed with Christ,' and some are still standing naked in their sins. Take careful note of Paul's words about the saved, \n \n \n\"Blessed {be} the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly {places} in Christ, just as He chose us in Him BEFORE the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless BEFORE HIM. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us IN THE BELOVED.\" Eph. 1:3-6.\n\n \n Again, we are all (saved and unsaved) standing before Him and before the foundation of the world. Everyone who does not believe HAS BEEN JUDGED ALREADY, while some of us have been 'clothed with Christ' (Gal. 3:27). God's blessings are to those who are found 'in' Christ, i.e., inside of His Beloved Son. That means when God Almighty looks at us, He sees Christ. It is NOT about praying Jesus into anything! It is about hearing and believing the gospel. God Almighty has fashioned our gospel and sent it into the world so that all who believe will be saved. As it is written, \n \n \n\"For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not {come to} know God, God was well-pleased through the foolishness of the MESSAGE PREACHED to save those who believe. For indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom; but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness, but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\" 1Cor. 1:21-24.\n\n \n \nJerigo << Wouldn't it mean that he would never leave your heart, and that you don't have to be saved to have god in your heart?\n\n \n Again, God's omnipresence is no guarantee of salvation to anyone. If any attribute of God could save one soul, then Christ came and died for nothing. If being a good boy could guarantee eternal life with the Almighty, then there would be no reason for Him to send Christ into creation to die for the ungodly. What does Scripture say? \"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" Rom. 6:23. Note again that eternal life is 'in' Christ Jesus our Lord. Obedience to the gospel is your ticket to being 'in' Christ. \n \n Once you are truly saved, then nothing can \"separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" Rom. 8:39. Paul writes, \n \n \n\"Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth. For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.\" Col. 3:1-4.\n\n \n That is certainly 'good news' indeed.\n \n PS. Beware of counterfeit gospel messages, because they are more numerous than one would care to count.
