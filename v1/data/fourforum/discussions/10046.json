   "http://www.4forums.com/political/member.php?u=6301\n \n OK\n \n NDS means New Darwinian Synthesis in the sense of Fisher/Haldane/and sucessors. Merger of population genetics with evolution. Its the current \"standard\" model of evolutionary processes as a general rule.\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_evolutionary_synthesis\n \n From WIKI starts out\"\n \n \nThe modern evolutionary synthesis (often referred to simply as the new synthesis, the modern synthesis, the evolutionary synthesis, neo-Darwinian synthesis or neo-Darwinism), generally denotes the integration of Charles Darwin's theory of the evolution of species by natural selection, Gregor Mendel's theory of genetics as the basis for biological inheritance, random genetic mutation as the source of variation, and mathematical population genetics. Major figures in the development of the modern synthesis include Thomas Hunt Morgan, R. A. Fisher, Theodosius Dobzhansky, J.B.S. Haldane, Sewall Wright, Julian Huxley, Ernst Mayr, Bernhard Rensch, George Gaylord Simpson, and G. Ledyard Stebbins.\n \n Essentially, the modern synthesis introduced the connection between two important discoveries: the units of evolution (genes) and the mechanism of evolution (selection). It also represents a unification of several branches of biology that previously had little in common, particularly genetics, cytology, systematics, botany, and paleontology.\n \n \n\n \n and further:\n \n \nAccording to the modern synthesis as established in the 1930s and 1940s, genetic variation in populations arises by chance through mutation (this is now known to be sometimes caused by mistakes in DNA replication) and recombination (crossing over of homologous chromosomes during meiosis). Evolution consists primarily of changes in the frequencies of alleles between one generation and another as a result of genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection. Speciation occurs gradually when populations are reproductively isolated, for example by geographic barriers.\n\n \n The concept that mutations occur by chance is often questioned by non-evolutionists as being a requirement for strict randomness, but just what they mean by this is usually left unstated. In addition evolutioinsts do not in general specify what \"by chance\" or random actually means. Depending on ones world view there may in fact be no events which occur \"by chance\" as every event is viewed as causal. Accepting that (and its likely that events at the genetic level are indeed causal), the question is what \"form\" or randomness are evolutionists really talking about.\n \n WW claims that the very fact that mutaions are not strictly acausal (and in his not so well developed opinion are DIRECTED towards greater fitness by something other than selection - ie a vitalist hypothesis. Its useful to nail this question down tight.",

   "A random mutation is therefore a unpredictable variation, as far as human perception is concerned.\n\n \n Thank you, I tend to agree but I think we will need to extend that idea as useful as it is. By unpredictable I will suppose you mean that prior events which one has knowledge of are not adequate to let one say what will next occurr. Hate (not really!) to toss in math, but its like tossing a coin multiple times. No matter how many times you toss it the next result is not predictable given the knowledge the normal coin tosser possesses. Many people make the irrational assumption for example that if a coin is tossed 10 time and comes up heads then a bet that it will come up tails on the next toss are improved. This is the so called gamblers fallacy and the believers have proven an important profit center for the operators of casios over the centuries. The belief seems to be reborn with every human being fallacious as it may be.\n \n In other words the probability of a fair coin coming up heads on a given toss is 0.5 regardless of any prior sequence of results involving any nuimber of tosses. This is summarized by stating that the results are uncorrelated and independent.\n \n Things get much more complicated when dealing with genetic mutations. For example lets consider only point mutations for a moment. Mutations due to a single change in a single nucleotide triplet. There are basically 4*4*4 = 64 such triplets possible as there are four different nucleotides to independently fill three positions. This is a rigid code with each triplet (withing an open reading frame) specifying a single amino acid (out of 21 common ones) for each triplet. Obviously the code is redundant. And of course the code was cracked in the 1960s. More on this later. I have to run right now.",

   "I have a question. Let's say you run a lottery machine. And then let's say you start the machine and out pops the #22 ball. Then let's say we are able to start over, put all the balls back in their exact, original locations...and let's say the machine operates the exact same way the second time around, would it be reasonable to think that the #22 ball would be selected again?\n \n So even though the outcome (to us humans) may seem random (or unpredictable), the laws of physics indicate that the selection was far from random...and if the physical parameters were the exact same, the selection would also be the same each and every time.\n \n Lynn Margulis once said randomness is just an excuse for ignorance. That is profoundly true.\n \n An example would be this: Let's say we have two people who smoke and eat the exact same diet their whole lives. One ends up with lung cancer, the other doesn't. Well, evolutionists would say that the person who got cancer was just unlucky and was the unfortunate result of a random mutation. The second person was lucky enough to not get the mutation. But the reality is, the 2nd person's genetic background or body chemistry may have been able to fight off cancer cells better. If such is the case, there's nothing \"random\" about the mutation. The results may be unpredictable from others' vantagepoint, but that does not justify saying cancer is caused by a random mutation. If the person who got the cancer was somehow able to go back and live his life again, and he ate the same foods and smoked the same cigarettes, he'd most certainly get the exact same cancer again.",

If you go far enough down the scale you get to a point where quantum uncertainties will block your knowledge of causes and thus your ability to predict. The uncertainty principle disallows perfect knowledge of the position and motions of particles. However at the level of nucleotides and such its fairly reasonable to take the position that events are in fact sufficeint determinstic to be predictable if you have enough knowledge. I agree with Margulis to a large extent. However we are certainly a heck of a long way from knowing the detailed path of say every cosmic ray or reactive chemical molecule in a specific human body - at least not to the extent of saying this cosmic ray generated a free radical at the right spot to change that specific nucleotide to something else! Till we reach that kind of detailed knowledge about the best we can do is to employ statistical descriptors using rates of mutation of X to Y and so forth under more or less controlled conditions.

Some random processes are even the result of volition. For example the flipper of a coin has to .... flip it.... and thats volitional even though the outcome is or may be random in nature. And of course there are non-volitional processes which are NOT random as has been pointed out with regard to gravity. I do not believe you can make volition and non-randomness dependent on each other. All the links would seem to be falsified thus indicating the two properties are not correlated.\n \n \n \nThis debate reduces, in geneticist-speak, to the issue of whether or not the alterations in genes in the genome, (assumed by them to be the determining factor re the evolution/origin of phenotypic traits in the darwinist aka \"NDS\" notion) are 'random', i.e., accidental, unintentional, and thus only coincidental to 'adaptedness', (which, in darwin-speak, means having a positive 'birth to death' ratio. They call it, \"fitness\").\n\n \n This is not in fact a debate its a discussion of what evolutionists mean by randomness as used in NDS.\n \n \nIn short, unless you want to take this debate to the philosophy forum, the issue of \"randomness\" in this forum is this--evolution is caused by random genetic accidents, or it is caused by volitional, teleological, organismic effort.\n\n \n Of course you either don't know or don't choose to tell us exactly what you mean by random do you. And that is in fact the issue. How could one distinguish random from non-random mutation (or genomic change) based on predefined criteria of what random means to evolutionists! Please fee free to contriut your ideas on that topic. I will be interested to see what you come up with.\n \n \nDarwinists say that all genetic mutations, (since it has been establisheed both by definition and observation that they are not mechanically regular enough permit prediction), are purely accidental, unintentional, undirected, uncontrolled, coincidental to organismic effect, and ateleological. That is, ALL genetic mutations are random, and since in darwinism genes mechanically determine the organism, all organisms mutate randomly--not intentionally, volitionally, teleologically, or systematically.\n\n \n But if we do not know what random implies about the actual properties of such mutations then we really do not have a good grip on the process do we? And of course there remains the issue of what forms of randomness are compatible with the concepts inside the NDS context. And what degrees of deviation from strict ransomness are tolerable within the theory. We don't have that defined yet either.\n \n And its also still possible that evolutionists do not believe that ALL mutations are random or unpredictable. For example the specific mutations leading to say breast cancer are predictable in a broad sense. If nothing else the effect of a given mutation is predictable.\n \n However you are correct that NDS folks do not invoke intention, volition, or \"organismic effort\" as causal agents of mutations, at least not generally (deliberate self exposure to chemical mutagens might count).\n \n \nEverything else said about \"randomness\" is non sequitur, a red herring, to this issue.\n\n \n But you have said very little at all about randomness, certainly not enough to distinguish random from non-random.

The fine print in all this is that that chemmy is a hard and fast materialist/mechanist, (and in biology, darwinist), ideologue.\n \n His whole point and purpose in starting this thread is to show that, by defining 'randomness' in such a way that suits his ideology, he can justify a belief that biological evolution is the product of randomly/unintentionally altered bits of DNAcid determining novel organismic traits in complex biosystems, i.e., live organisms, while at the same time showing that local and relative and unpredictable environmental, life-shortening events, (what he and his darwinist clique call, \"Natural Selection\"), is not simple random causation, aka, 'chance', but somehow, magically, something mechanical-- and so, deterministic.\n \n He has already insinuated his ideology into the framework of this discussion by insistiong that everyone accept the materialist/mechanist false dichotomy that all events are pre-determined, mechanistically, and so all events are either so mechanistically repetitive, iterated and regular, that we can call them 'determined', or they are so anomalous, rare, infrequent, and non-repetitive, that we can't make a clear connection between their pre-supposed, metaphysically assumed, mechanical cause, and its effect. In short, the materialisty dichotomy that that all causation is either known and physically mechanical, hence 'lawful', or it is 'unknown', hence 'random' and 'chance-based'. The basic point being, that all causation is physically mechanical, and that there is no such thing as psychical, non-physical, causation in the universe.

   "\n Quote:\n Just a question--why are you people going on and on about numbers, coins, lotteriesand the like, when this forum concerns organisms and their evolution; not coin tosses, dice rolls, roulette tables, card games, lottery tickets, and what not/\n \n \n \n Simple. Because the issue of what is randomness necessarily rests upon a base of probability and statistics.\n\n \n **\n No, it does not. That's your assumed definition of 'randomness', i.e., as a bean-counter statisticians concern with patterning in results and effects. Long before bean-counting was invented, people were looking to 'randomness', not in effect patterns, but in causation. They called such causation, 'luck', chance', fortune', 'accident' and whatnot. In the 19th century Charles Darwin changed thse words to \"Natural Selection\", but he was still talking about unintentional, ateleological, unguided and undirected, irregular, anomalous and haphazard _causation_. When brighter people pointed out to him that what he thought was, \"cause\", was, in fact, only, \"effect\", he immediately shifted gears and plagiarized Lamarckian causation for his own, \"pangenesis\", explanation of origins. His stupid mistake in confusing effects for their own causes persists among latter-day darwinists, however.\n \n \n For instance, a \"mechanism\" in science is a 'causal explanation' for a repeated, regularly iterated, effect. The \"mechanism\" insisted upon by materialist/mechanist/darwinist/ geneticists, aka, 'fisherians', or, 'NDS-types', (like chemmy and his claque hereabouts), is that \"Random GHenetic Mutation _followed_ by local, unpredictable, chance-dependent environmental effects on survival, that is, \"NS\", are the scientific, 'causal explanation', for the historical process we call evolution.\n \n But here is where thinking people must part company with Darwinists. Intelligent, reasonable people must decide, in the case of 'random genetic mutations', whether they are discussing them _strictly_ as causal explanations for the evolution of organismic traits and behaviours, or are they going to do what chemmy and crew are trying to do. That is, talk incessently about causation in terms of effects, so as to constantly conflate and confuse cause with effect in this particular case? Hoping, therebye, to slide their 'mechanism' past scrutiny in all the confusion.\n \n Non-darwinists, insist that any discussion of \"randomness\", aka \"chance\", be restricted, in this thread, to its supposed causal role in evolution. Do not be taken in by darwinists telling you that 'randomness' in this instance is something found only in 'effects'--something that contradicts the \"R\" they themselves inserted in their own mechanism, thanks to Fisher, Haldane, and Wright. Beancounters all.\n \n \n \n\n If you do not have a grip on probability concepts you are not going to be able to define randomness.\n\n \n **\n Take that to the philosophy and/or mathematical abstraction forum. Here, the sole and only issue is whether or not random, i.e., accidental and ateleological, changes arising entropically and unintentionally in a complex, productive coding system, the genome, are not only capable of, but truly responsible for, mechanically determining adaptive productive alterations in organismic form and behaviour, by simple environmental coincidence/chance.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n There is only one issue of \"randomness\" in biological evolution, and that is this--are changes in organismic traits, including organismic behaviours, accidental or intentional/volitional in origin. Since \"accidental\" reduces to \"unintentional\" and \"ateleological\" , \"random\" in this case means soley and only 'unintentional, ateleological, accidental'. All the rest is a grotesque red herring which has no bearing at all on the evolution debate.\n \n \n \n Well actually no, there are several concepts of randomness which could be applied. Some random processes are even the result of volition. For example the flipper of a coin has to .... flip it.... and thats volitional even though the outcome is or may be random in nature.\n\n \n **\n My point exactly!! Thank you for pointing out, in reinforcement to what I've just gone over above, that 'randomness' in causation and 'randomness' in effect are two separate issues that must not be confused, and that here we are speaking of causation. You, thank-you, have just shown that a teleological, intententional, systematic cause can produce a 'random', 'unpredictable save in terms of patterns in iterated instances', effect. And that is why, in the case of evolution, we cannot, as you do, argue back from adaptive phenotypic change, or even genotypic change, to some 'random', unintentional cause. Think of the organism as that which systematically flips the 'coins', or shuffles the cards, in it own genomic 'hand', until it gets an outcome/hand it likes. That is NOT random causation. In order to call genomic shuffling and coin tossing 'random', (and by extension, phenotypic traits as randomly arising, by chance), you must draw an exact distinction between the the identifiable _causes_ of genetic mutation, and genetically mutant genomes as identifiable _effects_ of those causes. Otherwise calling the causes of genetic mutations, 'accidental, unintentional, ateleological, undirected, unmotivated, unsystematic, and uncontrolled', is purely a metaphysical assumption on your part. \n \n \n \n\n And of course there are non-volitional processes which are NOT random as has been pointed out with regard to gravity.\n\n \n **\n Yes they were. By someone too handicapped to understand that I had already excepted mechanical causation in iterated regularities, (eg., gravitational effects), from this discussion of 'randomness', for reasons that for anyone with a working brain are just too painfully obvious.\n \n \n\n I do not believe you can make volition and non-randomness dependent on each other. All the links would seem to be falsified thus indicating the two properties are not correlated.\n\n \n **\n For one thing, only you (and members of your unthinking claque, I would suppose), have somehow convinced yourselves that I am trying to, \"make volition and non-randomness dependent on each other\". What do you think that you mean by that?!? I cannot imagine.\n \n In terms of 'dependency', the only issue is that ultimately volition depends upon the real and actual existence of mechanical indeterminism. And thanks to quantum mechanics, we now know that to be the case.\n \n So, since QM says that reality contains real and actual mechanical indeterminism, therebye showing that 'chance' and 'randomness' exist independently of our knowledge/ignorance of any physical 'chain of causation',\n thus making 'volition', 'intention', and 'teleology' just as scientifically real as 'common sense' has always said that they were--before materialist/mechanists convinced the world that all psychical phenomena were only 'apparent', i.e., 'illusory' epiphenomena of determined and inevitable physical mechanics, we can now speak in terms of three causal options--\n A/Determinist/mechanical, whereby events are iterated in a regularity of cause/effect correspondence that allows a high degree of causal identification. As per gravity, etc.\n B/Determinist/mechanical, wherebye events are so infrequently iterated with any degree of similarity that predictability is, at best, problematic, and causation is non-specific and non-identifiable in any direct fashion (see entropic genetic mutation, for example), thanks to our ignorance.\n \n The above being, again, the materialist/mechanist false dichotomy, false because, thanks to QM and common sense, the third oprion--\n \n C/Non-determinist/psychical, whereby events have more than simple, mechanical, efficient causes, but can also have teleological, intentional, volitional, 'final causes', i.e., are 'goal directed' events.\n \n Note--Option A does not speak to 'randomness' at all, option B speaks to randomness only as ignorance of mechanically determinist causation, and option C speaks to a non-determinist, non-mechanical alternative to option B., but not to 'randomness'. Rather, as an alternative to 'randomness' and to 'mechanical determinism', both. In short, far from trying to \"make volition and non-randomness dependent on each other\", I am doing the direct opposite, by showing that volition and 'non-randomness' are as distinct from one another as volition and 'randomness' are, which is in fact just as distinct as volition and 'determinism' are.\n \n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n This debate reduces, in geneticist-speak, to the issue of whether or not the alterations in genes in the genome, (assumed by them to be the determining factor re the evolution/origin of phenotypic traits in the darwinist aka \"NDS\" notion) are 'random', i.e., accidental, unintentional, and thus only coincidental to 'adaptedness', (which, in darwin-speak, means having a positive 'birth to death' ratio. They call it, \"fitness\"). \n \n \n This is not in fact a debate its a discussion of what evolutionists mean by randomness as used in NDS.\n\n \n **\n Oh, so you are _not_ trying, as you claimed you would do in your OP, to \n \"discover\" what 'randomness' means wrt biological evolution, but are really working up to dictating to the rest of us \"what evolutionists mean by randomness as used in NDS\". Duh! Colour me surprised. Not.\n \n \n \n\n Of course you either don't know or don't choose to tell us exactly what you mean by random do you.\n\n \n **\n Horsemanure. Not only have I told you what 'randomness', aka, 'chance', means to me in terms of biological evolution and genetic mutation, I've rehashed what it means to you,-- since you refuse, so far, to be honest and straightforwardly come out and say it, plainly.\n \n \n\n And that is in fact the issue. How could one distinguish random from non-random mutation (or genomic change) based on predefined criteria of what random means to evolutionists! \n\n \n **\n Again I caution readers that when chemmy and friends say \"evolutionists\", they really mean materialist/mechanist/darwinist/geneticists. I am an 'evolutionist', and I am not the least bit like them.\n \n IAC, I have shown how this particular 'evolutionist' can not only distinguish random from non-random mutation, but also distinguish accidental non-random mutation from intentional non-random mutation, and how to he distinguishes volitional mutation from determinist mutation.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Darwinists say that all genetic mutations, (since it has been establisheed both by definition and observation that they are not mechanically regular enough permit prediction), are purely accidental, unintentional, undirected, uncontrolled, coincidental to organismic effect, and ateleological.

I've just told you what you darwinists claim \"random implies about the actual properties of such mutations\". That's a done deal. All that remains is the debate over whether or not your opinion is correct.\n \n \n\n And of course there remains the issue of what forms of randomness are compatible with the concepts inside the NDS context.\n\n \n **\n \"Forms of randomness\". So now this abstraction comes in different flavours, or something? Tell me, are there different flavours of 'infinity', in your world?\n \n \n\n And what degrees of deviation from strict ransomness are tolerable within the theory. We don't have that defined yet either.\n\n \n **\n Not true. You have long ago defined everything to suit yourself. You just haven't been honest enough, up to now, to tell us what you've already decided. \n \n \n\n And its also still possible that evolutionists do not believe that ALL mutations are random or unpredictable. \n\n \n **\n The wonder of darwinists' is that they are as easy to pin down about their basic and unshakeable beliefs as it is to nail jello to the wall.\n \n \n \n\n For example the specific mutations leading to say breast cancer are predictable in a broad sense. If nothing else the effect of a given mutation is predictable.\n\n \n **\n Gee, what a radical change from your former position, to wit, that organisms are genetically determined, and therefore, not only is it possible to predict the organismic effect from a given genetic mutation, it is deterministically inevitable!! Sheesh, isn't that belief/assumption precisely what your genomic modification and genetic engineering is entirely based upon?!?\n \n \n\n However you are correct that NDS folks do not invoke intention, volition, or \"organismic effort\" as causal agents of mutations, at least not generally (deliberate self exposure to chemical mutagens might count).\n\n \n **\n Does it count when you do it to fruitflies? How about when you do it to 'evolutionary algorithms' and 'computerized kritters', 'simulated genomes', and whatnot?\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Everything else said about \"randomness\" is non sequitur, a red herring, to this issue. \n \n \n But you have said very little at all about randomness, certainly not enough to distinguish random from non-random.

And what in the world makes you think that determining that something is volitional does not negate any possiblity that it was random? By definition, that which is volitional is not random, and that which is random is not volitional. What's your difficulty with this? The same goes for volitional vs mechanically determined. Your problem is that, thanks to youyr ideology, you have no real, non-arbitrary, criterion foor distinguishing 'determined' from 'random' in the real universe, and so you fall back on 'human ignorance'.",

   "N\no, it does not. That's your assumed definition of 'randomness', i.e., as a bean-counter statisticians concern with patterning in results and effects. Long before bean-counting was invented, people were looking to 'randomness', not in effect patterns, but in causation. They called such causation, 'luck', chance', fortune', 'accident' and whatnot. In the 19th century Charles Darwin changed thse words to \"Natural Selection\", but he was still talking about unintentional, ateleological, unguided and undirected, irregular, anomalous and haphazard _causation_. When brighter people pointed out to him that what he thought was, \"cause\", was, in fact, only, \"effect\", he immediately shifted gears and plagiarized Lamarckian causation for his own, \"pangenesis\", explanation of origins. His stupid mistake in confusing effects for their own causes persists among latter-day darwinists, however.\n, chance\n \n You got hardly a single item correct in that rant! Don't you have the faintest grip on things scientific? Luck, chance, fortune, are all statistical terms at their core. They rest on probability concepts.

Perhaps others here will differ. You need to remember the goal - its to nail down the idea of randomness to something we can reach agreement on.

Given normal, relatively stable environmental circumstances that continue for many generations, a basic 'given' in darwinian gradualism, empirical evidence from field studies has accumulated sufficient evidence to demonstrate that differential mortality and reproduction between members of a given population can be positive or negative, but in neither case is it due to some 'trait' difference in any given individual in the common genotype. Instead, those differentials, (given those extended environmentally stable conditions requisite to the darwinian model ) have been shown to be a simple matter of individual happenstance--i.e., chance, good or bad luck, the fickle finger of fate. In short, the entire 'heredity-based' notion of \"Natural Selection\" has been empirically negated under those circumstances which darwinism stipulates are necessary to its very operation in the first place!!\n \n As for \"NS\" in anomalous instances of general population catastrophe, (i.e., bad luck for everybody), it is the case that 'catastrophism' is antithetical to darwinism in principle. Darwinism's 'competitive striving' principle, held responsible for generating differential 'fitness', is replaced by a lucky accident of birth [an anomalous gene], that does make a positive survival/reproductive difference in an individual. But 'luck' is not science. Apart from the pure luck involved in differential survival of general catastrophes, the only other survival option is immediate and proximate dynamic self-adaptation to the catastrophe, in which novel traits and behaviours are initiated that were not established in that population in its collective history. That is, evolution takes place ( by EAM), which is utterly contrary to darwinism's passive selection.\n \n \n\n 3) The variation in 1 in heritable in that offspring will carry the genes of their linages. \n\n \n **\n Unintelligible. Please re-write.\n \n \n\n If one wishes to attack 1 then you need to show that there is no variation\n\n \n **\n Which is a ridiculous demand, as explained above.\n \n \n \n\n and if you wish to attack NDS as such you might try to claim that genetic mutations are non-random.\n\n \n **\n Not. All that needs be challenged is the darwinist assertion that ALL genetic changes, no matter what effect, (positive, negative, or negligible), they may have when expressed organismically, arise randomly, accidentally, unintentionally, non-sytematically, by result of entropic system [genomic inheritance system] failure. \n \n \n\n First of course you will need to define what random means relevant to the NDS context.\n\n \n **\n Actually, that is not at all any of my duty or responsibility. It is strictly your own.

They are truly important to our ability to deal with concrete reality. The danger is simply that many people, especially materialists, reify abstractions; that is they deal with abstractions as if they were concrete, substantial, corporeal entities. Very bad move. See Alfred North Whitehead on \"concretizing the abstract\".\n \n \n WRT 'complexity', it is an abstraction, just as the word 'system' is an abstraction. Just ask any engineer how much can be accomplished by disregarding these words.\n \n FYI----Columbia Encyclopedia oln complexity\n \n \"Columbia Encyclopedia-- complexity, in science, field of study devoted to the process of self-organization. The basic concept of complexity is that all things tend to organize themselves into patterns, e.g., ant colonies, immune systems, and human cultures; further, they go through cycles of growth, mass extinction, regeneration, and evolution. Complexity looks for the mathematical equations that describe the middle ground between equilibrium (see statics) and chaos (see chaos theory), such as the interplay between supply and demand in an economy or the relationship among living organisms in an ecosystem.\n Complexity theory had its beginnings with American mathematician Norbert Wiener's development of cybernetics, Canadian biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy's development of general system theory, and American mathematician John H. Holland's development of a computerized artificial life simulation. More recent efforts are centered at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, which was established in 1984, and are found in the work of multidisciplinary researchers such as American economist Kenneth Arrow and American physicist Murray Gell-Mann. Because complex systems typically cross the boundaries of traditional disciplines, the study of complexity is an interdisciplinary science. Much of the progress in the field can be attributed to advances in nonlinear dynamics, in the power of computers and in computer graphics, and in adaptive programs and fuzzy logic.\n \n Bibliography\n \n See M.

The means by which many of them arise is well known to biochemists and geneticists, however specific mutations at a given locus in a given individual are not predictable outside of a statistical formulation based on empirical data.

And the fact for which sufficient evidence has been collected from many and various wildlife and ecology studies, such as bird-banding, fin-clipping, radio-collaring, and on and on, is that in stable environments the genetic differences, and expressed their traits, between normal members of any given population, are so slight as to make no statistically significant difference wrt survival and reproductive success. \n \n The actual empirical fact of the matter is that survival and differential reproductive success are overwhelmingly due to happenstance, i.e., luck, chance, fortune.And I repeat--this is not my \"hypothesis\"; this is the actual fact of the matter, and it blows darwinian \"Natural Selection\" sky high. \"NS\" is a humbug notion, pure and simple, of no scientific, (as opposed to ideological), merit or use of any kind.\n \n \n\n Thus an individual whose genes render it sterile will have just as many offspring as an indiviudual whose genes render it fertile.\n\n \n **\n Golly, now there's a normal organism for ya!!

So far as biologists know genes and epigenetic effects are the only mechanisms of inheritance for biological traits. If you should find a new one that you can test and validate you can go to Oslo some fine October day - all expenses paid of course. As to causal connections. Its clearly demonstrable for some traits that if the genes involved are changed then so is the trait, and that if the gened is NOT changed then the trait remains conserved. Thousands of instances in the literature. Causality is of course always multiple and its possible for an effect to arise from several DIFFERENT causes. Regardless of that gene-to-trait causal chains are well documented. Other things can of course effect traits, like exercise can effect your musculature provided of course that you have a musculature and that your genes are not a variant that prevents such.

And the fact for which sufficient evidence has been collected from many and various wildlife and ecology studies, such as bird-banding, fin-clipping, radio-collaring, and on and on, is that in stable environments the genetic differences, and expressed their traits, between normal members of any given population, are so slight as to make no statistically significant difference wrt survival and reproductive success.\n \n The actual empirical fact of the matter is that survival and differential reproductive success are overwhelmingly due to happenstance, i.e., luck, chance, fortune.And I repeat--this is not my \"hypothesis\"; this is the actual fact of the matter, and it blows darwinian \"Natural Selection\" sky high. \"NS\" is a humbug notion, pure and simple, of no scientific, (as opposed to ideological), merit or use of any kind.\n\n \n Yes a great deal of survival and reproductive success for a well adaped species is due to statistical effects alone. Thats why probability is part and parcel of a NDS researchers tool box. Only traits which confer a relative advantage in reporductive success will be fixed over time into the species. If the species does not have variants that have some improved survival anr reproductive variants then of course the species in not evolving at that point in time and one will NOT be able to detect any differential survival and reproduction in the existing variants. Thats how evolution works when you reach a local peak on the fitness landscape.. How the heck do you think its suppoed to work. This is inherent in the pop genetics equations. The findings that you refer to are confirmatory of NDS not contradictory to it! An interesting oversight on your part.\n \n When a species is well adapted its reached what amounts to an evolutionary convergence point. Its not very likely to evolve beyond the local fitness peak. And as long as the enviornment remains stable the fitness peak is not going to move out from under the species. Surely you grasp that such is the case. I mean you are not totally ignorant in these matters.",

   "WW\n \n \n I read quite well. And NDS DOES rest on the assumption that organisms exhibit variability and that some of that variability is heritable via genetics. \n\n \n **\n My god, you can't even tell the difference between an established fact and an \"assumption\". And facts are not theoretical \"principles\", either, you need to be told. If you want to say that NDS is dependent upon this fact, goahead, but do not try to confuse the fact with the theory.

It's an axiom of Euclidean geometry. Axioms are not assumptions--they are self-evident facts. If you want to call the genetic facts you mention above as 'axioms of biology', particulary heretibility, go right ahead. Just stop trying to tell us that axioms and facts belong to your theory as 'assumptions', 'principles' or anything else that would make them peculiar and particular to your \"theory\", instead of what they are--facts that relate to all biological theories.\n \n \n\n If its a given then its a given and we agree and if its a foundational assumption of NDS then its one to which we agree.\n\n \n **\n Once again, a fact is not and cannot be an 'assumption' after it has been established as a fact. The facts established by post-mendelian inheritance science are not the exclusive, patented property of your \"RMNS\" hypothetical on the mechanics of biological evolution.\n \n \n\n No problem no dispute. \n\n \n **\n No dispute if you've now understood just what the dispute was, and accept that genetic facts are not \"RMNS\" theoretical evolutionary 'assumptions'.\n \n \n\n If its true then its avaiable to NDSers as an assumption.\n\n \n **\n The point is that it is available to anyone and everyone, including me, and possibly creationists, as an established fact.

Even in those cases, it is more a matter dedicated to 'preserving' an ideal organismic form than it is to 'evolving' a new one.\n \n Continuing on, \"variation\" is a given, since it is an established fact, but it too, is also irrelevent to the EAM 'theory' of evolution, since 'environmental stimulus/organismic response' evolution could happen whether any 'variation' pre-existed it, or not. For example, a colony of perfect bacterial clones, all identical cells and genomes, could still evolve by EAM, [whereas, if I'm reading you right, it could not evolve according to your RMNS theory, since it contains no 'variation' to do it with--a vital 'component'].\n \n As for inheritance, well, this is gonna shock you to hear but inheritance is all about preserving and conserving a successful set of traits, by passing them on, unchanged, from one generation to the next. It doesn't matter if there are only a few successful traits and they get passed on monotonously, through cloning, or if their are a gazillion variaties of succcessful traits out of which 'grab bag' the organism gets to 'mix and match', sexually.

Please note well that if you start with an invariant colony of bacteria they can and do mutate and soon develop variability. Indeed given the rate of mutation observed in bacteria its unlikely that ANY colony will consist of one genome sequence only. You can't have that many cells (billions of em) without mutation at some loci. The copy mechanism is not that good, and the repair mechanisms are not that good either. That of course ignores any chemical or radiologucal mutations from environmental factors which will only add additional variability. It also ignores deletions, insertions, duplications, and inversions which occurr at non=zero rates.\n \n \nAs for inheritance, well, this is gonna shock you to hear but inheritance is all about preserving and conserving a successful set of traits, by passing them on, unchanged, from one generation to the next.

Mutation, (be it organismic, as in my theory, or genetic, as in your theory), has to precede the variation it produces, and mutation, organismic or genetic, is the actual event that, in a procession of such events, we call evolution.\n \n \n Now all we have to do is figure out what causes the mutations, organismic and/or genetic, that cause variation. We'll call that something the the 'mechanism' for evolution. One thing for sure, it will not, contrary to what you claimed, be \"variation\", since obviously 'variation' is the effect of evolution--not its cause. And furthermore evolution can occur where, as in an identical colony of clones, there was no variation to begin with. Just as I said.\n \n \n\n Indeed inheritance is a high fidelity copying process.

The frequency of mutation is quite low at any given position in the sequence, but mutations do occur and if in the germline then they are heritable.\n\n \n **\n You best catch up on your reading.

Life once it appeared would cease changing - barring of course independet origin of other imperfect replicators which would take over because they COULD evolve.\n\n \n \n **\n I implied nothing. What I did do was point out that by putting the cart before the horse, and requiring 'variation' prior to 'evolution', you were making an evolutionary effect, i.e, 'variation' into its own cause. Which is patently irrational, but not surprising in people that believe that evolution means 'spontaneous generation'. Stuff that, 'just happens', that's all.\n \n \n \n\n Well if not then we would not be having this conversation and nobody would be having any conversations at all.\n\n \n **\n No, its true that if your premise were true, we wouldn't exist. I have no wish to deny that.\n \n \n\n If its not heritable then a trait does not enter into evolution at all period. \n\n \n **\n That's arbitrary, but acceptable, since there has to be some criterion for distinguishing evolution from every other kind of change; at least in biology. \n \n Of course, in its orginal sense, 'evolution', as in 'the evolution of the universe', had no inheritance requirement, and outside of biology, it still doesn't. Which is another reason not to confuse chemistry and physics for biology, or vice versa. But never mind. The inheritance aspect need not be genetic, as epigenetic inheritance is an an established fact. See Jablonka, et al., and it is never permanent and immutable, or there would never be evolution, so who cares if it extends for a million generations, or only two. Two makes it evolution. Mutant-<offspring.\n \n \n\n The term evolution I would point out is not your personal domain where your definitions change the nature of the scientific universe.\n\n \n **\n Likewise, I'm sure.

Anyhow, it doen't matter, since it's no longer 1943, and Luria and Delbruck and their assumptions are no longer taken seriously by anyone who knows anything about eusocial bacteria.\n \n\n \n Nothing funny about it, and Luria and Delbruk worked primarily with resistance to phage as I recall rather than with antibiotic resistance. You have not only chosen the wrong experiment to attack with regard to antibiotic resistance, you have not in fact challenged anything at all.\n \n \nThe fact of the matter is that the 'resistance' crisis in certain strains of dangerous, even deadly, bacteria, such as c.difficile, or some new strains of tuberculosis, is the predictable result of the materialist/mechanist/geneticist/darwinist approach to bacterial, herbal, and insectile, and other biological resistances--which is to say, \"Throw chemicals at them.\".\n \n \n The resistance of pathogens to various host defenses is indeed a predictable result. I happen to be quite familiar with modern integrated disease control in agriculture, and I am well aware of what happens to pathogen variants when the host population is rendered resistant. It shifts genetically under the selection pressure to be virulent again. If you must have examples I can provide them. In the mean time you might check the history and mission statement of the USDA rust lab at the University of Minnesota. I send you out on your own so you will not complain that I have made an argument by link. If you want to know the info then you can find it.\n \n \nThe EAM way of doing it would have been be to throw viruses or other mutating/evolving 'predators/enemies' at them, but never mind. The modern materialist tendency is always to opt for the quick but temporary, mechanical and unnatural,( i.e., 'band-aid'), solution to chronic biological problems.\n \n\n \n Which is what is often done. Note well thats the kind of system Luria and Delbruk were studying in 1943 - just at the edge of the era of antibiotics. They used a phage which \"preys\" on E. coli to study the evolution of resistance/susceptibility in a host/parasite system! Naturally enough the phage mutated to become virulent against the resistant strains of coli.\n \n To quote WIKI on L&B:\n \nLuria-Delbr\u00fcck experiment (1943) (also called the Fluctuation Test) demonstrates that in bacteria, genetic mutations arise in the absence of selection, rather than being a response to selection. Therefore, Darwin's theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to higher organisms. Max Delbr\u00fcck and Salvador Luria won the 1969 Nobel Prize in part for this work.\n \n In their experiment, Luria and Delbr\u00fcck inoculated a small number of bacteria into separate culture tubes. After a period of growth, they plated equal volumes of these separate cultures onto phage (virus) containing agar. If virus resistance in bacteria were caused by a spontaneous activation in bacteria--i.e., if resistance were not due to heritable genetic components, then each plate should contain the same number of resistant colonies. This, however was not what Delbr\u00fcck and Luria found. Instead, the number of resistant colonies on each plate varied drastically.\n\n \n WW\n \nAnyhoo, our resistance crisis, in medicine, agriculture, and elsewhere, is the foreseeable product of any self-titled 'scientific', (that is, 'ideological'), establishment that insists that, \"Its(sic) not modification by the organisms to a vital chronic stimulus. Its(sic) simple mutation followed by preferential survival of the resistant mutants. Its(sic) genetic and its(sic) provably so. It has nothing to do with INTENT or any VITAL FORCE. Its(sic) just neo-darwinian evolution in action.\". Which is just plain garbage.\n\n \n Yes and the misuse of antibiotics etc has nothing whatsoever to do with the mechanisms involved. That human pathogens become resistant to antibiotics when those antibiotics are sprayed around is predictable on the basis of NDS concepts. Indeed experiments like L&D predict that this is what will happen. That clinicians ignored the science in their irrational exuberance is not a challenge to the sciences of genetics or evolution. \n \n Your attempt to divert the thrust of the debate down this channel is mere misdirection.",

   "This Press Release may be of some interest.\n \n Photons Are Apparently Intelligent\n NYT special edition\n Written by R. Queen with contributions form H. Dumpty\n \n An article by E. Bunny and W. Rabbit to be published in The Lagomorphs Journal (E. Bunny editor) overthrows the concept that only living organisms can exhibit intelligence. The authors (now vactioning at the theme park Wonderland) could not be reached for direct comment. However that paper reports a new intrepretation of the well known two slit experiment. The investigators set up a single slit and fired one photon at a time at it. Sure enough they got a single band of scattered photons indicating that each photon had passed through the slit some being bent in their tajectory by optical effects around the edges. Next the experimenters introduced a second slit near the first. They obtained the same interference pattern seen by other investigators of classical physics. The authors concluded that an individual photon passes through BOTH slits by choice when such a choice is open to them. With only one slit the photon intelligently chooses to pass thorugh only the single slit. Given that volition is required to make the choice to pass through both slits the investigators suggested that photons are indeed intelligent beings capable of recognizing their choices and dynamically adapting themselves to their environment in an intelligent way. All the other explanations for this were characterized by the authors as fairy tales. The authors went on to speculate that photons may even be alive, since intelligence is a signifier of life.\n \n Nobel prize winning physicist J. Bunny III contacted at his University Office said he would agree that photons are intelligent and adaptive, but that he is not convinced that they are alive. He said he is writing a major grant proposal to clear up that question.\n \n The results of this work may have significant impact on Darwinians world wide as they would overturn key assumptions of the new Darwinian synthesis. The special edition contacted the head of the Darwinian community who wishes to go unnamed and he expressed suprise and dismay that the fraud prepretrated by his organization might be recognized due to the finding that photons are intelligent. He then said he would have no additional comments until he had read a copy of the actual resarch.",

   "In any case I think we have reached a consensus on what the term random means when used by evolutionists and applied to mutation. Any further comments on that topic?\n\n \n \n Walking-fish:\n Pardon me for jumping into this discussion a few days after this was posted; but I have a comment about how randomness implies unpredictability in science. To me, the term is totally unrelated to issues of determinism vs acausality or mechanism vs vitalism. Mutations are understood to be random ONLY because their occurance cannot be predicted ahead of time. That means, there is no way to tell whether or not there is a conscious intelligence at work, or whether known, but unpredictable, chemical laws alone are governing the substitution of one nucleotide for another. None of that matters. Randomness is assumed only because no one has come up with a testable hypothesis that can adequately predict when or where a specific mutation will occur. After all, empirical science is only concerned with testable hypotheses that have predictive value. \n \n BUT, natural selection is a non-random component of the NDS because it lends itself to certain predictions. Land dwelling animals that venture into an aquatic habitat are likely to retain features which help them adapt, survive & reproduce in that aquatic environment. But, by the same token, such an adaptation may, or may not, be teleological. Conscious attraction to water may, or may not, be employed. Again, the issue of non-randomness in natural selection is independent of questions about determinism, intention, volition, vitalism mechanism etc... It's all about testability and predictability, because... well, that's what science deals with, pure and simple. \n \n Now these ID/creationist/vitalist types who misrepresent modern evo theory as some materialistic/Darwinist ideology love to imagine that there is a hidden agenda to exclude God, or intelligence, or intention, or consciousness, or whatever from social discourse. It irritates me to no end to have these accusations thrown at me simply for sticking to the constraints of an empirical method which can only deal with what is testable falsifiable and of value in making predictions. Random mutation, coupled with natural selection by the environment, does just that. All the other esoteric questions are beyond the scope and purpose of science, and they should be pursued on a philosophy discussion forum - not here.",

Carrol in the NYT.\n \n http://science.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/25/readers-questions-the-science-of-evolution/\n \n \n \n#\n 1.\n June 26th,\n 2007\n 8:30 am\n \n Do the development of new physical traits in a species result from random genetic mutations that, by chance, offer advantages to the species, or do these physical traits develop to in response to an environmental need or opportunity?\n \n - Posted by Witchey-Poo\n #\n 12.\n June 26th,\n 2007\n 8:31 am\n \n It is crucial to distinguish mutation from natural selection in the evolutionary process. Mutations arise at random and may impart variability to traits (let's say height or body color). Selective conditions, such as the environment, mates, predators etc determine whether taller or shorter, lighter or darker individuals are more successful (survive and reproduce). The \"fittest\" is a conditional status and can change as the environment changes. The mutation rate is largely independent of the environment in animals so even if it would be advantageous to be a bit taller or a bit darker, those properties depend on genetic changes that arise at random.You may think \"that seems unlikely\" but it is important to appreciate that there is a great amount of variation available in large populations many species populations are large, and a lot of offspring are born each year. The odds are very much in favor of mutations already existing in a population or of new useful mutations arising in a reasonable timeframe. I run through the interplay of mutation, slectiion, and time in The Making of the Fittest (WW Norton, 2006)\n \n - Posted by Dr. Sean B. Carroll\n \n",

Its adaptability to diverse environments and end uses is surprising given the diversity bottlenecks expected from recent domestication and polyploid speciation events. Wheat compensates for these bottlenecks by capturing part of the genetic diversity of its progenitors and by generating new diversity at a relatively fast pace. Frequent gene deletions and disruptions generated by a fast replacement rate of repetitive sequences are buffered by the polyploid nature of wheat, resulting in subtle dosage effects on which selection can operate.",

   "The first marsupial genome\n \n http://www.arn.org/blogs/index.php/literature/2007/05/\n \n \n Now that the opossum genome has been sequenced, both winners and losers have emerged. The main loser is the 'Genes-R-Us' school, who have argued that genes are the only really interesting components of the genome. This group is a loser because the \"vast majority of the opossum's genes are identical to other placental mammals\". Genes do not distinguish marsupials from placentals, but the non-coding elements (previously referred to as 'Junk DNA' are distinctly different. Thus, \"most of the genetic difference between marsupials and placental mammals comes from non-coding sequences, not proteins.\"\n \n The Evo-Devo community appears to consider itself a winner. The new research \"is bound to make the [evolutionary developmental biology] community very happy, because they've been saying all along that it's the regulation of genes that is what's driving the changes that we see in the evolution of animals.\" Some of this confidence is, however, misplaced: it is one thing to say that gene regulation is the key to understanding the difference between placentals and marsupials, but linking this to origins is theory-laden. The data does not speak for itself but is interpreted, often through an evolutionary filter.\n \n The ID community is also a winner. ID scholars have long been sceptical of the genetic reductionism displayed by most evolutionary biologists, and have also been quick to recognise the functionality of much of the so-called Junk DNA. These scholars have much in common with evo-devo, but see the regulation system as an extraordinarily complex system that invites design inferences when considering origins.\n \n ID scholars will also welcome the recognition that marsupials are not primitive mammals: \"The study helps to erode a common misconception that marsupials are somehow an archaic or second-rate category of mammal. One scientist comments on the discovery of a gene that encodes for a unique form of T-cell receptor not found in placental mammals: this \"knocks that assumption on its head [. . .] It shows that they have a very sophisticated immune system, but one that's very different.\"\n \n I underlined a sentence above......so tell me -- If the \"opossum's genes are identical to other placental mammals\" --- where's the silly EVOLUTION?????????",

For example if a bacterial variant is resistant to an antibiotic its genes will be propagated to the next generation with greater probability than its susceptible cousins if the antibioltic is present in the environment. This is selection in action - there is not object of the process there is only a differential outcome for various sets of genes.

In sexual metazoans such as ourselves evolution has to proceed via the germ line not the somatic cells. The spontaneous mutations (and epigenetic changes) occurring in somatic cells are not heritable and population genetics does not deal with them. Cancer is thus not an appropriate model for discusssing evolution via NDS!\n \n If you look at population genetics and the role of mutation in it you will find that such an assumption is unnecessary to NDS. You keep bringing this up and it still is not the case. There is no theoretical reason that mutations could not be \"oriented\" to a greater or lesser extent. The problem with the idea is HOW might such orientation be achieved - especially when a species is near or on top of a fitness peak! Randomness in the sense employed when referring to mutation by evolutionists means only that the specific outcomes of mutational processes are not readily predicted and that they have no statistically discernable patterns. All thats necessary to serve as the substrate for selection is some range of heritable variation in the source population with some variants being more fit than the bulk of the population.",

   "**\n \n FYI--\n \n \n\n The Lederberg Experiment\n In 1952, Esther and Joshua Lederberg performed an experiment that helped to show that many mutations are random, not directed.\n\n \n **\n Funny thing about that. For the first 40 years darwinists claimed that L&L'52, like L&D'43, _proved_ that _all_ genetic mutations_, including all adaptive mutations, were \"random\", as in, \"not directed\". The switch to \"many\" is a big, and quite recent, tune change.\n \n \n\n Here is the experimental set-up for the Lederberg experiment. All you really need to know in terms of background information is that bacteria grow into isolated colonies on plates, and that you can reproduce the colonies from an original plate to new plates by \"stamping\" the original plate with a cloth and then stamping empty plates with the same cloth. Bacteria from each colony are picked up on the cloth and then deposited on the new plates by the cloth. \n \n The hypothesis for the experiment is that antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria surviving an application of antibiotics had the resistance before their exposure to the antibiotics, not as a result of the exposure.\n\n \n **\n Very important to note--whether or not resistance is present in a colony of bacteria prior to the application of a bacteriacide says nothing at all about how bacteria come to evolve that resistance, should it prove to be present.\n On its face, this experiment, if it's premise, above, can be validated, tells us nothing about bacteria, let alone the evolution of their adaptive traits. And by extension, this lack of meaningful information extends to all of evolution. \n \n \n Why? Because this experiment tries to demonstrate a positive premise [that bacterial resistance to this particular bacteriacide existed in these particular bacteria prior to this particular instance of exposure to this particular bacteriacide to these particular bacteria], in order to prove a negative proposition, [that immediate and proximate contact did not, in this particular instance, generate any resistance found in these particular bacteria]. IOW, the intent here is to attack and disprove a positive universal, general contention, --that bacterial resistance is the result of a teleological, systematic attempt to develop an immunity, partial or total, by a particular kind of organism to a particular kind of vital threat--by means of an exception that at best proves that that is not true in all cases.\n \n The false assumptions being that, first, whatever is the case in this particular case, it has been, always and everywhere, the universal and general case wrt exposure of this kind of bacterium to this kind of bacteriacide. This may be true in modern cases, but there is no reason to assume that it always applied this kind of bacteria vis a vis this bacteriacide;- i.e., that no evolution among this kind/[species?] of bacteria ever took place in this regard.\n \n Second, the false assumption that if resistance does not appear in a particular bacterial cell, then colonies composed of such cells cannot possess a such an immunity. The false premise being that in complex autopoietic, self-organizing, self-sustaining, self-serving, and productive whole systems, such as bacteria colonies, the sum of its traits equals the sum of the traits possessed by its individual cellular parts. Which is like claiming that thjose traits we call human are solely the sum of the traits possessed by our individual cells. Very much a materialist/mechanist assumption about reality.\n \n Having clarified the theoretical background here, let us continue with the empirical experiment--\n \n \n\n 1. Bacteria are spread out on a plate, called the \"original plate.\" \n 2. They are allowed to grow into several different colonies. \n\n \n **\n Actually, unless great pains are taken to keep bacteria of the same 'strain'(?) hermetically separated from one another, recent work shows that they can and do chemically communicate with each other, and can and do laterally transfer genetic information to one another, so that in effect and FAPP, you do not get \"several different colonies\", but only one colony that is not, because it does not have to be, spacially coherent. Just because we cannot cut ourselves up into separate pieces and remain a single entity, does not mean that bacteria are equally limited. The fact is, they are not.\n \n \n\n 3. This layout of colonies is stamped from the original plate onto a new plate that contains the antibiotic penicillin. \n 4. Colonies X and Y on the stamped plate survive. They must carry a mutation for penicillin resistance. \n\n \n **\n The trait is self-evident. The assumption of a 'mutation', especially an immediate, local, and particular to this particular case, 'mutation', is utterly groundless. It's like saying that birds placed in this tree \"X\", moved to that tree, \"Y\" without touching the ground. They must carry a 'mutation for flight', that just happened, just now, in their case, in their genes. Sometime between the time they were eggs laid in tree \"X\", without a 'genetic mutation for flight', and the time that they actually flew to tree \"Y\".\n \n Wait a minute, you say!! Birds inherit the ability to fly, genetically. Without a gene for flight, they just can't fly. Well, get me an ostrich and a penguin, and show me the gene/s in eagles and swallows that ostriches and penguins do not possess. There are none. Flight is a developmental, epigenetic matter, as, (we are now discovering), is the case for almost all complex traits.\n \n But, you say, bacterial resistance is not 'complex'. It's a very simple matter of one gene change equals immunity, or not. Well, I do not believe that changing a specific gene in such a way that it confers immunity to the destructive effects of a particular phage/chemical is a 'simple' matter, at all. But that's just me. Darwinists claim, vociferously and at every opportunity, that such things 'just happen, that's all', by accident, all the time and everywhere. That's their assumption and they are welcome to it, but it sounds silly to me, and they have not validated that assumption by the scientific method. In fact, this experiment is an attempt to validate that suppostion without using the scientific method, just as was L&D '43, before it.\n \n The point being that their assumption rests entirely upon an assumption of genetic determinism, wherebye trait changes in organisms are directly, in strict linear fashion, the mechanically inevitable result of chemical changes in the genome. As opposed to the contrasting point of view, (held by myself and an ever increasing number of others), that chemical changes in the genome [mutations], are, where productive, adaptive, and positive in terms of the organism as a complex system, are themselves 'trait changes' brought about by the organism itself. Which means that a trait can and sometimes does exist for an organism without there having to be a specific 'gene for' it. \n \n Now, as I say, this experiment is really an experiment meant, underneath it all, to prop up the darwinist/mechanist assumption of genetic/chemical determinism. Does it? I think not.\n \n \n\n 5. The Lederbergs set out to answer the question, did the colonies on the new plate evolve antibiotic resistance because they were exposed to penicillin? The answer is no: \n\n \n **\n Actually, the answer is, \"Yes!!\", and \"No!!\" These particular bacteria in this particular case did not, (at least apparently, which we'll let go for sake of argument), \"evolve\" (by which is intended, 'immediately, but accidentally and coincidentally, generate a chemical change, i.e., genetic mutation') as an adaptive result of contact with this toxin at this time.\n \n Well, heck, nobody has ever claimed, at any time, anywhere, that adaptive changes in organisms with regard to immediate, proximate, destructive toxins are caused by accidental, coincidental, spontaneously arising chemical changes, i.e., genetic mutations. Except darwinists themselves, of course. \n \n So, to this point, they've come up with zip support for themselves and their 'selective', genetic determinist, evolution model, so far,-- and zip contra-indicating evidence for the opposing, 'responsive', epigenetically-directed evolution model--the one I label EAM. Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesisis. You can call it \"Devo-Evo\", or whatever, if you prefer.\n \n So we will continue and see what they eventually do come up with--\n \n \n\n When the original plate is washed with penicillin, the same colonies (those in position X and Y) live-even though these colonies on the original plate have never encountered penicillin before.\n\n \n **\n This is ridiculous, and does no great justice to the actual experiment. In order to state that colony X and colony Y, on the original plate, \"have never encountered penicillin before\", the protocols followed to determine this as fact should have been mentioned earlier. If there were none, (which I'm sure is not the case), the experiment would be a total waste of time. In actual fact the Lederbergs, like L&D before them, probably took a small culture from a larger culture, out of which all tested portions showed no resistance, and assuming that what was true for some was true for all, [an illogical assumption], they then took other portions of that culture in order to create their original plate of seemingly diverse and distinct colonies. I do not have the actual paper to work with here, so the actual protocols used are not here for me to present. But anyone knows that you you just don't slap down bacteria colonies with an assumption that all of them are resistance-free to start with.\n \n So let us assume that, like L&D'43 before them, the Lederbergs demonstrated, in terms of statistical probability at least, that it was highly unlikely that any of their original colonies possessed any degree of genetically determined immunity to penicillin, whatsoever. At least not at the moment that they were put onto the original plate. Please note that this is not an empirical observation, i.e., a fact, but only a theoretical, statistical assumption, i.e., a plausible belief.\n \n Later, [and it would really help clarify things if we knew how much later], these supposedly resistance-free colonies were transferred by 'stamping', taking them from plate A to plate B, as above. On plate B they were awaited by penicillin, which wiped out all colonies save X and Y. Rushing bact to the original plate and exposing all of those colonies to penicillin showed the exact same result. Therefore, it can be plausibly assumed that the penecillin resistance arose in the X and Y colonies, but no others, on the original plate, sometime between the time when the colonies were first placed upon that original plate, and the time that that that original plate was transferred, 'stamped', on the penicillin covered plate.\n \n What does this prove, in any plausible form? Solely this--that penicillin resistance can arise in some colonies of the same kind of bacteria, all of which are assumed to be originally resistance free, without and direct, immediate, and proximate contact with penicillin itself.\n \n What does this NOT prove?\n \n First, that this kind/species of bacteria does not have an internal developmental, epigenetic mechanism for systematically [teleologically] generating adaptive resistance/immunity to penicillin by developmentally, (as the colony grows and develops), altering, or allowing to be altered, the gene in question. \n \n Since a negative, as above, cannot be proven, did they prove a positive contrary which eliminates the above possibility? That is, did they prove that the presence of penicillin resistance in only two of the various colonies arose spontaneously in those two colonies because of some purely anomolous, accidental, coincidental, ateleological, chemical event called a random mutation? No, they certainly did not.\n \n \n\n So the penicillin-resistant bacteria were there in the population before they encountered penicillin. They did not evolve resistance in response to exposure to the antibiotic.\n\n \n **\n So what? The fact that things are as they are is not the issue in science;--the issue is the 'how' and the 'why' explanation for things being what they are.\n \n In this regard, they failed to show that the generation of penecillin resistance in modern bacteria is purely accidental, coincidental, and spontaneous and immediate, rather than deliberate, systematic, developmental, and epigenetically heritable. That is, immunity as an epigenetically inherited systematic trait that first \"evolved\" long ago in the ancient forebears of modern bacteria when they first encountered penicillin and had to heuristically find some way to deal with it or go extinct. A systematic immunity generated sporadically [for energy and other cost/productivity considerations] by colonies as an ongoing and integral, 'health and well-being' self-maintainance behaviour.\n \n They will argue that, in their opinion, if this was a systematic and integral behaviour, then all of the colonies should have restored their intrinsic immunity, not just the two of them. But this is a false assumption about how a self-regulating system works. Unlike a purely mechanical machine system, there is no determinism which dictates the exact same behaviours every time, no matter what the coincidental consequences. These organismic behaviours are contolled with a teleological view to to 'profit and loss', and so are indeterminate in a purely mechanical sense. At the same time being \"indeterminate\" does not mean \"random, accidental, stochastic, unsystematic, coincidental and ateleological\". How do we know this? It's very easy to demonstrate. Just run this very experiment a thousand separate and distinct times, and see how regularly you get what darwinists claim is a purely accidental, anomalously random, result. Hint--you'll get far too much regularity to go on pretending that what you're looking at is darwinian 'random mutation'.",

   "Funny thing about that. For the first 40 years darwinists claimed that L&L'52, like L&D'43, _proved_ that _all_ genetic mutations_, including all adaptive mutations, were \"random\", as in, \"not directed\". The switch to \"many\" is a big, and quite recent, tune change.\n\n \n Nope thats not what the experiment was designed to show, nor could any experiment EVER show that \"all_ genetic mutations_, including all adaptive mutations, were \"random\", as in, \"not directed\" What L&L showed was that by far the larger fraction of mutations for resistance to penicillin were present in the population of bacteria before they were exposed to penicillin. In other words the variation already existed in the population - although at low frequencies. The experiment does not speak to whether or not a mutation to penicillin resistance is \"random\" other than to show that exposure to penicillin did not induce the mutations, but rather the mutations were pre-existing rather than spontaneous events triggered by penicillin exposure.\n \n \nVery important to note--whether or not resistance is present in a colony of bacteria prior to the application of a bacteriacide says nothing at all about how bacteria come to evolve that resistance, should it prove to be present.\n On its face, this experiment, if it's premise, above, can be validated, tells us nothing about bacteria, let alone the evolution of their adaptive traits. And by extension, this lack of meaningful information extends to all of evolution.\n\n \n Well it does tell us that the mutations responsible for resistance were present prior to exposure to the penicillin and were not induced by it. Thats precisely the HYPOTHESIS (not premise) that its designed to test! It was not designed to test anything else. It also tells us nothing about how stars evolve and die, but one should also not expect it to. The exact biochemical mechansims leading to resistance to penicillin (NOT AN BACTERACIDE by the way) is not the object of the exercise. Though if you want details on that they are known.\n \n \nWhy? Because this experiment tries to demonstrate a positive premise [that bacterial resistance to this particular bacteriacide existed in these particular bacteria prior to this particular instance of exposure to this particular bacteriacide to these particular bacteria], in order to prove a negative proposition, [that immediate and proximate contact did not, in this particular instance, generate any resistance found in these particular bacteria]. \n\n \n Nope the experiment tests specifically whether the resistant strains existed prior to or only after penicillin exposure. Its designed to discriminate between the two possibilities. If the mutations are induced then the original colonies whose replicates show resistance should not be resistant and some of the original colonies which did not demonstrate resistance should do so after exposure. If the mutations pre-existed then the original colonies whose replicates were resistant should be resistant and the original colonies whose replicates were sensitive should be sensitive. In other words its a test of spontaneous mutation upon exposure to penicillin. They did not find such mutations meaning that the resistant strains were already present in their original bacterial population. \n \n \nIOW, the intent here is to attack and disprove a positive universal, general contention, --that bacterial resistance is the result of a teleological, systematic attempt to develop an immunity, partial or total, by a particular kind of organism to a particular kind of vital threat--by means of an exception that at best proves that that is not true in all cases.\n\n \n No the intent was to test the stated hypothesis. Namely are the observed resistant colonies due to pre-existing mutations or due to induced mutations. The experiment tests both and can discriminate between the two possibilities. Turned out the mutations were pre-existing. \n \n \nThe false assumptions being that, first, whatever is the case in this particular case, it has been, always and everywhere, the universal and general case wrt exposure of this kind of bacterium to this kind of bacteriacide. This may be true in modern cases, but there is no reason to assume that it always applied this kind of bacteria vis a vis this bacteriacide;- i.e., that no evolution among this kind/[species?] of bacteria ever took place in this regard.\n\n \n No experiment can or ever does test every possible system nor can it be expected to. In the L&L experiment penicillin exposure did not induce resistance it was pre-existing. If you want to do your own testing in other systems to show that this is not always the case then feel free - or find them in the literature. And note well the outcome of the experiment was not known in advance, NOR is the test system here thought to be exceptional.\n \n \nSecond, the false assumption that if resistance does not appear in a particular bacterial cell, then colonies composed of such cells cannot possess a such an immunity. The false premise being that in complex autopoietic, self-organizing, self-sustaining, self-serving, and productive whole systems, such as bacteria colonies, the sum of its traits equals the sum of the traits possessed by its individual cellular parts. Which is like claiming that thjose traits we call human are solely the sum of the traits possessed by our individual cells. Very much a materialist/mechanist assumption about reality.\n \n\n \n You do not understand how replica plating works do you? It samples the entire colony in a printing like operation not just single cells. And the assumption you are imposing is not present in the original experiment. The experiment was designed to test the genetics of resistance in bacteria. Genetics IS confined to individual cells or linages of such cells. And going into a scientific experiment with non-material, non-mechanist assumption about reality is to put it mildly UNREALISTIC. The experiment is not designed to test for DIVINE miracles nor should it be! What an idiot you must be.\n \n \nHaving clarified the theoretical background here, let us continue with the empirical experiment--\n\n \n Ok but I hold out zero hope that you are able to continue very far given you lack of any scientific understanding of what was done and why!",

They must carry a 'mutation for flight', that just happened, just now, in their case, in their genes. Sometime between the time they were eggs laid in tree \"X\", without a 'genetic mutation for flight', and the time that they actually flew to tree \"Y\".\n\n \n Your language is turning into foaming at the mouth. \"immediate, local, particular to this particular case, mutation, is utterly groundless\" well yes it is since your words are a garbled mess without content. Lets look at the EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE not your babble about birds. A colony of bacteria on a plate is replica plated onto a plate containing penicillin, the replica colony grows out as is thus resistant. The original colony is tested for penicillin resistance and also found to be resistant. OR alternatively a replica colony is found to be penicllin sensitive, the original colony is tested and found to be sensitive also. This is repeated some hundreds or thousands of times and in each case the resistance/sensitivity state of the original colony corresponds to the resistance/sensitivity state of the replica. The conclusion is that the status of resistance/sensitivity did not change when the colony was exposed to penicillin. Stuff your birds and have them for thanksgiving you analogy is inapplicable and inappropriate. If you wish to discuss the experment then discuss it.\n \n \nWait a minute, you say!! Birds inherit the ability to fly, genetically. Without a gene for flight, they just can't fly. Well, get me an ostrich and a penguin, and show me the gene/s in eagles and swallows that ostriches and penguins do not possess. There are none. Flight is a developmental, epigenetic matter, as, (we are now discovering), is the case for almost all complex traits.\n\n \n Continued meaningless babble. The experiment deals with mutation to resistance (phage, sterptomycin, penicillin) in bacteria. Flight has nothing to do with it. You are simply getting desparate. Please explain the results of the experiment rather than engaging in FLIGHTS of fancy.\n \n \nBut, you say, bacterial resistance is not 'complex'. It's a very simple matter of one gene change equals immunity, or not. Well, I do not believe that changing a specific gene in such a way that it confers immunity to the destructive effects of a particular phage/chemical is a 'simple' matter, at all. But that's just me.

In fact, this experiment is an attempt to validate that suppostion without using the scientific method, just as was L&D '43, before it.\n\n \n Again resistance to phage or antibiotics can be complex or simple and it matters not to the experiment. The mutations existed prior to the colony being exposed to the agent. That is what you have to deal with not the simplicty or complexity or even the specific biochemical mechanism. Unless you can somehow invalidate the specific experimental findings you are going to have to accept the authors conclusions OR pose an alternate explanation for them which you can (prefereably HAVE tested). In other words you will have to show that the mutations detected DID NOT EXIST prior to the penicillin exposure. And please note that IF THEY DID then the results would be different than they are.\n \n \nThe point being that their assumption rests entirely upon an assumption of genetic determinism, wherebye trait changes in organisms are directly, in strict linear fashion, the mechanically inevitable result of chemical changes in the genome.

Does it? I think not.\n \n\n \n Phage resistance and antibiotic resistance has been studied to death. The assumption of genetic determinism holds up to the testing. We know the genes involved in most cases, and we know of several variant genes for most cases of resistance. The biochemical mechanisms are known, the coded proteins are known, and nowdays the underlying sequence changes are known. The assumption in this experiment of genetic determinism is in fact well justified. And I have to note that you continue to babble away without addressing the issues the experment actually raise. \n \n \nActually, the answer is, \"Yes!!\", and \"No!!\" These particular bacteria in this particular case did not, (at least apparently, which we'll let go for sake of argument), \"evolve\" (by which is intended, 'immediately, but accidentally and coincidentally, generate a chemical change, i.e., genetic mutation') as an adaptive result of contact with this toxin at this time.\n \n Well, heck, nobody has ever claimed, at any time, anywhere, that adaptive changes in organisms with regard to immediate, proximate, destructive toxins are caused by accidental, coincidental, spontaneously arising chemical changes, i.e., genetic mutations.

Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesisis. You can call it \"Devo-Evo\", or whatever, if you prefer.\n\n \n You are still babbling and have failed to address the experimental findings. You either have failed to grasp them or you refuse to face their implications. Its a relative simple experiment whose results could have gone either way. The actual results indicate the mutations existed prior to exposure rathere than being induced. You can rant all you want, but you still have not explained how this can be if you claim that such mutations should be induced rather than prexist!\n \n So we will continue and see what they eventually do come up with--",

   "This is ridiculous, and does no great justice to the actual experiment. In order to state that colony X and colony Y, on the original plate, \"have never encountered penicillin before\", the protocols followed to determine this as fact should have been mentioned earlier. If there were none, (which I'm sure is not the case), the experiment would be a total waste of time. In actual fact the Lederbergs, like L&D before them, probably took a small culture from a larger culture, out of which all tested portions showed no resistance, and assuming that what was true for some was true for all, [an illogical assumption], they then took other portions of that culture in order to create their original plate of seemingly diverse and distinct colonies.

But anyone knows that you you just don't slap down bacteria colonies with an assumption that all of them are resistance-free to start with.\n\n \n \n The strain the Lederbergs started with was either fully susceptable to phage or else showed NO resistance to the antibiotic. The way they showed this is detailed in the original paper - feel free to read it. I posted the link earlier. If there were any resistant cells in the original source material due to exposure to either phage or antibiotic they were NOT present in the bacterial population used for the experiment.

Please note that this is not an empirical observation, i.e., a fact, but only a theoretical, statistical assumption, i.e., a plausible belief.\n \n\n \n Nope its an empirical observation testing for resistance would involve testing many billions of cells with a detection ability of 1 or 2 resistant cells. This is not terribily difficult with bacteria you realize. And of course this fully sensitive population was cultivated in the absense of either phage or penicllin for many generations before being tested - otherwise there would have been no spontaneous mutations to resistance which would be detectable. The paper outlines the detail. But I have little hope you will grasp it - I have the impression you are not trained in microbiological laboratory operations.\n \n \nLater, [and it would really help clarify things if we knew how much later], these supposedly resistance-free colonies were transferred by 'stamping', taking them from plate A to plate B, as above. On plate B they were awaited by penicillin, which wiped out all colonies save X and Y.

As to when the resistance mutation arose you are confused. The paper again details this nicely. All that is known is that the colonies matched regardless of whether they had been exposed to penicillin.\n \n \n \nWhat does this prove, in any plausible form? Solely this--that penicillin resistance can arise in some colonies of the same kind of bacteria, all of which are assumed to be originally resistance free, without and direct, immediate, and proximate contact with penicillin itself.\n \n\n \n It was not and need not be assummed that the resistance on the original plate arose on that plate. See the original paper for the protocols.\n \n [QUOTE]What does this NOT prove?\n \n It does not prove that exposure to penicillin induces mutaions which make bacteria resistant to penicillin (or phage or streptomycin).\n \n \nFirst, that this kind/species of bacteria does not have an internal developmental, epigenetic mechanism for systematically [teleologically] generating adaptive resistance/immunity to penicillin by developmentally, (as the colony grows and develops), altering, or allowing to be altered, the gene in question.\n \n\n \n Actually it does falsify that contention for this particular system.

That is, did they prove that the presence of penicillin resistance in only two of the various colonies arose spontaneously in those two colonies because of some purely anomolous, accidental, coincidental, ateleological, chemical event called a random mutation? No, they certainly did not.\n\n \n The actual experiment wil of course involve many more than two resistant colonies. Hundreds of them in fact. The experiment shows that the resistance existed in the bacteria PRIOR to exposure to penicillin. The mechanism is not at issue. The mutation arose WITHOUT exposure to penicillin (or other agent). Thus the agent was not the cause of the mutation. If the agent had been the cause of the mutation then resistant colonies should have been found on the replica plates which were sensitive on the original plates. This did not happen.

Even though, as even chemmy points out, such a claim is impossible to validate inductively, since it is impossible to test all possible cases. \n \n The usual darwinist way round this logical dilemma in their \"random wrt fitness\" (as the assumed source of adaptive evolution), principle, was to claim that if they could show by even a single case that novel adaptation in a species was genetically \"random wrt fitness\", then it could be accepted as the general rule, just as novel maladaptiveness [in a mutant] could be explained, as a general rule, as an accidental, entropic genetic mutation. \n \n This, of course, is illogical. Only after thousands of such experiments on different bacteria and/or antibiotics- (not repititions of the same two experiments)-could so much as a statistical case be made, using probability theory. That has never been done. But that did not stop darwinists from claiming that beneficial traits, such as immunity to certain antibiotics in certain bacteria, could be generated accidentally, spontaneously, randomly, for no purpose or reason, and still be beneficial purely by coincidence, chance, serendipitous good fortune, luck, or whatever. And whenever anyone says to them, \"Oh, yeah, where's your evidence for that?\", they immediately and invariably bring up one or both of L&D'43 and L&L '52, just as chemmy did this time. Honest to pete, they do it every time!!\n \n Then what happens? Somebody like me points out that these two experiments do not provide evidence supporting their \"RMNS\", 'random wrt fitness' principle, and they immediately pretend that we misunderstood--that all the experiments were trying to do was show that adaptive genetic mutations _could_ arise [spontaneously] in colonies that supposedly did not possess resistance prior to any immediate contact with an antibiotic, because, according to them, that is what actually occurred in these two experiments. AND THEN, when we point out that the experiments DO NOT support that contention, either, they switch to claiming that all the experiments actually set out to prove was merely that novel adaptive mutations arise 'somehow', prior to any organismic need for them. \"Honest, folks, all we ever said was that adaptive genetic mutations precede, occur prior to, the immediate exposure to antibiotics done in these particular experiments!\" If that were all that was implied, nobody would give a cent for it.\n \n \n\n What L&L showed was that by far the larger fraction of mutations for resistance to penicillin were present in the population of bacteria before they were exposed to penicillin. In other words the variation already existed in the population - although at low frequencies.\n\n \n **\n But that is nothing more than a simple observation of fact!! You do not need an \"experiment\" to \"prove\" that \"by far the larger fraction of mutations for resistance to penicillin were present in the population of bacteria before they were exposed to penicillin\"-- you only have to observe what happens to batches of bacteria exposed to penicillin!! Duh!\n \n The two experiments are only experiments because protocols [according to the standards of over 1/2 a century past] established to the satisfaction of the experimenters that they were starting out [at 'point A'] with bacteria colonies in which NO resistance was to be found, only to find that before exposure to the antibiotic [at 'point C'] there came a 'point B', that is, an instant where resistance was spontaneously generated in that which, up to that point, did not have it. To say that they went to all that work, not in order to demonstrate spontaneous, random, but adaptive, genetic mutation for resistance, but rather, merely to show that some bacteria colonies possess genetic resistance prior to a novel instance of exposure to an antibiotic, is so ridiculous as to be insane! But that's what chemmy claims, here--\n \n \n\n The experiment does not speak to whether or not a mutation to penicillin resistance is \"random\" other than to show that exposure to penicillin did not induce the mutations, but rather the mutations were pre-existing rather than spontaneous events triggered by penicillin exposure.\n\n \n **\n These darwinists are a shifty lot--if you're not paying attention, they'll con you right out of your own shorts!",

   "**\n \n FYI--\n \n \n \n **\n Funny thing about that. For the first 40 years darwinists claimed that L&L'52, like L&D'43, _proved_ that _all_ genetic mutations_, including all adaptive mutations, were \"random\", as in, \"not directed\". The switch to \"many\" is a big, and quite recent, tune change.\n \n \n \n **\n Very important to note--whether or not resistance is present in a colony of bacteria prior to the application of a bacteriacide says nothing at all about how bacteria come to evolve that resistance, should it prove to be present.\n On its face, this experiment, if it's premise, above, can be validated, tells us nothing about bacteria, let alone the evolution of their adaptive traits. And by extension, this lack of meaningful information extends to all of evolution. \n \n \n Why? Because this experiment tries to demonstrate a positive premise [that bacterial resistance to this particular bacteriacide existed in these particular bacteria prior to this particular instance of exposure to this particular bacteriacide to these particular bacteria], in order to prove a negative proposition, [that immediate and proximate contact did not, in this particular instance, generate any resistance found in these particular bacteria]. IOW, the intent here is to attack and disprove a positive universal, general contention, --that bacterial resistance is the result of a teleological, systematic attempt to develop an immunity, partial or total, by a particular kind of organism to a particular kind of vital threat--by means of an exception that at best proves that that is not true in all cases.\n \n The false assumptions being that, first, whatever is the case in this particular case, it has been, always and everywhere, the universal and general case wrt exposure of this kind of bacterium to this kind of bacteriacide. This may be true in modern cases, but there is no reason to assume that it always applied this kind of bacteria vis a vis this bacteriacide;- i.e., that no evolution among this kind/[species?] of bacteria ever took place in this regard.\n \n Second, the false assumption that if resistance does not appear in a particular bacterial cell, then colonies composed of such cells cannot possess a such an immunity. The false premise being that in complex autopoietic, self-organizing, self-sustaining, self-serving, and productive whole systems, such as bacteria colonies, the sum of its traits equals the sum of the traits possessed by its individual cellular parts. Which is like claiming that thjose traits we call human are solely the sum of the traits possessed by our individual cells. Very much a materialist/mechanist assumption about reality.\n \n Having clarified the theoretical background here, let us continue with the empirical experiment--\n \n \n \n **\n Actually, unless great pains are taken to keep bacteria of the same 'strain'(?) hermetically separated from one another, recent work shows that they can and do chemically communicate with each other, and can and do laterally transfer genetic information to one another, so that in effect and FAPP, you do not get \"several different colonies\", but only one colony that is not, because it does not have to be, spacially coherent. Just because we cannot cut ourselves up into separate pieces and remain a single entity, does not mean that bacteria are equally limited. The fact is, they are not.\n \n \n \n **\n The trait is self-evident. The assumption of a 'mutation', especially an immediate, local, and particular to this particular case, 'mutation', is utterly groundless. It's like saying that birds placed in this tree \"X\", moved to that tree, \"Y\" without touching the ground. They must carry a 'mutation for flight', that just happened, just now, in their case, in their genes. Sometime between the time they were eggs laid in tree \"X\", without a 'genetic mutation for flight', and the time that they actually flew to tree \"Y\".\n \n Wait a minute, you say!! Birds inherit the ability to fly, genetically. Without a gene for flight, they just can't fly. Well, get me an ostrich and a penguin, and show me the gene/s in eagles and swallows that ostriches and penguins do not possess. There are none. Flight is a developmental, epigenetic matter, as, (we are now discovering), is the case for almost all complex traits.\n \n But, you say, bacterial resistance is not 'complex'. It's a very simple matter of one gene change equals immunity, or not. Well, I do not believe that changing a specific gene in such a way that it confers immunity to the destructive effects of a particular phage/chemical is a 'simple' matter, at all. But that's just me. Darwinists claim, vociferously and at every opportunity, that such things 'just happen, that's all', by accident, all the time and everywhere. That's their assumption and they are welcome to it, but it sounds silly to me, and they have not validated that assumption by the scientific method. In fact, this experiment is an attempt to validate that suppostion without using the scientific method, just as was L&D '43, before it.\n \n The point being that their assumption rests entirely upon an assumption of genetic determinism, wherebye trait changes in organisms are directly, in strict linear fashion, the mechanically inevitable result of chemical changes in the genome. As opposed to the contrasting point of view, (held by myself and an ever increasing number of others), that chemical changes in the genome [mutations], are, where productive, adaptive, and positive in terms of the organism as a complex system, are themselves 'trait changes' brought about by the organism itself. Which means that a trait can and sometimes does exist for an organism without there having to be a specific 'gene for' it. \n \n Now, as I say, this experiment is really an experiment meant, underneath it all, to prop up the darwinist/mechanist assumption of genetic/chemical determinism. Does it? I think not.\n \n \n \n **\n Actually, the answer is, \"Yes!!\", and \"No!!\" These particular bacteria in this particular case did not, (at least apparently, which we'll let go for sake of argument), \"evolve\" (by which is intended, 'immediately, but accidentally and coincidentally, generate a chemical change, i.e., genetic mutation') as an adaptive result of contact with this toxin at this time.\n \n Well, heck, nobody has ever claimed, at any time, anywhere, that adaptive changes in organisms with regard to immediate, proximate, destructive toxins are caused by accidental, coincidental, spontaneously arising chemical changes, i.e., genetic mutations. Except darwinists themselves, of course. \n \n So, to this point, they've come up with zip support for themselves and their 'selective', genetic determinist, evolution model, so far,-- and zip contra-indicating evidence for the opposing, 'responsive', epigenetically-directed evolution model--the one I label EAM. Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesisis. You can call it \"Devo-Evo\", or whatever, if you prefer.\n \n So we will continue and see what they eventually do come up with--\n \n \n \n **\n This is ridiculous, and does no great justice to the actual experiment. In order to state that colony X and colony Y, on the original plate, \"have never encountered penicillin before\", the protocols followed to determine this as fact should have been mentioned earlier. If there were none, (which I'm sure is not the case), the experiment would be a total waste of time. In actual fact the Lederbergs, like L&D before them, probably took a small culture from a larger culture, out of which all tested portions showed no resistance, and assuming that what was true for some was true for all, [an illogical assumption], they then took other portions of that culture in order to create their original plate of seemingly diverse and distinct colonies. I do not have the actual paper to work with here, so the actual protocols used are not here for me to present. But anyone knows that you you just don't slap down bacteria colonies with an assumption that all of them are resistance-free to start with.\n \n So let us assume that, like L&D'43 before them, the Lederbergs demonstrated, in terms of statistical probability at least, that it was highly unlikely that any of their original colonies possessed any degree of genetically determined immunity to penicillin, whatsoever. At least not at the moment that they were put onto the original plate. Please note that this is not an empirical observation, i.e., a fact, but only a theoretical, statistical assumption, i.e., a plausible belief.\n \n Later, [and it would really help clarify things if we knew how much later], these supposedly resistance-free colonies were transferred by 'stamping', taking them from plate A to plate B, as above. On plate B they were awaited by penicillin, which wiped out all colonies save X and Y. Rushing bact to the original plate and exposing all of those colonies to penicillin showed the exact same result. Therefore, it can be plausibly assumed that the penecillin resistance arose in the X and Y colonies, but no others, on the original plate, sometime between the time when the colonies were first placed upon that original plate, and the time that that that original plate was transferred, 'stamped', on the penicillin covered plate.\n \n What does this prove, in any plausible form? Solely this--that penicillin resistance can arise in some colonies of the same kind of bacteria, all of which are assumed to be originally resistance free, without and direct, immediate, and proximate contact with penicillin itself.\n \n What does this NOT prove?\n \n First, that this kind/species of bacteria does not have an internal developmental, epigenetic mechanism for systematically [teleologically] generating adaptive resistance/immunity to penicillin by developmentally, (as the colony grows and develops), altering, or allowing to be altered, the gene in question. \n \n Since a negative, as above, cannot be proven, did they prove a positive contrary which eliminates the above possibility? That is, did they prove that the presence of penicillin resistance in only two of the various colonies arose spontaneously in those two colonies because of some purely anomolous, accidental, coincidental, ateleological, chemical event called a random mutation? No, they certainly did not.\n \n \n \n **\n So what? The fact that things are as they are is not the issue in science;--the issue is the 'how' and the 'why' explanation for things being what they are.\n \n In this regard, they failed to show that the generation of penecillin resistance in modern bacteria is purely accidental, coincidental, and spontaneous and immediate, rather than deliberate, systematic, developmental, and epigenetically heritable. That is, immunity as an epigenetically inherited systematic trait that first \"evolved\" long ago in the ancient forebears of modern bacteria when they first encountered penicillin and had to heuristically find some way to deal with it or go extinct. A systematic immunity generated sporadically [for energy and other cost/productivity considerations] by colonies as an ongoing and integral, 'health and well-being' self-maintainance behaviour.\n \n They will argue that, in their opinion, if this was a systematic and integral behaviour, then all of the colonies should have restored their intrinsic immunity, not just the two of them. But this is a false assumption about how a self-regulating system works. Unlike a purely mechanical machine system, there is no determinism which dictates the exact same behaviours every time, no matter what the coincidental consequences. These organismic behaviours are contolled with a teleological view to to 'profit and loss', and so are indeterminate in a purely mechanical sense. At the same time being \"indeterminate\" does not mean \"random, accidental, stochastic, unsystematic, coincidental and ateleological\". How do we know this? It's very easy to demonstrate. Just run this very experiment a thousand separate and distinct times, and see how regularly you get what darwinists claim is a purely accidental, anomalously random, result. Hint--you'll get far too much regularity to go on pretending that what you're looking at is darwinian 'random mutation'.\n\n \n \n good stuff, WW.",

   "\n Actually no inference is made - the experimental facts speak for themselves. The resistantce/sensitivity status of the colonies match whether or not they have been exposed to penicillin.\n\n \n **\n This much is fact.\n \n \n\n Thus penicillin did not cause or direct the mutations - they arose spontaneously without exposure to penicillin or other antibiotic (or phage)..\n\n \n **\n This is pure inference made out of the above fact. This inference is both probably right in one respect, but probably wrong in another, far more important respect.\n \n The first respect is that probably yes, in this particular instance involving these penicillin molecules and these bacteria, the appearance of bacterial resistance was probably not in any way due to the penicillin to which they themselves had not yet been personally exposed. Seems both plausible and reasonable to make that assumption, at least until further evidence, if any, turns up to dispute it.\n \n But who cares about a single local instance? Science is looking for universals, regularities that enable predictions, and causal mechanisms logically inferred from the information derived from these regularities and validated predictions. In evolutionary biology, therefore, the real issue is the question of the ORIGINS of traits, not individual instances of their expression.\n \n In this particular instance we find that several colonies of bacteria, all carefully screened for resistance to the point where the experimenters were confident that they no longer possessed any of the resistance to penicillin commonly found in their species under natural conditions, were then left to themselves, and after a time{?} transferred by 'stamping' to another plate, one plated with penicillin. \n {It should be noted that the only claim overtly made by L&L for this experiment was that it demonstrated a good way to transfer bacteria from A to B for certain experiments. Not that anybody ever believed that that was what it was truly all about}.\n One might expect that all colonies of these supposedly non-resistant bacteria would by wiped out, but strangely, at least two were not. SOMEHOW, they had, IN FACT, regained the natural immunity that had supposedly been screened out of them in preparation for the experiment. Since that supposition had been founded, as had that of L&D in '43, on the non-empirical statistical probability that they were resistance-free, i.e., 'sensitive', it was not an empirical fact, but a plausible assumption. \n \n At the same time, any and all plausibility connected to this assumption depends entirely upon the 'a priori' metaphysical presumption of geneticists everywhere, that the inheritance and possession of organismic traits depend entirely upon the presence of particularized acid molecules called 'genes'. That genes are the 'be all and the end all' , not only of inheritance, but of biology entire.\n \n This geneticist presumption of purely mechano-chemical explanations of inheritance enables them to claim that if most bits taken from a colony exhibit no mechanical/genetic resistance, then the necessary chemical [DNA arrangement] is totally absent, everywhere in that colony. This is only statistically plausible,-- not empirically true.\n \n This in turn is based upon the assumption that, since bacteria cells are clones, and all clones are exactly alike, that a colony at full strength still has no properties not possessed by its original cells, but is merely the sum of of all its identically cloned cells. That is, that developmental and epigenetic biology have nothing to do with bacteria colonies. That this is empirically contrafactual is waved off as a matter of 'accidental mutations' making certain cells in a single colony completly different in some vital aspect from every other cell in the very same colony. This is only reasonable if one assumes that bacteria colonies are nothing more than geographically compressed collections of distinct and independent organisms, each consisting of one cell, herded together haphazardly. Which assumption is completely ridiculous, in the light of modern microbiology.\n \n Recent microbiology has shown empirically that this is not at all the the fact of the matter, and that bacterial eusociality makes these colonies into a single 'supra-organism', with component cells subject to the requirements of the whole, the collectivity. Thus enabling some cells to 'specialize', and carry responsibilities and traits not shared by their 'mates'. Since this is the case, any assumption that by taking several portions from a colony an finding no resistance in any of them, that you will find no resistance in any other portion of the source colony, becomes dubious. And that nagging bit of doubt transfers to the issue of whether or not all of the original colonies on the original plate were equally bereft of any degree of natural resistance.\n \n But for argument's sake let us pretend that there is no doubt;- that the assumption that all pre-screened and sorted colonies in use were equally bereft of any genes that would confer resistance (in natural colonies), is, in fact, correct. \n \n At best this assumption is true only for a certain length of time, because in the end at least two colonies prove to have resistance. Darwinists, depending on what they are arguing, say one of two things about this:\n First, that all the experiment claimed to show was that this observed resistance was proven by the experiment to exist prior to these particular colonies being exposed to this particular penicillin plate. Since this says nothing at all in explanation for the appearance of this resistance in some but not all colonies, it is a trivial observation of no great interest. The very best that can be made of it is that in this particular case the resistance found was not directly prompted by an any immediate contact with penicillin. Big deal.\n \n But darwinists did not stop with what was factual or with what was reasonably inferred. With both L&D'43 and with this L&L'51(?) experiment, they extrapolated an assumed explanation for the re-appearance of resistance in colonies from which, presumably, all genetically based resistance had been screened out and eliminated. They leapt past the actual scientific claims made for these experiments, and talked about them as if they provided validating evidence for the hypothesis that adaptive traits are the direct result of random, accidental, spontaneous genetic mutations. But there is nothing empirical and factual in the actual experiments to support this assumption, and none of the experimenters, to my knowledge, ever went so far as to overtly state that they did.\n \n \n\n All mutations observed in the experiment arose without exposure to the antibiotics or phage.\n\n \n **\n Without immediate, proximate exposure, that is. IOW, it is reasonable to assume that in this particular instance, the penicillin involved was not the proximate, [i.e., direct], cause of the observed resistance.\n \n \n\n The only adaptive mutations observed arose spontaneously. \n\n \n **\n Pure, unadulterated by any reasonable evidence, supposition. Argument from ignorance--\"We do not know what caused this re-appearance of an adaptive trait. But, since in our metaphysic all events are mechanical or they are random, and since only some, not all, of these colonies regenerated natural resistance, the phenomenon cannot be mechanical, and must therefore be random. So we'll write it off to 'random mutation', aka 'spontaneous generation', aka, 'magick'. Extrapolating from this assumption we will then attribute the origins of all penicillin resistance in all bacteria colonies, since earliest times, to this same spontaneous magick. Extrapolating from that junk we'll attribute the origins of all variations in all traits and properties in all organisms, in all of evolution, and even in all of biology, heck, in all of existence, to that same magick of 'spontaneous generation'.\"\n \n \n\n I see no claim here that RMS is \"True\" only that the mutations observed are not induced by the antibiotics or phage.\n\n \n **\n There is a big difference between what the experiments actually claim and what darwinists claim for them.\n \n \n\n And yes it does put a nail in the coffin of Lamarck and friends since NO induced resistantce mutations could be detected.\n\n \n **\n Which means nothing because no lamarckian has ever claimed that penicillin resistance originated with/evolved within, this particular experiment. Lamarck and friends are concerned with the evolution of traits, that is, their origins, and not with their later expression in the descendents of those which originated them. That's called, 'inheritance', not 'evolution'.\n \n \n\n This is precisely opposite to what Lamarck and similar theories would predict and thus the predictions are incorrect and the theory proves false in this instance.\n\n \n **\n Not true. Completely false. Neo-lamarckian theories such as EAM are concerned with the ORIGINS of ORIGINAL traits and properties. This experiment would only disprove such theories if there had been NO such trait as penicillin resistance anywhere in microbiology, prior to this particular experiment. Then what the darwinists claim would be most probably the case, even if it is irrational and superstitious. Fortunately for our sanity, that is not the case.\n \n However, allow me to suggest to darwinists that if they truly wish to prove their assumptions of adaptive mutations originating by happy genetic accident, that they repeat L&D'$# and/or L&L'52, but with a totally novel and original antibiotic, man-made and artificial;-- one to which no bacterium has ever been exposed, let alone been allowed to evolve immunity. Go for it. If youyr assumption of 'spontaneous generation', aka, \"RM\", is true, than under these conditions you will still get the exact same results seen in the thousands of repetitions made of these two famous experiments.\n \n OTH, if you don't [and you won't] get the same results, you'll have well-deserved egg all over your smug, patronizing, self-righteous faces.",

This is in accord with the methods employed. In other words all the colonies present have a common ancestor which was neither exposed to antibiotic/phage nor resistant to antibiotic/phage.

When replica plated onto a/p plates some colonies on the original plate were found to be resistant. AND note that the original colonies themselves were ALSO shown to be resistant! Plating onto antibiotic/phage plates did NOT change the resistance/susceptibility properties of a colony. Thus the mutations were present on the original plate and not induced by the antibiotic/phage as such.\n \n \nSince this says nothing at all in explanation for the appearance of this resistance in some but not all colonies, it is a trivial observation of no great interest. The very best that can be made of it is that in this particular case the resistance found was not directly prompted by an any immediate contact with penicillin.

I suggest you duplicate the L&L experiment as closely as you can - after you uderstand the techinque in depth.\n \n OK now lets analyze the experiment on the assumption you use L&Ls approach and that we either match or fail to match the pattern of results of the origina L&L experiment.\n \n If we match it then you can under your proposal simply claim that the chosen system was an exception and that some other system should be chosen. You can continue this literally forever claiming that each result is an exception.\n \n If we fail to match you will claim that EAM is verified EVEN if there are thousands of examples which DID match the L&L experiment. And if we try one more system and your predictions do not match - well thats just another exception.\n \n Sorry to make the experiment practical you will have to specifiy upfront what the test cells will be and what the selector will be. Then you and your theory are at some actual risk of being falsified. If you do not risk falsification due to an experiment then the experiment is valueless. But in this case its easily fixed up. Just specifiy what system of cells and selector you think act according to your theory, swear on a stack of bibles that you will accept the results without changing the system if your chosen one happens to be an \"exception\" and then we shall see. Or of course you can specifiy a limited set of test systems if you wish and do the experiment on each of them. What you cannot do is set it up so that the testing becomes infinite in extent.\n \n \nThere it is, plain and simple. Dare ya to try it out.\n\n \n Its only an acceptable experiment if you modify it so as to take a risk of falsification. But I cannot do the experimental work as I am both disabled and retired from the bench. You will have to do the work and publish it. Surely you must have an appropriate system of organisms and selector in mind and the resources required are not all that great, any ordinary microbiology lab could get the job done competently. There are a number of contractors who will run it for you. I suggest that you use PPD laboratories, my past experience with them has been uniformly excellent.",

Resistance is always a matter of degree. Perhaps you remember the phrase \"the poison is in the dose\"? If you repharse it to say \"exhibit no detectable resistance to X at a defined concentration\" then you may proceed otherwise no go.\n\n \n \n **\n Or to put it succinctly, \"Blah Blah Woof Woof\"!\n \n \n\n Ok then your theory does not apply to the systems used by others.

To do that all you need to do is repeat the two experiments precisely with a full dose, as per the original experiments, of antibiotic. The only difference in protocol, you use a completely novel man made antibiotic that neither these cells nor their ancestors has ever encountered in their species history, anbd to which there can be no taint of inherited immunity. Test it for effect on other bacteria kept well away from any possible communication with the test bacteria. Make sure its lethal. Then do exactkly as L&L and L&D did. My prediction--you won't get a single survivor, no matter how long you leave the various colonies, plates and cultures to develop before exposing them to the antibiotic. Unlike L&D and L&L, in an experiment where evolution, and not heredity, is at stake, you will never see one shread, one particle, one hint of these supposed survivors that came to be thanks to your hypothetical \"spontaneous generation of adaptive genetic mutations conferring resistance to antibiotics\".

   "1) In other words you will NEVER see any resistant colonies? If I read your right. None at all! In other words are you postulating that resistance is impossible?\n\n \n **\n I very much doubt that you are capable of reading anything right, since I have yet to see you do it. And yes, I am saying that using the same protocols as in the originals, with the important exception that an historically unfamiliar [to the bacteria species]antibiotic, [one for which no natural resistance has been observed, anywhere, as yet], you will never have any survivors, none, such as those found in the originals. Not even if you let the colonies propagate for days prior to exposure to antibiotic-coated plates. Providing, of course, that you keep the colonies hermetically shielded from any possible contamination via LDT or whatever.\n \n Why will you not get the same survivors in the same numbers as turn up time after time after time in repetitions of L&D'43 and L&L '51? Why will you get none at all? Because the survivors found in the original L&D and L&L, (and their subsequent duplications), appeared because of an inherited, systematic mechanism for re-generating resistance/immunity that had been first evolved aeons earlier, after repeated contact with these antibiotics led the bacteria to evolve a strategy for dealing with them. They did not appear spontaneously, as claimed by darwinists. They did not simply 'poof' into existence just when needed,(a short time before exposure), thanks to fairy-godmother of 'spontaneous generation, i.e., as a random genetic mutation. \n \n But I could be wrong. The darwinists might be right. There might be some survivors after exposure to a normally fatal dosage of unfamiliar antibiotic, thanks to the holy miracle of random genetic mutation. But I'll bet the farm against that happening. And when it does not happen, darwinists should sheepishly admit that L&D'43 and L&L'51 _DO NOT_ support their case that evolution of adaptive traits is a function of serendipitous random genetic mutations. But I know that they will not, because I know what darwinists, and true-believers everywhere, are like.\n \n \n\n 2) Does this mean you predict that NO resistance will be observed?\n\n \n **\n In those experiments, performed as I have stipulated? Yes, (did I somehow fail to make myself clear?!?), I predict that, unlike the results noted in the originals, in this case NO resistance at all will be observed.\n \n \n\n That bacteria do not evolve resistance to antibiotics - ever?\n\n \n **\n Chemmy, for those of you who don't know him, truly has a positive gift for 'non sequitur', and redherrings and irrelevancies of every kind. Right now we are discussing the appearance or non-appearance of resistance in originally sensitive bacteria when following the protocols of L&D and L&L exactly, save only that, in this instance, I call for an antibiotic with which the bacteria species is unfamiliar and for which no natural resistance has ever been observed. This to be used in place of the historically familiar antibiotics used in the original experiments. Now chemmy makes a mad leap from these experiments over to the nature and capacities of bacteria throughout history!! \n Of course bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics. They do it all the time, and even little children are well aware of this fact. Hopefully, chemmy is just playing the imbecile, and his stupid question is simply for effect. The point is that these particular bacteria in these particular experiments will not, by my prediction, develop any immunity. Not by EAM, and certainly not by the magick 'poof' of random genetic mutation's spontaneous generation.\n \n \n\n So how come they do.\n\n \n **\n That's a different issue. The issue before us here is, will they or won't they do it in these experiments, as performed under my conditions, just as they did do it in the originals, under the conditions imposed by L&D and L&L?? It should not make a difference if the resistance is simply a function of spontaneous generation [random mutation], as claimed by darwinists for the resulting resistance found in the original experiments. If that was true then, it should also be true now, under my conditions. But I say it will not happen, that no resistance, no survivors thanks to a lucky case of random mutation, will ever be found; not even if you repeat the experiment [exactly] for a thousand times or more. Why not? Because darwinist, 'evolution by random mutation' is a piece of superstitious humbuggery.\n \n If darwinists wish to discuss how bacteria actually do evolve resistance to antibiotics in nature, as opposed to what was mistaken for evolution in L&D and L&L, I'll talk about that topic in that context, and hopefully we can keep the darwinists from trying to conflate a discussion of evolutionary mechanisms in general, with the false assumptions prompted by a couple of old experiments, wherin heredity was mistaken for evolution. \n \n \n\n 3) Its a different antibiotic than used in the original experiment. The mutation rate is not going to be the same as for the original.\n\n \n **\n Here we go folks. Even before the results are in, the waffling, hedging, and weaseling out has begun.\n \n \n\n ' One might or might not get mutants which are resistance, but its perfectly possible (since the antibiotic is not known yet) that no resistance is even possible. \n\n \n **\n Nothing is impossible to random mutation and the magick of spontaneous generation! Didn't you people know that? HAW!\n \n IAC, that is not the point. The results of the experiment contrasted with the results of the originals, and the subsequent attribution of the resistance found in the originals to 'spontaneous adaptive genetic mutation' is the point.\n \n When no resistance appears in the lab, even after thousands of duplicate experiments, you can claim that there is no possibility of that species of bacteria developing resistance to that antibiotic. The medical world will be thrilled to hear that. You can then sit back and watch while the bacteria and the antibiotic meet one another in the real world. If resistance never occurs, then you were right, and we've finally found a way to defeat evolved bacterial resistance. But guess what? I bet the bacteria in the wild defeat this antibiotic just like they've defeated every other one we've ever come up with. That is, they do evolve resistance to it. In which case, you were wrong, even though you'll never admit it.\n \n \n\n 4) If the experiment works as you expect I think EAM is in deep trouble since it cannot then explain how life diversified since you seen no changes in the experiment at all! \n\n \n **\n EAM is about evolution, not these experiments. Not the originals, and not the variation I have proposed. No matter what happens, only the assumptions of RMNS darwinism are in question here.\n \n \n\n Or perhaps I misread you rather garbled statement which seems to be a polmeic rather than an attempt to find the truth.\n\n \n **\n Everything is garbled by the time it reaches your brain.

It had to be the patients' fault.\n \n The point is, that out in the wide world, [as opposed to laboratories], there is never, and never has been, a natural situation in which enough antibiotic is applied to a bacterial population/colony that is sufficient to kill all of their cells. This leaves 'surviving cells, and these survivors, collectively, learn from their comrades dying experience, using what they have learned in order to heuristically, teleologically, find an internal mechanism with which to overide the antibiotic's mechanism.

As do all organisms whenever they are not killed outright, but survive long enough to attempt to evolve an adaptation to any vital and chronic threat to, (or opportunity to enhance), their survival, prosperity, and reproduction.\n\n \n You see the thing is, you regularly level at 'Darwinists' the accusation of (paraphrasing) \"assuming bits of stuff can create adaptive change through stochastic mechanisms\". But here, you assume that bacteria (and indeed all organisms) have a psychical existence beyond the physical, for which there is no evidence, and base the rest of your view upon this assumption. Having read a great deal of what you have written in terms of your philosophical views, two major question are raised:\n \n 1)If your premise that all biological systems share the feature of consciousness/volition/intention is correct, then much of what you have written makes sense as a logical whole. However in terms of empirical evidence I am very sure that there is none that validates this view; the fact is that I cannot prove to an independent observer that my best friend or my mother or even I am conscious. Cogitio ergo sum only works as far as it is confined to the individual; there is no way as yet of verifying consciousness in other people, let alone attributing that feature to all biological systems. Therefore I am compelled to ask from where does this premise come? I must, I'm afraid, qualify this question with a major caveat:\n \n Your argument cannot be one such as \"Life and its related phenomena cannot be explained by non-consciousness, therefore consciousness must exist\"*; you need positive, affirmative evidence for consciousness, and I submit that there is none. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. A philosophical argument is insufficent.\n \n *I know there is a name for this fallacy, but it's very late and I can't be arsed to find out what it is.\n \n What it all comes down to, for me personally, and, I suspect, the vast majority of scientists, is the application of Occam's razor; there is no evidence of consciousness. There is no evidence of volition. There is only one's personal belief that one has 'free will'. Now, I am not asserting that one does not have free will, I am submitting that the question is moot, therefore while we cannot discount the concept of free will, we cannot use this concept in our methodology.\n \n 2) Given the fact that we cannot analyse, define, or even affirm the existence of, consciousness, how would we ever (even hypothetically) be able to tell that biological systems are acting 'volitionally', when we can model such systems' behaviours and evolution acceptably without resorting to such an assumption? In other words, I submit that what you call 'Darwinist' evolution actually explains everything that you explain, but does not resort to postulating an unevidenced fifth force. I refer you again to the bolded paragraph, because even though I know that the root of what you argue is unrelated to creationists' arguments, much of what you write sounds like an argument from personal incredulity. \n \n I submit that you have no empirical evidence of a conscious act ever having been performed, even by a human. Therefore you cannot attribute consciousness to any organism. \n \n I also assert that the reason materialism/mechanism is so popular among scientists, is because it does not make that one fatal assumption, that consciousness even exists in the first place. Materialism does not say that consciousness does not exist, it just does assume that it does, and therefore approaches all phenomena from the simlpest, most logical viewpoint.\n \n Phew!

[/quote]\n \n **\n In a word, autopoiesis. See answers.com or wikiperdia.\n \n \"autopoiesis\n \n the process whereby an organization produces itself; literally, self-production (not to be confused with allopoiesis)\n \"an example of autopoiesis is a cell or an organism; allopoiesis is exemplified by an assembly line.\" - from Klaus Krippendorff's Dictionary of Cybernetics \n \n In the materialist/mechanit/positivist world all systems, including biosystems, are allopoietic, i.e., passive, externally operated and controlled. That is a \"system\", a productive organization of interelated parts, generating a process which produces something other than itself and its own constituent parts.\n \n Simple chemical systems are always allopoietic, and darwinists view all systems as simple chemical systems.\n \n \n\n I know that you posit Vitality as a fifth force but can you describe as best you can how this force operates and how it relates to the other fundamental forces?** \n \n *I put \"systems\" in quotes because I know we have different definitions of the word! :) \n **If it is not directly related there must be a specific, identifiable reason; 3 of 4 standard forces are highly interrelated, while gravity has a separate explanation as a function of the topology of spacetime as opposed to a 'force' as such. This concept has observational as well as mathematical support.\n\n \n \n **\n We do not know what any \"forces\" are--we only know what that which we call 'forces', do. What they do is cause, generate, induce, whatever, a change in the 'staus quo'. Without these 'forces', nothing would ever change in any way, shape, or form, and existence, if it could still be referred to as existence, would be 'perfect'--and perfectly stagnant.\n \n The 'status quo' in science is usually referred to as 'an inertial state'. We don't know why inertia exists, but it does, and it's related to 'mass'. We don't know what 'mass' is either, but we know that we call the amount of force needed to overcome the inertial state of a mass, 'energy'--and that is all we know about 'energy'.\n On the corporeal, substantive, materialist, physical plane we have divided the 'force' that generates this inertia-affecting energy into four kinds, as you know. But those four forces only operate upon particles and aggregations of particles; that is, they only affect 'inertial states' of the material, corporeal, substantive, 'physical' parts of reality. That is, the natural phenomena that are 'particulate', as opposed to 'systemic'. That means they apply only to\n those entities whose properties can be reduced to the sum of their included particles individual properties. In short, 'bits of stuff'.\n \n For me, theoretically speaking, 'systemic phenomena' is the term that refers to properties/phenomena which are only found wrt complex, productive systems; those where the whole is an entity greater than the sum of its own parts; that is, where it can be described as organically organised and productive.\n \n Since the \"physical\" forces cannot fully account for 'change in the status quo', in the psychic phenomena evinced by autopoietic systems, something else has to do that. The materialist response to this problem is to resurrect the superstious magic of 'spontaneous generation', this time labelling it 'emergence'. But for us rational types, that just too infantile to be acceptable.\n \n Therefore, just as 'gravity' can be posited as the 'force' that makes an apple fall from a branch to the ground, changing its 'inertial state', so another force causes a psychical 'inertial state', such as an idea or an emotion, to change, and includes even the overall change between the inertial states of life and death, inanimate and animate. I label that force, 'Vitality'. It's as good a label as the labels, 'force', 'mass', 'energy', 'inertia', 'gravity', and so on, that are in constant use. \n \n And yes, I would suppose that all 'forces' are related, and emanate from the same ultimate source.\n \n \n\n b2) Is Vitality as you describe it, some kind of universal consciousness of its own (ie a God-analogue) or the 'force' which results from biological systems having their own consciousness? And does Vitality exist in the universe before life, or only as a result of it?\n\n \n **\n Vitality, like all forces, precedes that which it generates.\n \n \n\n You see the thing is, you regularly level at 'Darwinists' the accusation of (paraphrasing) \"assuming bits of stuff can create adaptive change through stochastic mechanisms\". \n\n \n **\n Yes, because there is no empirical evidence of it.\n \n \n\n But here, you assume that bacteria (and indeed all organisms) have a psychical existence beyond the physical, for which there is no evidence, and base the rest of your view upon this assumption.\n\n \n **\n If you think that, then you have failed to apply empirical observation to the behaviour of bacteria, and indeed all organisms.

   "OK, here goes.\n \n \n\n In a word, autopoiesis. See answers.com or wikiperdia.\n \n \"autopoiesis\n \n the process whereby an organization produces itself; literally, self-production (not to be confused with allopoiesis)\n\n \n So this is where your problem with the ex nihilo business lies I think? You say that life is autopoetic, ie self-producing, by definition. But given that nothing can just produce itself ex nihilo there must be a force driving said organisation, which you call vitality.\n \n And the problem with materialism is that it does not have an answer for what drives this organisation? \n \n \nIn the materialist/mechanit/positivist world all systems, including biosystems, are allopoietic, i.e., passive, externally operated and controlled. That is a \"system\", a productive organization of interelated parts, generating a process which produces something other than itself and its own constituent parts.\n \n Simple chemical systems are always allopoietic, and darwinists view all systems as simple chemical systems.\n\n \n This doesn't make sense to me. It looks like a straw man. The reason being, that once you have any physical system larger than a single particle/quantum, that physical system's internal state is no longer solely determined by external forces. It quite obviously is also determined by events internal to the system, which, if you could trace the evolution of a system back in time with perfect accuracy, would all be originally determined by the system's initial state. \n \n I cannot see how any form of materialism could possibly maintain that all, or even any, physical systems, are entirely \"passive, externally operated and controlled\". To take such a viewpoint is to ignore the (vast in the case of biosystems) complexity of forces unleashed by the continuous, evolving patterns of internal system-state changes, the first change being determined by a disequilibrium of forces, which is itself determined by the initial state.\n \n The only thing imaginable that would not be affected by this process, is something which has a perfect internal equilibrium of forces. One example of this would be a small, unradioactive solid body in a vacuum. (Small so that it is unaffected by gravitational stress, the other qualitites are obvious). But nothing exists in a perfect vacuum for ever, so eventually the object will experience disequilibrium as a result of external forces, say another solid body impacting it. The first body then becomes many smaller bodies, a physical system that will never stop 'evolving' through numerous states as the parts spread out.\n \n So any system is subject to internal and external forces at all times. Biosystems are exactly the same in this regard, which is why I just cannot for the life of me understand the need for another force. \n \n The organisation exhibited by biosystems occurs as a result of internal and external forces, pretty much entirely the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces which are responsible for making and breaking chemical bonds, a mechanism that can readily create organic molecules. A bacterium, a collection of organic molecules, is readily understandable as a very complex chemical reaction which evolves continuously through varying patterns within patterns within patterns of system-state changes, each change quite naturally producing the next, due to the forces arising naturally from the chemical configuration of the bacterium itself, and its environment.\n \n I just can't see the gap that vitality is supposed to fill. \n \n \nWe do not know what any \"forces\" are--we only know what that which we call 'forces', do...\n \n ...they apply only to those entities whose properties can be reduced to the sum of their included particles individual properties. In short, 'bits of stuff'.\n\n \n But all four forces essentially do the same kind of thing. They attract and repel, and this attraction and repulsion can be quantified. They do not 'organise' per se. What I call 'organisation' is the result of extremely complicated relationships of attraction and repulsion. This is where the notion of vitality stands out like a sore thumb. What it supposedly does cannot, as far as I can imagine, be quantified in any meaningful way that would not reduce its apparent actions to the actions of the established forces. \n \n \nFor me, theoretically speaking, 'systemic phenomena' is the term that refers to properties/phenomena which are only found wrt complex, productive systems; those where the whole is an entity greater than the sum of its own parts; that is, where it can be described as organically organised and productive.\n\n \n OK, but for me, these properties are just basic fundamental actions writ large; it really seems almost intuitively obvious to me that when you have something as complex as a biosystem, with the vast complexity of forces within it, you will get something that is, and I know you hate this word, 'emergent'. Because it cannot be specifically predicted. But this isn't a cop-out, and it doesn't mean that anything has been created ex nihilo. All it means, is that it cannot be specifically predicted.\n \n Again, I fail to see the gap that vitality is supposed to fill. \n \n \nSince the \"physical\" forces cannot fully account for 'change in the status quo',\n\n \n But I do not think that this is the case, and I do not believe that you have shown this to be the case.",

   "I'd just like to dip in and address a point raised earlier in the debate, where WW says that what matters in the analysis of evolution is the 'origin' of a trait, not individual instances of its occurrence. This statement was made (iirc) in relation to bacterial mutations, and effectively proposes that when a variant allele arises in a population, the bacterium in question must be 'remembering' that mutation from a prior life, unless we can know for sure that no ancestor of that bacterium ever possessed that allele.\n \n This inspires me to ask a few followup questions:\n \n 1. Where are these 'memories' of mutations stored?\n \n Although bacterial colonies do exhibit organisation, we can be perfectly sure that these alleged 'gene memories' are not retained in some meta-state of the colony. Why? Because adaptive mutants can arise even in colonies grown from a single abstracted cell.\n \n So where, exactly, are these individual bacteria storing the trillions of gene memories they have presumably accumulated in their 4,000,000,000 or so years of ancestry?\n \n 2. If the mutations are being remembered, rather than arising afresh, why do so few bacteria manage it, even when their life depends upon it? Typical adaptive mutation rates are in the 1 in 10^11 range, coincidentally similar to the measured rates of unhelpful (and therefore presumably unintentional) mutations at other gene loci.\n \n 3. If the mutations are being remembered, rather than arising afresh, why is it that UV bombardment of a colony can induce - as part of an across-the board elevated rate of mutation - elevated numbers of the adaptive mutants? Are the UV rays jogging their memories?\n \n 4. Your proposed modified experiment, using an entirely novel antibiotic, is interesting but has a few problems. Actually, it's interesting because of the problems.\n \n You specify that the antibiotic must be one that it is known no bacteria possesses or has ever possessed resistance to in its species history. However, if a colony of bacteria are duly plated upon this wonder-drug and one does survive, it would be because it did already possess resistance, invalidating the drug from being used in the test. How do you propose we resolve this catch-22?\n \n Alternatively, we run the risk of producing a drug so powerful that adaptation is completely impossible. Given the kind of potency we would need to be dealing with (exposing maybe 10^16 bacteria with no survivors), it's a distinct possibility that the second half of experiment (where you administer the drug in dilute form, let the colony mull things over for a while, then apply the full monty) would leave us with a whole bunch of dead bacteria and none the wiser.\n \n But worst of all, the format of your experiment is vulnerable to false positives, because it is based on the assumption that resistance is all-or-nothing, which it isn't. Tolerance to the environmental concentration of any chemical at all, not just antibiotics, varies across populations of bacteria. I know you specified 'no resistance', but think for a moment: if we invent a chemical no bacteria can survive even the faintest tang of, by definition it's going to be impossible to administer 'survivable' dilute doses to test your contention that colonies learn. You might as well flamethrower them and have done with it.\n \n The best we can possibly hope for is to find a concentration of a novel chemical such that none of our 10^16 or so virgin 'test for effect' bacteria survive (about 10,000,000 chemostats full; hope you're not in a hurry for the results). Once we've done that, there's little point in our great-grandchildren conducting the experiment proper, because all it would involve is throwing more bacteria at it.\n \n So we move on to the second part of the experiment: administering a survivable diluted dose, followed by an elevated dose once the colony has had a chance to think things over.\n \n For once, I agree with you: I think you *might* get survivors too. But don't get too excited, because as I said, it could be a false positive: it's perfectly feasible for us to get the results you predict, even if we assume darwinian theory at work. Here's how:\n \n Say for the sake of argument that our 'survivable' concentration is '5', while the 'universally lethal' concentration is '10'. We've established that a virgin population of the bacteria never naturally exhibits a resistance of 10. Yet our second experiment shows that it is possible for the bacteria to possess such a level of resistance, given the chance. What gives?\n \n It could be that the degree of resistance is inhibited by an associated inefficiency - resistance levels of 7, 8 or 9 being so detrimental to the relative performance of the bacterium that it is quickly out-competed. If that is the reason why the dizzy heights of resistance 10 are never reached in practice, then everything changes when you add a background concentration of 5 to the mix. Suddenly, mutants with resistance levels of 7, 8 or 9 don't have nippy little 0's, 1's and 2's to contend with. They can survive much more readily, potentially producing mutant offspring capable of surviving the subsequently administered level 10 apocalypse.\n \n That is why you have to make sure you nail an infection completely with a sufficient dose of antibiotics right from the start. If you have a billion bacteria, and the odds of one being <5 resistance is one in a million, and the odds of one of them being <10 resistance is a further one in a million, you have a good chance of smiting them all if you administer a concentration of 10 right from the start. But if you #####-foot around and administer a dose of 5, then the 0.001% who survive will repopulate the colony, and suddenly the one-in-a-million chance of one of them having <10 resistance is looking pretty good, because there are a billion of them. Now administering a dose of 10 does you no good because a thousand bacteria will survive, repopulate, and if they have a one in a million chance of achieving resistance <15...",

   "**\n FYI--\n \n \"Colonial stress and morphotype transitions\n \n \n It is now understood that bacteria paved the way for life on Earth as we know it, and are crucial for its continuation [28]. Yet, the view of bacteria as unicellular primitive microbes, or a collection of non-interacting passive \"particles\", has persisted for generations. Only recently have the notions of smart bacteria [29,30] and bacteria as multicellular organism [31,21,32,33,34,35,36,29,37,38] (both with respect to bacterial colonies) started to gain attention. Armed with the new developments in the study of patterning in non-living systems [39,40,41], I set out to promote the above notions. \n \n The study of diffusive patterning in non-living systems teaches us that the diffusion field drives the system towards decorated irregular fractal shapes. Hence, I expected complex patterns to be developed by nutritionally stressed colonies. We have created such hostile growth conditions in a petri dish by using low levels of nutrients and a hard thin substrate (high agar concentration). Indeed, we observed some very complex patterns. \n \n Moreover, the colonies exhibit richer behavior than patterning of non-living systems, reflecting the additional levels of complexity involved [21,32,42,33,35,43,36,44,45,38,38,46,47]. The building blocks of the colonies are themselves living systems, each having its own autonomous self-interest and internal degrees of freedom. At the same time, efficient adaptation of the colony to adverse growth conditions requires self-organization on all levels -- which can only be achieved via cooperative behavior of the individual cells. It may be viewed as the action of singular interplay [21,32,48,36,45,49] between the micro-level (the individual cell) and the macro-level (the colony) in the determination of the emerging pattern. \n \n To achieve the required level of cooperation, the bacteria have developed various communication capabilities, such as: 1) direct cell-cell physical and chemical interactions [50,51], 2) indirect physical and chemical interactions, e.g., production of extracellular \"wetting\" fluid [52,53], 3) long range chemical signaling, such as quorum sensing [54,55], and 4) chemotactic signaling (chemotactic response to chemical agents which are emitted by the cells [56,57,58]). \n \n The colonial communication, regulation and control in the formation of complex patterns during colonial development justify the notion of smart (in the weak sense) bacteria. Had we demonstrated colonial adaptive morphogenesis (inherited colonial morphological characters resulting from environmental stress on the colony), it would provide strong support to the notion of bacterial colonies as a multicellular organism. Motivated by the new \"fastest growing morphology\" selection principle developed by Ben-Jacob and Garik [39], we set up experiments with the above special goal in mind. The working hypothesis was that transitions were expected from a morphotype [59] (a colonial geometric character which is inherited and can be carried by an individual bacterium) which expands slowly to a faster expanding one. This means that the colony which can propagate faster on the agar surface has an advantage in reaching the food. Transitions between two of the morphotypes we have identified (for more details see Refs. [21,32,42,33,43,36,45]) the tip-splitting and the chiral morphotypes have been observed. As expected, we observed transformations on softer surfaces for which is the faster morphotype, and the reverse transformations on harder surfaces on which is the faster one. Since the growth velocity is a colonial property, our observations indicate that some selective colonial pressure is invoked. This would be an extension to living systems of the \"fastest growing morphology\" selection principle. \n \n Now we are facing two riddles. One is the manner in which colonial pressure can reach down to the single bacterium and cause genetic changes in the individual cells such that a transformation from the type to the type occurs. Another, related riddle has to do with the morphotype bursts. Sparse cells of the morphotype scattered among the cells within a colony have no individual advantage and no effect on the colonial structure even during growth on soft substrate for which the morphotype is the preferred one. Only finite nucleation of the cells has an advantage (on soft substrate), as it can lead to a burst of the preferred morphotype in a manner analogous to phase transitions (say from liquid to solid) via finite nucleation in non-living systems. The riddle is then how the finite nucleation in the morphotype transition is formed. One possible explanation which was suggested in Refs. [21,32,33,36,45,49], is that of autocatalytic or synchronized genetic changes. If so, a mechanism for such changes needs to be proposed. \"\n \n at-- http://star.tau.ac.il/~eshel/inon/wisdom1/node5.html",

   "**\n See also--\n \n \n \"Genomic adaptation and genomic learning\n \n \n I proceed here with a detour to present two additional ideas that emerged from the observations of the morphotype transitions. Clearly, the potential to perform the transitions from one morphotype to another in response to environmental conditions is available within the bacteria, as well as the capacity for \"deciding\" to go through the transition (although the \"decision\" can be a collective action). \n \n Whether the mechanism is based on activation of cybernators (as is proposed in Ref. [21,32,36,45]), or is \"ordinary\" epigenetics or phase variations, or another mechanism yet to be revealed, the important point is that it provides the colony with the potential to select the preferred morphotype according to the environmental conditions. \n \n To emphasize the special nature of such morphotype transitions, to distinguish it from ordinary reversible phenotypic adaptation and to draw upon the possible relations with adaptive mutagenesis, I refer to it as cooperative genomic adaptation. The advantage of the latter (over phenotypic adaptation) is probably with respect to more severe but less frequent changes in the environmental conditions, e.g. soft soil vs. hard soil in different seasons of the year. Indeed, the concept of time has a major role in the process of genomic adaptation, as is discussed in Ref. [21,32,60] \n \n The possession at present of the potential for genomic adaptation means that it had to be acquired by the genome sometime in the past during its course of evolutionary history. I refer to the above process of acquisition as genomic learning, to emphasize the assumption that it is not a result of Darwinian evolution. For the genome to perform learning in the sense of \"learning from experience\", the following requirements must be fulfilled: \n \n Exposure of the bacteria to several cycles of alternating environmental conditions (e.g. wet and dry soil). \n \n Stored information about past environmental conditions. \n \n Self-information: Information about past and present abilities. \n \n Means for the genome to recognize difficulties and formulate problems and for problem solving according to the collected and processed information, both about internal state and external conditions (including state of other bacteria). \n \n Cybernetic capacity: means for the genome to change itself according to solutions to problems. Ranging from reorganization and restructuring (e.g. activation and deactivation of genes, replication of genes, moving genes etc.) to actual interlacing of new sequences. \n \n The acquisition of the potential for the morphotype transitions is only one out of many examples of genomic learning (see Ref. [60] for more examples). In all cases, the above requirements must be fulfilled.\"\n \n at-- http://star.tau.ac.il/~eshel/inon/wisdom1/node7.html",

   "**\n See also--\n \n \"The Colonial Wisdom: Genomic Webs and Emergence of Creativity\n \n \n According to the extension of G\u00f6del's theorem, the genome can design and perform horizontal genomic changes but not vertical leaps involving paradox solving. Are we back to random mutations? Could it be that the simpler horizontal changes resulted from designed changes and the more relevant (for evolution) vertical leaps are the outcome of random mistakes? The dilemma is solved when we assume cooperative behavior. \n \n Say you would like to design a new, more advanced computer for a certain task. The best strategy would be to construct a network of computers to do the designing. Even though each individual computer is less advanced than the new computer, their network can, in principle, be superior to it. This is, for example, how Intel486 was designed: A network of Intel386 was employed for the task. \n \n Back to the bacteria. It is known that in a stressed colony, some of the bacteria become competent by rendering their membrane more permeable to genetic material, while other bacteria go through lysis: break open and deposit their genetic material in the media [14,13]. In addition, direct genetic connections between the bacteria are formed by means of conjugation or transduction [14,13]. We propose that these features indicate that the stressed colony turns into a genetic network, which is the highest level of colony cooperation. To emphasize that the network is composed of agents (each genome is by itself a cybernetic agent) I refer to it as a ``genomic web''. I further assume, that in order to establish the genomic web, the bacteria produce (or activate) special cybernators enhancing the efficient and sophisticated genomic communication. Once formed, the genomic web is a \"super-mind\" relative to the individual genome. Thus, a paradox for the genome is a solvable problem for the web. The web, being more complex than the individual genome, can design and construct a new and more advanced genome relative to the original ones, i.e., perform a vertical genomic leap. Such a leap is best described as a cooperative self-improvement or cooperative evolution. \n \n The formation of a creative web is far from being trivial and requires very special environmental conditions. Not every assembly of agents leads to a more sophisticated entity. As we well know from daily experience, a committee composed of very intelligent individuals can be a fairly dumb entity. It depends on the balance between the agents' self-interest and their level of awareness of the new entity. In other words, the environmental conditions should be such that the individual bacteria will give up most of their awareness as individual entities.[60]. \n \n In principle, the genome is capable of solving problems on its own, but it is more efficient to solve problems cooperatively. Hence I expect that genomic webs are also employed for the task of problem solving. The harder the problem, the more advanced the genomic web formed. Indeed, as I mention in the introduction, we now have evidence that adaptive mutagenesis requires cooperation of the bacteria. \n \n The picture of a creative genomic web is very appealing. Yet a nagging conceptual difficulty is left. We would expect the colonies of new bacteria which are the outcome of a vertical genomic leap to be more advanced than the colonies of the original bacteria. But, if we truly regard the colony as a multicellular organism, it will be in contradiction with the extension of G\u00f6del's theorem; if we regard the colony as our system, it would imply that a system is capable of designing a system more advanced than itself. I believe that the colony of the new bacteria can only be improved relative to the original colonies, and not more complex. In order to keep the picture consistent, we have to assume that genetic communication between many colonies of the same bacteria, or a number of colonies of different bacteria, are required for the design of a vertical leap on the colonial level (we discuss this point in Ref. [60]). \"\n \n at-- http://star.tau.ac.il/~eshel/inon/wisdom1/node11.html",

   "\n I guess you think you are being 'witty'. Since a cloned bacterium is, FAPP, its own 'prior life', along with all of its fellow clones, just your own cells today had a 'prior life' in the cells you were born with, you should be more careful with your snide insinuations. \n\n \n Please, WW, could you maybe dial back the sensitivity just a little bit? I honestly couldn't think of a better way of characterising what you describe - as you say, I would be perfectly happy to describe my physical form as 'remembering' its characteristics 'from a prior life' - namely my parents and their ancestors - via genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. No slur was intended.\n \n \nIn the organism, of course. Are you trying to put forward the notion that no organism has a 'memory' if it doesn't have a 'brain'?!?\n\n \n No, WW, I'm not, and I don't know why you're insinuating that I am. These discussions would go a lot more smoothly if you could credit those with whom you speak with a modicum of intelligence.\n \n \nWhat mental/psychical trait is confined to single cells individually, and what trait is generated by a number of cells collectively, a 'quorum' if you like, remains to be seen. \"Collective\" intelligence, like all psychical properties, is still a mystery to us after three centuries of materialist dominance in science.\n\n \n This is beside the point. I'm perfectly comfortable with the hypothesis that it might take a number of cells operating in concert to realise a remembered trait (just is it can take a number of people working together to construct something whose design any one is individually capable of remembering), but that's irrelevant as far as your specific claim that the trait is being remembered is concerned.\n \n Of course I understand that the neurons in my brain operate collectively to retain memories. However, the fact that a colony grown from a single abstracted cell also appears to 'remember' these traits disqualifies collective storage as a candidate here. If these traits are stored, they must be stored in the bacterium. What evidence do you have for this?\n \n \nBeing a materialist, you automatically assume that psychical phenomena have to have a physical 'place' in which to reside.\n\n \n No, WW, it is not an assumption, it is a deduction from the fact that evidence discounts the contrapositive.\n \n Specifically, the reasoning is this: if these traits do not require physical storage, then why do organisms need DNA at all? Why do they need the complex physical inheritance mechanisms we observe them to have? You're postulating an intangible (and therefore for all we know bottomless) psychical 'offline storage' which information can flow from and to, and out of which designs can be recalled and used to marshall physical matter into different configurations - ok, if that's the case, why isn't it used for more purposes than the one you claim? Why aren't all the organism's characteristics stored and recalled from there, safely away from unwanted mutagens? Why are physical atavisms always associated with the expression of a dormant but physically present genetic atavism? Surely in the model of reality you describe all creatures, not just bacteria, would be able to recall and express ancestral features without needing to retain those features in unexpressed DNA.\n \n Do you understand the reasoning? It's like claiming your neighbour watches upcoming TV shows using an invisible time machine. The invisible time machine is hard to directly prove or disprove, but the fact that he is your neighbour and does a regular 9-5 job every day, rather than being the richest stockbroker in the world, strongly suggests the claim is false.\n \n \n\n Why was Einstein so much smarter than me? Because his brain was so muc differentfrom mine? Take several brains from a morgue, dice 'em and slice 'em all to heck. Take those that are normal. Without checking on who they belonged to in life, rank them from dumbest to smartest. Then check them agaionst the known IQ's of their former owners. Get any right? \n\n \n But you're conflating your own terminology now. First you say that the colony is the brain analogue and the bacteria are the neurons, now you're treating the individual bacteria as brains. You're not really making a coherent case for yourself.\n \n \n\"Adaptive\" to what? UV radiation? In that case, the adatation is the EAM response to the radiation.\n\n \n Although this does occur, no, that's not what I'm talking about.\n \n \nIf you think that you have examples of bacteria colonies that, following UV bombardment, suddenly demonstrated novel adaptive traits that a/had nothing to do with the demands of their immediate environment, and b/, have nothing to dowith dealing with radiation, then bring them on. But I won't hold my breath waiting for you to do that.\n\n \n How can they demonstrate an adaptive trait that has nothing to do with their immediate environment? That's like asking someone to 'demonstrate' their ability to swim when there's no water around :)\n \n Experiments have be performed in which cloned strains have been incubated in environments with a known factor limiting growth, and the incidence of adaptive mutation measured. When the experiment is performed on a seperate culture under UV bombardment, the incidence of adaptive mutations increases (as does the incidence of non-adaptive mutations). In the experiment I've linked here, the UV bombardment induced a roughly 10 times greater incidence of aphtase-hyperactivity mutations beneficial in that chemostat. Note that, with or without the UV bombardment, the known limiting nutrilite was the same and unrelated to UV resistance.\n \n I appreciate that's not quite what you asked for, because the cells were in the test environment during the UV bombardment. I'm currently checking the web for any examples where UV bombardment is a precursor to exposure to a new environment. Meanwhile, perhaps you could address the remaining points from my earlier post, and explain why, according to EAM, UV bombardment would induce an elevated incidence of adaptive mutation to an unrelated environmental factor.",

In brief:\n \n Two sets of cells were exposed to MTX (methotrexate):\n \n \nInhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR; EC 1.5.1.3)\n by methotrexate (MTX) results in starvation of cells for\n glycine, purines, and thymidylate, resulting in inhibition of\n DNA synthesis, generation of chromosomal abnormalities\n (7), and ultimately cell death.\n\n \n Pretreating with UV radiation prior to exposure to MTX increased the number of MTX-resistant colonies later observed:\n \n \nWhen cells were pretreated with UV radiation (3 J/m2) the\n number of colonies which were resistant to MTX increased\n ca. 10-fold (Fig. 1., open circles).

Which is to say, all psychical phenomena, including intelligence and its facet, memory.\n \n Your objection here is exactly the same objection raised by materialists against any life form lacking a 'brain' being endowed with anything which might be called, 'intelligence'. But that is, quite simply, not science, but a metaphysical assumption-- that materialist postulate that all real phenomena arise out of something ruled by the property of 'extension', i.e., matter, and therefore must be tied to its 'proper place' in the physical universe. In your philosophy, information does not exist without a 'brain' to 'store' it in, 'memory' must be 'stored' in some 'bit' of DNA, or some other molecular 'bit', and a tree does not fall in the forest if nothing and nobody hears it fall.\n \n \n\n If these traits are stored, they must be stored in the bacterium. What evidence do you have for this?\n\n \n **\n As above, that is the philosophical assumption you make, in keeping with your materialist metaphysic, which that beyond the 'physical', there is no other existence, no other 'place', if you like.\n \n In my philosophy, which is one that allows for the reality of psychical phenomena, and does not assert that they are nothing but an epiphenomena of materialist chemistry and physics doing what they do for no known reason or acceptable reason, 'matter' is simply a 'tool'. The 'clay', if you will, which, when put together in a living autopoietic system, i.e., live organism, acts as a physical 'key' or other 'artefact' by which the psychical reality of existence is accessed, obliquely, to itself. That is, the physical exists simply so that that 'pychical existence' can 'see itself in a material mirror', so to speak. And in fact, IMO, that is the sole reason for which this physical universe exists in the first place!\n \n So what does this mean? It means that 'memory' is 'stored', [or rather, simply 'exists', as 'information'], outside of any existing physical 'bit of stuff',\n but requires certain physical 'forms', 'configurations', 'designs' before it can be systematically accessed. It is the difference in these these 'designs, forms, configurations', etc., that determine how much better or worse one physical entity accesses the psychical [eg., why Einstein was so much 'smarter' than me, or why Bach was so much more musically 'gifted']. The 'bits of stuff' do not, as in your metaphysic, generate wisdom and beauty--rather, in my metaphysic, they simply access that which exists anyway, with them or without them, whether anybody hears them in the forest or not, but are better heard and appreciated by themselves, and so \n ears, and so forth, came about, [by way of 'the big bang'], just so that _that which is_ would be able to appreciate itself, by oblique reflection. \n \n Of course this is all metaphysics, but it is no more 'metaphysical' than your assumption that \"If these traits are stored, they must be stored in the bacterium.\". It just ain't necessarily so.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Being a materialist, you automatically assume that psychical phenomena have to have a physical 'place' in which to reside. \n \n \n No, WW, it is not an assumption, it is a deduction from the fact that evidence discounts the contrapositive.\n\n \n **\n Ho hum, so say you materialists, one and all. But what is this 'evidence' from which you 'deduce' this 'fact'. It is, in reality, only an 'a priori' metaphysical postulate about the nature of reality, one which dictates the manner in which the world is viewed, and dictates how that which is viewed is to be 'interpreted'.\n \n \n\n Specifically, the reasoning is this: if these traits do not require physical storage, then why do organisms need DNA at all? Why do they need the complex physical inheritance mechanisms we observe them to have? \n\n \n **\n See above.\n \n \n\n You're postulating an intangible (and therefore for all we know bottomless) psychical 'offline storage' which information can flow from and to, and out of which designs can be recalled and used to marshall physical matter into different configurations - ok, if that's the case, why isn't it used for more purposes than the one you claim? Why aren't all the organism's characteristics stored and recalled from there, safely away from unwanted mutagens?\n\n \n **\n I do not follow you. As a matter of fact, all of an organism's physical characteristics are \"stored and recalled\" from \"there\", using various 'access keys', such as, [but not limited to], the genetic code. \n The fact that material tools, such as 'genes', can and do suffer from being temporal, [that is, material, physical], tools--artefacts and systems-- and so are subject to entropy, is simply the price paid for having a material universe. Mirrors crack and must be discarded and replaced. That's life. Novel 'keys' that access better 'mirrors' are generated to that purpose--that's evolution.\n \n \n\n Why are physical atavisms always associated with the expression of a dormant but physically present genetic atavism?\n\n \n **\n As above. The physical design of the physical 'key' determines what it can, and does, access in psychical reality. It does not determine 'what is there to be accessed', by one 'key' or another, and even a slight change in the way a 'key' is 'cut', or worn down, can make quite a change. \"Revertant\" and 'atavistic' resumption of earlier 'key design' is to be expected.\n \n \n\n Surely in the model of reality you describe all creatures, not just bacteria, would be able to recall and express ancestral features without needing to retain those features in unexpressed DNA.\n\n \n **\n Whyever would they?!? But at the same time, whyever wouldn't they? That which can be, and is, accessed, depends upon the design, the 'cut' of the 'key', and that 'key design ' may or may not depend upon a 'collective' cut that arises _developmentally_ , epigenetically, and is not achieved until a certain 'quorum' is arrived at. \n There is no law that says, 'one key fits all'. Just the contrary, in fact. Some sharks can detect prey electrically, and I'm told. I cannnot, but I do not think that I should, just because a shark can. I see no problem in the fact that eusocial bacteria colonies, when fully developed, can do things that fully developed sharks, for instance, cannot do. And vice-versa.\n \n [quote\n Do you understand the reasoning? It's like claiming your neighbour watches upcoming TV shows using an invisible time machine.[/quote]\n \n **\n Ridiculous.

To the contrary.\n Never have I likened a 'cell' to a 'brain', other than wrt to this 'key' function, as different keys with the same 'access' function, but accessing, both in kind and in quantity, very different psychical phenomena. A bird can access psychical phenomena with its individual being, but as a flock it it can access something more, a 'collective' access to a psychical phenomenon sometimes referred to, [insultingly, IMO] as 'swarm intelligence'.

But no genetic mutations expressed as adaptive traits wrt to some other environmental circumstance, one not immediately and proximately in play at the same time as the radiation, would be produced by that radiation.

It just ain't necessarily so.\n\n \n True, but then again, nor is it 'necessarily so' that the traits are stored at all. Indeed, it seems pure wishful thinking to believe that they just happen to be stored and recalled with a success rate indistinguishable from the rate at which carcinogens induce other genetic changes at the same or different loci. To believe that this point mutation/duplication/deletion and this point mutation/duplication/deletion were accidental, but that one, though physically indistinguishable in terms of the kind of change that occurred, 'must have been' recalled from the psychical plane because it turned out to be adaptive some way down the line - there's no science there, just the imposition of one's own emotional filter.\n \n \nHow can they demonstrate an adaptive trait that has nothing to do with their immediate environment? That's like asking someone to 'demonstrate' their ability to swim when there's no water around.\n \n My point, exactly. So don't make that claim.\n\n \n You misunderstand. They can possess the trait, but in the absence of the environment to which it is adaptive it confers no advantage, rendering it practically impossible for us to detect the presence of the variant. We cannot individually sequence the DNA of all 1,000,000,000 cells in a chemostat to see if some of them possesses a particular allele. The best we can do is expose the population to an environment in which that allele confers an advantage, and let differential reproductive rates bring the variant to visible prominence.\n \n \nAgain, you've lost me. I've always said just the opposite--that radiation, although it would, naturally, vastly increase the rate of entropic mutations, would NOT increase the number of adaptive mutations, with the possible exception of inducing the organism to mutate its genome in order to adapt to this very increase in radiation. But no genetic mutations expressed as adaptive traits wrt to some other environmental circumstance, one not immediately and proximately in play at the same time as the radiation, would be produced by that radiation. If you find something of mine that says otherwise please quote it back to me. It is probably a typo.\n\n \n No, no, I'm aware of your expressed opinion. When I said \"I appreciate that's not quite what you asked for,\", I didn't mean it was 'not quite in line with your opinion', I meant it was 'not quite the evidence you demanded I produce to contradict your opinion'.\n \n However, as you can see I have now produced precisely that, contradicting your assertion that \"no genetic mutations expressed as adaptive traits wrt to some other environmental circumstance, one not immediately and proximately in play at the same time as the radiation, would be produced by that radiation.\"",

It certainly clears up the 'invisible time machine' paradox; you should have mentioned all this earlier!\n\n \n **\n Well, I tend to debate by focussing on responding to my opponents points, so until a point is made to a certain effect, I rarely volunteer an opinion. But, that said, I thought that I had made it clear, somewhere in the course of our correspondence, that I thought that biogenesis consisted of the vitalist force, Vitalism, directing the mechanical force to the end that certain mechanical, material 'designs', were systematized to the point where they could directly access Vitality itself, providing Vitality to a 'biofeedback' mechanism to itself, a 'two-way street' of information flow, so to speak. Somewhat along the same lines as my EAM hypothesis on evolution, where, contra Crick's disproven, \"Central Dogma\", information flows between the organism, its germcells, and their molecular components, i.e., \"genes\".\n \n It could be that the 'key' that Vitality creates is the _information_ found in the various molecular media, DNA 'code' and other biochemical 'codes'. That by creating the code by infusing its information into a mechanical system that does not have it,, Vitality turns that system's molecules into a 'key' that unlocks a gateway to itself, i.e., vitality or the source of vitality, allowing two-way information flow between it, or its own source, and the strictly material component of reality. Strictly speculation, but that's what hypotheses are supposed to be, so long as they're rationally plausible.\n \n \n\n That said, none of it is necessary to explain what we see. Vitalism has far more in common with religious hypotheses than it has with genuine science:\n\n \n **\n Well, no, that is not at all true. Vitality has a great deal more in common with Idealist philosophies, including more eastern philosophies, than it has to do with the materialist/mechanist/physicalist/positivist/naturalist/darwinist/atheist metaphysic you falsely label, 'science\", but there is absolutely nothing in it that would contradict any part of true science--most especially modern physics, with which it is in perfect accord. It is your metaphysic, above, that is pseudo-science, and it has already been destroyed by modern physics, principally quantum mechanics. Albeit those genetic statisticians and molecular chemists who call themselves, 'biologists', (but are in fact merely darwinists), have yet to wake up to that fact of history.\n \n \n\n it is an unfalsifiable proposition designed to explain observed reality in a way that does not offend your personal philosophical preferences.\n\n \n **\n And \"darwinism\"? Right back atcha!! But as to whether or not it is as unfalsifiable as the dead-end, 'it just happened, that's all', that your darwinist explanation of life reduces to, is merely your negative opinion, derived from your personal own philosophical preference.\n \n There is no reason, once 'information', [despite thwe fact 'information' is something that has no place at all in the materialist camp, which can only cope with 'data'] becomes accepted as something truly real--(that is, not physically corporeal, like the substance that it is inscribed within, eg., the ink on a piece of newsprint, and not just an 'epiphenomenon' of corporeal matter, [the ink and paper did not generate, 'epiphenomenally', via 'emergence', the information in the book or paper] , but as the principal ingredient of existence [instead of matter]),-- then we can probably work out just how 'information' [significance, meaning], through Vitality, became inscribed in the earliest molecular codes found in the earliest auotopoietic systems, i.e., lifeforms.\n \n More later.",

   "And this on is rather interesting is it not? Tracking microevolution of a protein as it changes function.\n \n ==========================================\n \n Science 17 August 2007:\n Vol. 317. no. 5840, pp. 884 - 885\n DOI: 10.1126/science.317.5840.884b\n \n Prev | Table of Contents | Next\n News of the Week\n MOLECULAR EVOLUTION:\n Resurrected Proteins Reveal Their Surprising History\n Robert F. Service\n \n It's easy to see evolution's handiwork writ large--just compare a marigold and a musk ox. With a little work, scientists can also pick out subtle differences in the proteins of related organisms. Now researchers in Oregon and North Carolina have gone a step further: retracing the steps by which two proteins diverged from their ancient common ancestor.\n \n In a paper published online in Science this week (www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1142819), the researchers report that they resurrected a protein from ancient fish that swam the oceans some 450 million years ago and then worked out the protein's atomic structure. By comparing the protein to more modern versions and doing some deft detective work, they crafted something like a movie of the sequence of key mutations that enabled the ancestral protein to take on new modern functions.\n \n \"It's a beautiful piece of work,\" says David Haussler, a molecular evolution expert at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Haussler says the work underscores how chance mutations that seemingly add little value initially can help set the stage for major evolutionary leaps. \"For me, what is so exciting is seeing the dynamics of evolution play out on the molecular level,\" Haussler says.\n \n The study was led by Joseph Thornton, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Oregon, Eugene. Thornton and his postdoctoral assistant Jamie Bridgham turned to a pair of closely related protein receptors for two steroids, hormones that govern a wide range of metabolic functions in humans and other vertebrates. The first receptor, known as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), binds to the hormone cortisol, which helps regulate the body's response to stress. The second, called mineralocorticoid (MR), binds to deoxycorticosterone (DOC) in fish and to aldosterone in humans and other tetrapods. The two receptors derived from a common ancestral protein, known as the ancestral corticoid receptor (AncCR), some 450 million years ago.\n \n Last year, Thornton's group reported they had resurrected that ancient protein by comparing the gene sequences of 60 steroid receptors from present-day organisms (Science, 7 April 2006, p. 97) and using evolutionary relationships to compute the most likely sequence of the ancestral protein. The team then synthesized a gene for that protein, cloned it into mammalian cells in culture, and regenerated it.\n \n Biochemical tests showed that, like the modern MR protein, it readily bound aldosterone and DOC, and it had a more modest sensitivity to cortisol. \"So it's the GR's function that emerged with evolution,\" Thornton says. That suggested that the gene for the ancient MR protein was duplicated in the ancestral organism--when fish with cartilage-based skeletons were the only vertebrates on Earth--and evolved to become GR, Thornton says.\n \n For its current study, the group set out to unravel those evolutionary steps. They started by teaming up with structural biologist Matthew Redinbo of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and his postdoctoral assistant Eric Ortlund, who crystallized the AncCR protein and used a powerful x-ray synchrotron to determine its three-dimensional structure, the first of an ancient protein. They then studied precisely how the structure differed from structures of MR and GR.\n \n The researchers worked their way back up the tree of life from AncCR, reconstructing other ancient proteins from ancestral organisms that likely lived around 440 million and 410 million years ago. Whereas the older of these retained the MR-like behavior of AncCR, the more recent protein was found to have a more GR-like function. Comparing computer models of the likely structures of these two proteins, Thornton's team found 37 amino acid changes. In all modern GRs, the amino acids at five of those sites are always the same--a clue that those mutations are vital to the ancient protein's GR-like function. When the researchers inserted the mutations into AncCR, no single one of them transformed it into a GR-like receptor. But one pair of mutations did turn the ancestral receptor into one that prefers cortisol to aldosterone and DOC. \"It didn't get us all of the way there, but it was a huge shift,\" Thornton says.\n \n Thornton's team suspected that adding the other three conserved mutations into the protein would create a more modern GR. But it didn't happen. Instead, the mutations completely killed the receptor. Reviewing the atomic structures of the ancient and modern proteins, the researchers found another pair of mutations that likely helped reinforce the portions of the protein destabilized by the trio of \"killer\" mutations. When they added these mutations before the other three highly conserved mutations, they got a protein that works like a modern GR. \"That really blew our minds, that we were able to predict the functional effect of these mutations that occurred over 400 million years ago,\" Thornton says.\n ==============================================\n \n Full Paper at:\n \n http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1142819",

To generate life afresh, you need vitality to devise another 'key' to fit another 'lock', way down at the simplest, most bare-bones, level. Once lifeforms, cells and multi-celled organisms, lose their inherited life 'spark', i.e., access to Vitality, it's gone for good.\n \n \n\n Indeed, the very existence of life necessitates that be true. For if physical form is the key, then the first key must have formed without the help of what lies beyond the lock.\n\n \n **\n Physical form is a key, but not 'the' key. The real key is the data cut/coded into the matter--its design. This data becomes 'information', i.e., takes on significance and meaning, when and if it correlates to the 'design' of the 'lock' involved, so that together 'access' is obtained. No design match, no access. \n \n Therefore it is the design correlation, the matching data that creates 'information' that matters, because it is that 'generated information' that is the real 'key'. Unless you can put the 'right key' into the 'right lock' you get nowhere. \n \n But you cannot match key to lock unless you are completely familiar with both. That which made the lock, must needs make the key that fits it--no blind key cutters need apply. If Vitality is it's own lock, then Vitality is that which must cut the key to fit. A key component of Vitality is, of course, intelligence. Nothing happens unless Vitality designs the right key, and then brings it into phyical existence. Theoretically anything possessing Vitality, with its Intelligence and Volition, could do it, but only to the 'vitality lock' and 'vitality supply' it already possesses. After all, ex nihilo, nihil fit.\n \n Now, some extraordinarily bright fellows might figure out, someday, just how the original physical key was 'cut'--only to find that the lock has since been replaced, and the old key just doesn't fit it anymore. Or they may get lucky and open the door to genesis, and more life forms of nearly their own calibre, or much lower. But my intuition tells me that that is not the way to bet.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n As above, that is the philosophical assumption you make, in keeping with your materialist metaphysic, which that beyond the 'physical', there is no other existence, no other 'place', if you like. \n \n \n Likewise you make a philosophical assumption that there is something beyond the physical, and that it has certain properties that you find emotionally pleasing, all without the slightest shred of evidence.\n\n \n **\n For some reason you people find your materialist atheism \"emotionally pleasing\", but never admit that you are \"without the slightest shred of \n evidence\" to support it.

You simply huff and puff that your metaphysic is \"science\", which it is not, and that it has real evidence for itself, which it does not. To the contrary, real science, especially quantum physics, shows that your 19th century materialist/atheism is wrong, and, intellectually speaking, should be as dead as the dodo. But then the xtianism of modern evangelistic manichaeism [creationism] should be dead, too, but it lives and breathes on these forums, so what can ya do?\n\n \n Sorry friend but Quantum Physics is a direct product of scientific investigation using the tools of 19'th century physics.

   "Finally we wrap up WWs post:\n \n \nWell, actually, we all know that 'traits' are not stored at all, at least not physically, in some physical warehouse, as required by those who do not believe that anything exists beyond the physical. What is 'stored' is the non-physical, non-corporeal, 'information _about_ traits. That which in non-physical, such as information, requires no physical place to 'store' it, only a means to 'access' or 'retrieve' it from a non-physical state of being/existence.\n That is, to make it manifest. A trait is its information made manifest.\n\n \n Ok lets ask then how you explain the following trait of certain plants. They are resistant to tentoxin - a simple cyclic tetrapeptide made by A. tenuis. The mechanism by which tentoxin (produced by a pathogen) was established to be CF1 binding back in 1976. The following will fill you in on the details - its free access via PNAS so I will just post the link - its only 5 pages long.\n \n http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/73/7/2245\n \n In 1992 the specific codon on the specific protein subunit was tracked down its a single point mutation at codon 83. It involves only the alteration of a single amino acid in the protein from aspartate to glutamate. AND the researchers could by changing the physical structure of the DNA turn the sensitivity to tentoxin on or off. THe abstract follows. If you have full access to the Journal you can read the entire paper - its short 2 pages. Read the 7 pages and weep.\n \n \n \nScience 28 August 1992:\n Vol. 257. no. 5074, pp. 1245 - 1247\n DOI: 10.1126/science.1387730\n \n Tentoxin sensitivity of chloroplasts determined by codon 83 of beta subunit of proton-ATPase\n A Avni, JD Anderson, N Holland, JD Rochaix, Z Gromet-Elhanan, and M Edelman\n \n Department of Plant Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.\n \n Tentoxin is a naturally occurring phytotoxic peptide that causes seedling chlorosis and arrests growth in sensitive plants and algae. In vitro, it inhibits activity of the beta subunit of the plastid proton-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) from sensitive species. Plastid atpB genes from six closely related, tentoxin-sensitive or -resistant Nicotiana species differ at codon 83, according to their response to the toxin: glutamate correlated with resistance and aspartate correlated with sensitivity. The genetic relevance of this site was confirmed in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by chloroplast transformation. The alga, normally tentoxin-resistant, was rendered tentoxin-sensitive by mutagenesis of its plastid atpB gene at codon 83. Codon 83 may represent a critical site on the beta subunit that does not compete with nucleotide binding or other catalytic activities. \n\n \n Since I was involved here and there in this work I am willing to vouch for its validity so far as I know. And since the 1990s there have been quite a few other studies which confirmed these findings in critical ways. Now you may say that the information for the trait was NOT stored physically in the DNA if you choose, but the evidence certainly will not support you in this case (and I might add many thousands of other cases) and I only need one case of course to falsify your claim. I have that case.",

   "**\n \n Continued from about where I left off--\n \n \n\n True, but then again, nor is it 'necessarily so' that the traits are stored at all. Indeed, it seems pure wishful thinking to believe that they just happen to be stored and recalled with a success rate indistinguishable from the rate at which carcinogens induce other genetic changes at the same or different loci.\n\n \n **\n Not true. The viable traits we inherit, [i.e., are 'stored' non-physically, via an abstract 'code' or whatever, and which are 'recalled' developmentally, i.e., non-randomly, systematically] have a 'success rate' a gazillion times greater than \"the rate at which carcinogens induce other genetic changes at the same or different loci\"!! Where do you get this stuff--from chem?\n \n \n\n To believe that this point mutation/duplication/deletion and this point mutation/duplication/deletion were accidental, but that one, though physically indistinguishable in terms of the kind of change that occurred, 'must have been' recalled from the psychical plane because it turned out to be adaptive some way down the line - there's no science there, just the imposition of one's own emotional filter.\n\n \n **\n So now you switch in mid-paragraph from 'traits' to 'genetic mutations', implying that the one is very much the other--which is transparently false.\n \n Your logic, which says that an unintentional change in the inscribed particulars of a code [such as any one or more of the typographic errors in this post] which alters the meaning, significance, of its intended message, cannot be sensibly discerned and then logically and reasonably set apart from \n any intentional edit made in the text, without notice. But that is manifestly untrue, because we can, and do, do that all the time. \n \n Yours is simply a materialist assertion that it is impossible to discriminate between the intentional and the accidental, in all events and in all facets of existence, in any case whatsoever. Impossibvle because, according to your metaphysical assumptions, there is no, 'intentional/unintentional', 'volitional/accidental', dichotomy to begin with.\n Rather, that all events are mechanically pre-determined, for better or for worse. But here in the real world, most humans are capable of discriminating the intentional from the accidental, and to accept that duality as a real, non-illusory, fact of existence.\n \n Materialists, OTH, must deny the existence of the intentional, the volitional, the teleological; or else completely abandon their mechanical determinist metaphysic, and all that it stands for--which is, most importantly to materialists,-- its denial of anything in existence that might, under any sort of understanding, be construed as 'divine'. \"Atheism uber alles, and let common sense perception be hanged!!\"\n \n Starting from this premise, how could a materialist ever discriminate an accidental, random change in any biological code from any systematic, teleological, intentional change in that same code?\n \n But those of us who, looking at events without a materialist 'a priori' mindset, have several criteria for discriminationg the accidental from the intententional. One of the chief methods of achieving this discrimination is contextualization. Basically this is the process of seeking 'intent' from the 'meaning' signified by a part as being coherent and consistent with the overall 'meaning' of the message, and the 'intent' of that message taken as a whole, systematized/symbolic/abstract process of the communication of 'meaning' from 'sender' to 'receiver'.\n If you automatically dismiss the entire concept of 'intent' as illusory, then of course this is no good to you. Which makes me wonder how materialists justify their constant accusations of 'quote-mining', when, under their philosophy, intended messages are only illusory, since intention is illusory, and so 'context' is irrelevent?!?!\n \n \n\n Quote:\n You misunderstand. They can possess the trait, but in the absence of the environment to which it is adaptive it confers no advantage, rendering it practically impossible for us to detect the presence of the variant. We cannot individually sequence the DNA of all 1,000,000,000 cells in a chemostat to see if some of them possesses a particular allele. The best we can do is expose the population to an environment in which that allele confers an advantage, and let differential reproductive rates bring the variant to visible prominence.\n\n \n **\n Science, the study of causes and effects in the material universe, is founded upon the validation of speculation regarding 'causation' according to the 'scientific method'. The 'scientific method' depends upon cause/effect regularity in natural causal events enabling prediction of effects in future events. The scientific method does not work backwards, from present observations of observable effects to some supposed, unobservable causation. The best this can do is generate the speculation we call, 'hypothesizing'. And anybody can do that, even me. But that speculation does not get validated until the cause is specified, and then, in an experiment that is correspondingly specific, a particular effect repeatedly follows a specified cause. Failure to identify a specific cause, as you darwinists do here, is just a way to tell a 'just-so' story, no matter what your excuse. And a darwinist 'just-so' story is no better than a creationist 'just-so'\n story or anybody else's 'just-so' story.\n \n So until you can directly correlate a specific genetic cause/mutation occuring prior to a specific expressed trait to that particular trait, AND demonstrate that that genetic 'mutation' was not systematic and teleological, but, as you insist, irregular, random, anomalous and 'out of context', i.e., purely coincidental, then you are merely trying to pass off your 'just-so' story as if it were 'science', which it is not.\n \n Also, how do you know in advance which 'environment' confers that 'advantage'? Are you truly 'blind-firing', randomly seeking a 'coincidence' by throwing every conceivable 'environment' at your bacterial subject matter, or are you covering up a discernible context, a correlation, that puts the systematic and predictable [in terms of specified environment] back into the case?\n \n And as for your example, that got shot down in my earlier post, and you are no closer to validating your claim, or invalidating mine, than you have ever been.

How about first taking notice that science tries to explain observations. I think we went over this before but perhaps you missed it. I observe the positions of the planets and ask why they move as they do. All observations taken are in my past else I could not have made them. I construct a theory (as Newton and others did) and I ask is it reasonable to explain the observations I have by this theory. I make the calculations and glory be the darn numbers match up very well! Now in your world that may not be scientific, but you know that most of the participants in constructing that theory are generall thought of as having done science - Newton, Glaileo, Kepler, Brahe (the guy who supplied the observations in the beginning) and of course others.\n \n Next take a more fuzzy example. I observe a corpse with a bullet hole in the center of its forehead, I recover the bullet. I infer using science that the cause of death is being shot in the head with a gun. I am in fact working backwards in time. Is that a scientific enterprise or not? And of course I draw this inference only because of many observations to the effect that shooting someone in the center of the forehead with a gun has a significant probability of killing the person so shot.

You can only be reading this off the inside of your skull.\n \n Are cell systems involved in gene amplification? In a sense, yes: unequal crossing over is an error during cell division. The accidental severing of a section of chromosome, should it occur during a particular stage of cell division, can also result in one daughter cell going away with two copies of a gene (while the other is left with none). Were you aware of that? I ask because important little details about complex biochemistry sometimes get omitted from single-paragraph dictionary definitions. In gene amplification, no additional copy of the gene is actually made. All that happens is that during meiosis (iirc) one daughter cell happens to end up with both copies. Whoops! An analogy would be shuffling together two identical decks of cards, and then manually seperating them again against the clock.

[bold added]\n [sci-tech encyclopedia via answers.com]\n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- see also--\n \n \"gene amplification\n n.\n A cellular process characterized by the production of copies of a gene or genes to amplify the phenotype that the gene confers on the cell.\"\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n You still are not getting past the fact that the genome/genotype did not mutate randomly, [as your notion requires], \n \n \n But WW, you are still, as ever, simply asserting that the mutation was not random, despite it clearly being induced by chemical and UV carcinogens.\n\n \n **\n No, I am saying that, as per the above sources, THERE WAS NO GENE MUTATION, random or otherwise, but rather a cellular process in which the cell operated upon and altered the distribution its own genome, without mutating any gene/s [see, EAM], a phenomenon which is quite plainly, to everyone but your own good self, a systematic and regular process, and certainly no accidental, \"it just happens, that's all\", anomalous, random event, as you so dearly wish it was. \n \n \n\n You, on the other hand, have no evidence that the specific one in question was not random. You only have your baseless assumption that it 'must have been'.\n\n \n **\n You are making yourself look quite foolish, peeling. If I were you. I'd cut my losses and drop the subject.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n but that, as per EAM, gene amplification is a systemic and systematic cellular response to an environmental stimulus that, in this case, was simply passed on epigenetically from clone to clone, \n \n \n WW, according to you you can't even read the PDF; where the heck are you getting your information from? You can only be reading this off the inside of your skull.\n\n \n **\n Look up. Not way up, just up. Those are my sources. That's what gene amplication and gene duplication are. It doesn't matter what else your pdf says, so long as it says that it is talking about gene amplification, and it does, according to you.\n Where are you getting the notion that gene amplification in this case is somehow something wonderfully different from gene amplification in every other case?!?!\n \n \n\n Are cell systems involved in gene amplification? In a sense, yes:\n\n \n **\n No, not \"in a sense\". That is exactly what gene amplification is--the product of a cellular system.\n \n \n\n unequal crossing over is an error during cell division. The accidental severing of a section of chromosome, should it occur during a particular stage of cell division, can also result in one daughter cell going away with two copies of a gene (while the other is left with none). Were you aware of that? \n\n \n **\n Why would I have to be? It's an irrelevant red herring. And where do you get off just automatically assuming that such an event is 'accidental', anyway?\n \n \n\n I ask because important little details about complex biochemistry sometimes get omitted from single-paragraph dictionary definitions.\n\n \n **\n Especially when you need those irrelevent little details to blow smoke withal.\n \n \n\n In gene amplification, no additional copy of the gene is actually made. All that happens is that during meiosis (iirc) one daughter cell happens to end up with both copies. Whoops! An analogy would be shuffling together two identical decks of cards, and then manually seperating them again against the clock. Is it inconceivable to you that one deck might accidentally go away with both aces of spades? And that the chances of that happening might be increased by the introduction of energetic interference mixing the cards up while you're trying to sort them out? \n\n \n \n **\n \n Why are you so desperately trying to take the technical details of a systematic cellular process and distort them into a false picture of a random genetic mutation?\n \n \n\n More to the point, does the fact that the error occurred during what could be described as a purposeful process make the error any less random or unintentional?\n\n \n **\n Your notion of the word, 'error', does not apply here. In a systematic heuristic search process, [such as human 'brain-storming' in the search for solutions to unfamiliar problems], there is no such thing as a 'wrong answer'. So, yes, in heuristic processes, any product generated by that process is not accidental or unintentional, as it would be in a stochastic event, such as, a random genetic mutation. You really need to work on your understanding of the differences between 'processes' and 'events'.\n \n \n [quote\n Quote:\n no, it is not at all what I claimed that you wouldn't be able to find evidence for; and as to that, you still haven't found evidence for it. But thanks for the evidence for EAM in autopoiestic organisms, though. \n \n \n This is cheap bait-and-switch nonsense, WW,[/quote]\n \n **\n Like hell it is.\n \n \n\n I gave you exactly what you asked for: UV radiation demonstrably inducing a mutation that later proved adaptive to a new environment. \n\n \n **\n Are you truly so obtuse that you still believe this?\n \n \n\n Sorry, but you don't get to just thumb your nose and say 'well, that mutation wasn't random, because I say so'. \n\n \n **\n There was no genetic mutation; there was a systematic, [not random, not accidental, not irregular, not anomalous] cellular restructuring process of its genomic components, carried out as a systematic, intentional, dynamic response to being UV irradiated. The fact that this NON GENETIC MUTATION, NON-RANDOM SYSTEMATIC CELLULAR RESPONSE, coincidentally or intentionally, buffed up the cell against some other stimulus to be encountered elsewhere or elsewhen, just does not matter!! All that matters is that there is NOT, as I stipulated _there must be_, any RANDOM GENETIC MUTATION involved in this.\n \n \n \n\n Provide evidence.\n\n \n **\n Evidence for what? In case you've forgotten, and it seems that you have, the onus of proof is on you, since it is your assertion that this paper describes an example of a random genetic mutation that occurred non-adaptively prior to proving adaptive, coincidentally, in a later, unrelated environment. It simply fails to do that.\n \n It does not show that that the cellular response was not adaptive re UV radiation, as far as the cell was concerned. It does not demonstrate that this cellular response was a random, accidental, irregular and anomalous event. It does not show that this genome restructuring was not cell-directed and systematic, but was instead the simple, linear, mechanical result of genes getting wacked by incoming UV rays, like billiard balls, and just getting re-distribute, willy-nilly. \n In short, it entirely fails to qualify as a random genetic mutation.\n \n \n\n Provide a rational for it being an ADAPTIVE response to UV bombardment, \n\n \n **\n That's not my job. The only responsibility that I have here is to show that, contrary to your claim, what took place was not, by any definition, a random genetic accident. And I've literally rubbed your nose in that fact.\n \n \n\n despite it conferring no survival or reproductive advantage under UV.\n\n \n **\n That is your assumption, and one for which you have absolutely no supporting evidence to the effect that it would never under any range of conditions prove adaptive to excess amounts of UV radiation. For all you know, it could be adaptive, either negatively [as a defense against destruction], or positively, [as a means to capture radiant energy more effectively, when more is available]. The point is that you just don't know, and are talking through your hat. What I do know is that cellular processes don't occur for no good reason.",

   "As to LaMarck he was not exactly a non-materialist although he did propose vitalist components in his theory - but it did not work out. And vitalists here should take care to note his two stage process of evolution is not something which comes from outside biology!!!\n \n ==========================================\n \n \nJean-Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet, Chevalier de Lamarck (August 1, 1744 - December 28, 1829) was a French soldier, naturalist, academic and an early proponent of the idea that evolution occurred and proceeded in accordance with natural laws. Lamarck was born as the eleventh child in an impoverished noble family of soldiers in Picardie. Lamarck was forced into enrollment in a Jesuit college in Amiens, but after his father's death in 1760, Lamarck joined a company of soldiers.[1] He fought in the Pomeranian War with Prussia, and was awarded a commission for his bravery on the battlefield. At his post in Monaco, Lamarck became interested in natural history and resolved to study medicine.[2] He retired from the army after being injured in 1766, and he continued to his medicine studies. Lamarck showed a particular interest for botany, and he studied the subject under Bernard de Jussieu for nearly ten years.\n \n After publishing a respected three-volume work Flore Fran\u00e7ais, he gained membership into the French Academy of Sciences in 1779, with the help of Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. Lamarck became involved in the Jardin des Plantes and was appointed to the Chair of Botany in 1788. When the Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle was founded in 1793, Lamarck was appointed as a professor of zoology. In 1801, he published Syst\u00e8me des Animaux sans Vertebres, a major work on the classifications of invertebrates. In an 1802 publication, he became one of the first to use the term biology in its modern sense.[3][4] Lamarck continued his work as a premier authority on invertebrate zoology. In the modern era, Lamarck is remembered primarily for a theory of \"inheritance of acquired characters\", called \"soft inheritance\" or Lamarckism. However, his descriptions of soft inheritance were, in fact, reflections of the folk wisdom of the time, accepted by most natural historians (including Charles Darwin in his Origin of Species). Lamarck's contribution to evolutionary theory consisted of the first truly cohesive theory of evolution, in which an alchemical complexifying force drove organisms up a ladder of complexity, and a second environmental force adapted them to local environments through \"use and disuse\" of characteristics, differentiating them from other organisms.[5]\n",

BROAD\n \n VIENNA - Pierre Lagoda pulled a small container from his pocket and spilled the contents onto his desk. Four tiny dice rolled to a stop.\n \n \"That's what nature does,\" Dr. Lagoda said. The random results of the dice, he explained, illustrate how spontaneous mutations create the genetic diversity that drives evolution and selective breeding.\n \n He rolled the dice again. This time, he was mimicking what he and his colleagues have been doing quietly around the globe for more than a half-century - using radiation to scramble the genetic material in crops, a process that has produced valuable mutants like red grapefruit, disease-resistant cocoa and premium barley for Scotch whiskey.\n \n \"I'm doing the same thing,\" he said, still toying with the dice. \"I'm not doing anything different from what nature does. I'm not using anything that was not in the genetic material itself.\"\n \n Dr. Lagoda, the head of plant breeding and genetics at the International Atomic Energy Agency, prides himself on being a good salesman. It can be a tough act, however, given wide public fears about the dangers of radiation and the risks of genetically manipulated food. His work combines both fields but has nonetheless managed to thrive.\n \n The process leaves no residual radiation or other obvious marks of human intervention. It simply creates offspring that exhibit new characteristics.\n \n Though poorly known, radiation breeding has produced thousands of useful mutants and a sizable fraction of the world's crops, Dr. Lagoda said, including varieties of rice, wheat, barley, pears, peas, cotton, peppermint, sunflowers, peanuts, grapefruit, sesame, bananas, cassava and sorghum. The mutant wheat is used for bread and pasta and the mutant barley for beer and fine whiskey.\n \n The mutations can improve yield, quality, taste, size and resistance to disease and can help plants adapt to diverse climates and conditions.\n",

   "The notion that \"natural selection\" might organize accidents in the genome into complex, rationally interacting biological systems is one of the most bizarre theories science has ever tried to defend,\n\n \n Hello again :) I don't have as much free time as I'd like, so responding to both you and WW is going to slow things down a bit; hope you don't mind.\n \n \n Biological adaptations occur in living organisms, not their genomes. The biological system then reorganizes its genome to reflect those adaptations\n\n \n While of course I can't say for sure that this never happens (after all, I haven't examined the workings of every individual living cell), studies abound which unequivocally demonstrate adaptation not occurring in the manner you describe.\n \n In many, many cases, an adaptation critically depends upon a particular genetic mutation (eg for the synthesis or metabolism of particular chemicals), thus disallowing the possibility of organismic adaptation preceding it. In addition, mutations demonstrably occur prior to the organism in question ever encountering the environment to which the mutation confers an advantage, making it even more unlikely that the mutation represents an organismic adaptation that has been tested and judged worthy of genetic encoding.\n \n Indeed, in the face of overwhelming evidence, WW has long since abandoned the stricture of organismic adaptation always preceding genetic adaptation, instead preferring to interpret mutation as a 'heuristic' method of organismic adaptation in its own right. As I've said, it's not actually a heuristic except at the population level, since individual organisms do not perform an iterative, narrowing search and the mutations are not statistically biased towards success.\n \n Which brings us nicely back to your opening statement of incredulity as regards the 'organisational' capacity of natural selection. To illustrate the point, I'd like to ask you to consider the following regarding bacterial adaptation:\n \n As WW acknowledges, mutational adaptation is a hit-and-miss affair. Intentionally self-induced or not, there's no evidence of mutations experienced by individual organisms being biased towards success. As you would expect, the occurrence of adaptive mutations is low. Typical measured rates are 1 in 10^7 to 1 in 10^13 cell divisions in the absence of UV or chemical carcinogens.\n \n Now, imagine we take a population of a billion bacteria and somehow enforce a 'one offspring rule', in that we allow each cell to divide once and then remove one of the daughter cells, thus maintaining a stable population but effectively taking natural selection (differential reproductive success) our of the equation. Further imagine that this is taking place in an environment to which there are two potential independent mutational adaptations, each of which have been measured to occur at a rate of 1 in 10^10 cell divisions.\n \n Within, say, 10 generations, we can reasonably expect both of the adaptive mutations to have been 'found'. However, the odds of both having been found by the same lineage of bacteria are 1 in 1,000,000,000; rather worse odds than winning the lottery. \n \n Even if we ignore reversion rates and allow these one-in-ten-billion mutations to accumulate, it's going to take around a billion generations before there's a reasonable chance of the two mutations 'stacking' even once, and around one hundred billion billion generations before the majority of the population has successfully adapted. Even if we use comparatively lively e-coli bacteria, that's 3,805,175,038,051,750 years.\n \n Now, instead imagine we perform the same experiment, supplying enough nutrients to support the same size of population (one billion), but allow natural selection (differential reproductive rates) to proceed without interference. In other words, we just let the adaptive mutants enjoy their competetive advantage, overrunning the population and thus increasing the chances of the second mutation occurring to one of them.\n \n The maths are a little complex to go into here, but just such an experiment was conducted with mutations that had a measured rate of 1 in 10^11 cell divisions - that's ten times less likely than the hypothetical example above - and differential reproductive rates allowed the two mutations to stack and overrun the population in around four months.\n \n A process that would have taken two hundred thousand times the age of the universe, cut down to around four months by natural selection.

   "You darwinists have always insisted that you have sole rights to the word \"mutation\", so that whenever that word is used, then by your semantic diktat, it means an accidental change, either in content or organization, in a string of DNA molecules labelled a \"GENE\", such that the phenotypic expression of that \"GENE\" is _altered_. Not enhanced or diminished, but _ALTERED_. That is, 'mutated'.\n\n \n I think you're projecting again, this time your habit of folding philosophical implications into the meaning of words. Mutation is a change to the genome, whether it be accidental or otherwise. Gene splicing is the intentional induction of a mutation. You're getting all het up over nothing.\n \n \nNow that reality has caught up with your Humpty Dumpty semantic, you need to change your definition of 'mutation', and without a second's thought, away you go, claiming that anything that in any way, shape or form relates to a difference in a 'genome', _rather than in a 'gene'_, whether accidental or systematic, is still, 'a random genetic mutation'.\n\n \n No, WW: an alteration to the genome is still a 'genetic mutation' and always has been. The extant research into how events like chromosomal gene amplification occur amounts to rather more than a second's thought! Where 'random' comes in is in the observed pattern of occurrence and nature of mutations. If I call a mutation 'random' it is because it was one of many, many mutations occurring in the same environment, with nothing in its nature or pattern of occurrence to distinguish it.\n \n \nWell, that just a plain and obvious load of doggy doo-doo, and since you'll never admit to that fact, don't expect me to pay any attention to all the smoke you're blowing. Your smug denial and obfuscation has no logic to uphold it. So yammer on.\n\n \n WW, why are you so rude all the time?

   "\n Indeed, in the face of overwhelming evidence, WW has long since abandoned the stricture of organismic adaptation always preceding genetic adaptation, instead preferring to interpret mutation as a 'heuristic' method of organismic adaptation in its own right.\n\n \n **\n Not so. Organismic response always precedes adaptive mutation, but sometimes phenotypic adaptive mutation precedes genertic mutation, and sometimes systematic genomic adaptive mutation precedes phenotypic mutation. In this latter case the organism employs an heuristic, systematic, goal-directed response mechanism for intelligently generating possible genetic solutions to its immediate adaptation problem.\n \n \n\n As I've said, it's not actually a heuristic except at the population level, since individual organisms do not perform an iterative, narrowing search and the mutations are not statistically biased towards success.\n\n \n **\n By what logic does the fact that such iteratative, goal-directed searches require multiple generations somehow disallow it from the ranks of heuristic processes?!?! \n \n \n\n As WW acknowledges, mutational adaptation is a hit-and-miss affair. Intentionally self-induced or not, there's no evidence of mutations experienced by individual organisms being biased towards success.\n\n \n \n **\n Not true. There is very good evidence demonstrating a strong statistical bias toward adaptive rather than non-adaptive mutations in such cases. Which is to say, the individual organisms which developed adaptive genomic mutations, wrt the immediate environmental stimulus, as opposed to maladative genomic mutations wrt that same stimulus, has been repeatedly shown to be statistically non-random, i.e., non-stochastic, but rather, very much more positive than negative.\n \n \n \n Now, instead imagine we perform the same experiment, supplying enough nutrients to support the same size of population (one billion), but allow natural selection (differential reproductive rates) to proceed without interference.

And of course the necessary differential to fix a gene in the species is not very great as little as 1% differential wil suffice over many generations. Over long time periods (read many generations) the slight differential is a very very powerful effect when repeated over and over. Much like enrichment of uranium, no one stage of enrichment makes a lot of difference, but it does make a difference and at the end of perhaps a 1000 centrifuguge chain you get weapons grade U235 out of the system.\n \n breeding success mostly has to do with being in the right place at the right time and/or being selected to breed by a female, which is a decision that requires a degree of abstract reasoning and intelligence -- something materialists deny.\n \n Well yes it does and the phenotype is relevant to that especially in species which are territorial. The strongest males often hold the best territories and they compete for females. Females often are very selective about their mates and many features they recognize are indicators of physical health and nutritional status. There are a great many studies of this sort of thing in the literature. Even in humans sexual selection based on \"beauty\" tends to be selection for a well functioning partner. Symmetry of features and that sort of thing just happen to be pretty good markers of general genetic quality! Absent plastic surgery etc of course!\n \n However in by far the larger majority of cases the responses apprar to be basically hardwired rather than dependent on any form of abstract intelligence. Try it yourself. Look at a beautiful woman (or handsome man as the case may be).

   "The major tenets of the evolutionary synthesis, then, were that populations contain genetic variation[/U] that arises by random (ie. not adaptively directed) mutation and recombination; that populations evolve by changes in gene frequency brought about by random genetic drift, gene flow, and especially natural selection; that most adaptive genetic variants have individually slight phenotypic effects so that phenotypic changes are gradual (although some alleles with discrete effects may be advantageous, as in certain color polymorphisms); that diversification comes about by speciation, which normally entails the gradual evolution of reproductive isolation among populations; and that these processes, continued for sufficiently long, give rise to changes of such great magnitude as to warrant the designation of higher taxonomic levels (genera, families, and so forth).\n\n \n Noplace in that does the author make a claim that the sole deteminant of phenotype is the genotype.

   "chemist, would you say that the variable peppered moth traits are genetic in nature?...or would you say they're simply environmentally-induced re-expressions of the same gene. Some call it polyphenism. Thus, if the trait is not genetic, then what is the logic in saying the peppered moths proved Darwin's theory of natural selection?\n\n \n Sorry but to answer that one needs to know the heritability of the trait (determined empirically) or else know the exact details of the moths genome in the relevant area of the sequence.

Of course thats the original hypothesis as you know, but I don't know the current status since the problem is probably still being researched. Have you read the current literature on the subject. You will likely find the answer to your inquiry there.\n \n In any case I am sure you have better sources than I regarding the biology of bugs and insects.

Cook. 2003. \"The Rise and Fall of the Carbonaria Form of the Peppered Moth.\" Quarterly Review of Biology, 78(4):399-417.\n \nMelanism in the peppered moth was soon shown to be genetic and dominant in effect (e.g., Bowater 1914).\n\n \n From a review article by Bruce Grant, 1999, Fine-tuning the peppered moth paradigm, Evolution 53 (3): 980-984\n \n The common name derives from the typical phenotype (the \"type\" specimen) which is covered in white scales \"peppered\" with black over the body and wings. Melanic forms have conspicuously more black scales than do typicals; those uniformly covered in black are called carbonaria. Intermediates are also known; these range between the two extremes, and are collectively called insularia. The phenotypes result from multiple alleles at a single locus that approximate a dominance hierarchy with the carbonaria allele as top dominant and typical as recessive (Lees and Creed 1977). ....... Throughout this discussion melanic refers to carbonaria unless otherwise specified.\n \n .......\n \n .... in 1924 Haldane calculated the selection coefficients necessary to account for the spread of melanic peppered moths, and he also reviews the several papers by Heslop Harrison written during the 1920s that challenged a Darwinian explanation. Harrison argued from his experimental work on certain other Lepidoptera that melanism can be induced in adults by feeding larvae contaminated leaves. Other workers also exposed pupae to noxious fumes and reported darkening of the wings of the adults. All of this work was severely criticized by contemporaries who attempted to repeat the experiments, but failed to reproduce the results. Whatever the correctness of that work might be, none of it has proved relevant to peppered moths. Nevertheless, modern reviewers (e.g., Sargent et al. 1998) continue to resurrect these arguments as if they are worthy of serious consideration in this context. It certainly is true that peppered moth caterpillars (larvae) develop different colors in response to environmental stimuli (they come to match the colors of the twigs of their host plants) (Poulton 1890), but it has never been demonstrated that environmental stimuli experienced at any stage in development can induce melanism in adults. The Mendelian inheritance of the melanic forms of adult peppered moths has been repeatedly demonstrated (see Creed et al. 1980 for an analysis of published data reporting 12,569 progeny from 83 families). Clearly, the recent attempts to extend induction arguments to the evolution of melanism in peppered moths are unfounded.\n\n \n Let me restate that last bit for emphasis: 12,569 progeny from 83 families show that melanism in the adult peppered moths is genetic and is not a polyphenism.\n \n Shorter version: You've been informed about this before, on another forum.

   "Not so. Organismic response always precedes adaptive mutation, \n\n \n Come on now, WW, we've been over this and over this. Precisely how is organismic response supposed to precede adaptive mutation when we know perfectly well that the mutations themselves can occur before the organism is exposed to the environment to which they are adaptive? Your 'just in case' hypothesis doesn't hold water; why would an organism capable of self-modification put itself at a disadvantage now on the one-in-a-billion offchance that the environment will change to its advantage sometime in the future? Why wouldn't it just wait and see, and enjoy the best of both worlds?\n \n \nIn this latter case the organism employs an heuristic, systematic, goal-directed response mechanism for intelligently generating possible genetic solutions to its immediate adaptation problem.\n\n \n 'Heuristic' is false, because the search does not narrow based on feedback.\n 'Systematic' is really the point at issue, and is strongly contraindicated by the induction of higher rates of mutation, including adaptive mutations, via UV or chemical carcinogens.\n 'Goal-directed' is misleading at best, since to most readers it will imply that the organism knows or understands the problem it needs to fix. Since there are plenty of examples, eg competition in the plant kingdom, where it is impossible for the organism to have an objective (since it doesn't know what the competition is doing), the only conceivable goal is a very vague and undirected 'do better than I am now, somehow'.\n 'Intelligently generating' is false, because mutations do not show a statistical bias towards success.\n 'Immediate adaptation problem' is almost certainly incorrect, unless you're ready to concede that mutations which prove adaptive to a later environment are coincidental - effectively 'lucky misses' on the part of an organism trying to adapt to its current environment. \n \n \nBy what logic does the fact that such iteratative, goal-directed searches require multiple generations somehow disallow it from the ranks of heuristic processes?!?! \n\n \n Quite simply because the 'search' does not narrow based on feedback, not over any number of generations. Therefore it is not a heuristic, not even along a lineage. On a population level, it's a heuristic, because NS provides a filter that guides the centroid of variation.\n \n \nThere is very good evidence demonstrating a strong statistical bias toward adaptive rather than non-adaptive mutations in such cases. Which is to say, the individual organisms which developed adaptive genomic mutations, wrt the immediate environmental stimulus, as opposed to maladative genomic mutations wrt that same stimulus, has been repeatedly shown to be statistically non-random, i.e., non-stochastic, but rather, very much more positive than negative.\n\n \n No, there isn't. The vast majority of studies show no statistical bias towards success. A very few have seemed to show a bias, but upon closer review have proved flawed. I think I have a link saved on my work computer for just this occasion; I'll post it tomorrow.\n \n EDIT: Here we go. It's a PDF again, unfortunately. It collates the debunked evidence for directed evolution. Also, one of the unresolved cases it mentions has subsequently been dealt with here.\n \n \nIt is still a vacuous, meaningless tautology that amounts to nothing more <snip<\n\n \n So the accumulation of adaptive mutations isn't an important part of evolution? It would proceed just fine if the odds of them stacking were as I described in the absence of NS?\n \n Just because something is simple and obvious once it's pointed out to you, does not make it unimportant or trivial. Yes, NS is breathtakingly simple, but its ramifications are subtle.",

   "An interesting human mutation.\n \n =================================\n \n Good for Sperm, Bad for Children\n \n By Gisela Telis\n ScienceNOW Daily News\n 28 August 2007\n Cutthroat competition in the testes might explain the unexpected prevalence of a mutation that halts skull growth and fuses fingers and toes. The genetic glitch seems to give some sperm precursors an advantage by speeding their division, a new study suggests.\n \n Apert syndrome afflicts one in every 70,000 children who are born with fused bones in their heads, hands, and feet. That incidence, although low, is 100 to 1000 times higher than the average mutation rate. The fault occurs at one spot on a single gene on chromosome 10 and is linked to the father's age. Researchers first theorized that the site might be susceptible to genetic errors, a mutation \"hotspot.\" More recent studies posited that the mutation might instead confer some advantage to germline cells--sperm progenitors--in natural selection.\n \n Computational biologist Peter Calabrese of the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles developed mathematical simulations of how the mutations might arise and develop in each scenario. If the hotspot model held true, the mutant cells would appear evenly distributed throughout the testes. If the selection model proved right, mutants would appear in clusters, with few mutated cells in between. To test the scenarios, USC molecular geneticist Norman Arnheim and colleagues dissected testes from two deceased organ donors in their 50s and 60s-when men are 10 times as likely to carry and pass along the mutation as men under 30. The team compared the distribution of mutated germline cells with Calabrese's simulations. They found the mutants clustered together, just as in the selection model. The results, published online this week in PLoS Biology, suggest that the mutation makes these cells better at cloning themselves or surviving than are nonmutant germline cells. The accumulation of these mutant cells explains why the risk of Apert syndrome is higher than expected and increases with the father's age.\n \n Arnheim hopes that the results will change the way geneticists think about human mutations. \"You can have a mutation that causes a serious, detrimental condition,\" he says, \"and yet the mutation has a selective advantage.\"\n \n The findings offer the first answer to the century-old puzzle of genetic conditions linked to older fathers, like Apert syndrome and achondroplasia dwarfism, says James Crow, a geneticist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. \"It's nice to have that cleared up,\" he says. \"And it's a beautiful idea ... new and striking and remarkably interesting.\"",

Might not be a good idea considering the reviews.\n \n \nScience 9 August 2002:\n Vol. 297. no. 5583, pp. 940 - 941\n DOI: 10.1126/science.1073593\n \n EVOLUTION:\n Sour Grapes of Wrath\n A review by Bruce S. Grant\n \n Of Moths and Men Intrigue, Tragedy and the Peppered Moth\n Judith Hooper\n Fourth Estate, London, 2002. 397 pp. \u00a315.99. ISBN 1-84115-392-3.\n \n Of Moths and Men The Untold Story of Science and the Peppered Moth\n Norton, New York, 2002. 397 pp. $26.95, C$38.99. ISBN 0-393-05121-8.\n \n Mark Twain once quipped that reports of his death had been exaggerated. Recent reports exaggerate the death of industrial melanism as an exemplar of natural selection. The latest is Judith Hooper's Of Moths and Men, which promises \"the untold story of science and the peppered moth.\" What it delivers is a quasi-scientific assessment of the evidence for natural selection in the peppered moth (Biston betularia), much of which is cast in doubt by the author's relentless suspicion of fraud. This is unfortunate. Hooper is a gifted writer. In places, her prose is quite enjoyable, even brilliant. But, sadly, the book is marred by numerous factual errors and by misrepresentations of concepts and controversies.\n \n The fundamental problem is Hooper's failure to clearly distinguish the evidence for natural selection and the mechanism of selection. A dead body with a knife in its back is evidence that a murder has been committed. An inability to establish beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the leading suspect does not mean that the murder did not occur.\n \n Population geneticists define evolution as a change in allele (gene) frequency. Adult peppered moths come in a range of shades from mottled gray (pale) to jet black (melanic). We know from extensive genetic analysis that these phenotypes result from combinations of multiple alleles at a single locus. Changes in the percentages of the phenotypes in wild populations are well documented. The changes continue and are observable even now. The steady trajectory and speed of changes in allele frequencies indicate that this evolution results primarily from natural selection. J. B. S. Haldane's original calculation of a selection coefficient was estimated from the number of generations it took for the melanic phenotype to effectively replace the pale phenotype during the 19th century. More detailed records document recent changes. For example, near Liverpool, England, the melanic phenotype declined from 93 to 18% in 37 generations (one generation per year); this change is consistent with a 15% selective disadvantage to genotypes with the dominant (melanic) allele.\n \n We have amassed enormous records of changes in allele frequency in peppered moth populations that cannot be explained in the absence of natural selection. But what is the mechanism of selection? Even the answer \"we have no clue\" would not invalidate the conclusion that selection has occurred. Fortunately, the circumstances have left clues.\n \n Geographic and temporal variations in the incidence of melanism correlate with atmospheric levels of SO2 and suspended particles. (The correlations are not perfect; gene flow by migration spreads alleles, even into populations where they are deleterious.) Light reflectance from tree bark declines as suspended particles increase. Across a range of backgrounds, the pale and melanic phenotypes are differently conspicuous to the human eye. As early as 1896, J. W. Tutt suspected that birds were selectively eating conspicuous phenotypes in habitats variously modified by industrial fallout; H. B. D. Kettlewell first tested Tutt's idea in the 1950s.\n \n It is on Kettlewell and his experiments that Hooper focuses her attention. In a biography more akin to character assassination than to objective disclosure, she portrays Kettlewell as an insecure misfit so driven to please his \"boss,\" E. B. Ford, that he is suspected (by Hooper) of fudging his data. She bases her case on experimental design changes that Kettlewell himself described in his papers and on a sudden increase in the recapture rate of marked moths released in polluted woodlands. Several obvious things that Hooper left unexamined affect the size of moth catches, and her case is unconvincing. In addition, she presents it as if the very evidence for natural selection in peppered moths depends on the validity of Kettlewell's experiments. But even the evidence for bird predation does not depend on them.\n \n Fortunately, science assesses the correctness of work by testing its repeatability. Kettlewell's conclusions have been considered in eight separate field studies, of various designs, performed between 1966 and 1987. Some of the design changes--such as reducing the density of moths, randomly assigning moths to trees, altering locations on trees where moths were positioned, and positioning killed moths to control for differences in viability and dispersal--were made to correct deficiencies identified in his original experiments. L. M. Cook's regression analysis of fitness estimates from these experiments plotted against phenotype frequencies at their various locations shows the studies to be remarkably consistent (1).\n \n Other mechanisms of selection have been proposed. An inherent physiological advantage of melanic over pale phenotypes is consistent with the rise and spread of melanism, but the widespread decline in melanism that followed the Clean Air Acts obviates that interpretation. Although the possibility remains that physiological differences might be facultative (changing with conditions), so far no experimental work supports this idea. To date, only selective predation by birds is backed by experiment.\n \n Hooper's book turns bizarre when she showcases American biologist T. D. Sargent as a wounded iconoclast whose career was stultified because Kettlewell dismissed his work. She argues that Sargent is now under attack because he questions the \"classical explanation\" for industrial melanism. Hooper garbles the controversy regarding background selection by moths, and she entertains Sargent's protracted speculation about phenotypic induction. (He has offered no evidence that melanism is an induced character in adult peppered moths.) But most egregious is Sargent's assertion that studies in North America falsify the classical explanation. The history of melanism in American peppered moths--which are conspecific with Kettlewell's moths, not a separate species as Hooper indicates--closely parallels what has occurred in Britain, and melanism is correlated in like manner with levels of atmospheric pollution (2). The American studies corroborate rather than contradict the classical explanation.\n \n The case for natural selection in the evolution of melanism in peppered moths is actually much stronger today than it was during Kettlewell's time. Textbook accounts should be expanded to reflect this newer information, and they should not cite Of Moths and Men as a credible resource.\n \n References\n \n 1. L. M. Cook, Biol. J. Linn.

(So yes, non-genetic traits exist and can be selected for or against in a single generation.) However, if the effects of non-genetic traits overwhelm the effects of genetically controlled traits, then you have a situation where natural selection is not the dominant influence on what's happening. (So natural selection can't 'work off them' to produce any evolutionary change.) If most traits were environmentally determined then you couldn't build up genetic differences, and evolution wouldn't happen, at least not at all in the way we currently theorize.\n \n However, lots of traits ARE under genetic control, and we do see mutation, recombination, selection, and drift happening in nature. Biologists do test traits for genetic vs environmental control, which is easily done by some simple breeding experiments. Your contention that mutations don't cause many phenotypic traits is simply words that you've strung together without benefit of evidence to make a false assertion.\n \n A trait that is not under genetic control but which is under environmental control is one that cannot be passed on to the offspring, because what they become is determined by the environment, rather than their parentage (Peeling's exception being noted here). \n \n However, there is a large complication that favors ToE interpretations: the triggers that respond to environmental signals may very well be under genetic and even selectional control. Also, some traits are part genetic and part environmental.\n \n And for the last time, SS, enough with the assertions that adult peppered moth coloration is a polyphenism: that has long since been disproved.",

Precisely how is organismic response supposed to precede adaptive mutation when we know perfectly well that the mutations themselves can occur before the organism is exposed to the environment to which they are adaptive? \n\n \n **\n I don't have any idea where you dream up this stuff, peeling, but whether you like it or not, environmentally stimulated systematic regular cellular responses that result in genomic activities (such as gene amplifification and gene duplication) simply cannot be forced, by you or any other darwinist, to conform to any rational interpretation of the term, \"random, accidental, genetic mutation\". So for pete's sake, stop beating this dead horse and swallow the fact that your example simply does not fulfill the requirement of a random, accidental, genetic mutation which it proves coincidentally adaptive to some other environmental stimulus at a later date. That is to say, fulfills the description of evolution's mechanism as stipulated by the darwinian RMNS notion.\n \n This is exactly the same sort of stupidity that allows some darwinists to believe that Luria and Delbruck '43 is evidence for RMNS, or Lederberg and Lederberg ['54?], or any other darwinist assumption where a systematic cellular process is passed off as some version of darwinism's 'spontaneous generation' thesis.\n \n \n\n Your 'just in case' hypothesis doesn't hold water; why would an organism capable of self-modification put itself at a disadvantage now on the one-in-a-billion offchance that the environment will change to its advantage sometime in the future? Why wouldn't it just wait and see, and enjoy the best of both worlds?\n\n \n **\n It would not, and your assumption that in this case it does do so is exactly that--an unwarranted assumption. What the cellular response to UV radiation was [gene amplification] has nothing to do with anything else. The fact that that gene amplification later proved additionally adaptive to another, somewhat different stimulus [to what degree, from the cell's POV, I know not] is neither here nor there. Why can't you get that through your head!?!\n \n And your silly insinuation that cells are imbued with the same level of consciousness and capacity for rational analytical thought is just resorting to a sophist's mischaracterizion of cellular intelligence.\n \n A better question in the context would be why a reality as complex, rational, orderly, sane, and comprehensible as this one would come up with life, but then come up with a mechanism for expanding and increasing life's capacities and prop[erties [evolution], that is the darwinian notion that a life form must first be degraded accidentally by a 'random genetic mutation' that puts it \" at a disadvantage now on the one-in-a-billion offchance that the environment will change to its advantage sometime in the future\" by simple coincidence? As per your RMNS?\n \n \n\n Heuristic' is false, because the search does not narrow based on feedback.\n\n \n **\n Your assertion is false. That is what heuristic means, and that is exactly what occurs as organisms adapt themselves to unfamiliar environments, supposing that the development of novel traits would be of benefit to that organism in that , [to it], novel environment. There is absolutely no call for any new heuristic process when a stimulus/response adaptation has already been systematized into a cellular property, such as gene amplification or gene duplication, or revertant gene re-generation [as per L&D'43, etc.], nor is there, as in your case, any need for any particular organismic adjustement at all, heuristic or anything else, when an organism finds itself in a new environment for which it is already adapted. Rabbits didn't need to reawaken there heuristic abilities when they got Australia-- they were all set just the way they were, --and likewise for the cells in would-be example.\n \n \n\n 'Systematic' is really the point at issue, and is strongly contraindicated by the induction of higher rates of mutation, including adaptive mutations, via UV or chemical carcinogens.\n\n \n **\n So now you are trying to deny the accepted fact that stress stimulates a systematic, adaptive, heuristic response--increased mutation rates via reduced/eased cellular limitation of its controls of genetic mutation and repair? You are trying to turn this cellular process into the simple linear mechanical bashing and smashing of acid molecules by photons, and nothing else? Well, that just won't fly. Not in modern cellulart biology [anything after 1980].\n \n \n\n 'Goal-directed' is misleading at best, since to most readers it will imply that the organism knows or understands the problem it needs to fix.\n\n \n **\n Which happens to be the exact truth of the matter, although you insist that\n \"to know\" and \"to understand\" require that the organism do something more than directly experience the situation, which is an irrational and indefensible expectation on your part. And I very much doubt that anyone reading these posts will expect a cell, be it a bacterial cell or any other kind of cell, a eusocial organism or a multi-organ complex organism, to 'know' and 'understand' what is happening to it and what it is doing about it in the same fashion as modern medical doctor might 'know and understand' his or her own body. Not unless some darwinist prompts them to, by insisting that such anthropocentric views are right and proper in biology.\n \n \n\n Since there are plenty of examples, eg competition in the plant kingdom, where it is impossible for the organism to have an objective (since it doesn't know what the competition is doing), the only conceivable goal is a very vague and undirected 'do better than I am now, somehow'.\n\n \n **\n First true thing you've said, since it destroys the legitimacy of using the word, 'competition' in the vast majority biological cases to which darwinists dogmatically apply it. A simple striving to survive, thrive, and possible self-replicate in no way constitutes, 'competition', as darwinists, [whose biological evolution theory is founded in 18-19th century laissez-faire liberal economic theory, principally that of Malthus], would have the world believe.\n \n \n\n 'Intelligently generating' is false, because mutations do not show a statistical bias towards success.\n\n \n **\n Utterly untrue. Under these circumstances [stress-induced hyper-mutation], as per EAM,[above], it has been repeatedly demonstrated [since 1988, at Corning, by that scientist whose name escapes me] that the number of adaptive mutations outnumbers the number of of ineffectual or maladaptive mutations by a strongly significant statistical percentage.\n \n \n\n 'Immediate adaptation problem' is almost certainly incorrect, unless you're ready to concede that mutations which prove adaptive to a later environment are coincidental -effectively 'lucky misses' on the part of an organism trying to adapt to its current environment.\n\n \n **\n As already explained many times, whatever else an evolved trait is also adaptive for _after_ it has been _first_ developed by the organism in response to some immediate adaptation problem, is irrelevent to the issue of evolutionary origins. So what if a trait that is adaptive for 'this', later turns out, for whatever reason, to be additionally adaptive for 'that'??! It's entirely beside the point. Even if it is, possibly, no more than a lucky coincidence, that makes no difference.\n \n \n\n Quite simply because the 'search' does not narrow based on feedback, not over any number of generations.\n\n \n **\n In general terms, of course it does. In the particular case of your supposed example, it does not, because your example has no connection to it, nor any correlation with it. It's just a red herring.\n \n \n\n Therefore it is not a heuristic, not even along a lineage. On a population level, it's a heuristic, because NS provides a filter that guides the centroid of variation.\n\n \n **\n I don't know what a 'centroid', a geometry term also found with respect to the physics of 'masses', has to do with biology, or how \"NS\" supposedly acts as the driving dynamic force that creates such a thing within organismic variation. I suppose that you are trying to say that \"NS\" limits and condenses the amount of organismic variation found in nature. I say 'adaptation' is what does that, not 'selection'. I say that if you've got 'adaptation', then evolution doesn't need 'selection'. EAM is adaptation, so it doesn't need your \"Natural Selection\". Once an organism is adapted, it flourishes. For as long as, and to the degree that it is, maladaptive, it declines and diminishes, possibly becoming extinct. If you want to label that inevitable after-effect of failure to adapt, \"NS\", then go right ahead, but stop trying to promote it as the dynamic cause of novel complexity and variation [evolutionary origins] in biology. It just ain't so.\n \n \n\n No, there isn't. The vast majority of studies show no statistical bias towards success. A very few have seemed to show a bias, but upon closer review have proved flawed. I think I have a link saved on my work computer for just this occasion; I'll post it tomorrow.\n \n EDIT: Here we go. It's a PDF again, unfortunately. It collates the debunked evidence for directed evolution. Also, one of the unresolved cases it mentions has subsequently been dealt with here.\n\n \n **\n Haven't had time to look at these links. But I'll remind you that 'directed mutations' are not the same issue as 'adaptive mutations'.\n \n \n \n\n So the accumulation of adaptive mutations isn't an important part of evolution? It would proceed just fine if the odds of them stacking were as I described in the absence of NS?\n\n \n **\n Frankly, no, it is not. The accumulation/retention/conservation/preservation, that is to say relative rate of inheritance of traits is nothing to to with the creation/generation/origin of novel traits. The former is inheritance, the latter is evolution, and despite the false and self-serving efforts of darwinist geneticism, they are two distinct phenomena. There only connection is that inheritance needs evolution to supply it with something to work with. Evolution needs inheritance to supply it with something it can change into something newly adaptive and original. They work together without being the same thing, despite the darwinist/geneticist's self-serving proclamation that they are the same thing. \n \n \n\n Just because something is simple and obvious once it's pointed out to you, does not make it unimportant or trivial. \n\n \n **\n That depends upon context. A nail in board is nothing but simple, obvious, meaningless fact, until it is pointed out that it is, in the context of your tire, a puncture waiting to happen. In this case the context is biological science, and the simple fact that adapted organisms do better for themselves than maladapted organisms is nothing but a vacuous truism in that context. Why? Because it speaks only to an effect, a foregone conclusion, and not, as any meaningful scientific principle requires, a causal mechanism for that foregone conclusion. That is why EAM's adaptationist mechanism is science, whereas darwinism's selectionist notion is pseudo-science.\n \n \n \n\n Yes, NS is breathtakingly simple, but its ramifications are subtle.\n\n \n **\n Not simple. Simple-minded.",

In NDS many organisms which vary from each other in undirected and nonintentional ways are selected differentially by the landscape itself and the centroid of the population moves towards greater fitness on the landscape. The move is accomplished by selection not by assessment of context by the organism itself. The organisms in the population do not in NDS assess the environment and somehow find the optimum path.

   "I don't have any idea where you dream up this stuff, peeling, but whether you like it or not, environmentally stimulated systematic regular cellular responses that result in genomic activities (such as gene amplifification and gene duplication) simply cannot be forced, by you or any other darwinist, to conform to any rational interpretation of the term, \"random, accidental, genetic mutation\".\n\n \n If by the bolded text you mean the organism entering a hypermutational state, then you need to appreciate the following:\n \n 1. Beneficial mutations - or mutations that coincidentally turn out to be beneficial in a later environment - arise in the absence of hypermutational states. Their occurrence is stochastic in distribution and unrelated to any proximate stimulus. Hypermutational states can be useful in times of stress, in that they make it more likely that chancing upon a helpful mutation will happen sooner rather than later, but they are not a requirement for evolution to proceed. In short: the organismic response you're talking about is sometimes useful, but is not actually necessary and does not always happen.\n \n 2. UV or chemical carcinogens can elevate mutation rates without triggering an endogenous hypermutational state. Again, no organismic response is present or necessary.\n \n 3. Organisms from which the genes regulating hypermutational states have been excised still evolve, and still experience elevated mutation rates under UV or chemical carcinogens. Now, no organismic response is possible, and it is still not necessary.\n \n Just as the iris is a useful but not essential mechanism in an eye, hypermutational states are useful but not essential mechanisms for evolution.\n \n \nThis is exactly the same sort of stupidity \n\n \n Please don't call me stupid, WW. I would appreciate it if you would try to make your points in a more civil manner.\n \n \nIt would not, and your assumption that in this case it does do so is exactly that--an unwarranted assumption. What the cellular response to UV radiation was [gene amplification] has nothing to do with anything else. The fact that that gene amplification later proved additionally adaptive to another, somewhat different stimulus [to what degree, from the cell's POV, I know not] is neither here nor there. Why can't you get that through your head!?!\n\n \n You talk about the 'cellular response' to UV being 'gene amplification' as if that was the only mutation that occurred. It was not. It was merely the only one of many UV-induced mutations that turned out to be beneficial in a later, selective environment.\n \n Additionally, the UV elevated the existing very low rate of occurrence of that mutation, just as it elevated mutation rates across the board. How can it have been a systematic response to UV if it happens in the absence of UV?\n \n \nA better question in the context would be why a reality as complex, rational, orderly, sane, and comprehensible as this one would come up with life, but then come up with a mechanism for expanding and increasing life's capacities and prop[erties [evolution], that is the darwinian notion that a life form must first be degraded accidentally by a 'random genetic mutation' that puts it \" at a disadvantage now on the one-in-a-billion offchance that the environment will change to its advantage sometime in the future\" by simple coincidence? As per your RMNS?\n\n \n Strawman. If you're going to criticise classical evolutionary theory, at least have the courtesy to understand it first.\n \n In some cases, yes, a debilitating mutation experienced in one environment turns out to be adaptive to a later environment (eg in many cases of antibiotic resistance, where the resistance itself confers a reproductive disadvantage in the absence of the antibiotic). On the other hand, a mutation can be entirely neutral or slightly beneficial in one environment, and then greatly beneficial in another.\n \n The ToE does not disallow the occurrence of mutations within the environments to which they are adaptive. I've provided several examples of this happening in earlier posts. Hypermutational states can speed up the 'discovery' of beneficial mutations, at the expense of a correspondingly higher rate of detrimental and lethal mutations. However, they are not a requirement, and UV/chemical carcinogens can elevate mutation rates and thus hasten the 'discovery' of adaptive mutations in the absence of an organismic response. This is empirical, observable fact.\n \n \nYour assertion is false. That is what heuristic means, and that is exactly what occurs as organisms adapt themselves to unfamiliar environments, supposing that the development of novel traits would be of benefit to that organism in that , [to it], novel environment. <snip<\n\n \n I didn't understand the relevance of the rest of your post. Regardless, stochastic variation does not constitute a heuristic, even if it is intentionally induced. A lottery draw is not a heuristic for finding lottery winners.\n \n \nSo now you are trying to deny the accepted fact that stress stimulates a systematic, adaptive, heuristic response--increased mutation rates via reduced/eased cellular limitation of its controls of genetic mutation and repair?\n\n \n I refer you to my earlier points: the response mechanism you describe can be useful, but it does not always 'kick in', and evolution can and demonstrably does proceed without it. Mutation rates can be exogenously elevated without it. Are you trying to deny these empirically observed facts?\n \n \nFirst true thing you've said,\n\n \n So now perhaps you could explain precisely how observations of goal driven stochastic variation, filtered by the empirical success or failure of the organism that induces it, would differ from observations of unintentional or accidental stochastic variation, filtered by the empirical success or failure of the organism that experiences it. A different pattern of success, perhaps? A different rate of success? Please, explain how our observations of these phenomena would differ.\n \n \nUtterly untrue. Under these circumstances [stress-induced hyper-mutation], as per EAM,[above], it has been repeatedly demonstrated [since 1988, at Corning, by that scientist whose name escapes me] that the number of adaptive mutations outnumbers the number of of ineffectual or maladaptive mutations by a strongly significant statistical percentage.\n\n \n I refer you to the papers I linked earlier, which document the logical and experimental failures which led to these erroneous interpretations of results.\n \n \nSo what if a trait that is adaptive for 'this', later turns out, for whatever reason, to be additionally adaptive for 'that'??! It's entirely beside the point. Even if it is, possibly, no more than a lucky coincidence, that makes no difference.\n\n \n If it can be coincidentally adaptive to a later environment, then the fact it's adaptive to the current environment can also be a lucky coincidence. Thanks for admitting that you cannot exclude that possibility :)\n \n \nIn general terms, of course it does. In the particular case of your supposed example, it does not, because your example has no connection to it, nor any correlation with it. It's just a red herring.\n\n \n Pardon? I invite you to show me one study demonstrating a single organismic lineage performing a narrowing, heuristic mutational 'search'.\n \n (Hint: the deactivation of a hypermutational state does not count as 'narrowing', only 'slowing', because the scope of mutations experienced does not change).\n \n \nI suppose that you are trying to say that \"NS\" limits and condenses the amount of organismic variation found in nature. I say 'adaptation' is what does that, not 'selection'. I say that if you've got 'adaptation', then evolution doesn't need 'selection'. EAM is adaptation, so it doesn't need your \"Natural Selection\". \n\n \n According to you, organisms adapt via EAM. But as I've shown, if NS is taken out of the equation, the observable success rate of EAM is far too low for the organisms we see around us to have evolved in the time available. You need differential reproductive rates to create a larger pool of organisms possessing adaptive trait #1, and thus increasing the chances of one of them developing adaptive trait #2 and the two traits stacking rather than existing in parallel.\n \n \nOnce an organism is adapted, it flourishes. For as long as, and to the degree that it is, maladaptive, it declines and diminishes, possibly becoming extinct. If you want to label that inevitable after-effect of failure to adapt, \"NS\", then go right ahead, but stop trying to promote it as the dynamic cause of novel complexity and variation [evolutionary origins] in biology. It just ain't so.\n\n \n Strawman again, and this one's looking pretty moth-eaten, I have to say. We probably covered this within our first ten posts to each other. Mutation (and recombination, and environmentally induced phenotypic variation etc) is the proximate source of novelty and variation; selection is the filter that biases the accumulation of those variations towards success.\n \n \nHaven't had time to look at these links. But I'll remind you that 'directed mutations' are not the same issue as 'adaptive mutations'.\n\n \n I'm not aware of the distinction - could you explain?\n \n \nFrankly, no, it is not. The accumulation/retention/conservation/preservation, that is to say relative rate of inheritance of traits is nothing to to with the creation/generation/origin of novel traits.\n\n \n Quite true, but both are necessary to explain the genotype and phenotype of the organisms around us. Neither evolutionary hypothesis - not the ToE or EAM - can do without NS.\n \n \nThe former is inheritance, the latter is evolution, and despite the false and self-serving efforts of darwinist geneticism, they are two distinct phenomena.\n\n \n No; the combination of the two is evolution, as proven by the fact that both are needed to explain what we see around us - and isn't 'evolution' supposed to describe how living things got the way they are?\n \n \ndespite the darwinist/geneticist's self-serving proclamation that they are the same thing. \n\n \n Again with the strawmen, WW. Saying that evolution involves variation and selection - excuse me, filtering via empirical success - is not saying that the two are the same thing. Does your car have doors and wheels? Does that make them the same thing?\n \n \nWhy? Because it speaks only to an effect, a foregone conclusion, and not, as any meaningful scientific principle requires, a causal mechanism for that foregone conclusion.\n\n \n I think I see what you're trying to say, but I don't agree. Ok, NS is not like gravity where we can say 'all things fall because of gravity'. In each environment the selective influences will be different. The fact we can't find one common selective pressure does not invalidate the observation that selective pressures influence the distribution of success within a variable population. Those selective pressures can include behaviour developed by the organisms themselves to cope with their environment - how helpful is each phenotype in the pursuit of that behaviour? The general principle that selective pressures influence the direction evolution takes is a well-founded one.\n \n \nThat is why EAM's adaptationist mechanism is science, whereas darwinism's selectionist notion is pseudo-science.\n\n \n Oh deary me, no. Your demand for a single, extant motive 'force' behind evolution is entirely arbitrary, as is your choice of how to satisfy that demand. You may as well insist that I present the single mathematical axiom that leads to the emergence of the Mandlebrot set. Scoffing at me when I can't perform the impossible, and then claiming that a new and undetectable force 'Mandlebrotism' is a more scientific explanation is just embarassing. Some things have more than one cause; surely you can appreciate that.\n \n \nNot simple. Simple-minded.\n\n \n Really, WW, you do yourself no favours. Even if you're right about EAM, that doesn't make everyone else stupid. Was Newton 'simple minded' because he didn't develop relativity? Your overweening arrogance makes enduring these discussions as pleasant as eating raw garlic; could you please tone it down a bit?",

But narrowing a search space on the basis of a pre-selected, but not entirel;y defined goal, i.e., the best available outcome for a certain individual/organism, and finding it by generating and rejecting a series of options, according to the internal 'rules of the game', is an heuristic. Flipping a coin one time is a stochastic, accidental, random event. Flipping it a thousand time in order to discover a pattern is an heuristic, systematic, goal-driven process. The fact is, that all games, from chess to scrabble to poker, are heuristic, no matter the degree to which they include an element of chance, so long as they are iterated events bound by rules and directed toward a general goal called 'winning'. So long as that is the case, they are systematic, not random, i.e;, stochastic, as the simple event of a random genetic mutation, per se, is purely a matter of chance, or rolling a certain dice number is in 'Monopoly', without turning the winning Monopoly into a matter of pure chance, as per RMNS, where 'the spots on the board' [environments] would change as randomly as the rolls of the dice. One roll and you would land ond Boardwalk, except that, randomly, the Boardwalk space has suddenly become \"Go to jail, do not pass go, do not collect $200\".\n That would be the RMNS stochastic version of \"Monopoly\", and what you are appealing to here with your 'adaptive in this environment, maladaptive in that' argument. To be anything heuristic, as opposed to stochastic, something must remain stable, universal, and rule-bound. In monopoly, one of these things is the board's layout. In nature, the board's layout, the environment is not so fixed and inflexible, but very much uinstable and undependable. So to avoid total randomness, evolution requires some element that is stable, and that element is the removal of the single throw of the dice, i.e., the random genetic mutation, and replacing it with systematic, goal-dependent, genetic variation.\n \n Break time.",

   "http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2007/830/1\n \n Now there is horizoontal transfer with a vengeance. I will post the entire article because it will interest many and I would not want anyone here to miss it.\n \n \nBacteria Get Promiscuous\n \n By Benjamin Lester\n ScienceNOW Daily News\n 30 August 2007\n Microorganisms such as bacteria enjoy swapping genes, and the trades have made a big difference in how they've evolved. Now new research suggests that bacteria are also easygoing about passing genes on to more complex organisms. The findings have researchers rethinking the prevalence of interspecies gene transfer and its role in evolution; they may also change the way geneticists filter out bacterial \"contamination\" when they sequence a new genome.\n \n So-called lateral gene transfer is ubiquitous among bacteria--they can acquire antibiotic resistance by swapping genes with species that have evolved it--but transfers between bacteria and multicellular organisms were thought to be rare. Some of the few known cases involve genes from parasitic bacteria called Wolbachia, which infect 20% to 75% of insects, as well as other invertebrates. The parasitic bacteria live within their hosts' cells, including the germ cells that give rise to eggs, and in past studies scientists found its genes in the genomes of two worm and insect hosts.\n \n However, according to microbiologist Julie Dunning Hotopp of the J. Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland, common wisdom holds that these transfers are uncommon, and so genetic sequences from bacteria like Wolbachia are considered to be contamination when they're found in insect genomes. Suspecting that their treatment as contaminants was masking transfers' true frequency, Dunning Hotopp and her colleagues screened animal genetic databases for Wolbachia sequences. Reporting online 30 August in Science, the team found them in three wasp and four worm species. In the wasps, the DNA was a 96% match to each wasp's resident Wolbachia strain.\n \n Even more surprising, by resequencing genes from a tropical fruit fly called Drosophila ananassae, the team discovered that the insect was carrying nearly the entire Wolbachia genome of more than 1 million DNA base pairs on one of its chromosomes. Most of the DNA appears to be nonfunctional, but the researchers found RNA transcripts from 30 Wolbachia genes. That indicated that these genes were being transcribed, the first step toward making a working protein. To ensure that the Wolbachia sequences really come from the fly genome, the team treated the flies with antibiotics and then peered at the cells using microscopes to ensure that all Wolbachia DNA had been destroyed.\n \n \"Lateral gene transfers ... might be much more widespread than previously envisioned,\" says Takema Fukatsu, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Tokyo in Japan. Fukatsu calls the paper \"exciting\" but questions whether the Wolbachia genes are active because they didn't display any biological function. However, if future experiments confirm that expression really is occurring, he adds that it's an \"unprecedented insight\" into the process of evolution.\n \n Related sites\n \n \n",

   "Ah finally you reached something resembing an argument or conclusion.\n \n \nPicking a winner by a single draw is a stochstic event, not an heuristic.\n \n \n Yes it is.\n \n \nBut narrowing a search space on the basis of a pre-selected, but not entirel;y defined goal, i.e., the best available outcome for a certain individual/organism, and finding it by generating and rejecting a series of options, according to the internal 'rules of the game', is an heuristic.\n\n \n Yes it would be, but thats not how NATURAL SELECTION functions - there is no preselected goal - there is no entity which can set such a goal. Its different of course in the case of artificial selection where there is a goal - such as obtaining a wheat variety with better drought tolernace. Then the process IS hurestic in nature and the goal exists and its narrowed by the application of rules administered by an intelligent external entity. Not so in evolution in nature.\n \n \n Flipping a coin one time is a stochastic, accidental, random event. Flipping it a thousand time in order to discover a pattern is an heuristic, systematic, goal-driven process. \n\n \n Yep, but in such a case one has to presuppose an external entity which is seeking the knowledge and performing a directed experiment. Then its \"hurestic\" a means of discovery. But bacteria etc do not engage in discovery - they just do not have the hardware for it. And yet they evolve perfectly well without intelligence indicatiing that we are not dealing with a search for knowledge, or a goal, or a hurestic process.\n \n \nThe fact is, that all games, from chess to scrabble to poker, are heuristic, no matter the degree to which they include an element of chance, so long as they are iterated events bound by rules and directed toward a general goal called 'winning'.\n \n \n That is true. But consider what the term \"game\" necessarily implies.\n \n \nSo long as that is the case, they are systematic, not random, i.e;, stochastic, as the simple event of a random genetic mutation, per se, is purely a matter of chance, or rolling a certain dice number is in 'Monopoly', without turning the winning Monopoly into a matter of pure chance, as per RMNS, where 'the spots on the board' [environments] would change as randomly as the rolls of the dice. One roll and you would land ond Boardwalk, except that, randomly, the Boardwalk space has suddenly become \"Go to jail, do not pass go, do not collect $200\".\n\n \n But I have to point out that bacteria and plants do not play games in the sense that humans play monopoly. Players of monopoly are by implication intelligent, have goals, exercise intention. And the game is played by a hurestic process - thats obvious.\n \n \nThat would be the RMNS stochastic version of \"Monopoly\", and what you are appealing to here with your 'adaptive in this environment, maladaptive in that' argument. To be anything heuristic, as opposed to stochastic, something must remain stable, universal, and rule-bound. \n\n \n Nope there are adaptive hurestic methods. But more to the point even stochastic processes can be bounded, stable, uiversal, and rule bound. Those criteria do not serve to distinguish the two types.\n \n \nIn monopoly, one of these things is the board's layout. In nature, the board's layout, the environment is not so fixed and inflexible, but very much uinstable and undependable. So to avoid total randomness, evolution requires some element that is stable, and that element is the removal of the single throw of the dice, i.e., the random genetic mutation, and replacing it with systematic, goal-dependent, genetic variation.\n\n \n Nope its not necessary for Evoultion to be goal directed. Random variation and natural selection combined with heritability are sufficient to result in speciation and diversity among the linages arising from a common ancestor. Your fallacy here is (among others) that you seem to think that what one finds in nature is somehow the realization of a goal or purpose which drove it from the beginning. Tis not the case. What you see in nature is the outcome of the evolutionary process which is not Goal Directed. And that has to be unless you postulate (and provide some reasonably credible evidence) for some implementer of the goal, ie a creator or director. And such an external entity would have to be sufficiently intelligent to manipulate life forms at the molecular level. Do you have any candidate for this other than ourselves?",

   "Of interest to many here.\n \n \n \n \nScience 31 August 2007:\n Vol. 317. no. 5842, pp. 1227 - 1230\n \n \n DOI: 10.1126/science.1145065\n \n Prev | Table of Contents | Next\n Reports\n Strand-Biased Spreading of Mutations During Somatic Hypermutation\n Shyam Unniraman and David G. Schatz*\n \n Somatic hypermutation (SHM) is a major means by which diversity is achieved in antibody genes, and it is initiated by the deamination of cytosines to uracils in DNA by activation-induced deaminase (AID). However, the process that leads from these initiating deamination events to mutations at other residues remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that a single cytosine on the top (nontemplate) strand is sufficient to recruit AID and lead to mutations of upstream and downstream A/T residues. In contrast, the targeting of cytosines on the bottom strand by AID does not lead to substantial mutation of neighboring residues. This strand asymmetry is eliminated in mice deficient in mismatch repair, indicating that the error-prone mismatch repair machinery preferentially targets top-strand uracils in a way that promotes SHM during the antibody response.\n",

   "hi, could anybody explain to me the luria delbruck fluctuation test? I m kind of confused about the whole concept of random vs. adaptive mutation.\n thx\nOK. Bacteria from a single source were cultured in several culture tubes and allowed to grow. Plates with growth media and a phage (a virus that attacks bacteria) were then inoculated from these tubes. The plates demonstrated differences in the numbers of phage resistant cultures. If resistance had developed as a response to the presence of the phage, then there would have been approximately equal numbers of resistant cultures in each plate. There weren't. So the resistance developed by random mutation before the phage was present. These results have been confirmed by other methods and experiments.\n \n All mutations are random. Some of those mutations are harmful, many are neutral, and a few are advantageous. Advantageous mutations are said to be adaptive because they give the organism an advantage in a particular environment. However, a mutation that is adaptive in one environment, may be harmful in another. That is essentially natural selection, i.e., the differential reproductive success of organisms with advantageous characteristics in a given environment.",
