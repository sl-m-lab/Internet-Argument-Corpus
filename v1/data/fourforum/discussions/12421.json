They have the \"letters to the editor\" sections of course, but they can omit and edit them to largely obscure their meaning - I've seen it done by my (late :p) local paper.",

Liberal talk shows almost always fail because no one wants to listen to 3 hours of America bashing and politically-correct nonsense.\n \n By the way, has anyone made any progress with Obama that he's bankrupting the country and enslaving future generations in debt with his drunken-sailor spending sprees? \n \n \"Gee, honey, we're in debt big time on our budget.\"\n \n \"Yeah, let's solve it by maxing out another dozen credit cards.\"\n \n Duh...",

But then, that does take some attention off the last 8 miserable years. \n \n I think most everyone values life. . . . .even us liberals. No one wants murder or war. The difference is when life begins. Potential for life, yes. Life sustainable outside the womb, no.\n \n And I notice something else about the \"murder\" debate. No one wants to end a potential life with intervention but when the child is born into a poor environment and must live off the government, everyone turns their back. This is a paradox if nothing else. Why is that?",
