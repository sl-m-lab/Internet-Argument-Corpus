Gays are certainly treated more respectfully, and in Britain, have essentially identical rights to straights now (there may still be a couple of exceptions, e.g. on adoption, but for the most part, they're the same.) Eventually, I'm sure the last barriers will be swept away. The US seems closer to buddies such as Saudi Arabia on many social issues than it is to Europe.\n \n I must admit, I can't really see much difference between the Iranian president and George Bush.

The fact that Iran's president is a nut job doesn't actually effect your average American gay all that much in a practicle sense, the fact that Bush is a homophobe does. So the fact that Bush doesn't like a certain homophobic nut job does not all of a sudden make him a gay's best buddy, because he's still a homophobe himself. Nor, for that matter, does anyone's personal views on homosexuality effect how politically and militarily stupid it would be to try to invade Iran right now. Again, the fact that a homophobe is running Iran is not of great practical concern; the disaster that would insue from trying to invade Iran would be. Concern for strangers in other countries is a fine thing, but I'm worried about how much more damage Bush will do to America much more.",
