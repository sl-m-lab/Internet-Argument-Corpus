Why can't society just agree with the Bible's morals, even if many don't think of it as proof of God?\n\n i can only speak for the bible because its the only religious book i'm deeply familiar with. i wouldnt be surprised if other religious books share this trait but i dont know for a fact.\n \n for almost every commandment and major moral instruction in the bible, there is another passage in the bible where god instructs or encourages his followers to do the opposite. for example, instances where god commanded to kill far outnumber those where he said killing is wrong. in fact, for having mercy and restraint from slaughtering every woman, child and animal during a battle against the amalekites, saul was cursed and stripped of his position as king. abraham had an affair with his maid and abandoned her pregnant with his bastard son, yet that in no way affected the blessings god bestowed on him. solomon was probably the most notorious womanizer in the bible, yet he was the most blessed and properous. moses gave the israelites instructions to take as much jewelry from their egyptian neighboors with no intention of giving it back. this is known as stealing. jonah was defiant and rebellious to god's direct commands, yet god continued to humor him throughout his poorly executed mission. there are many examples i could cite off the top of my head, but the point is that while on the one hand the bible seems to be a good source of moral instructions, on the other hand it contradicts itself by so many examples of people being rewarded for doing otherwised and even being penalized for keeping in accordance with those very commandments",

In addition to that point is the fact that not everything presented in the Bible is moral, as Matthew just pointed out. Feindslayer would like us to simply say \"the Bible says it, so it's right.\" My point was that the Bible isn't right automatically. The bits that it got right it got right by adopting sound morals established external to the Bible, and it's gotten plenty wrong all on its own. Simply put the inclusion or exclusion of something in the Bible should really have no bearing on it's adoption as a moral standard. Just because it's written in a book, any book, does not make it correct. If you find some moral code that's repeated in the Bible and you think that's spiffy, then good for you. But if someone asks if something is moral and you say \"Well, according to the Bible...\" then you're telling them nothing really useful. Unless every line in the Bible which says \"Do X\" is correct, and we all know that's not the case, then citing the Bible as a definite authority isn't valid.",
