They did not need this show to keep their mansion. Ozzy is still singing and performing, but he does not need to to keep his family off the streets.\n \n That said, I'm not much of a fan of the show. I absolutely love Ozzy as a singer, and watching him stumble around everywhere because of a lifetime of drug use, just isn't what I want to watch for 30 minutes.",
