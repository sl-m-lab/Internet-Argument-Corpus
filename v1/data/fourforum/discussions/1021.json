   "Is it time to begin Act III of the war on terror by focusing our attention to Iran? Bush has already had us take care of Afghanistan and Iraq which were potential threats to the US and now there is a sense that there has to be a next step taken soon.\n \n Iran is suspected to be developing nuclear weapons and based on how North Korea has been able to do so while under a microscope I don't think it is too unrealistic to believe that Iran will be able to do so as well. If they were to succeed that would not be in the interest of any country other than Iran. If there is even the suspicion that this is going on then I think it makes Iran a potential to be the next on the list to get taken care of.\n \n I think it is time for Act III to begin for several reason. First of all we have to be ready to find out that Iran has become a nuclear threat. We have to be prepared to go into war mode in a short amount of time. We also have to show that we are ready for war to put pressure on Iran to back down if they are considering such a plan. They have already seen what happened in Iraq and considering the Iraqi's defeated Iran in a war not too long ago, I don't think Iran wants to see whether or not the US can take care of their army the same way we took care of Iraq's. Also I think it is important to make sure that Iran supports the war on terror. We don't want Iran to become a hiding place for terrorists in the future so by putting pressure on them now to make them back down from their nuclear program we can also put pressure on them to search out and destroy terrorists in the country.\n \n I don't think Act III will necessarily need to be another war. Assuming Iran gives in to all US and UN demands, then we will be able to determine whether or not they are developing nuclear weapons. If we find that they are not then we have both helped ourselves assess the military capabilities of Iran as well as had Iran put on notice that they cannot expect to get away with starting a nuclear weapons program. If we do find more evidence that they have gone nuclear, then it can become a political and economic game between isolated Iran and the combined might of the US and UN. If Iran chooses not to back down then and only then would war become a possibility.\n \n If Iran does have a nuclear program then they are already a threat to the countries near it. If they are supporting terrorist groups then they are a threat to the US as well as all the countries of the world. They would have the ability to destabilize the Middle East which goes against what the US and UN have been working to do lately. We cannot risk letting Iran get away with starting a nuclear weapons program as we have allowed North Korea to do.\n \n What do you think? If Bush were to say tomorrow that Iran is next on our list would you support his decision or not? When will Act III begin if it does at all? Could Bush use the threat of force against Iran as a way to boost his slumping poll numbers? Do you think that Iran has a nuclear weapons program? Do you think they have nuclear weapons? Will the US and UN unite to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power? Is war a possibility? Do you think it could possibly be a different country that will be targeted for Act III?",

   "Excellent inquiry!\n \n I think we are far from another war. I believe North Korea is more likely the next biggest problem. Their ruler is a bit mentally ill. At least Iran is controlled by a theocracy that purports some idea of human value. Their current Ayatolla(sp?) is much more liberal in his willingness to work with foreign governments\n \n NK Kim Jong Il is not willing to work with anyone. China has moved a large number of troops to it's border with NK. Since the US doesn't appear to beefing up any military presence in the region and SK has not significantly increased it's military along that border, one might think that even China is getting tired of the problem. Refugees have been fleeing across that border like a pig stuck in the jugular.\n \n I also think the next war will be diplomatic. We are likely to have a change in presidents well before any more confrontations. \n \n A second possibility would be that the US increases it's military presence in the tribal regions of Pakistan. Pakistan may not like this but will tolerate it. Other arab countries will protest. the US will maintain.",

   "It would seem as if the US isn't going to do anything at all about North Korea although I think we should be taking this a whole lot more seriously. Even the UN seems to brush off the North Korean threat as being less than the threat of a nuclear Iran.\n \n The reason I think North Korea isn't getting much attention is because Japan, South Korea, China, and Russia surrounding the country on all sides and none of them have anything to do with terrorism. Also I don't think North Korea has shown a whole lot of support for terrorism either although I wouldn't doubt they could be talking about it. I think terrorism is the word of the day and since Iran is next to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Georgia, and Saudi Arabia, I think they are seen as a place that will harbor terrorists because so many could be in the region. Nuclear weapons + terrorists isn't a good thing at all.\n \n I've heard several times now that the end result of the North Korean thing will either be them using nuclear weapons again Japan or them using them against South Korea. I haven't heard a scenario yet that had them using a nuclear weapon against Hawaii or the continental US. I guess no one thinks they have the guts to go that far or maybe they don't have the proven technology to do such a thing. Also as I stated in a different post their nuclear weapons are 1/7th the strength of our average nukes when it comes to the size of the kill zones created by the nukes. So their 5-7 nukes would equal the damage of one of ours and would be weaker than our strongest conventional weapon the MOAB and the Fuel Bomb.\n \n I'm not sure what the level of technology that Iran is running at when it comes to missiles or nukes. I'm guessing they are probably helped by the Russians and my even have secretly bought long range missiles from them at one time. The problem for Iran is that they don't have a supply of spent nuclear rods like the Koreans had and I don't think that they even have a working nuclear power plant. So it would be difficult for them to make a lot of nuclear weapons quickly. So even if we catch them with a nuke already in their possession it is likely that it would take them 9 months to a year to make another. North Korea can make about one a month right now while using their supply of spent rods. Iran would be playing a dangerous game if they were to make just one nuclear weapon because they would know that one nuke is just as good as or even worse than none. If you use that one nuke you are inviting the entire world to retaliate against you and your deterrent is now gone. I think we should look for that one nuke and catch them while they are in no position to use nuclear weapons.\n \n The North Korea issue can wait. At the very worst we will be able to cut our aid to them and blockade them with China's help. I think you are right when you say that China may be getting sick of them. China is getting to a point where they know that 20 years from now they will be a super power equal to the US and I don't think they want North Korea to screw that up for them.",

   "As far as Iranian technology, they just displayed missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads and they had a range of 800 miles. They are able to reach any location within Israel. \n \n This has the international community somewhat antsy. Justifiably so. Still, I think the iranian government is less of an unknown and therefore less dangerous. They have been known to support terrorism, however, they are willing to negotiate.

   "As far as Iranian technology, they just displayed missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads and they had a range of 800 miles.

Justifiably so. Still, I think the iranian government is less of an unknown and therefore less dangerous. They have been known to support terrorism, however, they are willing to negotiate. KJI of NK has not.\n\n \n This is true. If we pressure Iran for long enough they will probably bend to our will. I don't think they wish to be the next target nor do they want war.\n \n \nTrue NK is surrounded and their arsenal is not very threatening, but, KJI dislikes the US enough to sell weapons to anyone. There is significant evidence they were selling nuclear producing parts to Iraq.\n\n \n He may dislike the US but he has to also know that he is horribly outnumbered as far as strength goes. If he were to nuke the US we would lose maybe 50k-70k people per nuke. We already know what invasion of North Korea would be costly in lives and I don't doubt that if nukes were used against us by any source right now North Korea would be the point where we focused our rage. It might not be a nuclear campaign against them but you can bet we would have bombs dropping on every city day and night from the US, China, Russia, Japan, South Korea, and probably even the UN countries. There would be no hope for KJI to survive. He would have no where to run to and his armies would quickly begin to starve. North Korea could face a total collapse and I have no doubt that South Korea would be considered to take control of the entire peninsula after that. I don't think KJI wants to see this happen either.\n \n All in all I think KJI wants respect. He doesn't want war because he would lose quickly and badly. I don't think he wants to see South Korea take control of North Korea after the war either.",

Still I don't think you can count on avoiding a nuclear retaliation. Assuming what I've been told about EMP, perhaps a few nukes will be detonated high in the atmosphere around North Korea to take down their electronics and ability to communicate.\n \n \nIt is more likely that Kim Jong Il would sell to a terrorist that will set off a dirty bomb somewhere. This would not be a nuclear bomb but one with depleted radioactive material.\n\n \n We can track were certain nuclear material originates from and I'm pretty sure we will have a sample of the North Korean nuclear material from their plant. That will allow us to track it back to them and retaliate for their association with terrorists. You can bet this will be treated as equal to a nuclear attack straight from North Korea. They might as well get as many kills as they can with a real nuclear bomb than to waste one on a dirty nuke which will present the same attack from the US.\n \n \nSet off in an urban area it would contaminate several square miles and cost billions to clean up.\n\n \n But not as many lives will be lost as would occur if a real nuclear attack occurred. Still you can be sure that they will get theres maybe a few hours after we find out it was them. They would be foolish to do this since the death count will be lower, the costs will be lower, and the clean up will be less for the US and North Korea will still take the whole blame for the event.\n \n \nAn occurrence in south america was similar.

   "Very well, I will accept your premise that NK is already gone as you say. If the ball is in our court in Iran, what would be the next appropriate step? Please include the necessary steps to achieve that result.\n\n \n I can only give my opinion based on the limited facts that I have on this issue. First we have to ask what we are trying to achieve. What we are trying to achieve is to establish whether Iran has a nuclear weapons program or not. To do this we need access to Iran's secrets as this would be a very tightly held one if it did exist. Coming right out and asking isn't going to work so clearly we are going to have to get people into Iran to make this determination and Iran will have to cooperate.\n \n So far we already have inspectors in Iran and always have. They are the ones who are providing the evidence right now that Iran may have a nuclear weapons program. They have found circumstantial evidence such as nuclear weapons grade material in Iran. Iran has claimed that the equipment that they purchased must have already had that on there when they bought it. This provides the UN and US with enough evidence to go forward and ask for more and more in depth inspections. I believe this is the process we are stuck at right now. So the first step that has to be taken is to get the UN and/or US focused on getting Iran to cooperate with more inspections. Iran is going to resist this unless a real effort is put forth and I think an effort by the US alone isn't going to get the job done. I think the UN is going to have to take charge of this push to get Iran to open up.\n \n Beyond the first step it would depend on a number of thing such as how long the process takes, whether Iran kicks out the current inspectors like they have already threatened, if another major terrorist attack occurs, if more condemning evidence is found, and on and on. There is a lot of different things that can happen after the process really gets started but the first step is what is the most important right now. We don't want to ignore this problem and then one day pick up on radar that Iran is testing nuclear weapons. By that time it is already too late. Also right now there is a focus on Iran and we know that the US is under the command of a president who has to be taken seriously when he demands that countries both avoid terrorist activities as well as anything to do with WMDs.\n \n I really don't think that it will be long before a decision is made by someone to put a lot more pressure on Iran. I think North Korea was an eye opener and considering that Iran already deals with terrorist, everyone recognizes that they could be a very large threat if they do go nuclear. How far the UN would be willing to go if the fear is proven to be credible is the biggest question. I don't think we could afford to allow a second country to go nuclear without taking steps against them or we will just be inviting more countries to do so as well.",
