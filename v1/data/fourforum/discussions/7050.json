There was one solution that was never mentioned. If you really want to break the cycle of crime in our society, simply make having an illegitimate child illegal. Over time, this would restore the family unit.\n \n Structured families with two parents tend to make children behave.\n \n (signed)\n \n Thoughts?\n \n (I'm sorry if I've posted in the wrong forum.)",

   "Making things illegal never 100% solves the issue it simply means you're paying for more people to spend time in prison, which means your loosing tax from their potential earnings, which leaves a child/spouse financially in a difficult position which means they themselves may need benefits.\n \n Viscious circle...\n \n I mean for god sake, even in America which I presume you're from you have the death penalty in certain states and people STILL murder in spite of it...\n \n As for the family unit, well I think you or the person has way simplified the situation -- two parents doesn't always = better child it's far more complicated than that.\n \n [I'm not sure this fits in the abortion forum -- people who are married can have abortions...]",
