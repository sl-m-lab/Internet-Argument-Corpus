   "Israel needs to change. An exclusive state for people of one ethnic group has no place in the modern world. Breaches of international maritime law are a symptom of the problem, just as British concentration camps in Natal were a symptom of the faulty imperialist ideology.\n \n It makes no sense to portray Israelis as some sort of demonic force. Their actions are the logical conclusion of the founding assumptions of the state of Israel, these sort of incidents will continue while Israel remains an ethnically defined exclusivist state. This sort of bloodshed is the inevitable consequence of trying to make the world conform to their view of reality, and indeed of the demonisation of those on the opposing side. When we demonise others we fuel the violence. I can't honestly believe that the Israelis are motivated by bloodlust and an enjoyment of killing, I don't even think that they necessarily value the lives of non-Israelis less than those of Israelis, but their ideology is such that they see threats where there are none, and hostile intent in anyone who tries to challenge or modify their actions. \n \n This paranoia is understandable given the context, and the very real anti-semitism that does exist in parts of the world, but it is incredibly destructive and must be stopped. The first step to this is for the US to end military and economic support for Israel.\n \n Even if the Israeli version of events is correct, it doesn't change the fact that they illegally boarded ships in international waters, and killed some of the occupants.

It puts liberals in a bind, because it's an issue for which political correctness is on the side of conservatives.\n \n Helen Thomas agrees to bow out as commencement speaker at Walt Whitman High\n \"BETHESDA, Md. (AP) - A high school graduation speech by veteran White House reporter Helen Thomas has been canceled because of controversial remarks she made about Israel, the school's principal said in an e-mail Sunday. Thomas had been scheduled to speak at the June 14 graduation of Walt Whitman High School, but Principal Alan Goodwin wrote in the e-mail to students and parents that she was being replaced. The school in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, Md., hasn't picked a new speaker.\n \"Graduation celebrations are not the venue for divisiveness,\" Goodwin wrote.\n Thomas, a columnist for Hearst Newspapers, issued an apology on her Web site on Friday for comments that were captured on video by an interviewer for the website . On the video dated May 27, Thomas says Israelis should \"get the hell out of Palestine,\" suggesting they go to Germany, Poland or the U.S.http://www.rabbilive.com\n \"I deeply regret my comments I made last week regarding the Israelis and the Palestinians,\" Thomas wrote on her site on Friday. \"They do not reflect my heart-felt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance. May that day come soon.\"\n The national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham H. Foxman, said Sunday that Thomas' apology didn't go far enough.\n \"Her suggestion that Israelis should go back to Poland and Germany is bigoted and shows a profound ignorance of history,\" Foxman said in a statement. \"We believe Thomas needs to make a more forceful and sincere apology for the pain her remarks have caused.\"\n Thomas, 89, began her long career with the wire service United Press International in 1943, and started covering the White House in 1960, according to a biography posted on her website. She became a columnist for Hearst in 2000.\"My Way News - Helen Thomas high school speech canceled over flap \n WHCA Outraged by Helen Thomas, Considers Punishment\n Over the weekend, members of the White House Correspondents Association (WHCA) weighed in on what some members are calling \"outrageous and offensive comments\" made by 89-year-old Helen Thomas who said that the \"Jews need get the hell out of Palestine.\"\n \n Suggested responses to Thomas' gaffe ranged from a WHCA-issued statement to revocation of her White House press pass. Though some members would like to overlook this incident so as not to \"define Thomas' career by a lapse in judgment,\" it seems likely that the board will take some action.WHCA Outraged by Helen Thomas, Considers Punishment - mediabistro.com: FishbowlDC ",

What we want to prevent coming into Gaza are rockets, missiles, explosives and war materials that could be used to attack our civilians. This is an ongoing policy and it was the one that guided our action yesterday.
