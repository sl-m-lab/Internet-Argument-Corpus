BofA (BAC: 30.19, +2.70, +9.82%) won shareholder approval to acquire Countrywide for $2.5 bn on July 1. \n\n \n \nBut those profit results do not include Countrywide's massive losses. BofA did report Countrywide's results separately in its earnings release.\n \n Factor in Countrywide's $2.33 bn in losses, and BofA's profit plunges to $1.1 bn, more than a fifth of the year earlier period, missing analysts estimates by a country mile (according to my read of it, some cow-eyed analysts' estimates had factored in the CFC acquisition).\n\n \n First, Steeeve, how in the hell did they justify reporting countrywide losses completely separately? Is this one of those \"letter of the law\" things? If so, we need to change the law, add something like \"ensure that results are clear and unambiguous to the public\" to auditors responsibility because frankly this is BS. \n \n I read the earnings report when it came out and it was like \"Everything is looking pretty good, earnings are down but life is still pretty sweet\" then they toss in \"oh, and we lost another 2 billion on countrywide\".\n \n I am not sure I have any faith left in accounting at these companies. It is like the capitol one release where they say that despite the fact that corporate bankruptcies are up FORTY FIVE PERCENT, the do not expect increased defaults by corporate customers because they expect the bankruptcy courts to support full repayment to them. Are these people on freaking crack?? Over half the corporate bankruptcies this year are companies CEASING OPERATIONS. Even when a company IS just restructuring, it is not unusual for them to have at least a portion of credit card debt killed off.",

   "First, Steeeve, how in the hell did they justify reporting countrywide losses completely separately? Is this one of those \"letter of the law\" things? If so, we need to change the law, add something like \"ensure that results are clear and unambiguous to the public\" to auditors responsibility because frankly this is BS. \n It is not year end for one thing....I'm not familiar with BoA and their merger. Frankly mergers and acquisitions are accounting hell and it is anyones guess on whether one was actually done in accordance with the law. Under our accounting rules, you can have a company where no one knows who is in charge and thus no one can take the blame when it fails. In any event, I'm not aware of what went on and is no surprise. \n \n On the plus side, Bank of America and Wachovia are probably more likely to be following the rules than Citi. But this is like saying Mussolini was better than Hitler.\n \n \nI read the earnings report when it came out and it was like \"Everything is looking pretty good, earnings are down but life is still pretty sweet\" then they toss in \"oh, and we lost another 2 billion on countrywide\".\nRight, somewhere buried in the report (which is basically unaudited). I'm not a huge fan of quarterly reports because you can have magical corrections by year end. Out of the many financial statements I have read over the past year the only good ones are from Mozilla Corporation (makers of FireFox browser) and the US Federal Government financial statements issued by the GAO. \n \n I'm not even kidding either. Mozilla really discloses well.\n \n \nI am not sure I have any faith left in accounting at these companies. It is like the capitol one release where they say that despite the fact that corporate bankruptcies are up FORTY FIVE PERCENT, the do not expect increased defaults by corporate customers because they expect the bankruptcy courts to support full repayment to them. Are these people on freaking crack?? Over half the corporate bankruptcies this year are companies CEASING OPERATIONS. Even when a company IS just restructuring, it is not unusual for them to have at least a portion of credit card debt killed off.\nWho does an audit firm work for? The answer, is now, the company as opposed to the stockholders. Now, this doesn't mean the auditor can ignore GAAP but it does mean they can ignore what might be a questionable practice and accept an accounting practice so long as it technically goes with the letter of the law. Remember those SIV's that Citi had? Off the balance sheet and all of a sudden they had to bail them out...we discussed long before that ever happened that they were a risk to Citi and Citi was 100% responsible for them. So when they are barely a footnote on the financials who is that really serving? Technically it was correct but to anyone with a brain it obviously should have been reported on the balance sheet for people to see because it created a more likely than not threat to the company. Now if KPMG had said \"hey, you should really put those on the balance sheet\" then Citi would have said \"it isn't against GAAP\" and would have switched auditors if forced causing KPMG to lose a huge client.\n \n \n So there you have it...",
