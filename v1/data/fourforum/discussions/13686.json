I can name several who earned enough to retire long ago, and keep on working because they enjoy it &#8211; because they feel they still have something to contribute to society. And they know that they&#8217;ll never stop learning in the process. Thomas Sowell, Dave Ramsey, Charles Payne, Steve Forbes, many others. They know that if they decide to live the &#8220;good life&#8221; (sit around an indoor pool in their mansion staying drunk on expensive wine) the learning process will stop for them. \n \n One of the problems we have in the U.S. is that so many Obama voters (penniless trailer park and inner city dwellers) think they deserve to be on the receiving end of wealth re-distribution because people like you portray the rich as economic wizards who simply make investments and don&#8217;t really accomplish anything substantial. It&#8217;s actually very seldom the case, most rich people get that way because they work hard, have self discipline, surround themselves with the right people, and get something done that makes life better for just about everyone. \n \n \nClinton was a fiscal moderate. Bush was not a conservative by any definition. \n\n \n Clinton was president during good economic times, with a Republican congress. His spending would have been different if not for that. A person being conservative or liberal is a complete package &#8211; it&#8217;s phony to label someone as, for example, a &#8220;fiscal conservative and a social liberal&#8221;. It&#8217;s like saying he wants to spend, but not tax. The money has to come from somewhere. \n \n Bush was a conservative by several definitions. He kept the government from increasing domestically far more than any Democrat would have. &#8220;Spending&#8221; is not always liberal, it depends on what the money is being spent on. Military spending beyond a very basic level is not what liberals do. \n \n \n Obama sure as hell is not. Limbaugh is republican and goes whichever way that wind is blowing at the moment. He did not oppose Bushs trillion dollar prescription drug program (which had the net impact of making prescription drugs MORE expensive for seniors). \n\n \n It&#8217;s seldom possible to oppose a Republican act without endorsing a Democrat. Politics in the U.S. is a two way conflict. It&#8217;s amusing to hear Michael Savage ranting about Obama &#8211; he needs to be told that he helped put him in office, with all his previous ranting about Bush. \n \n \n He did not oppose the trillions spent in Iraq. \n\n \n Most conservatives didn&#8217;t, most liberals did. Again, spending is not always a liberal act. Liberal spending is almost always about domestic spending. \n \n \nThis is something you have always had trouble grasping. If you are going to try to label people as conservative or not, you have to look at their ACTIONS, not just the party that they used to raise funds to get where they are. Like so many other entertainers Limbaugh tends to follow the lead of whoever is in power which is why when Bush Sr was in power (the last truly conservative president we had) Limbaugh looked rabidly conservative. Then when Bush Jr took the white house, Limbaugh pretty much looked like a militant liberal since that is what Shrub was.\n\n \n I admit Limbaugh follows a lead &#8211; I don&#8217;t always agree with him. But I agree with him on one basic thing &#8211; that the solution to a Republican problem is never a Democrat one. I&#8217;ll take a Republican mistake (Bush&#8217;s prescription plan) to a Democrat success (complete government takeover of health care) any day. \n \n \n \nIf anything Daewoo was more critical of Bush's spending....\n\n \n That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying! Obama&#8217;s spending far outweighs Bush&#8217;s, yet he has little to say about it. A lot of liberal posters here faded away when Obama was elected. Out of contentment/satisfaction maybe? Daewoo largely faded away when Obama was elected. I've drawn a conclusion from that, when combining it with his past years of posting where liberals like Simone often agree with him on issues, and as he constantly bashes just about every prominent conservative on the national scene, as well as these forums. \n \n \nSome things Limbaugh says is conservative. Like Daewoo says, he blows in the wind. To me it is more like looking away when republicans screw up royally. A lot of \"conservatives\" are guilty with this. They think when a republican gets in there that they will for the most part be a conservative and so when they spend something they feel it was probably really needed. Sadly this is not the case. \n\n \n I disagree, I think it largely is the case, because the Republican constituency is only recently demanding more spending. Republican spending is always less than is Democrat spending. The Democrats used to have a few good people, Zell Miller, Wendell Ford, possibly Joe Lieberman. Those days are long gone.",

   "But you haven't been saying it here. If you'd have been saying it here for the last year with the same regularity that you were with Bush for the 3 or 4 years before that, who knows, you could have come to the conclusion that Bush may not have been so bad after all! Then again, maybe not in your case.\n\n \n Nope. Bush was a lying sack of monkey feces. \n \n Look at the difference in topics between then and now. Then:\n \n \"Federal budget deficit sets new record\"\n Now\n \"Is Jesus the Jewish Messiah?\"\n \n Seriously. Can you get any dumber than that?? \n \n \n \n\n That was going on every bit as much, if not more, 2, 3, 4 years ago. emoticon_confused\n\n \n No. It wasnt. the dominate forum here is now the religous forum and most of the people who are the dominate posters there are psychotic id0ts. It was NOT that way before. \n \n The reason I came back here is that an old time poster said they were going to try to make a real effort to reclaim this place from the nuts. It appears that they have given up. \n \n \n \nI can't name an economist that has specifically addressed something so far-fetched and unusual as the earning of billions of dollars in mere hours, or weeks. I can name several who earned enough to retire long ago, and keep on working because they enjoy it - because they feel they still have something to contribute to society. And they know that they'll never stop learning in the process. Thomas Sowell, Dave Ramsey, Charles Payne, Steve Forbes, many others. They know that if they decide to live the \"good life\" (sit around an indoor pool in their mansion staying drunk on expensive wine) the learning process will stop for them. \n\n \n The only person on that entire list who has NOT made their living pimping advice rather than actually DOING something is steve forbes and forbes is playing the game. He is building empires and having fun. Everybody else you list is a talking head who can not cut it DOING it, so they talk about it to people who know even less than they do. \n \n \nOne of the problems we have in the U.S. is that so many Obama voters (penniless trailer park and inner city dwellers) think they deserve to be on the receiving end of wealth re-distribution because people like you portray the rich as economic wizards who simply make investments and don't really accomplish anything substantial. It's actually very seldom the case, most rich people get that way because they work hard, have self discipline, surround themselves with the right people, and get something done that makes life better for just about everyone. \n\n \n WRONG. The #1 difference I have seen between wealthy people and uh...not so wealthy people is how much they understand about how the system works. Search back through Georgeds posts. He used to say the same thing constantly. \n \n Example....even after the sub prime mess had started people made BILLIONS of dollars shorting sub prime paper because so much of it was being held in fixed accounts (i.e your retirement account) that there were literally WEEKS to short the stuff AFTER the collapse. I did it, and without putting up any of my own money. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, did it. Did you? Why not? Do you know HOW to short a sub prime bond? Do you understand enough about sub prime bonds to know what to short? Can you arrange to finance several hundred thousand dollars in short term money for something like that?\n \n The most profitable thing I did during the financial crisis was to buy a bunch of GM preferred bonds at $0.30 on the dollar when they were not sure what was going to happen with GM. Why in the world did I do that? Because the bonds came with a convertible insurance policy from AIG. AIG had just announced they were in DEEP trouble but the government was saying \"tough\". It took about 20 minutes of googling and phone calls to figure out that if they did not bail out AIG that the entire US banking system was going to crash overnight. The only possible path of the government to take to unwind it would be to take over AIG, pay off claims at face value, and walk away. So when GM actually tanked my $0.30 on the dollar bonds were paid out at full face value and as an added bonus the government let me keep them. \n \n Marc, believe it or not, I respect you. I have you typed as the kind of guy who has worked hard his entire life and really done his best. I hate to be the one to tell you that for the most part the American dream is a pile of BS. We live in a country where 5% of the population controls 98% of the wealth. That is not because those 5% work 98% harder than everybody else. The above examples are simple example of how a guy like me who knows how to buy and sell things and knows enough to keep his mouth shut and his ears open when knowledgeable people talk can make a bundle of money without ever getting up off my dead behind. Then I get somebody like steeeve, but with a little more moral flexibility, to come in and make all those profits vanish on paper so I pay taxes on maybe 20% of the income. \n \n Hard work and dedication will get you a decent life and make you tired and disappointed. If you really want to be wealthy, you have to understand the game that is being played. \n \n \n \nClinton was president during good economic times, with a Republican congress. His spending would have been different if not for that. A person being conservative or liberal is a complete package - it's phony to label someone as, for example, a \"fiscal conservative and a social liberal\". It's like saying he wants to spend, but not tax. The money has to come from somewhere. \n \n\n \n Adn the difference between a fiscal conservative like Clinton and a fiscal Liberal like Bush is that in Clintons case the money was coming from current revenue. In Bushs case it is being stolen from your grandchildren. Buch LOVED to spend and LOVED to cut taxes. The term is \"thief\". \n \n \nBush was a conservative by several definitions. He kept the government from increasing domestically far more than any Democrat would have. \"Spending\" is not always liberal, it depends on what the money is being spent on. Military spending beyond a very basic level is not what liberals do. \n \n\n \n No, he didnt. We saw the largest expansion of government since WWII under Bushs watch. Bush also cut the military. Not only did he refuse to budget for replacement equipment that was destroyed/used up in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan....going so far that pentagon leadership felt they had to GO PUBLIC about how dangerously under equipped our military was, he also cut major military programs that the pentagon objected to.\n \n Clinton also cut military spending but it was literally in line with pentagon requests. During the Clinton era the pentagon recognized a need to transition our military from one designed (literally) to re-fight world war II to a military designed for 4th generation combat. That meant less aircraft carriers, more special forces. When Clinton was president he was repeatedly accused of \"gutting\" the military and the pentagon kept telling the American public that THEIR budget had been rubber stamped but that the transition taking place was simply cheaper than the old paradigm. \n \n When Bush got into the white house he killed those changes and started pushing the military back toward a \"refight WWII\" mentality. Then....hey...what do you know....we end up in a 4th gen war and are short special forces troops and are poorly equipped to handle it. Then in order to cover the trus cost of the war that jackass runs our ready supplies down to nothing. \n \n \n \nIt's seldom possible to oppose a Republican act without endorsing a Democrat. Politics in the U.S. is a two way conflict. It's amusing to hear Michael Savage ranting about Obama - he needs to be told that he helped put him in office, with all his previous ranting about Bush. \n\n \n Yes. It is. Believe it or not, many people identify themselves by ideology as opposed to party. Example. I am a hard right traditional conservative. You, on the other hand, are a republican, which means that you may sometimes be a conservative, or you may be more liberal than hanoi jane depending on who is wearing the \"republican\" label at the moment. \n \n \n \nMost conservatives didn't, most liberals did. Again, spending is not always a liberal act. Liberal spending is almost always about domestic spending. \n\n \n No, most REPUBLICANS didnt. I don't know a single CONSERVATIVE that did not oppose the spending on the obviously unnecessary war that even if we won would show no return on our investment whatsoever. That is what a conservative refers to as \"flushing money down the toilet\". \n \n You really need to keep those terms straight when you are trying to classify ideas as liberal or conservative. For example, I have seen you claim before that opposition to gay marriage is a conservative view. In fact, that is not true. Any actual conservative who is practicing conservative principals will tell you that there is nothing whatsoever in the constitution or in this nations history that suggests that the federal government has any power at ALL over marriage, which means it has no business being in the debate, and it is an issue for the STATES. \n \n As a REPUBLICAN you can pick and chose. You are more than welcome to despise the idea of feeding poor children while taking the ultra liberal view that the federal government should somehow control marriage. You cannot do so and claim to be a CONSERVATIVE. \n \n See the difference?",

   "I was harder on Bushs spending than I have been on Obamas. I expected Obama to spend money like a drunken sailor in a whore house. HE never put anything else forward. Bush I expected better from.\n\n \n What do you mean he never put anything else forward? Don't you remember him promising that the middle class wouldn't see their taxes go up by one thin dime? Yet the trickle down effect of his policies has clobbered the middle class, small business and has scared all employers away from hiring and investing in their businesses. All of these negatives have impacted the little guy in terms of higher costs across the board. \n \n \n That is why I hate Bush with such a passion. He betrayed us. I actually supported that scum bag. I invested time and money in his campaign. I argued in his favor. A lot of people did. How did he repay us? By making Jimmi Carter look conservative.\n\n \n Blaming Bush across the board as if he was the sole reason for the mortgage debacle just reveals your ignorance of the issues which actually contributed to it. Check out this video and you will see that the real criminals are currently in charge of guarding the hen house. http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=D2FBC202F7982688&playnext=1&playnext_from=PL&v=cMnSp4qEXNM\n \n And before you say that the republicans had a majority back in 03 and could have done something about the concerns expressed here, they didn't have a super majority as the Dems do now so it required bipartisan cooperation which never happened when the dems were the minority. They were spoilers to the max.\n \n \n Bush was the conservatives big return to the white house and instead of showing the country what good stewards conservatives could be, he botched everything he touched so badly that we lost control of congress and the next president was barack obama.\n\n \n I agree that Bush betrayed conservative principles during the last half of his second term, but not in the same areas that you apparently do. The fact is that even when the economy was booming, the leftist media claimed we were crashing, even with a 4% unemployment rate. But now, when we lost 430,000 NEW JOBS last month, the liberal media said that was good news cuz they expected to lose 470,000 new jobs. So since we lost 40,000 les jobs than expected, the recession is almost over. Forget the fact that the expected number of lost jobs was created out of whole cloth and all that actually matters is that we lost 430,000 MORE JOBS. But that's not how the Yobama media machine reports it. \n \n So this is what we are up against in the real world. According to the propaganda machine of the left, nothing the RIGHT does is good and nothing the LEFT does is wrong. Even when our economy is imploding under democratic majority control. But you are too busy buying the lies and propaganda of these leftists to objectively give credit and blame where it is due.",

   "Nope. Bush was a lying sack of monkey feces. \n\n \n Not as much as Obama. \n \n \nLook at the difference in topics between then and now. Then:\n \n \"Federal budget deficit sets new record\"\n Now\n \"Is Jesus the Jewish Messiah?\"\n \n Seriously. Can you get any dumber than that?? \n\n \n Come on - those two topics, from two different forums, aren't indicative of what's been going on here in the past several years. \n \n \nNo. It wasnt. the dominate forum here is now the religous forum and most of the people who are the dominate posters there are psychotic id0ts. It was NOT that way before. \n\n \n The actual numbers show that it's opposite of what you claim. In the economics forum, the entire years of 07 and 08 had about 25 threads started. In 09, about 45 economics threads were started. I didn't check the economic sub-forums, but they wouldn't alter the fact the the religion forum simply has not recently dominated. \n \n Looking at only the month of December in the religion forum, over the past three years, posting there has steadily decreased. In Dec. 09, 10 new threads, 381 posts total. In Dec 08, 15 threads, 483 posts total. In Dec 07, 17 threads, 1374 posts total! I'm not going to take the time to look at 3 whole years totals from the religion forum, but I know good and well that there were no major spikes there to offset what these December numbers actually show. \n \n People who are content with Obama as president aren't as interested in posting on these forums, for fear of how it will show comparisons of his administration to Bush's. They are trying to justify their lack of posting by promoting an imaginary, completely false, deterioration of 4 forums. \n \n \nThe reason I came back here is that an old time poster said they were going to try to make a real effort to reclaim this place from the nuts. It appears that they have given up. \n\n \n A lot of NUTS have left this place in the past year. One of the reasons the religion forum has slowed down is because posters like obvious_child are no longer here taunting religious people. Most of the threads in the religion forum started in 07 & 08 were started by Bush hating non religious people. It was about half and half in 09. \n \n \nThe only person on that entire list who has NOT made their living pimping advice rather than actually DOING something is steve forbes and forbes is playing the game. He is building empires and having fun. Everybody else you list is a talking head who can not cut it DOING it, so they talk about it to people who know even less than they do. \n\n \n And I'd bet Forbes is learning more, and consequently knows more, than those like georged who prop their feet up and live the good life. The implication that the most knowledgable people in economics are silent because they have theirs and therefore don't share their superior knowledge is simply false. \n \n \nWRONG. The #1 difference I have seen between wealthy people and uh...not so wealthy people is how much they understand about how the system works. Search back through Georgeds posts. He used to say the same thing constantly. \n\n \n I know he did, but my life experiences tell me that the subject of wealth isn't that simple. I'd guess there were several investors with Gillette and some other company I can't think of right now, that just lost their a$$es simply because Tiger woods crashed his car trying to get away from a golf club wielding woman. No wealthy person is immune from unpleasant economic surprises that he couldn't forsee. \n \n \nExample....even after the sub prime mess had started people made BILLIONS of dollars shorting sub prime paper because so much of it was being held in fixed accounts (i.e your retirement account) that there were literally WEEKS to short the stuff AFTER the collapse. I did it, and without putting up any of my own money. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, did it. Did you? Why not? Do you know HOW to short a sub prime bond? Do you understand enough about sub prime bonds to know what to short? Can you arrange to finance several hundred thousand dollars in short term money for something like that? \n\n \n I'm not the slighest bit interested. \n \n \nThe most profitable thing I did during the financial crisis was to buy a bunch of GM preferred bonds at $0.30 on the dollar when they were not sure what was going to happen with GM. Why in the world did I do that? Because the bonds came with a convertible insurance policy from AIG. AIG had just announced they were in DEEP trouble but the government was saying \"tough\".

So when GM actually tanked my $0.30 on the dollar bonds were paid out at full face value and as an added bonus the government let me keep them. \n\n \n So you made a lot of money at the expense of taxpayers. I'd rather make $70 an hour hauling dirt. It's given to me with a smile - it's a good feeling. Not much fun that the government takes about half that from me in licences, fees, taxes, regulations, mandatory insurance, drug testing, etc. But oh well, \"a touch of gray kinda suits me anyway\". :)\n \n [Edit; tired last night - it's actually all of my expenses that take half of my gross, not just the government. But the government is a significant percentage of it]\n \n \nMarc, believe it or not, I respect you. I have you typed as the kind of guy who has worked hard his entire life and really done his best. \n\n \n I sincerely appreciate it, but many would say I haven't done my best. I come from a white collar family - father, brothers, uncles, even grandfathers, all white collar. I started out that way, a draftsman for 5 years. Loved the drafting, but hated offices. As soon as cad-cam computers came on the scene, I could see the end of manual drafting, so I bailed, and was told in writing that I could come back if/whenever I was ready. It's expired by now I'd say, that was 1979. (Kroger food stores) If I'da stayed there I'd be retired now. But I wasn't put on earth to be retired. \n \n \nI hate to be the one to tell you that for the most part the American dream is a pile of BS. We live in a country where 5% of the population controls 98% of the wealth. That is not because those 5% work 98% harder than everybody else. The above examples are simple example of how a guy like me who knows how to buy and sell things and knows enough to keep his mouth shut and his ears open when knowledgeable people talk can make a bundle of money without ever getting up off my dead behind. Then I get somebody like steeeve, but with a little more moral flexibility, to come in and make all those profits vanish on paper so I pay taxes on maybe 20% of the income. \n\n \n You like what you do and I like what I do. Since rich people who invest in jobs that require dirt to be hauled are afraid of what Obama might do to them, and I have less of that to do, I find other things to do in my garage, that people gladly pay me for. It's the American dream to me - my \"lower middle class\" standard of living is far better than 99% of all people who have ever lived on this earth. \n \n \nHard work and dedication will get you a decent life and make you tired and disappointed. If you really want to be wealthy, you have to understand the game that is being played. \n\n \n I'm not a bit disappointed, other than dealing with too much government. Some of it I didn't have to deal with only two years ago. \n \n \nAdn the difference between a fiscal conservative like Clinton and a fiscal Liberal like Bush is that in Clintons case the money was coming from current revenue. In Bushs case it is being stolen from your grandchildren. Buch LOVED to spend and LOVED to cut taxes. The term is \"thief\". \n \n \n \n No, he didnt.

Then....hey...what do you know....we end up in a 4th gen war and are short special forces troops and are poorly equipped to handle it. Then in order to cover the trus cost of the war that jackass runs our ready supplies down to nothing. \n\n \n Yes yes, liberal talking points, the main reason Bush is (was) hated is because of his Christianity. 9/11 changed a lot of things. I'd hate to think of how a Democrat would have handled it, of what would be happening today if Saddam Hussien were still in power. \n \n \nYes. It is. Believe it or not, many people identify themselves by ideology as opposed to party. Example. I am a hard right traditional conservative. You, on the other hand, are a republican, which means that you may sometimes be a conservative, or you may be more liberal than hanoi jane depending on who is wearing the \"republican\" label at the moment. \n\n \n Yes, we've been through all this before. Your definition of conservative doesn't match with it's accepted application in politics today. Conservatives DON'T BASH Limbaugh or Thomas Sowell. They just don't do it. \n \n \nNo, most REPUBLICANS didnt. I don't know a single CONSERVATIVE that did not oppose the spending on the obviously unnecessary war that even if we won would show no return on our investment whatsoever. That is what a conservative refers to as \"flushing money down the toilet\". \n \n You really need to keep those terms straight when you are trying to classify ideas as liberal or conservative.

That is simply how it's discussed and referred to throughout the political spectrum. You confuse conservatism with godless libertarianism. Again, we've been there before, we're not going to get any further on it now than we did then. \n \n \nAs a REPUBLICAN you can pick and chose. You are more than welcome to despise the idea of feeding poor children while taking the ultra liberal view that the federal government should somehow control marriage. You cannot do so and claim to be a CONSERVATIVE. \n \n See the difference?\n\n \n I've watched you and obvious_child play these word games with conservatism for years now. Words mean things according to how they're used in a society. Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, Dave Ramsey, really are conservatives. That's how they're referred to throughout society, by those who agree with them and those who don't. You can deny that in your own little world, but that has no bearing on the actual, overall world that the rest of us live in.",

   "I had an opportunity to go to Iraq to make a \"corporate\" film for the Private Sector Development arm of the Coalition government. This was before Iraqis took over.

Helping them to create business forums, economic zones, local economic councils, chamber of commerces, etc.. \n \n Krugman writes a piece in the New York Times just blasting this group as being a bunch of Bush cronies with the sole purpose of handing out contracts to friends and personally profit from insider deals. That depiction was so inaccurate, I wonder what could be Krugman's motivation. \n \n As an economics professor from Princeton, one who appears regularly on TV and one who never went to Iraq, his ideas on this subject must have been devised from his hatred of Bush.
