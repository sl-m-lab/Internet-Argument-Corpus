   "The Oklahoma House of Representatives has passed a bill that says that a student can receive a passing grade in an Earth Science class if they say that the Flying Spaghetti Monster created the Earth an hour ago, and then planted false memories into every single living creature on Earth to make it seem like they've been around longer.\n \n Of course, that's not the intent of the bill. The intent is that a student can say the Earth is 6000 years old and still get a passing grade. The bill itself says that a student cannot be graded down if they say that what they are being taught interferes with their religious beliefs.\n \n Specifically, the bill states:\n \n \nA school district shall treat a student's voluntary expression of a religious viewpoint, if any, on an otherwise permissible subject in the same manner the district treats a student's voluntary expression of a secular or other viewpoint on an otherwise permissible subject and may not discriminate against the student based on a religious viewpoint expressed by the student on an otherwise permissible subject.\n\n \n It's the \"otherwise permissible subject\" phrase that's sticky. That can easily be interpreted as meaning tests, besides just normal classroom discussion.\n \n For a long time, I have been disquieted by the fact that many people want to give patently ridiculous ideas as much standing as reality. One problem with this is that once you open the door to fantasy, any and all flavors of it can walk on through, as in the example above. But it also elevates fantasy to the same level as reality, and that is simply wrong.\n \n I taught a few classes back when I was a grad student. If someone had answered a question on a test saying the Earth was 6000 years old, I would have marked it as incorrect. That's because - and sit down for this breaking news - that answer is wrong. The student could complain, they could take it to the dean, the president, the Supreme Court for all I care - I wouldn't have backed down. Wrong is wrong.\n \n I don't care what your religious belief is, there are some things that are simple facts. An object with mass has gravity. A lump of lithium dropped into water will create heat and hydrogen gas. An accelerating charged particle will emit radiation. These are facts. It doesn't matter what you believe: reality is that which, when you go to sleep, doesn't go away.\n \n What I find most ironic about this legislation - and there is a rich, rich field of irony to choose from - is that it was passed by conservatives, people who no doubt would rail against political correctness and relativism (for example, the bill's primary author, Sally Kern, has spoken clearly about her being against \"the gay lifestyle\" - she even compares being gay to cancer), yet this is exactly what this legislation is all about. The problem here is that they are trying to legislate relativistic reality. And that's simply wrong.\n \n And it's not like they have to go far to see what a disaster this bill will create: Texas is already in a peck o' trouble for passing a similar law.Trinixy: Creationists can't fail Earth Science: Oklahoma\n \n It is downright scary how some people insist that their religious superstitions must be treated as the same as science. If science tells you that you're wrong, and can prove it, then you're wrong.\n The earth IS NOT just over 6,000 years old, and you \"believing\" that doesn't mean you get special treatment in science classes.\n \n It's like these guys want \"special ed\" or something... emoticon_ic",

   "Incredible news out of Texas: creationists have lost a big battle to destroy science education in the Lone Star State!\n \n The State Board of Education voted on the science standards - the list of basic scientific knowledge students should have at various grade levels, like knowing that atoms are the basic building blocks of matter, the Earth goes around the Sun, and - say - evolution is the basic and most fundamental aspect upon which all of modern biology is based.\n \n Creationists on the board (and there are many) tried to water down the standards by creating a phony baloney \"strengths and weaknesses\" amendment, a totally bogus and arbitrary rule that says that teachers have to point out where a theory has faults. They did this specifically to weaken the teaching of evolution in biology classes. They don't actually care if the students get a solid education on the fact of evolution, they only care to tear down real science and replace it with Biblical literalism.\n \n And they failed. According to the fantastic science-based Texas Freedom Network, which has been live-blogging the vote, the creationist amendment lost in a 7-7 vote. They could not add the amendment without an actual victory, so the tie means the garbage amendment goes down.\n \n But before you dance in the streets, have a mind that the vote was tied 7-7. In other words, half the people on the Texas State School Board of Education thought it was fine and dandy that evolution, a foundation of modern science and shown to be fact beyond reasonable doubt, be taught as being weak and flawed.\n \n So once again, we see that creationists have lost, but we also know that they will never, ever admit defeat. Remember, their entire outlook on life is not based on reality, but dogma, and so they cannot rest, cannot stop, without shattering their whole worldview.\n \n So as always, this is not over, despite this advance. It's a victory for the students of Texas and for reality, but the war will rage on.\n \n I've said it before, and I'll say it again (and I'm not the first): the price of freedom is eternal vigilance. Stay sharp, Texas. They'll regroup. Bet on it.\n\n Breaking news: SCIENCE WINS IN TEXAS!! Barely. | Bad Astronomy | Discover Magazine\n \n Science should be taught in school.\n Not religious dogma speaking points cause they don't want to acknowledge the age of the earth or explain the existence of all those fossils.",

   "Update: This afternoon (March 27, 2009) the Texas State Board of Education approved the Science Standards as proposed. This will permanently (for 10 years) remove the \"strengths and weaknesses\" language from the standards. It became obvious that the only scientific theory the proponents of this language had in mind was the biological theory of evolution. As one witness testified, there are essentially no weaknesses to the theories of evolution as presented at the high school level. \"Strength and weakness\" discussions are possibly relevant to graduate level courses where students are engaged in real research. High school only has time to touch on the basics of the topic.",

   "If the student answers \"6000 years\" for the last question it is a wrong answer because the question does not call for their personal opinion.\nBut, of course, this is true of any test question in any science class. No test question in science ever asks for an opinion. They all ask for answers that confirm a knowledge of the science. The law is meant to intimidate teachers. But if a student expresses a religious opinion on a biology test, that opinion is actually irrelevant. The only consideration in grading the test is whether or not the correct answer was provided. The student may also give an answer based on religious mythology, but as long as the correct answer is given, the student passes. However, if a student answers all questions in a class of earth science or life science with religious mythology, that student fails. He/she isn't being penalized because he/she expressed his/her religious mythology, he/she is being penalized because he/she didn't answer the question correctly. Students are not asked to express opinions, religious or otherwise, on tests of knowledge of science. They are required to confirm that they have a grasp of the science.",
