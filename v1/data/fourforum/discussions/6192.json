   "From the conclusion of a long and well-researched Boston Globe article, here: http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2005/08/14/what_makes_people_gay/?page=1 \nStill, no matter how imperfect these studies are, when you put them all together and examine them closely, the message is clear: While post-birth development may well play a supporting role, the roots of homosexuality, at least in men, appear to be in place by the time a child is born. After spending years sifting through all the available data, British researchers Glenn Wilson and Qazi Rahman come to an even bolder conclusion in their forthcoming book Born Gay: The Psychobiology of Sex Orientation, in which they write: \"Sexual orientation is something we are born with and not `acquired' from our social environment.\"\n",
