   "Geraldine Ferraro recently claimed that Obama wouldn't even be a contender in the race if he were white. Which obviously means that he's only doing so well because he's black.\n \n Is this racist? Are these kind of comments proper? How does this reflect on the schism in the Democrat party? Should Ferraro be denounced? \n \n Is this less or more of an offense than using Obama's middle name? And what would the outcry be if a McCain supporter said something like this?",

   "Geraldine Ferraro recently claimed that Obama wouldn't even be a contender in the race if he were white. Which obviously means that he's only doing so well because he's black.\n \n Is this racist? Are these kind of comments proper? How does this reflect on the schism in the Democrat party? Should Ferraro be denounced? \n\n And she proudly stands by her remarks, because she is simply exercising her first amendment rights. Then, she even tries to turn it around and say that her comments have only become an issue because she is white? Barbara Bush was probably pretty close to correct when she declined to comment on Ferraro, but said that she is something that rhymes with the word rich...I think she later appologized an said she was sorry for calling her a \"witch\". Somehow, I don't think \"witch\" was the word she really was talking about. As far as the comments go, I say let her speak up as much as she wants, wouldn't want to violate her 1st amendment rights and all. After all, she is simply showing America how ugly and hypocritical she can be. People like her have a tendency to not only shoot themselves in the foot, but drag those around them down as well. As far as denouncing her, I really don't see the point. Who would \"denounce\" her, and what purpose would it serve? The only one I would say who should distance themselves from her publically (to save face with the voters) would be Clinton, who has stated that she is unwilling to do so...(gotta have the money and all). Personally, I think she fits in great with Hillary. Perhaps she could buck for a spot with Hill as her VP if she gets the nomination? We could probably dig Reagan back up to run with McCain as his VP candidate and whoop Clinton / Ferraro in a walk. At least Reagan wouldn't be out running around shooting his mouth off and insulting people. \n \n \nIs this less or more of an offense than using Obama's middle name? And what would the outcry be if a McCain supporter said something like this?\n\n \n Not sure what at all would be offensive about using Obama's middle name. In a country with as many problems as we have, perhaps people should warm to the idea that we really need to focus on the candidates stance on the issues, not the candidates race, religion, gender, or name.",
