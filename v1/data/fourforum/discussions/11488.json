   "The deal is that cladistics is concerned exclusively with common ancestry and not with novel derived traits. That means birds, which have evolved many novel traits not shared with reptiles, must be classified as reptiles because they share the same common ancestor with all living reptiles. Otherwise, the reptiles themselves must be divided into several smaller classes in order to allow birds to remain as a bona fide class, but the catch here is that crocodiles would then have to be reclassified as birds to distinguish them from lizards snakes and turtles. I say that it makes sense to retain some paraphyletic taxons (or taxa?) when they share enough derived traits that really set them apart from other groups within the same clade. \n \n Another classic case in point is how some biologists classify chimpanzees in the human family separate from the other apes because of sharing the same common ancestor with us which they don't share with gorillas or orangutans. Obviously, we have so many radically derived traits as humans that make this approach ridiculous. I think that linnean classification must rely on some semblance of common sense with respect to ancestral versus derived traits.",
