   "Piggybacking upon the \"Plan-B\" thread in the \"Abortion\" forum, a question has come to mind: Has the West, which was rich in Christian heritage, walked away from God and His Truths?\n\n A lack of historical and ethnographic perspective is, in my experience at least, characteristic of the religious right. They look at the things they don't like in present-day society and conclude that things have never been worse, or even as bad.\n \n \nLet's review some of the facts, shall we?\n \n 50+ million children killed in the abortuaries since the horrendous Roe v. Wade decision of 1973.\n\n I think abortions actually deal with embryos and fetuses rather than children; but that's an argument for another thread. As I understand it, since Roe vs. Wade the majority in favour of access to abortion has fluctuated around 60%. Most of your compatriots apparently do not agree that the decision was 'horrendous'.\n \n \nCorruption and unethical behavior abounding\n\n Here's where the lack of historical perspective really kicks in. I think you'd be very hard pressed to demonstrate that levels of 'corruption and unethical behaviour' were at higher levels now than they were in most societies through most of history; or even in US society through most of its history.\n \n \nDoctrinal heresy\n\n One society's or era's doctrinal heresy is another's orthodoxy...\n \n \nAttempts to \"redefine the family\"\n\n The family is a social construct. The construct currently understood in the West is not, for example, the same one that Abraham would have understood. The family has been 'redefined' throughout history as social circumstances change, and has quite different meanings in different cultures. It's the old lack of perspective again.\n \n \nand the list goes on.\n\n Does it? I got the distinct impression you'd run out of steam.",

   "I don't have too much to offer this thread but I think that like many other things, religious fervor comes and goes with dramatic cycles. I have 2 examples:\n \n 1. The Hebrews were very religious and independent several thousand years ago. Then they became very secular and started worshipping icons and what I consider to be false gods. A very dramatic event took place when all the Hebrews became enslaved by the Egyptians. The Hebrews found [their] God pretty dang quickly when all their golden idols were taken and they had to build the pyramids. Moses led them out of slavery through the grace of God and they became religious again. \n \n 2. Entering the Pax Romana, people were becoming very secular. Even though Jesus Christ was around during the Pax Romana, the society was very secular. People were very wrapped up into their material possessions. Rome fell and shortly thereafter the Dark Ages began. People's lives went to :xcensored and they started to find God again. The Church became immensely powerful as a testament to people's renewed fervor. The Church offered hope and people turned to it. (The Church carried out many atrocities but that is because they cashed in on their monopoly of hope.) \n \n I believe that we are in another cycle. People are stepping away from God because they are getting comfortable living in hedonism and self pleasure. The material finite pleasure are currently more attractive than salvation. Look at Europe. Sex, drinking, and smoking are all allowed at younger ages. Drugs are allowed. In Thailand, pedophilia is rampant. Amsterdam specifically is a hub of \"do what feels good\" thinking. Prostitution is commonplace. This mirrors other cycles. Think of the height of Rome. Prostitutes filled the streets. (Mary Magdalene for one) Powerful men would have sex with women, other men, children or even animals if the mood struck them. They had vomitoriums. They eat until they peuk and then they eat some more. Harems were a part of many government buildings.\n \n I am not saying that many great things were not accomplished during the time of Rome's Pax Romana. I am not saying that great things aren't being accomplished now. I am glad for these things. I like living comfortably. But I also know that people find God pretty darn quickly when their finite possessions are gone. In the face of suffering, slavery, sickness, and death, many people that say they renounce God or haven't tried getting closer to God find Him pretty quick.",

Caligula and his orgies, the vomitoriums, the obsession with material goods. The lack of moral guidance. I can't give too many specific examples so I won't go any farther but I haven't found or heard too many stories of Romans and their great moral deeds.\n \n \nWhat atrocities exactly did the Church commit in the Dark Ages?\n\n A few examples:\n In 777 , Charlemagne, a devout Christian, after conquering the Saxon rebels, gave them a choice between baptism and execution. When they refused to convert, he had 4500 of them beheaded in one morning. \n In 1122 Christian crusaders swept over Jerusalem and slaughtered men, women and children, 'until their horses were knee deep in blood. We then went to the church to thank the Lord for his mercy.\n In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Inquisition was born, with Christians killing Christians, during what was known as the Albigensian heresies. Hundreds of thousands of people died because their Christianity did not agree with official dogma.\n EDIT: All these were sanctioned by the Church. Charlemagne was not excommunicated for what he did. The Pope (Urban VII I think but probably wrong) ordered the Crusades. Inquisition was done in churches.\n \nDo you really believe Thailand is in Europe?\n\n No I do not.

That was why I said that.\n \n I don't really have a whole lot more to say about my point because I was merely testing the waters on what other people thought.

   "There's an interesting writer Bat Ye'or who has written a book called \"Eurabia\" in which she argues that Europe has lost it's sense of self and is becomming more and more a loser in the culture war with Islam\n\n There a brief synopsis somewhere online of that? It sounds interesting, I always assumed the culture war between the West and Fundamentalist Islam was due to the West 'walking away from God', less the christian thing and more the decadent west aspect.\n \n Far too soon in this case I think to say which is winning or losing, the lure of the slightly hedonistic lifestyle is something that will really only manifest over a generation or two. There is certainly a reason I think that deserts breed religious fanatics, its a lot easier to give up your material life when its not that great anyway.\n \n But yeah, I think the West certainly has reduced the importance placed on religion quite significantly",
