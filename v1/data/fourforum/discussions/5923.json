   "DANIEL'S VISION OF THE 'SON OF MAN'\n \n In Daniel chapter nine, starting with verse 24, the prophet Daniel gives a critical, time-sensitive prophecy concerning when the Jewish Messiah shall arrive in Jerusalem. This prophecy is known as the \"Seventy Weeks of Daniel,\" and that will likely be addressed later on. But a second vision by Daniel records another individual of similar stature approaching the throne of Almighty God.\n \n In Daniel 7:13-14 we read:\n \n \"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a\n son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the\n Ancient of Days (Jehovah God) and was led into His presence. He\n was given authority, glory, and sovereign power; all peoples,nations,\n and men of every language worshipped him. His dominion is an\n everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one\n that will never be destroyed.\"\n \n Jesus referred to Himself as the \"Son of Man\" numerous times (Mark 14:21, etc.). In Mark 14:62, Jesus was specifically asked if He was the Christ, the Son of the 'Blessed One.' Jesus replied, \"I AM (note: this was the name Jehovah revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai when Moses asked the Lord His name). And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One (note Psalm 110:1) and coming on the clouds of heaven.\"\n \n Here is that same individual spoken of in Isaiah 9:6-7 who will reign on David's throne, who will have the sovereign power of Almighty God, and whom the peoples and nations of the earth will worship. He is approaching the throne of the \"Ancient of Days,\" who is clearly Jehovah God the Father (see Daniel 7:9-10), and is about to set up his eternal kingdom. Is this not the eternal Messiah, the Son of God? If King David were to reign on this throne, would he desire that all people worship him, or would he do as he did on earth and direct the people's worship towards Almighty God? \n \n If by now there are any doubts that God will raise up a Lord (who is someone other than David) who will reign on David's throne, then the prophet Jeremiah foretells who this individual is:\n \n \"The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will raise up to\n David a righteous Branch, a King who will reign wisely, and do\n what is just and right in the land. In His days Judah will be saved\n and Israel will live in safety. This is the name by which He will be\n called: THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.\" (Jeremiah 23:5-7)\n \n Remember, in Jewish theology there can be only one Lord. Yet in the above verse the Lord God is raising up another Lord who is called, \"The Lord (Jehovah) our Righteousness.\" Certainly neither David, who committed murder and adultery, or Solomon, who sought after the idols of his many wives, nor any other Jewish King could become the \"Righteousness\" of the people. This is a divine individual, and is the same person that Isaiah and King David refer to as, \"Lord.\" Praise the Lord!",

   "THE SUN DARKENED AT NOON\n \n Circa 750 B.C.\n \n According to Amos 1:1, Amos prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah, king of Judah (767-739 B.C.), and Jeroboam, king of Israel (782-753 B.C.). The name \"Amos\" is derived from the Hebrew term meaning, \"lift a burden,\" or \"burden-bearer\" (note Isaiah 9:4, speaking of the coming Messiah as one who would carry our burdens, and also Matthew 11:28). His calling by God was to foretell of pending judgments upon a number of surrounding nations, and particularly of a coming judgment upon Israel. As is common with other Biblical prophets, along with the promise of impending judgment, God also gave Amos a glimpse of events that would soon occur in the life of the coming Messiah, though the significance of what was prophesied may or may not have been made known to Amos. And so it is in the Old Testament book of Amos that we find a prophecy that for many centuries was looked upon with wonder and curiosity:\n \n \"'In that day,' declares the Sovereign Lord, 'I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight....I will make that time like mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.'\" (Amos 8:9-10)\n \n It probably wasn't until the day of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in 32 A.D. that the prophecy of Amos took on clarity and meaning, for in Matthew 27:45 Jesus had just been nailed to the cross when the Bible records:\n \n \"From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.\"\n \n Just as the \"Star of Bethlehem\" marked the birth of Christ, so now God brought forth another celestial miracle to pronounce His death. This prophecy is one of those that is beyond the control of mortal man, and as such it dispels the theory that Christ could have manipulated events so as to make it appear that He was the Messiah. But is there any evidence that this really occurred? Did the sun go dark at noonday? In his book, Evidence That Demands a Verdict (Volume 1, pages 81-87), Josh McDowell provides the following historical evidence that what took place at Calvary was more that just fanciful mythology:\n \n Concerning the Samaritan-born historian Thallus, circa 52 A.D: (The writings of Thallus no longer exist, yet were alluded to by the historian Julius Africanus, as follows): \"Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away this darkness as an eclipse of the sun - unreasonably, as it seems to me - unreasonably, of course, because a solar eclipse could not take place at the time of a full moon, and it was at the season of the Paschal full moon that Christ died.\"\n \n Likewise, Africanus wrote concerning the writings of another first century historian by the name of Phlegon: \"....during the time of Tiberius Caesar an eclipse of the sun occurred during the full moon.\" \n \n Phlegon is also mentioned by the historian Origen in his work, \"Contra Celsum,\" book 2, sections 14, 39, and 59: \"Phlegon mentioned the eclipse that took place during the crucifixion of the Lord Christ....and this is shown by the historical account itself of Tiberius Caesar.\" Apparently at one time there were historical accounts of the strange darkness that came over the land that were kept in the official archives of Tiberius Caesar, though they are likely lost to history.\n \n Finally, the 2nd century Roman born jurist and theologian Tertullian referred to a Roman archives report of an \"unexplained darkness that took place during the reign of Tiberius Caesar, as can be seen in the archives of Pontius Pilate.\"\n \n The darkness spoken of in the book of Matthew occurred between noon and three P.M. in the afternoon (from the sixth to the ninth hours, as the Jews were noted as referring to the sixth and the ninth hours of daylight). Note that a solar eclipse will take less than an hour to complete, and a total solar eclipse lasts just a few minutes. This, coupled with the fact that a solar eclipse cannot occur during a full moon (the moon would be on the 'other' side of the earth), provides further evidence that what occurred was something other than an eclipse of the sun. Just what it was no one can say for sure, just that from recorded historical sources there was a strange darkness during the time of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. From God's perspective, it surely was a time of mourning for His only begotten son. \n \n Jesus once said, \"I am the light of the world.\" So it shouldn't be surprising that during his death there might be a time of darkness over the land. \n \n REFERENCE: McDowell, Josh.

As for the darkness.. the only evidence we have of a 'darkness' is the quoting of apologist who was refering to someone else whose works are lost . No other 'record' of a darkness is found.\n \n The book 'Evidence that demands a verdict' is a poorly written rehash of a bunch of appolistic rationalisations that fall apart under scrutiny. It does great to reinforce the beliefs of those who already believe, but does nothing to soemone who actually looks at the evidence.\n \n The term 'Son of man' was a very common phrase through out the entire Jewish scripture, means a human being. The fact that later Christians distorted it to be a title for something greater shows a misunderstanding of the social and historical setting of first century Jerusalum Jewish community.",

Phlegon was born some decades after the alleged crucifixion; the indirect reporting of his (alleged) words and those of Thallus constitutes hearsay; furthermore, hearsay by an interested party about descriptions of events to which neither of the referenced authors was an eyewitness.\n \n There was a normal solar eclipse on November 24, AD 29; this is enough to account for the Tertullian quote, given that no-one at the time had a clue as to why eclipses occurred.\n \n The silence of Seneca and Pliny the Elder, both contemporaries of the alleged events and both actively writing about natural phenomena such as eclipses, is nothing short of deafening.",

It was not written by Daniel in the 6th century b.c.e. That is why it is in 'WRITINGS' not in 'THE PROPHETS'.\n\n \n Nice try, Trebor. You need to study up on these issues, though. \n \n Was the Book of Daniel originally in the Prophetic Section of the Tenakh? \n \n \"The Book of Daniel would not be out of place in the prophetic section, Joshua, Judges and Kinds are included in the Prophets, and the translators of the Septuagint version of the Jewish Scriptures placed Daniel there also.\" Joseph D. Wilson, \"Did Daniel Write Daniel,\" page 84.\n \n \"...the present position of the Book (of Daniel) in the Hebrew Canon is not its original position. We have it on the authority of the Jewish historian Josephus that at the close of the first century A.D. the Canon of the Old Testament books was differently arranged from that which is presently accepted among the Jews; and it is also evident from the writings of the Early Fathers that a change must have been made in the arrangement of the Jewish Canon between the middle of the third and the end of the fourth century A.D.\" - Charles Boutflower, \"In and Around the Book of Daniel,\" pages 276-277.\n \n Josephus in Contra Apionem 1:8 writes, \"We have but twenty-two (books) containing the history of all time, books that are justly believed in; and of these, five are the books of Moses, which comprise the laws and earliest traditions from the creation of mankind down to his death. From the death of Moses to the reign of Artaxerxes, King of Persia, successor of Xerxes, the prophets who succeeded Moses wrote the history of the events that occurred in their own time, in thirteen books. The remaining four documents comprise hymns to God and the practical precepts to men.\" \n \n Daniel was included in those 13 books. \n \n Professor R.D. Wilson states: \"All the direct evidence, then, that precedes the year 200 A.D., supports the view that Daniel was in the earliest times among the Prophets.....Thus Origen, at A.D. 250, and Jerome, at A.D. 400, both of whom were taught by Jewish Rabbis and claim to have gathered their information from Jewish sources, put Daniel among the Prophets and separate the strictly prophetical books from those which are more properly called historical.\"  R. D. Wilson, \"Studies in the Book of Daniel,\" page 49.\n \n One other important distinction should be noted was that Daniel was not a Prophet in the classical sense associated with Isaiah, Amos, and Jeremiah - the classical sense meaning a prophet who's sole function was operating as a spiritual mediator between God and a theocratic community (Israel). Daniel had a gift of prophecy, but it was not his appointed office per se. Those books of the Prophets contained prophets whose main calling was to be a Prophet / Mediator to the people. Daniel was chiefly an administrator over the affairs of the Babylonian government, although he did also have a prophetic gift. And whereas the Torah also was not contained in the Prophetic Books, no one seriously denies that Moses was also considered a Prophet. Likewise, Daniel.",

In the form in which we have it (perhaps without the additions of 12:11, 12), the book must have been given its final form some time in the years 167-164 B.C. This dating is based upon two assumptions: first, that the authors lived at the later end of the historical surveys that characterize Daniel 7-12; and second, that prophecy is accurate only when it is given after the fact, whereas predictions about the future tend to run astray. Based upon these assumptions, the references to the desecration of the Temple and the 'abomination that makes desolate' in 8:9-12; 9:27; and 11:31 must refer to events known to the author. The best candidates for the historical referents of these events are the desecration of the Temple in Jerusalem and the erection in it of a pagan altar in the autumn of 167 B.C. by Antiochus IV Epiphanes. The inaccurate description of the end of Antiochus' reign and his death in 11:40-45, on the other hand, suggests that the author did not know of those events, which occurred late in 164 or early in 163 B.C. The roots of the hagiographa (idealizing stories) about Daniel and his friends in chaps. 1-6 may date to an earlier time, but the entire work was given its final shape in 164 B.C.\" (Harper's Bible Commentary, p. 696)\n \n\n \n Much much more at the link.",

However, this does not mean that the Book lacked the final chapter at Qumran, since Dan 12:10 is quoted in the Florilegium (4Q174) - (Dead Sea Scrolls), which explicitly tells us that 'it is written in the Book of Daniel the Prophet.' \n \n The Jewish Talmud refers to Daniel as a Prophet\n \n Hatach. Hatach is another name for the prophet Daniel. He was called Hatach (related to the Hebrew word for \"cut\") because he was \"cut down,\" demoted from his position of greatness, which he held at the courts of the previous kings (Megillah 15a). http://www.virtualpurim.org/scripts/tgij/paper/IndexPurim.asp?ArticleID=1436&Cat=Megillah\n \n Be sure to sweep all that under your dresser too, Trebor.\n\n \n Yawn, cutting and pasting, and takign things out of context again.\n \n That still does not address the vast amount of evidence that the Book of Daniel was not written by daniel.",
