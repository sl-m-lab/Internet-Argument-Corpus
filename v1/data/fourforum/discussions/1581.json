What does this say about how well the exam tests you? Why should you pay attention in class if you can be \"proficient\" with it with just some reference materials?\n \n Let me tell you about my freshman physics class I took last year in high school.\n \n \n We had a teacher who wanted you to understand and love the topic, not just memorize general formulas. He would tell people how they are missing out on amazing work with their brains relying on their calculators to do simple arithmetic instead of either estimating or doing it in your head (very true). For example not many people could estimate what 53*48 was without using a calculator (50*50=2500 a little over 2500). His tests (the few we had) were whether we had understood the topics and why these formulas worked. For the final exam he allowed us to use one full page (front and back) of formulas, notes, whatever we wanted because of the exact reasons stated by the original poster. This is a magnet class (the 100 \"best\" math-science students in the county) and many people god C's on the test with formulas and notes. (Many kids in this program will probably get grounded if they don't get straight A's) This was a true test on how well you knew the topic.",

If you understand it and use it constantly sometimes you will memorize it. And the trig functions are different from most things because they are definitions.

It would cost you time.\n \n \n\n It all works out nicely with minimal planning---and I've seen forced memorization go terribly wrong. Like the time an English teacher tried to force us to memorize a list of 60 adverbs. That was nasty, and pretty pointless.\n \n\n Ow.\n \n \n\n Agreed; a good trig teacher will have the students memorize those. But they are the exception, not the rule.\n\n Because that's the definition of them. We need to know the definition of +, -, /, log, sin, cos, tan, etc. but we don't need to memorize every theorem or trig. identity. How many of you can simplify a complex trig. equation? But we have to memorize all the identities. How many people other than mathemeticians need to know what sin(a+b) is? If we are using it in our everyday lives we can just look it up. And on a test it will take up more time just as in real life.\n \n \n Of course languages is the one exception. In english you have to be able to speak coherantly without looking up things in a dictionary, but this is just basic vocabulary. Big, complicated words you can just ask, \"what does that mean?\" and not use them yourself. And foreign language the same way. You have to \"memorize\" the words you use to speak. People don't talk and look in dictionaries at the same time.",
