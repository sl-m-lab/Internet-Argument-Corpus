   "I think it is clear for everyone that our entry into the World Trade Organization would be suitable for Russia only on condition that our government would wield efficient control levers of foreign trade, freedom in the sphere of our customs policy. This will make it possible for our country to stimulate international specialization and industrial cooperation economically. But such members of Russia's Cabinet of Ministers as Mr. Gref and Mr. Kudrin pursue extremely ruinous policy in settlement of WTO entry's conditions for Russia. They continue to agree with demands of WTO members to waive the right of Russian government, connected with state regulation of our foreign trade. These armchair critics are fighting for so-called \"free trade with the whole world\". Although they know exactly that our realization of fuel and primary goods in world markets has no problems for Russia just in current conditions. In other words our membership in WTO is not necessary for developing our foreign trade at all. On the contrary, in the case of our entry into this global trade organization we will have serious problems in the sphere of protection of our internal markets and home producers' interests because of meaningful constraints in the sphere of any control over foreign influence.",
