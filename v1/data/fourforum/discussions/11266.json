   "Wedding bells won't ring in the Kern county clerk's office for any couples - gay or straight - after June 13, local officials said Wednesday after the California Supreme Court refused to stay its decision legalizing same-sex marriage.\n \n The office will issue same-sex marriage licenses beginning June 17 as state law requires but will stop solemnizing weddings due to lack of staff and space, Auditor-Controller-County Clerk Ann Barnett announced in a news release Wednesday evening. \n \n \"Because of long-term administrative plans, budgetary reasons, and the need to increase security for elections, the Clerk's office will cease solemnizing weddings, which is discretionary on the part of the County Clerk,\" the release said. \"As done in other counties, information necessary to solemnize marriages will be made available to those acquiring licenses.\"\n \n County Counsel Bernard Barmann said he expects a \"landslide\" of same-sex couples to come forward for weddings June 17.\n \n The state Supreme Court announced Wednesday it would not stay its ruling legalizing same sex-marriage in California. Several conservative religious and legal organizations asked the court to do so until voters decide the issue via a ballot measure Nov. 4. \n \n Counties are set to issue marriage licenses to gay couples in fewer than two weeks. http://www.bakersfield.com/102/story/462592.html\n \n But wait.\n There is more...",

   "Kern County Auditor-Controller-County Clerk Ann Barnett repeatedly tried to avoid licensing and performing marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples, interviews and e-mails obtained by The Californian show.\n \n At her request, County Counsel Bernard Barmann filed a brief with the California Supreme Court opposing implementation of the May 15 ruling allowing gay marriage.\n \n She tried to resign her elected position as county clerk - while keeping her positions as auditor-controller and elections boss. \"She really wanted to get rid of it,\" Barmann said.\n \n And finally, when the ruling came down Wednesday that she had to license same-sex marriages, she decided to stop performing all weddings. That involved canceling 25 heterosexual ceremonies that had been scheduled after June 13, according to her staff.\n \n HER CHOICE\n \n Barnett, who was elected in 2006, is not required by law to perform marriage ceremonies.\n \n So when the California Supreme Court refused Wednesday to postpone legalization of gay marriage until voters decide the issue in November, Barnett's office issued a press release stating \"the County Clerk's office will not solemnize weddings after June 13, 2008. We will not have the staff or space to deal with an increase in both licenses and ceremonies.\"\n \n Barmann said he advised Barnett that she could not stop ceremonies in a discriminatory fashion.\n \n \"That would be a lawsuit before breakfast,\" he said.\n \n Right after the decision came down, Barnett's second-in-command fired off an e-mail to lawyers with gay-marriage opposition group Alliance Defense Fund seeking legal protection for Barnett if she canceled all civil marriages in the county of Kern.\n \n ....\n \n But records obtained from the clerk's office for April and May of 2008 shed some light on whether wedding ceremonies are a financial drain on the county, as the press release claims.\n \n The county clerk's office charges $30 for every ceremony it performs.\n \n In April and May the office performed 299 marriage ceremonies, according to records.\n \n That's income - over two months - of $8,970.\n \n At that rate, it appears the county brings in more than $50,000 a year from performing marriages, before costs are figured into the equation.\n \n An analysis of the pay of the county staff who perform the ceremonies puts the revenue into context.\n \n The top average hourly pay for an office services specialist - one of the classifications that conducts the weddings - is around $19.20 an hour, based on county salary charts.\n \n A marriage ceremony conducted Thursday took seven minutes to perform.\n \n Barnett's press release also stated that the county does not have the space to deal with increased ceremonies.\n \n But her office currently has two separate wedding rooms set aside for the marriage ceremonies. http://www.bakersfield.com/hourly_news/story/464269.html\n \n Two months, 299 marriage ceremonies...\n So I guess we can estimate 150 STRAIGHT couples PER MONTH this woman is inconveniencing because she doesn't want to marry gay couples. emoticon_xgood \n \n As the article mentions, she tried to give up the SPECIFIC job which would involve her with gays, but evidently she still wants the paycheck from other positions related to her current one... emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Any bets as to whether or not she gets replaced in the next election?",
