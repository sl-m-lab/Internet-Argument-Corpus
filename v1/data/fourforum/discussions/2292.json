   "One more on this topic.\n \n By the way, I absolutely dislike the existence of slavery/racism, but I happen to think Lincoln wasn't doing his job ie to follow and defend the Constitution. \n \n Some interesting facts:\n \n *No sooner had Congress assembled in 1861 than the high tariff was passed into law and signed by Lincoln. The Morrill Tariff, as it was called, was the highest tariff in U.S. history. It doubled the rates of the 1857 tariff to about 47 percent of the value of the imported products. This was Lincoln's big victory. His supporters were jubiliant. He had fulfilled his campaign and IOUs to the Northern industrialists. By this act, he had closed the door for any reconciliation with the South. In his inaugural address he had also committed himself to collect customs in the South even if there were a secession. With slavery, he was conciliatory; with the import taxes, he was threatening. Fort Sumter was at the entrance to the Charleston Harbor, filled with federal troops to support U.S. Customs officers. It wasn't too difficult for angry South Carolinians to fire the first shot.\n \n *The North and South struggled over trade, with all Northern businesspeople threatened by extremely low import taxation in the South that could bring economic ruin to trade and commerce in the North...the North did not go to war to free the slaves, and the South did not secede because of a trigger-happy antislavery crusader in the White House.\n \n *There were literally hundreds of newspapers and many prominent politicians in the North who opposed Lincoln's war, which also contradicts Gunderson's claim about how devoted Northerners in particular were to the Union. Lincoln illegally suspended the writ of habeas corpus and had his military arrest literally tens of thousands of these people. There were also tens of thousands of deserters in the Union army.\n \n *The National Currency Act of 1862 established central banking and fiat currency; massive subsidies were given to railroads, the steamship industry, and hundreds of other rent-seeking businesses; tariffs were increased threefold and remained high for decades; an internal revenue buracracy was created; and the federal government was massively centralized\n \n *After the War, the federal government completed its program of ethnic cleansing by killing off most of the Plains Indians and putting the survivors on reservations where\" [as Gen. William Sherman said], 'they can be watched'. By 1890 Henry Clay's 'American System' had finally been realized\n \n *Federal import tax laws were, in [Sen. John C.] Calhoun's view, class legislation against the South. Heavy taxation on the South raised funds that were spent in the North. This was unfair. Calhoun argued further that high import taxes forced Southerners to pay either excessive prices for Northern goods or excessive taxes... The first rebellion in the South over high import taxes came in 1832. A convention was called in South Carolina to nullify the new federal import duties. The duties were declared unconstitutional, and the governor was authorized to resist any attempt at enforcement by the national government. Andrew Jackson reacted strongly and it looked as if a civil war was in the making. Cool heads prevailed and a compromise was worked out. The tariff (import taxes) was to be reduced over the next few years to levels South Carolina would tolerate. This was the great Compromise of 1833.\n \n *Secession by the South was a reaction against Lincoln's high-tax policy. In 1861 the slave issue was not critical. Lincoln and the Congress gave unequivocal assurance that slavery in the South would be respected, yet the South would not budge from its secessionist plans. The leaders of the South believed secession would attract trade to Charleston, Savannah, and new Orleans, replacing Boston, New York, and Philadelphia as the chief trading ports of America, primarily because of low taxes. This was the pot of gold behind secessionist dreams\n \n * Abraham Lincoln strongly believed in an income tax, and when an opponent criticized it during the 1864 election campaign, Adams explained, 'Lincoln was so upset...that he had this Democratic candidate arrested and tried before a military court in Ohio for the trumped-up charge of expressing treasonable sentiments.\n \n Note: This is similiar to sending John Edwards out the country, because he disagrees with you.\n \n Lincoln personally signed the order banishing him from the country, notwithstanding the advice of his Attorney General that Lincoln was depriving an innocent man of his constitutional rights (free speech)'.",

   "I can give my speculations, though of course as with most things there were many complex and interrelated reasons for the outcome of the articles.\n \n The first problem was inter-economic warfare between the states. As the federal government had no power to regulate interstate commerce, states often levied tariffs and taxes on each other's goods.

   "I can give my speculations, though of course as with most things there were many complex and interrelated reasons for the outcome of the articles.\n\n \n I tend to believe that they were thrown away too quickly, and neither compact is perfect in my eyes. \n \n \n \nThe first problem was inter-economic warfare between the states. As the federal government had no power to regulate interstate commerce, states often levied tariffs and taxes on each other's goods. This might have been the number one cause for adopting the constitution, and its certainly the root of the inter-state commerce clause which causes modern conservatives so much grief!\n\n \n I believe this happened also during the Constitution, but it was a federal issue; both in the 1830's (the Great Comprise), and right before the Civil War--which some consider the cause. I tend to think these dynamics of the compact were overstated, and with due time could have been corrected.\n \n \nThe second problem is the utter impotence of the federal government. I would say how they couldn't tax and how they had to request all funding from the states (requests that were often ignored), but I doubt that you'd think those were awful tragedies.\n\n \n Even afterwards they were slightly limited. I would say they weren't given enough in the Conferation, but the pandora box was left open in the Constitution.\n \n \n \n However, on the one issue where it was almost universally agreed that the federal government should have primacy (its raison d'etre perhaps), foreign affairs, the feds also had virtually no power. When John Adams tried to sign a trade agreement with Great Britian, the British refused, pointing out that effectively, they'd need to sign agreements with all 13 states individually because the federal government had no enforcement power. The lack of a standing federal army also severely hampered its ability to meaningfully bargain on the foreign policy front.\n\n \n I believe you have some valid points; but perhaps the framework should have been adjusted, atleast in my perspective.\n \n From my understanding of it, other than the above, the primary reason was over Shay's Rebellion; but perhaps I'm wrong. This is where a former Revolutionary soldier, Daniel Shay, gathered a force to fight against what he considered state tyrrany. It seemed he had some valid issues that seemed to be ingnored. It was a minor squirmish, and it was dissolved much like the Whiskey Rebellion (but with State soldiers, not Federal). It was used as a reason to have a wider amount of federal power, since they were authorized to stop the 'rebellion', but the states wouldn't provide funding. \n \n Honestly, I think minor squirmishes on the issue of tyrrany are more of a health thing than anything. Not to say I condone the violence, but I tend to think that it's patriotic to stand up against government abuse. To bring the Federal government in wasn't nescessary in that occurence; and as Washington later admitted, he deviated with the Constitution durning the Whiskey Rebellion, because he considered it nescessary. Although what's the point of the Constitution if you don't follow it?\n \n So essentially I don't consider it a 'great' failure; perhaps it simple to say that it was written under a time constraint, because of war and our infancy. I'm sure they're could have been a more perfected Article, but I guess we'll have to deal with what he have now.",

   "I don't know, I kind of like the constitution. I think it strikes a nice balance between state and federal power. And one of its BIG positive points is that it makes the proper venue for airing grievances against government tyranny an independent court system, rather than muskets and bullets. Big improvement in my eyes :)",

   "Patrick Henry, 1788\n \n This speech by Patrick Henry against ratification of the \n CONstitution for the united States of America.\n \n \n \n THIS, sir, is the language of democracy-that a majority of the \n community have a right to alter government when found to be \n oppressive. But how different is the genius of your new Constitution \n from this! How different from the sentiments of freemen that a \n contemptible minority can prevent the good of the majority! If, then,\n gentlemen standing on this ground are come to that point, that they \n are willing to bind themselves and their posterity to be oppressed,\n I am amazed and inexpressibly astonished. If this be the opinion of \n the majority, I must submit; but to me, sir, it appears perilous and \n destructive. I can not help thinking so. Perhaps it may be the result\n of my age. These may be feelings natural to a man of my years, when \n the American spirit has left him, and his mental powers, like the \n members of the body, are decayed. If, sir, amendments are left to the\n twentieth, or tenth part of the people of America, your liberty is \n gone for ever.\n \n We have heard that there is a great deal of bribery practised in the \n House of Commons of England, and that many of the members raise \n themselves to preferments by selling the rights of the whole of the \n people. But, sir, the tenth part of that body can not continue \n oppressions on the rest of the people. English liberty is, in this \n case, on a firmer foundation than American liberty. It will be easily\n contrived to procure the opposition of the one-tenth of the people to\n any alteration, however judicious. The honorable gentleman who \n presides told us that, to prevent abuses in our government, we will \n assemble in convention, recall our delegated powers, and punish our \n servants for abusing the trust reposed in them. Oh, sir! we should \n have fine times, indeed, if, to punish tyrants, it were only \n sufficient to assemble the people! Your arms, wherewith you could \n defend yourselves, are gone; and you have no longer an aristocratical,\n no longer a democratical spirit. Did you ever read of any revolution \n in a nation, brought about by the punishment of those in power, \n inflicted by those who had no power at all? You read of a riot act \n in a country which is called one of the freest in the world, where a\n few neighbors can not assemble without the risk of being shot by a \n hired soldiery, the engines of despotism. We may see such an act in \n America.\n \n A standing army we shall have, also, to execute the execrable commands\n of tyranny; and how are you to punish them? Will you order them to be\n punished? Who shall obey these orders? Will your mace-bearer be a \n match for a disciplined regiment? In what situation are we to be?\n The clause before you gives a power of direct taxation, unbounded \n and unlimited-an exclusive power of legislation, in all cases \n whatsoever, for ten miles square, and over all places purchased for \n the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, etc. What \n resistance could be made? The attempt would be madness. You will \n find all the strength of this country in the hands of your enemies; \n their garrisons will naturally be the strongest places in the \n country. Your militia is given up to Congress, also, in another part \n of this plan; they will therefore act as they think proper; all power\n will be in their own possession. You can not force them to receive\n their punishment: of what service would militia be to you, when, most \n probably, you will not have a single musket in the State? For, us \n arms are to be provided by Congress, they may or may not furnish them.\n \n The honorable gentleman then went on to the figure we make with \n foreign nations; the contemptible one we make in France and Holland, \n which, according to the substance of the notes, he attributes to the \n present feeble government. An opinion has gone forth, we find, that\n we are contemptible people; the time has been when we were thought \n otherwise. Under the same despised government we commanded the \n respect of all Europe; wherefore are we now reckoned otherwise? The \n American spirit has fled from hence: it has gone to regions where it\n has never been expected; it has gone to the people of France in \n search of a splendid government, a strong, energetic government. \n Shall we imitate the example of those nations who have gone from a \n simple to a splendid government? Are those nations more worthy of \n our imitation? What can make an adequate satisfaction to them for \n the loss they have suffered in attaining such a government-for the \n loss of their liberty? If we admit this consolidated government, it \n will be because we like a great, splendid one. Some way or other we \n must be a great and mighty empire; we must have an army, and a navy, \n and a number of things. When the American spirit was in its youth, \n the language of America was different; liberty, sir, was then the \n primary object.\n \n We are descended from a people whose government was founded on \n liberty; our glorious forefathers of Great Britain made liberty the \n foundation of everything. That country is become a great, mighty, \n and splendid nation; not because their government is strong and \n energetic, but, sir, because liberty is its direct end and foundation.\n We drew the spirit of liberty from our British ancestors; by that \n spirit we have triumphed over every difficulty. But now, sir, the\n American spirit, assisted by the ropes and chains of consolidation, \n is about to convert this country into a powerful and mighty empire. \n If you make the citizens of this country agree to become the subjects \n of one great consolidated empire of America, your government will not\n have sufficient energy to keep them together. Such a government is \n incompatible with the genius of republicanism. There will be no \n checks, no real balances, in this government. What can avail your \n specious, imaginary balances, your rope-dancing, chain-rattling,\n ridiculous ideal checks and contrivances? But, sir, \"we are not \n feared by foreigners; we do not make nations tremble.\" Would this \n constitute happiness or secure liberty? I trust, sir, our political \n hemisphere will ever direct their operations to the security of \n those objects.\n \n Consider our situation, sir; go to the poor man and ask him what he \n does. He will inform you that he enjoys the fruits of his labor, \n under his own fig tree, with his wife and children around him, in \n peace and security. Go to every other member of society; you will \n find the same tranquil ease and content; you will find no alarms or \n disturbances. Why, then, tell us of danger, to terrify us into an \n adoption of this new form of government? And yet who knows the dangers\n that this new system may produce? They are out of sight of the common\n people; they can not foresee latent consequences. I dread the \n operation of it on the middling and lower classes of people; it is \n for them I fear the adoption of this system. I fear I tire the \n patience of the committee, but I beg to be indulged with a few more \n observations.\n \n When I thus profess myself an advocate for the liberty of the people, \n I shall be told I am a designing man, that I am to be a great man, \n that I am to be a demagog; and many similar illiberal insinuations \n will be thrown out; but, sir, conscious rectitude outweighs those \n things with me. I see great jeopardy in this new government. I see \n none from our present one. I hope some gentleman or other will bring \n forth, in full array, those dangers, if there be any, that we may see\n and touch them. I have said that I thought this a consolidated \n government; I will now prove it. Will the great rights of the people \n be secured by this government? Suppose it should prove oppressive, \n how can it be altered? Our Bill of Rights declares that \"a majority \n of the community hath an indubitable, unalienable, and indefeasible \n right to reform, alter, or abolish it, in such manner as shall be \n judged most conducive to the public weal.\"\n \n The voice of tradition, I trust, will inform posterity of our \n struggles for freedom. If our descendants be worthy the name of \n Americans they will preserve and hand down to their latest posterity \n the transactions of the present times; and tho I confess my \n exclamations are not worthy the hearing, they will see that I have\n done my utmost to preserve their liberty, for I never will give up \n the power of direct taxation but for a scourge. I am willing to give \n it conditionally-that is, after non-compliance with requisitions. I \n will do more, sir, and what I hope will convince the most skeptical \n man that I am a lover of the American Union; that, in case Virginia \n shall not make punctual payment, the control of our customhouses and \n the whole regulation of trade shall be given to Congress, and that \n Virginia shall depend on Congress even for passports, till Virginia \n shall have paid the last farthing and furnished the last soldier.\n \n Nay, sir, there is another alternative to which I would consent; even \n that they should strike us out of the Union and take away from us all \n federal privileges till we comply with federal requisitions; but let \n it depend upon our own pleasure to pay our money in the most easy\n manner for our people. Were all the States, more terrible than the \n mother country, to join against us, I hope Virginia could defend \n herself; but, sir, the dissolution of the Union is most abhorrent to \n my mind. The first thing I have at heart is American liberty; the \n second thing is American union; and I hope the people of Virginia \n will endeavor to preserve that union. The increasing population of \n the Southern States is far greater than that of New England;\n consequently, in a short time, they will be far more numerous than \n the people of that country. Consider this and you will find this \n State more particularly interested to support American liberty and \n not bind our posterity by an improvident relinquishment of our \n rights. I would give the best security for a punctual compliance \n with requisitions; but I beseech gentlemen, at all hazards, not to \n give up this unlimited power of taxation. The honorable gentleman \n has told us that these powers given to Congress are accompanied by a \n judiciary which will correct all. On examination you will find this \n very judiciary oppressively constructed, your jury trial destroyed, \n and the judges dependent on Congress.\n \n This Constitution is said to have beautiful features; but when I come\n to examine these features, sir, they appear to me horribly frightful. \n Among other deformities, it has an awful squinting; it squints toward \n monarchy, and does not this raise indignation in the breast of every \n true American? Your president may easily become king. Your Senate is \n so imperfectly constructed that your dearest rights may be sacrificed\n to what may be a small minority; and a very small minority may \n continue for ever unchangeably this government, altho horridly \n defective. Where are your checks in this government? Your strongholds \n will be in the hands of your enemies. It is on a supposition that \n your American governors shall be honest that all the good qualities \n of this government are founded; but its defective and imperfect \n construction puts it in their power to perpetrate the worst of \n mischiefs should they be bad men; and, sir, would not all the world,\n blame our distracted folly in resting our rights upon the contingency\n of our rulers being good or gad? Show me that age and country where \n the rights and liberties of the people were placed on the sole chance \n of their rulers being good men without a consequent loss of liberty! \n I say that the loss of that dearest privilege has ever followed, with\n absolute certainty, every such mad attempt.\n \n If your American chief be a man of ambition and abilities, how easy is\n it for him to render himself absolute! The army is in his hands, and \n if he be a man of address, it will be attached to him, and it will be \n the subject of long meditation with him to seize the first auspicious\n moment to accomplish his design, and, sir, will the American spirit \n solely relieve you when this happens? I would rather infinitely-and \n I am sure most of this Convention are of the same opinion-have a \n king, lords, and commons, than a government so replete with such\n insupportable evils. If we make a king we may prescribe the rules by \n which he shall rule his people, and interpose such checks as shall \n prevent him from infringing them; but the president, in the field, at\n the head of his army, can prescribe the terms on which he shall reign\n master, so far that it will puzzle any American ever to get his neck \n from under the galling yoke. I can not with patience think of this \n idea. If ever he violate the laws, one of two things will happen: \n he will come at the head of the army to carry everything before him,\n or he will give bail, or do what Mr. Chief Justice will order him. If\n he be guilty, will not the recollection of his crimes teach him to \n make one bold push for the American throne? Will not the immense \n difference between being master of everything an being ignominiously \n tried and punished powerfully excite him to make this bold push? But,\n sir, where is the existing force to punish him? Can he not, at the \n head of his army, beat down every opposition? Away with your \n president! we shall have a king: the army will salute him monarch; \n your militia will leave you, and assist in making him king, and fight\n against you: and what have you to oppose this force? What will then\n become of you and your rights? Will not absolute despotism ensue?",
