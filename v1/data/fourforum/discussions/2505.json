   "Paul writes: \"For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. For what does the Scripture say? \"ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS. Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.\" Romans 4:2-5.\n \n James writes: \"You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected; and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, \"AND ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS,\" and he was called the friend of God. You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.\" James 2:22-24.\n \n First of all, it is impossible for anyone to be justified before God by 'faith apart from works' and by 'works' at the very same time. So, which of these Bible writers have it correct? The answer is that they are both right. However, they are writing to two separate groups of individuals who live under two separate Administrations. To obtain the full impact of what this means, there are a few facts that the reader must come to realize. \n \n Peter and Paul sat on opposite sides of the table at the meeting in Jerusalem in 50 Ad.. (Acts 15) Paul writes, \"It was because of a revelation that I went up; and I submitted to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but {I did so} in private to those who were of reputation, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain.\" Galatians 2:2. Those of reputation are reported to be none other than Peter, John and James (the Lord's brother). Gal. 2:9.\n \n Ask yourself these questions: \n \n 1. Why is Paul going down to submit the gospel to Peter some twenty years after the crucifixion of Christ? \n \n 2. What did Paul know that Peter did not know? \n \n 3. And, why did Paul go down to submit our gospel to Peter, John and James in fear of failure? \n \n Quite obviously, if Peter and Paul were preaching the same 'gospel' message, then Paul had nothing new to submit to these reputed Kingdom Disciples. However, Paul reveals to these Galatians, \"For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but {I received it} through a revelation of Jesus Christ.\" Gal. 1:11+12.\n \n There are two gospel messages in your New Testament that contain a different set of precepts. John the Baptist, Christ and the Twelve preached the 'gospel of the kingdom.' Matt. 4:23, 9:35, 24:14, Acts 8:12. The main precepts of this message are 'repentance and water baptism for the forgiveness of sins.' See Mark 1:4, 16:15+16, Acts 2:38. Paul's Gospel (Romans 2:16, 16:25, etc.) was not revealed to Paul, until after Acts 9. Note also that Paul's gospel is according to the 'revelation of the mystery.' Romans 16:25. \n \n The fact that we would be justified by faith apart from works through the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ could not be revealed to anyone, until after Christ had actually died for sins. If Satan had known of God's plan for us through the cross of Christ, then he would have never crucified him. See 1Corinthians 2:6-8. Peter's gospel to the circumcised (Gal. 2:7) is based upon water baptism for the forgiveness of sins. Acts 2:38. Paul's gospel to the uncircumcised (Gal. 2:7) is based upon the blood of Jesus Christ for our redemption. Ephesians 1:7. Next, note very carefully that Christ came in water and in blood. 1John 5:6-8 (6). \n \n Now, to apply the above to our seeming contradiction: James is addressing members of the Kingdom Administration who had sins forgiven through repentance and water baptism. To those Kingdom disciples he writes, \"For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one {point,} he has become guilty of all.\" James 2:10. Paul is addressing members of the Body of Christ (See Romans 12:4+5, 1Cor. 12:12-14, 27, Eph. 5:30) who had sins forgiven through hearing and believing the 'message of truth' (Eph. 1:13+14).\n \n The words of the Apostle Paul (Romans - Philemon) are the Lord's commandment (1Cor. 14:37+38) for the members of the body of Christ in the world today. His thirteen Gentile Epistles represent God's personal mail 'to' you. Paul was given the 'dispensation/stewardship of the grace of God' (Eph. 3:2) for we who believe. We are justified by faith apart from works (Romans 4:5, Eph. 2:8+9). James is writing to Kingdom Disciples of the coming Messianic Kingdom Dispensation who shall be under Mosaic Law. They shall be justified by faith AND works. James 2:20-24. \n \n Many of the seeming contradictions of the New Testament shall be answered, when you realize the difference between Paul's Gentile Epistles and the Kingdom Epistles of the remaining NT writers.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",
