   "Trebor, what do you know about Buber?\n \nThis concept finds its completion, writes Buber, in Ludwig Feuerbach's sentence: 'Man with man -- the unity of I and Thou --is God.' The most personal lies in the relation to the other. Join a being to all beings and you lure out of it its truest individuality. ('Ueber Jakob Bohme,'op. cit., p. 252; Lesser Ury,'p. 45f.)\n \n God is immanent within the world and is brought to perfection through the world and through the life of man. The world is no being over against one. It is a becoming. We do not have to accept the world as it is; we continually create it. We create the world in that we unknowingly lend our perceptions the concentration and firmness that make them into a reality. But deeper and more inwardly we consciously create the world in that we let our strength flow into the becoming, in that we ourselves enter into world destiny and become an element in the great event. )'Ueber Jacob B\u00f6hme,' p. 251.)\n \n Human life itself is the bearer and reality of all transcendence. Tao, 'the way,' is unity in change and transformation, and the perfect revelation of Tao is the man who combines the greatest change with the purest unity. Though Tao is the path, order, and unity of everything, it exists in things only potentially until it becomes living and manifest through its contact with the conscious being of the united man. Tao appears in men as the uniting force that overcomes all deviation from the ground of life, as the completing force that heals all that is sundered and broken. (Martin Buber, Die Rede, die Lehre, und das Lied [Leipzig: Insel Verlag, 1920], pp. 40-79. 'Die Lehre von Tao' was originally published as a 'Nachwort' to Reden und Gleichnisse des Tschuang-Tse. It was most recently reprinted in Hinweise, op. cit., pp. 44-83, and in Pointing the Way, op. cit., 'The Teaching of the Tao,' pp. 31-58.)\n\n Martin Buber: The Life of Dialogue\n \n Commentez vous et confoundez vous les ignorants.",
