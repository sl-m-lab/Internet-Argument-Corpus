It is a good system in theory but we can see the short comings of it. Still I think it is the best form of government at this time.\n \n I suppose the best form of government for the future would be one directed by politically savvy AIs. Computers can make snap judgement without emotion and without feeling the need to lie or make decisions for their own selfish reasons. They will be able to manage all sorts of systems of our society at once and be able to analyze many different aspects of life in our country in order to make many more of the changes that need to be made in a timely fashion. It would be a model of efficiency and fairness, ideally speaking of course.",

Now how is this a stupid question? As for the question \"Do they support this happening?\" it basically had to be asked because they surprisingly do seem to be taking the step necessary for this to happen so it has to be asked if this is what they want to happen.

I just understand that on a project that is very large the government will have more resources to deal with it than a bunch of small groups will and they will have more organization.
