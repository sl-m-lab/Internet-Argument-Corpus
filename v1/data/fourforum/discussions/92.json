   "\n Yes\n \n No matter how meticulous you plan your life nothing can prepare you for the cruel and seemingly indiscriminate blow of terminal disease. Personally I don't think we should make it worse than it needs to be. Let people have control over their own lives. If someone wants to die we can't deny them the right. These people applicable are not rejecting the sanctitiy of life. I agree with the popular argument that life should be cherished but I think life is a gift with a heavy price for millions of people around the world and that sometimes the gift runs out leaving nothing more than an evil filled with pain and distress.

It is a persons right to choose and making it legal would offer a better alternative to trying to commit suicide on your own.\n \n However, there have to be regulations.

You hear stories all the time about people trying to commit suicide, not being able to, recovering, and living great, fulfilling lives.\n Second, if you believe in God, you are denying his power and are rejecting the belief that he could perform a miracle for that person.\n Third, to many doctors would have problems giving people medicine that will kill them.
