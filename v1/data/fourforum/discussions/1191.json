Although it may seem that our tax cuts will cost us money in the long term at this time it simply is not true as long as it continues to stimulate the economy. The increased amounts of money that will be brought into the economy alone will increase the tax dollars that are collected by the government. This in turn will pay off the tax cuts.

That will change as it is by its nature a \"lagging indicator.\" And my 401K is growing by leaps and bounds.

   "I dont think the question \"do tax cuts stimulate the economy\" is quite fair. Of course they do. The real question is: are they the most efficient way to stimulate the economy? There the answer is a resounding no.\n \n 1) Tax cuts overwhelmingly benefit the rich. This is because in our progressive system, the rich pay more taxes. Hence, they get more back in return when we cut them. The poor get less money back because they pay less (this is the argument conservatives use to respond to allegations that the cut is slanted towards the rich). Regardless of whether this can be helped or not (I think it can, by cutting payroll taxes and expanding the EITC), the fact remains the stimulus directed towards the wealthy is a relatively inefficient method of stimumlus. The law of diminishing returns (AKA the Utility Theory) states that as money is moved from poorer people to richer people, it is \"worth\" less. Poor people are more likely to spend, and more likely to spend here (so they have a higher multiplier effect). Rich folks are more likely to save or spend on imported luxury goods, which helps Switzerland, but not us.\n 2) Even if you buy the Bush propoganda that the latest 350 bil. tax cut will create 1.4 million jobs (all evidence aside), that's spending a whopping $250,000/job created. That's a terrible yield, at that rate we should just pay folks a tripple the median income and we still create more jobs at a lower cost. The CBA doesn't work here.\n 3) Rubinomics vs. \"Voodoo\" economics: Rubinomics (named for Clinton Treasury Sec. Robert Rubin) do not disdain tax cuts entirely. Rather they concoct a mix of middle/lower income tax cuts with paying down the debt. Debt/deficits are a huge drag on the economy, and according to the CBO, they will reach a cumulitive 4 trillion over the next 10 years (assuming the tax cuts are made permanent). The Brookings Inst. explains why, pointing out that dollars the government has to borrow are dollars unavailable to the public, thus pushing up interest rates and slowing down growth. By balancing the budget (which includes not spending on irresponsible programs/tax cuts) we provide insurance not just for the economic future, but the social future as well.",

   "I'll take this!\n \n The bull market took off when the GOP took control of Congress. See any chart.\n \n It's fact... the last 6 months of the Clinton administration were the start of the recession. It's the Clinton-Gore recession... markets lost some money, good signs became bad signs, and soon after we dipped.\n \n Who gave North Korea nuclear fuel to make it's weapons? Yes, that's right-- Bill Clinton. In 1994 we signed an agreement with them that got them several nuclear power plants. May the pictures of the secretary of state clinking glasses with Kim Jong-Il haunt them forever.\n \n THe deficit went away because Clinton borrowed from the social security trust fund to balance his budget. \n The most recent crime statistics were the best since they've been keeping track.\n The best economy I would rate as a tie, simply because no one agrees. Some say Clinton, some say Reagan.\n \n Remember, the surplus was just an estimate. It was money we never had. Facts are facts, fact: last 6th months of the Clinton administration began the recession.\n \n Also... corporate scandals. They came out under Bush, they occurred under Clinton. In the case of Enron, the administration actually blocked the SEC from investigating and helped to get Enron some big contracts.\n \n We've already seen an increased collection of almost 90 billion dollars as a result of the tax cuts. The deficit figure now stands at 380 billion dollars, and I think in the coming months we'll see it continue to dip as the economy rockets.",

   "Hank:\n \n I may have bitten off more than I can chew. I do not like clinton. I do like bush. I don't think I have the time to actually debate this topic. I will be posting quite a bit less for a while. Things are really heating up at work and home. One or two every other day or so will be about all I can do. Thanks for the debate. This really isn't a cop out. I hope we can revisit the topic in a month or so when things slow down for me a bit. You can private message me if you like. I would even consider email discussions but I cannot continue in this thread. Sorry.\n\n \n I completely understand epaphras and I don't think you are copping out in any way. I have been debating on three or four topics myself and I know how it can take up a lot of your time.\n \n I hope everything works out for you at work and home. Good luck and I'll look forward to debating you again in the future.\n \n Hank",

   "Which economic indicators are you using to justify the statement that the economy started going south in a big way towards the end of his administration?\n\n \n The two year rule of economics. It takes two years for economic policies to have a full effect on the economy. Thus, what Clinton did was still affecting the economy as late as 2003. When the economy officially entered a recession, what Bush did was beginning to impact the economy, but it was mainly the policies from Clinton's presidency that were affecting it.\n \n \nIf this is true, why do you say tax cuts get the economy cranking? \n\n \n Because they give more money back to the people who will spend it in our economy.\n \n \nBush calls North Korea an \"evil\" nation and strongly implies they may be next in line for an invasion by the US. North Korea says we are going to start making nuclear weapons to defend ourselves. So you blame that on Clinton. Go figure.\n\n \n If Clinton had handled the situation instead of creating an agreement that North Korea was obviously going to break anyway, then the situation would not be around today.\n \n \nThe deficit went down\n\n \n Only when the Republican-controlled congress forced him to.\n \n \nBest economy over the entire eight years in the history of the US\n Low interest rates\n Low unemployment\n\n \n But he burned the economy at the end\n \n \nThe house did that for purely political reasons.

   "I&#8217;m involved in other threads right now and don&#8217;t know how much I can contribute to this one. But I&#8217;ll see how it goes.\n \n \n\n The two year rule of economics. It takes two years for economic policies to have a full effect on the economy. Thus, what Clinton did was still affecting the economy as late as 2003. When the economy officially entered a recession, what Bush did was beginning to impact the economy, but it was mainly the policies from Clinton's presidency that were affecting it. \n\n \n I haven&#8217;t heard of the two year rule of economics. Maybe you could post some links.\n \n Income tax cuts don&#8217;t take two years to effect the deficit. It&#8217;s obvious when the deficit starts going up the next April 15th because tax revenues are down.\n \n \nBecause they give more money back to the people who will spend it in our economy. \n\n \n Then how do you explain the good economy after Clinton raised taxes to stop the rising deficit after he was elected?\n \n \nIf Clinton had handled the situation instead of creating an agreement that North Korea was obviously going to break anyway, then the situation would not be around today. \n\n \n You didn&#8217;t explain what you think he should have done and what Bush is going to do to stop them. How does not making an agreement stop them from doing something?\n \n It&#8217;s just been discovered that Iran has been obtaining enriched uranium for the past 18 years. Why didn&#8217;t Reagan or Bush the first do something about that? And what is Bush W. going to do about that?\n \n \nOnly when the Republican-controlled congress forced him to. \n\n \n You mean after the first two years of the Clinton administration when not a single republican voted for the budget either year but all said we would be in a deep recession by the end of the year. Do you need me to provide some quotes? Then when they got control of congress, on a platform of a balanced budget amendment I might add, they sent to Clinton a budget that had too much spending. He refused to sign it while Newt bragged that he&#8217;d like to see Clinton shut the government down, which he did and the American people blamed the congress. Of course then the congress gave in and sent Clinton what he wanted and the economy kept right on cruising. Next year same thing with the same results. After that the congress just kept their mouth shut and gave Clinton what he wanted because the economy and the deficit were doing great. If you need backup data for what I have stated, I&#8217;ll be glad to provide it.\n \n Anyway what about your two year rule? According to that, wouldn&#8217;t it have taken Clinton his first two years before the deficit started coming down?\n \n One other thing, the control of the congress by the republicans has not changed. If they were the reason the deficit went down, why did it go up just because we got a republican president? Before 1980 the deficit was never a problem. However over the past 23 years, every time we have a republican president, the deficit goes up and every time we have a democratic president, the deficit goes down. Does anyone see a pattern here?\n \n \nBut he burned the economy at the end \n\n \n Please provide something besides your opinion as evidence.\n \n \nHe committed purgery. That's a felony. It's a crime you can and should be impeached for.\n\n \n He was. So what&#8217;s your gripe?",

   "\"Consumer Confidence at 14-Month High\n Tue Nov 25,10:05 AM ET Add Business - Reuters to My Yahoo! \n \n NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence (news - web sites) surged to its highest level in over a year, exceeding economists' rosy expectations, as consumers grew more hopeful about the job market, a report said on Tuesday. \n \n Private research firm the Conference Board (news - web sites) said its index of consumer confidence climbed to 91.7, its highest level since Sept. 2002, from a revised 81.7 in October. Wall Street analysts had forecast a rise to 85.0. \n \n \"Consumers believe a slow but sure labor market turnaround is underway,\" said Lynn Franco, director of research at the Conference Board. \n \n The percentage of consumers saying that jobs were hard to get fell to 29.5 percent in November from 33.7 percent the previous month. Consumers' view of the future grew rosier, lifting the expectations component of the index to 99.4 in Nov. from 91.5. The present situation index rose to 80.1 from 67.0. \"",
