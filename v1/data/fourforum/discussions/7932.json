Remember her?\n Repeated polls showed clear opposition to the actions that the majority of politicians took in efforts to keep a vegetable *alive*.\n \n Remember Clinton's first election? He specifically stated that he was going to revoke the law precluding gay service in the military. Opinion polls on the issue repeatedly demonstrated majority support for gays in the military.\n But when Clinton got elected, Congress members who never spoke about it during their election campaigns suddenly fought him on it, defying the majority opinion in their attempt to ensure that the military exclusion policy remained.\n And despite what some may think about DADT, the military exclusion of homosexuals in uniform still exists, unabated. All Clinton did was tone down the military's attempts to root out gays...\n In part because after Clinton got elected, DESPITE majority public opinion, Congress passed NEW legislation reaffirming the laws against homosexuals in the military.\n \n And Bob's example is yet a third one, if all parts of the scenario are true.\n 1) Assume public opinion is against gay rights.\n 2) Assume politicians always 'pander' to majority opinion.\n 3) Ergo, politicians would pass legislation against gay rights.\n Politicians passing legislation in favor of gay rights would be a violation of the 'logic' situation, unless one of the parts is not true...\n \n And the flaw to the logical inconsistency is obvious. #1 is flawed...\n The truth is that the majority of the public support gays on EVERY equal rights issue except one. The SOLE exception is gay marriage.\n \n The majority is against sodomy laws. They support gays in the military. They support gay adoption. They support gay civil unions. They support hate crime laws which include sexual orientation. They support legislation making it illegal to fire a person just because they're gay.\n The list goes on and on, with only the ONE exception.

   "Your reply completely avoided Bob's point...\n\n I did? emoticon_confused \n \n\n Can you explain that inconsistency?\n \n\n What inconsistency? The majority of Americans are against gay marriage, but politicians in specific areas, such as San Fran, are. Surprising?\n \n\n And can you show where Bob actually said that \"pandering\" doesn't exist?\n Politicians can \"pander\" to the majority.\n But they can also \"pander\" IN SPITE OF the majority...\n \n Terry Schiavo? Remember her?\n Repeated polls showed clear opposition to the actions that the majority of politicians took in efforts to keep a vegetable *alive*.\n\n Well let's see........now who would politicians be pandering to if the majority of Americans wanted to see the veg die?.....oh yeah, their conservative religious base. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n\n Remember Clinton's first election? He specifically stated that he was going to revoke the law precluding gay service in the military. Opinion polls on the issue repeatedly demonstrated majority support for gays in the military.\n\n Revisionist history?! Clinton never met a campaign promise that he kept. His ideology was to wet his finger, stick it in the air and see which way the day's breeze was blowing. \n \n\n But when Clinton got elected, Congress members who never spoke about it during their election campaigns suddenly fought him on it, defying the majority opinion in their attempt to ensure that the military exclusion policy remained.\n And despite what some may think about DADT, the military exclusion of homosexuals in uniform still exists, unabated. All Clinton did was tone down the military's attempts to root out gays...\n In part because after Clinton got elected, DESPITE majority public opinion, Congress passed NEW legislation reaffirming the laws against homosexuals in the military.\n \n\n AND CLINTON SIGNED IT INTO LAW. He went from pandering to the Left to pandering to the Right. Isn't that obvious to you? And as for the Republicans, surely you don't think that the majority of Republican VOTERS support gays in the military, do you? \n \n\n And Bob's example is yet a third one, if all parts of the scenario are true.\n 1) Assume public opinion is against gay rights.\n 2) Assume politicians always 'pander' to majority opinion.\n 3) Ergo, politicians would pass legislation against gay rights.\n Politicians passing legislation in favor of gay rights would be a violation of the 'logic' situation, unless one of the parts is not true...\n \n And the flaw to the logical inconsistency is obvious. #1 is flawed...\n The truth is that the majority of the public support gays on EVERY equal rights issue except one. The SOLE exception is gay marriage.\n \n\n Surprise, surprise! Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act, but not more restrictive anti-gay measures. States that were strongly anti-gay marriage went one step further and banned same-sex unions.\n \n \n The majority is against sodomy laws. They support gays in the military. They support gay adoption. They support gay civil unions. They support hate crime laws which include sexual orientation. They support legislation making it illegal to fire a person just because they're gay.\n The list goes on and on, with only the ONE exception. Gay marriage...\n And even then, the statistics repeatedly show that opposition to gay marriage is shrinking, while support for gay marriage is growing...\n\n \n You've proven my hypothesis. The majority oppose gay marriage and it just so happens to be the only anti-gay legislation to become law. Amazing isn't it? :)",

   "\"I was glad to find in your book a formal contradiction at length of the judiciary usurpation of legislative powers; for such the judges have usurped in their repeated decisions, that Christianity is a part of the common law. The proof of the contrary which you have adduced is incontrovertible; to wit, that the common law existed while the Anglo-Saxons were yet Pagans, at a time when they had never yet heard the name of Christ pronounced, or knew that such a character had ever existed.\"\n --Thomas Jefferson, letter to Major John Cartwright\n \n \"For we know that the common law is that system of law which was introduced by the Saxons on their settlement in England, and altered from time to time by proper legislative authority from that time to the date of Magna Charta, which terminates the period of the common law, or lex non scripta, and commences that of the statue law, or Lex Scripta. This settlement took place about the middle of the fifth century. But Christianity was not introduced till the seventh century; the conversion of the first christian king of the Heptarchy having taken place about the year 598, and that of the last about 686. Here, then, was a space of two hundred years, during which the common law was in existence, and Christianity no part of it.\"\n --Thomas Jefferson to Dr. Thomas Cooper (Feb.10, 1814)",
