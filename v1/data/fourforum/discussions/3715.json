Wade?\n \n * Roe v. Wade is the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that recognized that a woman has a constitutional right to decide whether to continue her pregnancy. The Court also ruled, however, that after fetal viability, states may restrict or ban abortions entirely, except when necessary to protect the woman's life or health.\n\n \nHow is abortion legally restricted in the United States?\n \n * States can restrict abortion or prohibit it entirely after viability (that is, the point at which the fetus is able to live outside the woman's body, with or without artificial aid)-except when necessary to protect the woman's life or health-and the vast majority of states have done so. The most common restrictions on early abortion are parental involvement requirements, state-directed counseling and waiting periods, and limitations on public funding.
