Harry still has to actually do stuff without him, but he's still there in his role as mentor.

What if, in the movies, they had Ron talk and act towards mudbloods the way Draco does? That would completely change his character. This is what Jackson did to Faramirs character in LOTR. He turned the most noble character in the book into a sniviling coward. Also what if they had put the final battle with Tom Riddle in Hogsmede with Dumbledore completing Harrys task of saving Jenny? Jackson did the same Sauramans death by rewritting the scene in a way that it looses its power, drama, and meaning.

Anyway that's enough from me!\n \n No spoilers, but just to prove I'm not lying, the first line of chapter 16 is \n \n \"When Harry awoke the following day it was several seconds before he remembered what had happened.\"\n \n You can verify that in your own time!
