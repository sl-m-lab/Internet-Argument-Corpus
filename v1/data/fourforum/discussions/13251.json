   "  Own a gun? Are you prepared to use it? \n I'm not saying go buy the gun. I'm saying that if you already have one and you haven't shot it or cleaned it in, let's say, the last year, or if it is in the closet, unloaded and/or locked down, the fact is, you will not be able to get to it in time.\n \n Crooks are deathly afraid of being shot. They don't like being bitten by dogs or locked up by the cops, or going down with the swine flu either, but they really don't like being shot.\n \n .......... Don't fool yourself into thinking that if something were to happen, that you would have time to go to the closet, unlock it, load it and then be able to use it in a moment's notice.\n \n The burglar, looking for something to sell, in most cases isn't looking for trouble. But in some cases someone is going to go into the home looking for trouble. Believe me, there are some crazy, screwed-up people walking the earth.\n \n All I'm saying is prepare yourself for the worst-case scenario. If your defense includes your gun, then make sure that you have it together. Know it, practice with it and have a plan in case you need to respond.\n \n You don't want to finish in second place.\n",

   "I think the above article is exactly what is needed in every city in America, because the gun buying blitz seems not to be abating. \n   1,000,000+ Guns Added to American Homes in August \n Washington, DC --(AmmoLand.com)- Data released by the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) reported 1,074,757 checks in August 2009, a 12.3 percent increase from the 956,872 reported in August 2008.\n \n So far that is roughly 9,076,205 gun bought this year! The total is probably more as NICS background checks may cover the purchase of more than one gun at a time.\n This latest jump in background checks show that Americans are solidly in-favor of keeping firearms in the hands of law abiding citizens and clearly shows that proponents claiming the USA wants more gun control are blatantly wrong.\n \n Gun Owners Say No to Gun Conrtol with their Wallets\n The increased trend of Americans buying firearms at a record pace was once thought to be a one time fluke caused by fears of the new Obama administration expressed lust for more gun control. But now 10 months in and the wrongly named \"fear buying\" has now become the norm as law abiding US citizen exercise their constitutional right to keep and bear firearms by the millions every month with no sign of slowing down.\n \n .....\n \n 1.17 Guns for Each Person\n Conservative estimates of legally owned guns in the USA put the number at 355,029,250 million guns in the USA. That is 1.17 guns for everyone in the USA and if you listen to the liberal press they are all assault weapons. God bless anyone who tries to invade the USA...\n \n Crime Rates Falling\n The most stunning in all of this is that we have not seen an increase in crime, murder rates have fallen across most of the USA and Americans have shown that they can be trusted with firearms ownership.X This is directly in contrast to what the national media and gun control supporters would have us believe.\n\n If any of us knows that our neighbors were one of the new purchasers, and if we happen to know they are not familiar with gun handling, please take the time to show them proper gun handling techniques. Then take them to the range.\n \n Looks like Obama has yet another excellent economic program. Say what one wants to about Van Jones, but give credit where it is due. Cash for Hoopties, (Clunkers) was his idea. Not that I think this guy should be an adviser to the President of the United States, mind you.\n \n The above gun buying scheme was nothing but pure economic brilliance. He made sooooooooooo many Americans go out and buy guns, that it is absolutely amazing! They even had to back order all of these guns and ammo too, and they are just catching up with those back orders! He did all of this by scaring the Heck out of America, with all this talk of Radical Change, and gun control, and that made them buy guns by the tons! \n \n However, with so many armed Americans, I think the Government should tread very lightly in the coming years. Given the mood at Town Hall Meetings, that is. I don't think we want to Tick them off any time soon! As prudence would dictate. :)",

So anecdotal, gun shop owners say they have a good portion of new gun owners but nothing can be documented on this because it would be illegal. Nothing exist beyond that.",
