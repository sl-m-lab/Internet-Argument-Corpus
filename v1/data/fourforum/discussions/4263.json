Why does the fact that they can feelthe pain, as apposed to not, change ones thoughts on abortion? They are still killed and never get the chance to live in this world. \n The big difference is what they are **at the moment** when they are being aborted. What they are is much more important than what they will be. If they cannot feel, do not have any thoughts, emotions, not even a sense of self, then how in the world can you think of them as a person at that point in time? Yes, if left alone, they probably will develop into a person and the life of such a potential person should not be taken lightly. However, all of the rights, freedoms, and protections which our country, and most free civilizations, were founded on are for PEOPLE, not for potential people. It is an inherent assumption under all of the rights and laws. The rights of an actual person should always take precedence over that of a life that is not a person.\n \n Also, I know that this type of arguement is controversial, but if you take your idea that all potential life should have an overriding right to be protected, then one could argue that using contraception (either chemical or natural) is depriving a potential person of its right to life.\n \n \nAsk yourselves, what if i were aborted? What if Einstein, Columbus, Newton, Martin L. King, etc. were? Then it is a shame, for ANY life to be taken.\n If I had been developed enough to feel pain, emotions, etc. , then it would have been a terrible experience but, of course, this would only be valid in very late stages of pregnancy. If I had been aborted in earlier stages, then I never would have known it - just like all the billions of potential people who had never been born due to early miscarriages, or even contraception. As for a potential life becoming a Columbus, Newton, etc., it just as easily could have become a Hitler, Stalin, or serial killer.",

Why does the fact that they can feelthe pain, as apposed to not, change ones thoughts on abortion? They are still killed and never get the chance to live in this world.\n\n \n A lot of pro-lifers like to think that the Fetus is on the same level as a born, or almost-to-be-born, Human being, when it isn't. A fetus is nothing more than a pre-born human that, in many instances, cannot feel pain/pleasure, therefore prior to that point it does not and will never factor into a Utilitarian calculation. Even later in pregnancy, the actual line of demarcation after which they can feel pain/pleasure is blurry, and it is difficult to tell whether or not they are feeling it or just responding to the external stimuli.\n \n Furthermore, there is zero reason to treat a FEtus as a moral person as you would an adult, a child, or even a newborn baby for reasons other than pure pain/pleasure experience capability. Y ou have to look at the level of Rational Autonomy of the creature.\n \n The fact that something is alive does not give it a right to life. There are no Rights intrinsically. Humans and other animals kill other livign creatuers all the time, and Humans can easily rationalize this. It's not immoral to kill to eat or to kill to survive. Life itself is intrinsicially netural in value. Many pro-lifers like to espouse a lot of relgious motiviation behind their claims of value to human life---the sanctity of life.\n \n All things being equal, this really doesn't exist. THere is nothing intrinsically important about Human life at all stages. It depends on the stage. At many stages during the pregnancy, the Fetus is a non-autonomous, low IQ creature that doesn't have a developed sense of self-awareness, or sentience. It also does not posses sapience.\n \n These things make creatuers valuable moral persons. A fetus has less sentience and a lower level of autonomy and ratinoality that that of a Cat. As a fetus, both the Human Fetus and the Cat Fetus are relatively equal--both are unautonomous, unfeeling, and non-sentient/sapient. There is no reason, other than pure speciest bias ,which isn't a legitimate moral factor, that separates choice between the two.\n \n The fact that we kill fully grown cats and think nothing of the sort as we do with a Human fetus is, quite frankly, silly. There's no objectivity behind it. Humans are merely another animal, and we aren't even a \"higher\" grade animal, since there is no such hierarchy according to evolution.\n \n Even after birth, the fetus isn't at a significant level of self-awareness of being aware: sapient.",
