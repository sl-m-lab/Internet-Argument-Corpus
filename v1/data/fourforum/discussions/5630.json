   "http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=10&ItemID=7954\n \n The American Dream is More Livable in the Old World\n \n Now before you hard core conservatives get angry or attack the source, the original article was posted in the WSJ, as I do not have an online subscription to the WSJ i could not post that one.\n \n \nHey, guess what: the social class into which you are born matters a lot when it comes to where you stand on the American socioeconomic ladder. It matters more in the United States, the supposed land of upward mobility, than it does in Europe. The American Dream of \"rags to riches\" is less livable in America than it is in the aristocratic Old World that America rejected when its founding document proclaimed that \"All Men Are Created Equal.\" \n \n If you don't believe me, check out the front page of the capitalist Wall Street Journal two weeks ago. In an article titled \"As Rich-Poor Gap Widens in the U.S., Class Mobility Stalls: Those on Bottom Rung Enjoy Better Odds in Europe\" (May 13th), Journal reporter David Wessel notes that recent scholarship does NOT bear out \"the notion that the US is...a meritocracy where smarts and ambition matter more than parenthood and class.\" In reality, Wessel finds, the odds that a child born into poverty will climb into the middle or upper class are slighter in the U.S. than they are in \"class bound Europe.\" According to the latest and best research, the Journal reports, the U.S. and its junior partner England are \"the least mobile societies\" among the world's \"rich countries.\" France and Germany \"are somewhat more mobile than the U.S.; Canada and the Nordic countries are much more so.\"\n \n snip\n \n Rags to Rags, Riches to Riches\n \n How fixed is class position in the supposedly hyper-fluid \"land of opportunity?\" The best current research determines, the Journal reports, that \"at least 45%\" and \"perhaps as much as 60%\" of \"parents' advantage\" is \"passed on to their children.\" If you go with the 60% estimate, Wessel notes, then rich peoples' inherited edge - and poor peoples' inherited disadvantage - go back as far as five generations. That happens to take us back to the end of the Civil War and the constitutional abolition of slavery.\n \n According to Chicago Federal Reserve economist Bhashkar Mazumdor, who matched government survey data with the Social Security records of thousands of men burn during the 1960s, just 14% of American men born to fathers in the bottom tenth of the wage structure have risen to the top 30%. Conversely, just 17% of men born to fathers in the top tenth have fallen into the bottom 30th. \n \n It gets worse, Wessel notes, when you factor in race. He cites economist Tom Hertz's finding that fully 42% of blacks born into the bottom tenth of families for income fail to escape the lowest ten percent. By contrast, just 17% of whites born into the bottom tenth stay there as adults\n \n\n \n The American dream is not so American anymore. Yes it appears that in the US you can become super rich easier then in Europe or Canada, but for the more typical individuals of society a lower economic status individual in parts of Europe, has a better chance of ending up at least middle class.",

That happens to take us back to the end of the Civil War and the constitutional abolition of slavery.\n\n 1. i'd like some of what i achieved to be passed on to my kids. so would you. or would you rather have the state take everything when you die to \"redistribute\" wealth?\n 2. taking the higher end of any range in order to prove a point only make the article seem agenda driven and biased\n \nAccording to Chicago Federal Reserve economist Bhashkar Mazumdor, who matched government survey data with the Social Security records of thousands of men burn during the 1960s, just 14% of American men born to fathers in the bottom tenth of the wage structure have risen to the top 30%. Conversely, just 17% of men born to fathers in the top tenth have fallen into the bottom 30th. \n\n 3. i hope he meant born and not burn\n 4. 14% going from bottom to top isn't bad. but if your born-into station matters so much, then why do more (17%) go from top to bottom?\n \nIt gets worse, Wessel notes, when you factor in race. He cites economist Tom Hertz's finding that fully 42% of blacks born into the bottom tenth of families for income fail to escape the lowest ten percent. By contrast, just 17% of whites born into the bottom tenth stay there as adults. \n\n 5. 58%, a majority of blacks in the bottom rise out of the bottom. not bad.\n 6. the fact that more whites (83%) rises out than black says that social mobility is very much real. yes white still have a 25% margin. but lets also consider what is not being stated, what are the absolute numbers of blacks rising compared to white. there are substantiall more blacks at the bottom 10 then white.\n \n It should also be noted that the Wall Street Journal's focus only on income mobility leads it significantly understate the real degree of socioeconomic immobility in the U.S. The astonishing extent of American socioeconomic and related racial disparity becomes more fully evident when you factor in wealth. In the U.S., the most unequal nation in the industrialized world, the top 1 percent owns more than 40 percent of the wealth. The top 10 percent owns two-thirds of US wealth, leaving the rest of us - 90 percent of the population - to fight it out for one third of the nation's assets.\n\n 7. i find this part commical. yes the wealth are wealthier than the poor, thus they own more. duh\n \nThings get worse, again, when you factor in race. By 1999, economist Thomas Shapiro finds, the \"net worth (all assets minus all liabilities) of typical white families was $81,000 compared to $8,000 for black families\" in the US. By the recessionary year of 2002, black net worth fell to seven cents on the white dollar.\n\n 8. this support my comment #6, that mobility measurement as a % must also be balanced by a comparison of absolute numbers.\n 9. \"typical\" is not quite a statistical term for comparison is it? especially since it did not specify that it was being compared to a \"typical\" black family. i'd also question why white net worth was not mentioned for comparison.\n \nEncouraging Inequality\n \n Mass popular ignorance of these and other facts indicating a predetermined and immobile class-race structure holds dark ideological significance in the U.S. False perceptions of the U.S. as a special land of rampant upward socioeconomic progress encourages many of its citizens to be more tolerant than Europeans of the deepening economic inequality that results from U.S.-led corporate globalization. As Wessel describes mainstream American wisdom, \"it is ok to have ever greater differences between rich and poor, as long as [your] children have a good chance of grasping the brass ring.\" People who accept the dominant U.S. mobility myth are more prone, Wessel notes, \"to elect politicians who oppose using the muscle of government to restrain the forces of widening inequality\" through such measures as an increase in the minimum wage. \n\n 10. the article also fails to support its allegation of encouraging inequality. it make a mention of ignorance leads to certain action but i'd hardly say that ignorances can \"encourage\" any agenda. and then it suggest that the government should interfere to redistribute \"equality\". fascinating. he should read soviet/communist history as to the success of wealth redistribution as a means toward greater equality. oh yeah, it wasn't a success.\n \n[b]Facts and Frames: The Wall Street Journal Has Not Turned Marxist\n[/quote]\n 11. that is because the writer of the article is a marxist.\n \n 12. no where in the article is mention of similar anaylysis for europe to even suggest that the US is better, worse, or same. as suggested by the opening paragraph\n \nHey, guess what: the social class into which you are born matters a lot when it comes to where you stand on the American socioeconomic ladder. It matters more in the United States, the supposed land of upward mobility, than it does in Europe. The American Dream of \"rags to riches\" is less livable in America than it is in the aristocratic Old World that America rejected when its founding document proclaimed that \"All Men Are Created Equal.\" \n\n but then the whole article was just one allegation after another without evidence of facts in support, or sufficient comprehensions of the quoted figures to support the allegation. \n sorry but this article is rubbish and what is worse, it is overly verbose.\n i give it a 4 out of 5 diarrhea score.",

Something that is both \"good\" for the economy (it encourages competition) as well as considered as a sign of justice (one should earn ones own status/position/wealth). \n \n C) Social mobility is a way to gauge the economic priviledges of wealth acquisition and wether the mechanism of attaining wealth are available to a select few alone or availabe to all.

Sure. But it's also a line from the recent public testimony of a champion of the free market: Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.\n \n \n America's powerful central banker hasn't suddenly lurched to the left of Democratic National Committee chief Howard Dean. His solution is better education today to create a flexible workforce for tomorrow - not confiscation of plutocrats' yachts.\n \n But the fact that Mr. Greenspan speaks about this topic at all may show how much the growing concentration of national wealth at the top, combined with the uncertainties of increased globalization, worries economic policymakers as they peer into the future.\n \n\n \n \n The above statement especially the bolded area is and should be the main concern about wealth concentration ( ie rich getting richer poor getting poorer).

The top 20 percent of supervisory, salaried, and other workers has.\n \n The result of this, said Greenspan, is that the US now has a significant divergence in the fortunes of different groups in its labor market. \"As I've often said, this is not the type of thing which a democratic society - a capitalist democratic society - can really accept without addressing,\" Greenspan told the congressional hearing.\n \n The cause of this problem? Education, according to Greenspan. Specifically, high school education. US children test above world average levels at the 4th grade level, he noted. By the 12th grade, they do not. \"We have to do something to prevent that from happening,\" said Greenspan.\n\n \n it is unclear to be whether this population ranks as mainstream or bottom quartile/fifth.",
