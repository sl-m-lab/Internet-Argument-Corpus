   "One of the many problems with John Kerry is that although he claims he'd never cede, \"the right to preempt in any way necessary to protect the United States of America,\" that doesn't square with what he says time and time again. I know -- a contradiction from John Kerry, who'd have ever believed it?\n \n But look back to Kerry's first congressional campaign, back in 1970, when he said in an interview with the Harvard Crimson,\n \n \"I'm an internationalist. I'd like to see our troops dispersed through the world only at the directive of the United Nations.\"\n \n Fast-forward to today. \n \n Kerry constantly complains that we don't have enough allies, even though we have 30 right now. Kerry claims that we didn't do enough to get the UN involved, but W. spent months and months haggling with them and only moved after they absolutely refused to act. You'll also often hear Kerry moaning about the fact that we're not as popular as we used to be in the world. Of course, Ronald Reagan won the Cold War by doing things that made him unpopular in Europe. Would Kerry be willing to go against world opinion the way Reagan did? That's VERY doubtful. \n \n And remember folks, Iraq was low-hanging fruit. They had been thumbing their nose at us, the UN, and the rest of the world for more than decade. \n \n So what happens if -- and this is entirely possible -- we come to the conclusion that the only way to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is a military strike? If that were to happen, let me tell ya', there wouldn't be 30 countries backing us taking action then. Would John Kerry be willing to move in to stop the \"Death to America\" crowd that runs Iraq from getting nukes? All available evidence suggests that the answer would be \"no\". \n \n Then there's North Korea. What happens if we come to the conclusion that the only thing that will force that poofy haired little nutball Kim Jung-Il to give up his nukes, short of a military attack, is a blockade that would infuriate the North Koreans? Then suppose (gasp of surprise) France doesn't go along with it at the UN security Council? What does John Kerry do? \n \n If you watch him, if you listen to him, if you look at his voting record, it is clear that if the choice was between letting North Korea have nukes or risking the disapproval of France and Germany, he's rather let the Norks keep their nukes. \n \n I can't speak for anybody else, but I don't want an \"internationalist\" to be our President. I'm not a \"citizen of the world,\" I'm an American and I expect our President to look out for American interests first and foremost. That doesn't mean the President shouldn't take what other nations have to say into consideration, but protecting America from terrorists who may be armed with nukes should be infinitely more important to our Commander-in-Chief than public opinion in France, Germany, or at the UN. \n \n \"Global Tests\" are for UN Secretary-Generals, not for men who are entrusted with protecting the United States from attacks that could make 9/11 look like a walk in the park. George Bush understands that, John Kerry does not, and that's a very important distinction between them.",

Your referral is inconsistent with the argument.

But asking the British for help and advice is ok, but the French...that's just inconceivable! \n \n Anyway, in googling to find where Bush asked the French for advice or help, all I could get was:\n http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/11/08/iraq.resolution/\n \nBush also called French President Jacques Chirac. Bush would not characterize the nature of the talks.\n\n God, I hope he didn't ask for any advice! \n \n But, I found something else that might be the spawn of more debate:\n http://www.progressive.org/april03/roth0403.html\n \nAt the time, even the French were praising Bush. He has resisted \"the temptation of unilateral action,\" said France's foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin. Amr Moussa, Secretary General of the Arab League, said \"the turn President Bush has taken in asking the United Nations to take up its responsibility is a good one.\" \n\n \n \nBut Bush's insistence that the Security Council back up its resolutions is selective in the extreme. Iraq is not the only country to violate Security Council resolutions. In fact, it is not the country that violates the most resolutions. That distinction belongs to Israel, which has violated thirty-two Security Council resolutions. Turkey has violated twenty-four, and Morocco sixteen, according to Stephen Zunes, associate professor of politics at the University of San Francisco and chair of its peace and justice studies program. By comparison, Iraq has violated seventeen resolutions.\n\n Of course it's not the number of violations you rack up, it's who your enemies are. Besides this war wasn't about UN resolutions, was it? \n \n \nA mere glance back at the U.N. Charter reveals how far from its letter and spirit Bush has now traveled. Article 2, Section 3, states that \"all members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means.\" And Article 2, Section 4, says, \"All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.\" Bush's entire discussion of \"regime change,\" his mobilizing of more than 200,000 troops, and his constant threats of force since September are in clear violation of this article.\n \n And if he goes on and wages aggressive war, which is \"the ultimate crime\" in international law, according to Michael Ratner of the Center for Constitutional Rights, he could be tried in an international court. \n\n So, under the UN charter (and the US and UK are members of the UN) the war in Iraq was illegal, as Annan said. Bush could (won't) be brought to trial. (Yeah, right. because it's not the first time...)\n \nThe United States waged war against Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos without formal approval of the Security Council. It also attacked, among others, Panama, Grenada, the Dominican Republic, and Libya, and it destabilized many more countries without such approval.\n\n \n \n\n In late February and early March, Bush put the United Nations in an impossible bind. \"He clearly has confronted the U.N. with an untenable dilemma of either being a rubber stamp for U.S. geopolitics or finding itself bypassed on a major threat to peace and security by the most important member of the institution,\" says Falk.\n\n Man, if that's not true, what is? \n \n\n What are the consequences of Bush's trashing the United Nations? \"The unilateral path is horribly destructive, and almost certain to be self-destructive,\" says Falk. \"As a precedent, it's horrible: An endless number of countries could invoke this kind of preemptive logic. China could use it against Taiwan, and it could lead to a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.\"\n\n \n\n Even for U.S. security, the approach is counterproductive. \"It will cause an international backlash, generate more suicide bombings, lead to more religious and political extremism, and possibly cause a fundamentalist takeover in Pakistan or Egypt,\" says Falk. \"It could be a geopolitical disaster.\"\n\n How prophetic.\n \n More prophecy:\n \nSuch a disaster is what impelled the career foreign service officer John Brady Kiesling, who was serving in the U.S. embassy in Greece, to resign from the State Department on January 27. \"The policies we are now asked to advance are incompatible not only with American values but also with American interests,\" he wrote in his resignation letter to Secretary of State Colin Powell. \"Our fervent pursuit of war with Iraq is driving us to squander the international legitimacy that has been America's most potent weapon of both offense and defense since the days of Woodrow Wilson. We have begun to dismantle the largest and most effective web of international relationships the world has ever known. Our current course will bring instability and danger, not security.\"\n\n \n \nThe final cost of this policy is internal. \"It could destroy democracy at home,\" Falk argues. \"The rising tide of opposition here and abroad will play into fearmongering and an expansion of government control over citizen rights. There is a kind of proto-fascist dimension to the current set of circumstances.\" Falk says he usually is loath to throw the term \"fascism\" around. \"But you have this crackdown, coupled with a consolidation of military power and a messianic view that the United States is the bearer of a benevolent future that justifies exterminating those who stand in the way,\" he explains. \"You have the convergence of religious evangelicals in the White House with geopolitical fundamentalists like Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz. We have never had this mixture of religious and secular extremists so close to the core of governmental power.\"\n\n Wasn't there another thread about fanatics somewhere?\n \n Anyway, the bias of the article is obvious. \n It just gets back to the heart of the whole \"global test\" vs. \"my way or the highway\".\n \n You can go through international democratic channels, or when you deem those channels unreceptive to your needs, you can circumvent international democracy with brute force, if you have it. It's a matter of deciding which is right and which is wrong, when it's right and when it's wrong.\n \n \n \n .",
