   "THINGS YOU MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT EVOLUTION\n - BTG No. 160a April 2002\n by John D. Morris, Ph.D.*\n \u00a9 Copyright 2003 Institute for Creation Research. All Rights Reserved.\n \"O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:\" (I Timothy 6:20).\n Recently I had the privilege of addressing a gathering of state legislators and other influential political individuals. These gifted men and women are typically highly educated, most having been taught evolution and an evolutionary worldview extensively and exclusively. Now, they have the power to establish educational guidelines and societal norms. Sponsors of the banquet requested a talk both informative and evangelistic. What can one say in 45 minutes to a gathering of influential leaders that will make a difference? I don't pretend to know what would be best, but perhaps you would be interested in what I did say. My talk was entitled, \"Three Things You May Not Know about the Theory of Evolution.\" I was speaking only from notes, but a summary of the talk, with a few alterations, appears below. \n Introduction \n I started with definitions for clarity. There is much misunderstanding of important words today, and some purposefully misuse words to confuse students and hide their true intentions. \n Science has to do with careful observations in the present. Unlike true science, both evolution and creation are, at best, historical reconstructions of the unobserved past since no one can empirically observe either. In reality they are complete worldviews, ways to interpret all observations in the present, and a basis for all of life's decisions. In previous years, \"science\" was understood to mean \"the search for truth,\" but many now limit that to a search for naturalistic explanations, even if that search leads to hopeless conclusions. \n Evolution implies \"descent from a common ancestor\" with all of life related, consisting of modified forms of very different things, such as a person descending from a fish. Evolution does not mean merely \"change,\" for all things change with time. For clarity we must restrict this term to meaningful change, especially the descent of new types of organisms from earlier, different ones. \n Creation denotes abrupt appearance of basic categories of life without any basic type having descended from some other category, and with no extensive change once the category appears. Lack of change is known as stasis. Fish have always been fish, ever since they first appeared, and dogs have always been dogs. Fish and dogs and all else may have varied a little, but did not come from a common ancestor. \n The term microevolution is sometimes used for small, horizontal changes that are readily observed (such as the various breeds of dog), while macroevolution implies large vertical changes (fish to dog) that have never been observed. These big changes constitute evolution as Darwin used the term and as the general public understands it. \n Furthermore, evolution, as understood by all leading evolutionists, textbook writers, and theoreticians, utilizes only natural processes, like mutation and natural selection. To leading evolutionists, only unguided random forces have been involved with no supernatural input allowed. \n Following are three important points about real evolution-significant changes-the origin of new categories of life from older different ones. Even if one is highly educated about evolution, he may not know these things, but this knowledge is essential if intelligent decisions are to be made. \n I. Evolution didn't happen. \n A. Random forces cannot account for life. \n The design we see in living things is far too complex, too designed, too engineered to be the result of mere undirected, random forces. Even the simplest thing we could call \"living\" is vastly more complex than a super computer and super computers don't happen by chance. Every cell is composed of many constituent parts, each one marvelously designed and necessary for the whole. Without any one of its parts, the cell could not live. All of it is organized and energized by the magnificent DNA code, an encyclopedia of information which, even though modern scientists can't read it, it is read and obeyed by the cell. Surely some things need a Designer/Author. \n B. Evolution (i.e., macroevolution) doesn't happen in the present. \n If it ever happened in the past it seems to have stopped. Maybe environmental conditions don't change much, or selective pressures are too little, but everyone knows that real macroevolution is not and cannot be observed today. \n Mutations, random changes in the DNA information code, are observed, but never do these \"birth defects\" add any innovative and beneficial genes to the DNA. Instead, mutations are either repaired by the marvelous mechanisms elsewhere in the DNA, or are neutral, harmful, or fatal to the organisms. \n Likewise, natural selection occurs all around us, but this only chooses from among the variety that already exists, it can't create anything new. Evolutionists may talk of actual selection as if it had a mind of its own and does the work of evolution on purpose, but it is inanimate and unthinking, impotent to bring about more than micro-evolutionary changes. \n C. Evolution didn't happen in the past. \n When we look at the record of life in the past, we see no conclusive evidence that any basic category arose from some other category either. We see that some categories have gone extinct, like the dinosaurs, but the rest fit into the same categories that we see today. We see dogs in great variety, even some extinct varieties, but no half dog/half something else. Evolutionists have a few transitional forms that are commonly mentioned, but if evolution and descent from common ancestors really occurred we should see multiplied thousands of transitional forms. We do not see them. \n The most famous living evolutionary spokesman, Dr. Stephen J. Gould, paleontologist at Harvard University, has made a career out of pointing out to his colleagues that the fossil record shows abrupt appearance and stasis. He is no friend of creation and yet as an honest scientist he must acknowledge this now well-known fact. He proposed the concept of \"punctuated equilibrium\" to account for the fossils in which life usually is in equilibrium, or stasis, and doesn't change at all. When a category of life encounters a sudden environmental shift, it changes rapidly into a different stable form, so rapidly in fact that it leaves no fossils. How convenient. Evolution goes too slow to see in the present, but it went so fast in the past it left no evidence. Gould is arguing from lack of evidence! \n But lack of transitional forms is exactly what should be the case if creation is true. The fossil record supports abrupt creation of basic kinds much better than either slow or fast evolution. \n D. Evolution can't happen at all. \n The basic laws of science are firmly opposed to evolution, especially The Second Law of Thermodynamics which insists that all real processes yield less organization and information in their products than in the original. This basic law leads to de-volution, not evolution. The presence of abundant external energy has never, as far as science has observed, produced beneficial mutations or added information to the genome as evolutionists claim. Instead, an abundance of incoming energy will hasten the deterioration of living things, especially the DNA. It will not bring about their evolution. Evolution is against the Law! \n Evolution doesn't happen, didn't happen and can't happen, and is fully unable to account for the design that we see. \n We've all heard the claim that \"evolution is science and creation is religion.\" This oft-repeated mantra originated with the testimony of Dr. Michael Ruse at the 1980 Arkansas creation trial. The presiding judge, known for his prior bias toward evolution, entered it into his formal opinion, and this flag has been waved by evolutionists ever since. But Dr. Ruse, an expert on the nature of science and scientific theory has recently admitted that he was wrong-that \"evolution is promulgated by its practitioners as . . . a religion, a full-fledged alternative to Christianity. . . . Evolution is a religion.\" Which brings us to point two.",

   "II. Evolution is a complete worldview. \n Evolution is the religion of naturalism, the antithesis of supernaturalism. It purports to answer all the \"big\" questions of life. \"Who am I?\" \"Where did I come from?\" \"Where am I going?\" \"What's the meaning of all this?\" Claiming that science equals naturalism excludes a Creator from science by definition. Even if that Creator exists and has been active, such a notion is unscientific. This religion of naturalism, that we are merely the result of blind random forces is logically compatible only with atheism. It has resulted in life without accountability to a Creator and has led to a licentious society full of great heartache, for evolution thinking underpins racism, abortion, infanticide, euthanasia, promiscuity, divorce, suicide, Social Darwinism, etc. While science and technology have accomplished great things, often by evolution believers, the concept of evolution itself has lead to nothing useful. \n III. The religion of evolution is the opposite of Christianity. \n Evolution can be summed up by the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" and the extinction of the unfit. The death of the majority allows the few with beneficial mutations to continue. The strong thrive at the expense of the weak and helpless. The only things that matter are survival and reproduction. Evolution starts with small beginnings and over time, with volumes of bloodshed and disease, arrives at man. As Darwin concluded in the last paragraph of Origin of Species, death, carnivorous activity and extinction produced man. \n Christianity poses a very different picture. It starts with a mighty Creator who created a \"very good\" (Genesis 1:31) universe, one in which was no pain, suffering, or death. He recreated His image in man, and graciously supplied his every need, including personal fellowship with Him. This perfection was rejected by man, and now all of man's domain suffers the \"wages of sin\" (Romans 6:23), deteriorating and dying under the effect and penalty of sin. All things had been placed under Adam's stewardship, and now all suffer under his penalty. Plants wither, animals die, people suffer and die. Even inanimate things deteriorate. The moon's orbit decays. The sun uses up its fuel. The entire creation suffers (Romans 8:22). \n Today we see extinction and survival of the fittest, but these are not creative processes, they are reminders to us to return to our Creator for His gracious solution to our sin penalty, for He graciously sent His Son to die as our sacrifice. The most fit of all, died for the unfit. He gives us eternal life as a free gift of His grace. \n Contrast these concepts with survival of the fittest and struggle for existence, and you will see them as opposites. While evolution offers nothing but struggle and ultimate elimination, Christianity offers everlasting life free from every struggle and death. \n Both evolution and Christianity are complete worldviews. Of the two, creation is better supported by scientific observation, and it alone makes sense out of life and eternity. \n * Dr. Morris is President of ICR.",

Evolution is a religion.\" \n \n \n Did Dr. Ruse like to pause in his writing or did you CONVENIENTLY leave something out? Dr. Ruse's ACTUAL comments were about scientists who were incorrectly treating the ToE as a religion and adding things which did not belong, like answers to the Ultimate questions (which religion answers), rather than secondary questions (which science answers).\n \n \nEvolution is the religion of naturalism, the antithesis of supernaturalism.\n \n \n No. The ToE, like the rest of science, merely does not invoke gods/demons/magic to explain phenomenon. It doesn't comment on those things at all. \n \"Joe, what was that noise in the attic? I think it was some leprechauns dancing.\"\n \"No way. It was probably just the pipes. The make noise all the time.\"\n \"Shut up, Joe.

Other than explaining the origin of homo sapiens, it doesn't attempt to answer any of those questions.\n \n \nfor evolution thinking underpins racism, abortion, infanticide, euthanasia, promiscuity, divorce, suicide, Social Darwinism, etc\n \n \n Yeah, the ToE is the cause of many things which existed long before the ToE and have nothing to do with it. \"Honey, did you know that life on this planet is related? I think we should get divorced.\"\n \n \nWhile science and technology have accomplished great things, often by evolution believers, the concept of evolution itself has lead to nothing useful.\n \n \n Evolution is behind antibiotics and other medicinal ideas.\n \n \nEvolution can be summed up by the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" \n \n \n No, it can't. Only third graders are taught that. Survival of the fit enough would be much more appropriate.\n \n \nEvolution starts with small beginnings and over time, with volumes of bloodshed and disease, arrives at man.\n \n \n lol, why do people arguing against evolution always mention death so often like it's the most horrible thing to ever occur in the universe? Without death, there wouldn't be life. Organisms die so other organisms can have food. If none ever died, the world would be suffocated with life.\n \n \nThe death of the majority allows the few with beneficial mutations to continue. The strong thrive at the expense of the weak and helpless.\n \n \n The strong don't have to thrive at the expense of anyone. The members of a species are usually cooperative. \n \n \n<snip preaching< Both evolution and Christianity are complete worldviews. Of the two, creation is better supported by scientific observation, and it alone makes sense out of life and eternity. \n \n \n No. Evolution is a scientific theory of biology. Christianity is a religion. Both serve different purposes. \n \n Creation is NOT better supported by the evidence, nor is observation the sole criteria upon which a scientific idea is judged. TheWorldWasMadeYesterdayInThisState idea agrees completely with ALL evidence, but that certainly doesn't give it credibility.",

   "Lappster seems to have conceeded the debate. Maybe he is reading some of the things that have been suggested.\n \n Well, I thought I might talk some of the ideas the lappster suggested a bit more.\n \nSounds a great deal like the skelital system of this pre-anphibian fish would not match it's other systems. This mutation would make it an easy prey for other carnivorous lifeforms. Such a mutation whould have a great deal of dificulty swimming, nor could the fins support the body outside of the water. It would seem to me that survival of the fittest should determine such a mutation should not be passed on. Thus this creature whoul be found as dinner to another.\n \n\n The topic at this point was the evolution of the amphibians from fish. Actually, it is the evolution of the tetrapods, animals with 4 limbs. Lappster's reference is to information posted in another thread about lobe finned fish.\n \n The period under discussion is the late Devonian. The Devonian is known as the \"Age of Fish\" because it is characterized by the dominance of fish. The age lasted roughly from about 408 million years ago to about 360 mya. This age is marked by the significant movement of plants onto land and their diversification. The first land plants appeared in the very late Ordovician or early Silurian (ca 438 mya). But the late Devonian is also marked by the appearance of tetrapods.\n \n The above quote is from lappster's last post. Both Karl and I questioned it but lappster failed to return. I hope here, rather than ask for lappster to support his assertions, to try to explain why he is wrong. In other words, I will support my assertions.\n \n At this point in time (more than 370 mya) several different, but obviously related lines of fish had evolved. There were the chondrichthyans or cartilaginous fish which are not involved in the discussion. Today these are represented by the sharks and rays. We are concerned with the osteichthyans, the bony vertebrates. Specifically, the above comparison that lappster made was between the actinopterygians, the ray finned fish, and the sarcopterygians, the lobe-finned vertebrates.\n \n Lappster asserts that the lobe finned fish would not have survived for 2 reasons:\n \n 1. the skeletal system would not \"match\" its other systems.\n \n 2. it would be easy prey because,\n a. lobe fins would make it difficult for these fish to swim, and\n b. the fins would not support the fish out of the water.\n \n Since he never returned, it is anyones guess what he meant with his claim 1, that lobe fins would not \"match\" the other systems. There are living lobe finned fish today, and I can't for the life of me figure out how their fins don't \"match\" the other systems.\n \n Claim 2b is irrelevant since we are discussing fish, in spite of the fact that some lobe finned fish do leave the water and pull themselves over land by means of their lobe fins.\n \n The issue is claim 2a, would the lobe fins make it difficult for these fish to swim and therefore make them easy prey. In order to judge this we must compare them to the fish from the same time period, the Devonian ray finned fish.\n \n In the ray finned fish, the paired fins were articulated with the shoulder girdle through a series of parallel bones (radials). The radials in turn support the bony fin rays. In Devonian ray finned fish the fins had a broad base that limited maneuverability. Modern ray finned fish, through evolution, have evolved a structure with a narrower base that makes the fins more maneuverable.\n \n But in lobe finned fish there was a single radial articulated with the shoulder girdle, with the other radials forming chains outward from the body. In addition to bearing the fin rays, the radials has muscles between them, making the fin segmented and strong. The narrow base made it more flexable and allowed the fin to rotate as well as to be raised and lowered.\n \n Now it seems to me that this strong, flexable fin would not have placed it at a disadvantage as a swimmer.\n \n What do you think, lappster?",

   "I was merely responding to some assertions that lappster made. He is just parroting the party line by doing his cut and paste from ICR. He stated that his intention was to discuss the topic and then demonstrated that he didn't even understand his own assertions. One thing you can always tell, when someone begins a \"scientific\" discussion with a Bible quote, they're going to dump on you.\n \nThere is much misunderstanding of important words today, and some purposefully misuse words to confuse students and hide their true intentions.\n\n Indeed. And Morris does as much as he can along those lines. The essay that lappster pasted is a good example. But Morris' purpose is to make it appear as if evolutionary biology is not science, so he misdefines evolution and misstates evolutionary theory. Why is it that a creationist can't what biologists say evolution is and how they think it works and argue against that? Why is it necessary to invent straw men?\n \nEvolution does not mean merely \"change,\" for all things change with time.\n\n Of course it doesn't mean mere change. It is change that occurs by specific means. Morris is trying to set up his argument that evolution is somehow progress. Creationists often claim that unless something gets better or there is some sort of progress then there isn't any evolution. Since evolution doesn't claim that there need be progress or improvement, the argument is a straw man. Now if Morris has a problem with evolution wouldn't it be more rational to argue against evolution as biologists define it rather than invent his own? But his own definition is much easier to argue against.\n \n For the record, the biological definition of evolution is a change in the frequency of alleles in a population over time. That's it. That isn't a statement of evidence, nor is it a statement of theory. It is the definition of what kind of change is evolutionary. In other words, the change must be heriditary, not \"merely\" change. Also note that individuals do not evolve, populations do.\n \nFor clarity we must restrict this term to meaningful change, especially the descent of new types of organisms from earlier, different ones.\n\n Nope. Morris' purpose here is to define evolution so that the kind of evolution he can't deny isn't really evolution. There is no requirement that changes are by some unstated definition \"meaningful.\" How is that to be determined? Neither is there any requirement of any new type of organism.\n \n You see, Morris knows that the myth of Noah's ark is impossible without evolution. If one uses the word \"kind\" as most people do, they are referring to species or even subspecies. But there are millions of species (estimates range between 5 million and 30 million). Creationists have come to realize this so they try to fix the meaning of \"kind\" significantly above the level of species. So Noah didn't take lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars, and cheetahs on the ark. He took the \"cat kind\" on the ark and somehow all cats descended from a single pair of the \"cat kind\" in only a few years. Now whether Morris or any creationist likes it or not, the descent of all of the above cats from some common ancestor is exactly what evolutionary biologists are talking about when they talk about evolution. The theories of evolution explain the mechanisms that cause such change (obviously genetic) and how they work.\n \n what is worse, the evolution required by the Noah myth is at rates that would make an evolutionary biologist's head spin. Not only is it evolution, it is hyperevolution. YOu see, even though creationists claim that all this change took place in about 4,500 years since the presumed flood (a mind boggling rate of evolution at that) they really don't have that much time. Neither history nor archaeology record such change. The animals we know today have been around pretty much the same for thousands of years, as did the mythical migration and repopulation of the earth (across oceans and barren land).\n \nThe term microevolution is sometimes used for small, horizontal changes that are readily observed (such as the various breeds of dog), while macroevolution implies large vertical changes (fish to dog) that have never been observed.\n\n Evolutionary biologists rarely use the terms microevolution and macroevolution. And even they they don't mean any sort of \"horizontal\" or \"vertical\" change, whatever that is supposed to mean. Microevolution is defined as change below the level of species. Macroevolution is above the level of species. Macroevolution as biologists use the term means Polar bear from Brown bear. By the way, there have been several instances of observed speciation.\n \nThese big changes constitute evolution as Darwin used the term and as the general public understands it.\n\n Interesting. Darwin didn't like the term \"evolution\" and never used it in the early editions of his book. And it is actually irrelevant how the general public understands it. What matters is how biologists understand it. If one is arguing against a definition not used by evolutionary biologists, one is arguing against a straw man.\n \nFurthermore, evolution, as understood by all leading evolutionists, textbook writers, and theoreticians, utilizes only natural processes, like mutation and natural selection.\n\n Absolutely true. And until someone can show some empirical evidence for for the supernatural, it will remain that way. I haven't heard yet how one can observe and test supernatural events. Science is naturalistic, not because it rejects God, but because science lacks the tools to study God. If I am wrong, then tell me how it should be done. But since evolution is the study of changes in living organisms, there is no need to resort to miracles and the supernatural. \"God did it\" doesn't answer any questions of science. In fact, it is giving up. So a parent asks, \"Why is my son dying from MD?\" \"God wills it,\" isn't much of an answer. However, using science to identify the very gene and the very allele of that gene that causes the disease and to work on ways to treat the disease are science.\n \nTo leading evolutionists, only unguided random forces have been involved with no supernatural input allowed.\n\n Natural selection is not random, and it is unguided only in the sense that there is no planned goal. If a genetic change is beneficial, it will likely be retained. If it is harmful, it will eventually be eliminated.",

Apparently it was pointed out so often that they decided to remove it. Here are the tenets of the ICR.\n \n http://www.icr.org/abouticr/tenets.htm\n \n It says essentially, whenever reality conflicts with mythology, reject science and believe mythology.\n \n The really scary part is this. \"ICR maintains that scientific creationism should be taught along with the scientific aspects of evolutionism in tax-supported institutions,...\" And that is the basis of the whole debate.

Darwin made a profound quantification of God in his elementary theory of species - one might say that the intellect of the Creator went off the scale.\n \n \n My statement about not finding much evidence for the Flood was a logical fallacy. For the sake of argument and hoping to gain a fighting advantage, I temporarily \"agreed\" with my opponent's claim about the paucity of proof in the geologic record. Naturally, I believe there is extensive evidence in the sedimentary rock and fossil record of a worldwide flood, not to mention the written records of ancient civilizations pointing to the event! As well, I know that the time-line from when the flood rains began and the deep opened up onto the earth until the last continent appeared whole and entire was longer than 150 days. Again, for the sake of argument, I was using the verse \"And the floodwaters prevailed upon the earth one hundred fifty days\" as a tool - it contained the shortest time period allowed in scripture to loosely describe the length of the flood. \n \n \n And no, I do not really believe that Adam was a scientist - at least not by today's standards. But one ridiculous remark deserves another, and you must admit that your statement, \"no real scientist has a ministry,\" was trivial and unfounded. Creation scientists, while not only providing credible answers to real science, are also doing ministry by propagating this foundational truth: \"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.\" Too, I know of practicing scientists of creationism who have overseen Bible Schools and pastored churches.\n \n Lurch: Where did all of that water come from? Where did all of that water go? ...the water necessary to cover Everest from present sea levels is more than the water on the planet.\n \n Answer is too easy to state. The record is available for all to read in Genesis.\n \n Lurch: There are two creation stories. \n \n Good observation, but an observation in favor of creationism. Textual criticism teaches that two or more differing accounts of the same event serve to further authenticate it.\n \n Lurch: They don't agree as to the sequence of events.\n \n Both highlight different aspects of the same event, and the second version might contain some metaphoric elements, but I do not see the creation sequence changed, as you note.\n \n Lurch: Of course. Your god did it just like the book of mythology says and then removed all traces in the geology of the earth and created evidence that the earth is very old.\n \n Removed traces of the flood? I cannot be sure which geologic traces you are looking for, looking at, or overlooking. The age of the earth? Scientific creationism allows for an old earth without divine intervention to create one. \n \n Three questions: What if Noah's ark is found at the top of the world? How would it impact your science?

If you can quantify your god, then your god is not infinite nor omnipotent.\n \nDarwin made a profound quantification of God in his elementary theory of species - one might say that the intellect of the Creator went off the scale.\n\n Where? References please.\n \nMy statement about not finding much evidence for the Flood was a logical fallacy. For the sake of argument and hoping to gain a fighting advantage, I temporarily &#8220;agreed&#8221; with my opponent&#8217;s claim about the paucity of proof in the geologic record. Naturally, I believe there is extensive evidence in the sedimentary rock and fossil record of a worldwide flood,\n\n OK. Please indicate which levels are the flood.\n \nnot to mention the written records of ancient civilizations pointing to the event!\n\n Which brings up the question of why the Egyptians have no record of the flood. They were building the pyramids a short time before when creationists claim the flood occurred. They didn't notice. Maybe the Bible is wrong and the flood wasn't universal, covering the highest mountains.\n \nAs well, I know that the time-line from when the flood rains began and the deep opened up onto the earth until the last continent appeared whole and entire was longer than 150 days. Again, for the sake of argument, I was using the verse \"And the floodwaters prevailed upon the earth one hundred fifty days\" as a tool - it contained the shortest time period allowed in scripture to loosely describe the length of the flood.\n\n Most creationists have told me that it was almost a year from start to finish.\n \nAnd no, I do not really believe that Adam was a scientist - at least not by today's standards. But one ridiculous remark deserves another, and you must admit that your statement, \"no real scientist has a ministry,\" was trivial and unfounded.\n\n No. No real scientist has a ministry.\n \nCreation scientists, while not only providing credible answers to real science, are also doing ministry by propagating this foundational truth: \"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.\" Too, I know of practicing scientists of creationism who have overseen Bible Schools and pastored churches.\n\n But there is no such thing as \"creation science\". It isn't science. Real science doesn't begin from the conclusion and try to make the evidence fit into the dogma.\n \nLurch: Where did all of that water come from? Where did all of that water go? ...the water necessary to cover Everest from present sea levels is more than the water on the planet.\n \n Answer is too easy to state. The record is available for all to read in Genesis.\n\n Oh. Mythology. It's magic, is that what you are saying?\n \nLurch: There are two creation stories. \n \n Good observation, but an observation in favor of creationism. Textual criticism teaches that two or more differing accounts of the same event serve to further authenticate it.\n\n But they aren't of the same event. They are quite different and were two of the creation myths of the early Hebrews.\n \nLurch: They don't agree as to the sequence of events.\n \n Both highlight different aspects of the same event, and the second version might contain some metaphoric elements, but I do not see the creation sequence changed, as you note.\n\n Have you read both stories carefully?\n \nLurch: Of course. Your god did it just like the book of mythology says and then removed all traces in the geology of the earth and created evidence that the earth is very old.\n \n Removed traces of the flood? I cannot be sure which geologic traces you are looking for, looking at, or overlooking. The age of the earth? Scientific creationism allows for an old earth without divine intervention to create one.\n\n I am looking for any traces of the flood. There are none. That conclusion was reached about 200 years ago by creationists. At first they proposed several successive creations and several floods. Finally they realized that there was no flood. Fundamentalism grew as an anti-science reaction to findings in geology and biology. \n \nThree questions: What if Noah's ark is found at the top of the world? How would it impact your science? Why so much opposition to a worldwide flood - why does it bother you so?\n\n It doesn't bother me. What bothers me is that creationists are trying to get their religion taught in public schools in science. Generally we don't do a very good job of teaching science. Our highschool graduates score near the bottom of kowledge of math and science when compared to other industrialized nations. Telling children that the Bible is valid science won't help.\n \n Well, if Noah's ark were found on top of a mountain, it would present a problem. One problem would be to explain how it got there since there is no evidence of a global flood and there isn't enough water on earth to cover the mountains. Merely reading a book of folk tales and crying miracle doesn't really answer any questions. \"It's god's will\" doesn't answer the question of why people die. If we depended on \"creation science\" we would still be having epidemics of small pox.\n \n So why does it bother you so much that your religious beliefs are not supported by reality?",

You will like a lot of what he has to say. Unfortunately, I cannot argue too much with it either. Here he is! :\n \n Well, you might not like my reply.

Just the fact that Jesus quoted from it doesn't necessarily mean that any part He didn't quote from is true--not even within the same book.

Genesis 2 and 3 are like that. The stories of Job and Jonah are just a little too neat and tidy. They have the feel of fiction. \n \n Though I'm loath to admit it, there are really contradictory sections here and there.

The apologist insisted that the Bible wasn't trying to make a scientific statement about bats being birds. This very same guy would turn around and insist that the Bible IS scientific when talking about creation.\n \n Even the apparent harmony of the New Testament is not especially good evidence when considering that Eusebius and his ilk who decided what would finally be included were not about to allow in anything that might not seem to fit.\n \n Does this mean the Bible isn't altogether true? Not necessarily. You correspondent alludes to Homer. For millennia we just assumed what he wrote was entirely fiction. But then Schliemann discovered that the city had been an actual place and now we believe that the events described in the Illiad are true in the main. Job and Jonah may refer to real events that have just been arranged poetically to the point that they just seem to be art. That's possible. Of course, some will insist that the stories have also been embellished with fanciful allusions to God the same way Homer spoke of gods.\n \n I long ago gave up the endeavor of trying to justify the Bible by reason. I don't have an especially good opinion of those who do. So many of their arguments would never convince anyone but the already convinced. In fact, some of our claims about the Bible are pretty outrageous. As Carl Sagan said, \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.\" We don't seem to be providing that proof. What we provide are excuses for believing what we want to believe.\n \n All of this concerns me. I remain convinced of the basic truth of the Bible and especially the Gospel. But honesty compels me to admit that there are things that not only do I not understand, but which my understanding contradicts. The virgin birth? The deity of Christ? His genuine death and resurrection? Those are easy. Despite what the skeptics say, those are easy to believe. A God who couldn't do all that and more hardly deserves to be called God. But there are things that disturb me deeply. There are things that to my mind just cannot be true--at least not according to an \"orthodox\" understanding. I won't even get into them here. I've written too much already.\n \n Gilgamesh? Like the similar Sumerian story of Ziusudra, the similarities seem largely superficial. They may in fact point back to the same event, but the Biblical story is much more developed and far less fabulous. If anything, the Noachic version is the more believable. Despite the great antiquity of the Gilgamesh account, I feel it's far more likely that it is a corruption of the Scriptural story than the other way around.\n \n Anyway, decide for yourself.

At that point, you, Karl, posted a response. Now I post this in answer to that:\n \n Karl said: It is obvious that you have much to learn from your brother. \n \n My brother sent a second e-mail to me and expressed this concern: \"I'll let you decide whether you want to forward [to the forum] what I wrote, but my vote would be against it. To the thoughtful Christian, my words would just inspire further thought and deeper digging. The skeptic would take them as an admission that we don't believe our own religion.\" \n \n So, if two such divergent groups both appreciate what my brother said, I am not surprised that you like his thoughts. My only question would be, \"Which one are you - the thoughtful Christian or the skeptic?\"\n \n Karl said: You seem to be missing the fundamental truth of the Gospels while losing your focus in a vain attempt to promote the \"validity\" of the text.\n \n The \"fundamental truth of the Gospels\" (your words) would have to be the one called Jesus of Nazareth in Palestine. My discussion validated him as a historical figure first, then all other figures and events second. In all fairness to me, no, I did not miss this truth. And it is never to lose focus, nor is it a vain exercise to promote the validity of old texts. When you pick up a book translated and copied from ancient manuscripts, you expect it to be as true to the original as is humanly possible. For that, you have textual analysts and critics to thank for their long, hard work. \n \n Karl said: If your ability to promote the message lies within inerrancy of the text, perhaps it's because you don't understand it in the first place.\n \n To bring up the concept of inerrancy is to unlock a whole different theological study than that undertaken here, so I will quickly brush by it and say this. No, I am not stalled by the presence of textual errors in the reporting of the acts of Jesus and his message. Historians and textual critics, in full view of early recording errors, additions, and deletions, have validated the historical Jesus and his central message with relative ease, for reasons I stated earlier. That grants me the unfettered ability to \"promote the message\" (your words above) without any thought of inerrancy. With regard to your mention above of my supposed misunderstanding, I can't be sure if you mean the message or the text of scripture, but I really have no problem understanding either in the New Testament gospels.",

None of that is useful. If you can quantify your god, then your god is not infinite nor omnipotent. \n \n Ok, I guess I will have to start at a theological point of reference, then push toward a more scientific. Christians hold to the belief that the man, Jesus, was God incarnate. Scriptures are not in short supply to support this. Paul wrote that in him lived the fullness of deity in bodily form. Psalms peers at him through prophetic lenses and we hear him utter to God, \"A body you have prepared for me.\" Upon his bodily resurrection after his passion and death, Jesus urges the apostles to touch the wounds in his side and hands. In the same setting, he defines what manner of new substance his body is when he terms it \"flesh and bones,\" proceeds to eat a meal with them, and moves freely through walls and shut doors. Later, after his ascension, John pens in his first epistle concerning him, \"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon and touched with our hands....\"\n \n In all of the above, Jesus as God, is quantified and seen to have size, weight, dimension, and identifiable physical traits. But if that is not a difficult enough concept, the next level of reality for this Jesus might be even harder to grasp. Based on the scriptures describing his role and position after the ascension, we understand that this quantified God-man holds an exalted office and is seated next to his Father God on a heavenly throne. \n \n In short, God has taken on self-imposed, definable limits. But, in answer to your concern above, nowhere do we get the sense that these limits hinder his infinite or omnipotent nature.\n \n I said: Darwin made a profound quantification of God in his elementary theory of species - one might say that the intellect of the Creator went off the scale. \n \n You: Where? References please. \n \n 1. His identification of the adaptations and permanent changes that species undergo through the governance of what he proposed as natural selection. 2. His discussion of hereditary traits and their role in ordering changes in species.\n \n I suppose, chiefly though, I had in mind the marvel of speciation. Of course, how a particular science or individual defines 'specie' will determine their ability to decide if a speciation event has really taken place in a controlled environment or in nature. Though it might be a fact that creationists will line up against evolutionists for some time to come on this issue, some creationists are coming around and facing some hard evidence in favor of this theory.\n \n However, I will be quick to point out that, whereas I might be willing to admit a single specie has branched into two, I would have to label this wonderful evolutionary event as downhill and not macro. My science would further inform me that sufficient genetic potential of a created nature was present in the parent population to give rise to this phenomenon without the introduction of new genetic information.\n \n You: OK. Please indicate which levels are the flood. \n \n Not an easy question to grapple with and an even harder answer to live with once a commitment is made. I believe the Cretaceous level marks the end of the Deluge and what is called the first world. To go out on a limb, I believe, at the very least, the Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods are answered in this single global catastrophe.\n \n You: Which brings up the question of why the Egyptians have no record of the flood. They were building the pyramids a short time before when creationists claim the flood occurred. They didn't notice. Maybe the Bible is wrong and the flood wasn't universal, covering the highest mountains.\n \n What clued you in to mention this? You have hooked one of the biggest fish in the skeptics pond! Where a written version of the Flood by this superior ancient civilization would have been an old-world trophy, I believe cultural anthropology holds the plausible answer about why the record is missing and why it would actually be more unusual to find one than not!

   "A response to the absence of a written record of the Flood in ancient Egypt.\n \n WHAT WE KNOW\n The historical continuity of ancient Egypt is not always as smooth as one might be led to think. The time from the end of the Old Kingdom extending into the First Intermediate Period is described as dissolution and collapse of old powers, political and social (and perhaps, environmental) upheavals, and the struggle to establish new rule. Millennia later, Manetho and other historians were faced with the task of reconstructing Egyptian history for this period of confusion and chaos when records were scarce or nonexistent. So desperate were these historians to find a historical footing in this uncertain time, that at least one has been accused of creating spurious kings. The only evidence we possess for the existence of the Seventh Dynasty is contained in two Manetho copies which are termed \"inconsistent, badly garbled, and heavily redacted.\" The copy prepared by Africanus opens the Seventh Dynasty saying, \"seventy kings of Memphis, who reigned for 70 days,\" which is surely figurative language meaning the period saw as many kings in as many days. Petty warlords ruled provinces. Ruling families ascended to power over entire regions, only to be ousted in short order. The country was fractured along three power centers. Overall, it was a time of political and social instability uncharacteristic of the enduring world empire we recognize as Egyptian. Strangely enough, no one can be for certain what happened at the close of the Sixth Dynasty to bring about this dire situation.\n \n Phiops (Pepe II) is the last king of the Sixth Dynasty with any significant rule, his son possibly succeeding him for the space of about a year. A Sakkara scribe presents his own king-list for this period under the cloud of an apparent curse - \"a plague on all your houses\" - suggesting that the time of tribulation started during or immediately following the reign of this king and his son. Probably acting from the bias that the true king would be the embodiment of the god Horus, the scribe edits his king-list for the duration of the kingdom fracture, and denies legitimacy to any ruler until several Dynasties later when Menthotpe II reunites Egypt.\n \n This censorship of information is really not surprising given what we have come to know of this ancient and mysterious civilization. Kings were autocratic and theocratic, a combination always lending itself to the exaltation and exultation of a single man and the repression of a people group. Heady kings who constructed immense burial monuments for themselves at great cost in money and human lives, were not willing that interlopers, whether barbarians or foreign gods, should stain the recorded history of their respective reigns. The socio-economic construct of the empire, with every level from slaves to the wealthy who owned lands and private burial plots, was not conducive to the democratic ideal of free speech and free press perfected in later world governments. And with scribes and priests being the authorized recorders of Egyptian history, we must content ourselves with their biases, inconsistencies, and deletions. In Manetho's favor, I believe he did the best he could with the history he was handed. Were our modern historians able to recover the records he worked from, I am not sure they could produce a much better line of continuity for Egypt's ancient past.\n \n WHAT I THINK HAPPENED\n In the end, we are left with the reality that a major event, or series of events, preempted the historical continuity of the Egyptian empire at or near the close of the Sixth Dynasty. To the point, I believe that around 2350 BCE, the Noachic Flood absolutely wiped clean the slate of Egyptian history for the space of 150 to 200 years. While the entire region lay uninhabited, peoples in the Shinar Valley in Mesopotamia increased in number. Gradually migration from the east began to repopulate the Delta and Nile Valley of northern Africa, and by 2150 BCE the reconstruction of Memphis, Thebes, and Herakleopolis was in full swing. \n \n The immigrant peoples that settled here were descendants of Egypt, the son of Ham, the son of Noah. I believe they reclaimed the region with the intent of reviving the ancient pre-Flood empire along with its language and religion. While warlords and influential families vied for power in the region, scribes and priests began studying unearthed written records of history, economy, cultural and social mores, language, and religion. Other learned men studied the region's infrastructure of roads, canals, and agriculture, undertaking repair operations and beginning new construction projects. \n \n I believe at the heart of this revivalist spirit in the people, was a defiance of Noah's God. Nimrod, their \"uncle\", had galvanized this same defiant attitude generations earlier in Shinar when he vowed that the next time Noah's God meant to flood the world, he would be ready with a tower of safety that exceeded the height of the mountains. Adding insult to injury, God had then interdicted Nimrod's work by confusing the language and understanding of the Valley peoples, an act which resulted in their dispersion throughout the deserted and hostile world. These grievances, passed down through generations, were like bitter seeds planted in the soil of the new Egyptian civilization. What sprouted was a religious and cultural bias that slanted the empire defiantly away from the God of the ancients - Adam, Seth, Noah - and prohibited the inclusion of his name and acts in their recorded history. So fine was the mesh of this Egyptian history sieve, even an anecdotal version of the Flood has yet to surface in the culture. And, Moses, whose birth is confirmed by Manetho and whose war triumphs as a general under the pharaoh are born out by Josephus, received no press at all when it came time for him and his God to pour out ten plagues of judgment on the land and drown the pharaoh's pursuing hordes.",

   "Good afternoon. Here is the piece of Egyptian lore I promised which seems to have sprung from the story of the Flood. By the way, Mark Isaak of The Talk/Origins Archive emailed and claims to have another written record from ancient Egypt. I am trying to get a copy of that.\n \n Ra was warned by the Watery Abyss that humans had grown too rebellious, so he took Hathor and ordered her to punish the people. \n Hathor went to earth and slew millions of humans. The streets of the town of Chetenuten began to run like a river with blood because of her horrific endeavour. So much blood drained into the Nile that it overflowed the riverbanks, and the bloody water flooded the land, destroying everything. This water eventually ran into the sea, which overflowed as well. Hathor began drinking this horrible mixture of blood and water. \n Ra was displeased with Hathor's work, as he had only wanted to punish, and not destroy, the human race. So he asked Thoth, the wisest God, for help. He then told the Goddess Sektet to mix together dada, fruit and barley to make beer. The beer was then to be mixed with human blood, in the hopes that it would attract Hathor. \n Ra's servants were then ordered to pour out the mixture on the remaining land near Hathor. The beer became a great sea, and Hathor was drawn to it by the smell of the blood. She drank the beer until she was so intoxicated that she staggered off to sleep, leaving the last few humans behind. \n From those humans, earth was repopulated. \n Ra left the upkeep of earth to Thoth from then on, and he went off to rest on the back of the great cow of heaven. Thoth taught humans how to be civilized.",

Even the simplest thing we could call \"living\" is vastly more complex than a super computer and super computers don't happen by chance.\n \n Then replied...\n Supercomputers are inorganic.\n \n So were the chemicals that are supposed to form abiogenesis, or 'chemical evolution' as I've heard it called.*\n \n You talked about a spear in a mammoth as an example of observation on past events ... where was abiogenesis observed?\n \n In fact to believe in it is to go completely against 400 years of scientific method!\n \n Up till the 1600s people believed in abiogenesis, called then \"Spontaneous Generation\". Through hypothesis, experiment and observation, it was shown that Spontaneous Generation does not happen.\n \n Now, without benefit of observation, evolutionaries sell you abiogenesis.\n \n Granted that one deals with a fully-formed much more complex system, such as a maggot...and the other deals with a completely hypothetical and unseen critter which not even the scientists can agree what it was...They say, it's not a bacteria, not even a photo-bacteria, not even a proto-photo-bacteria, but something even more simple (and unknown/unprovable). (So much for needing evidence!)\n \n And of course there's the old conundrum of how do you get life forming in an oxygen free atmosphere when you'd need ozone to protect the newly formed life, but that oxygen-free is a necessary for these chemicals to come together.\n \n Then they suppose that in the primordial soup, that the fledgling life was deeper down, to protect it from UV, however, if it was so far down, it couldn't have worked well at being photo-dependant.\n \n *Indeed what 'survival of the fittest' concept could you apply for chemicals coming together?

   "You don't seem to understand science.\n \n SETI does not assume that there is extra terrestrial intelligence. They admit the possibility that it may exist. That is the hypothesis, not an assumption. That is one difference between real science and the pseudoscience of \"creation science.\"\n \n For example, in spite of the ignorance of most creationists who insist that evoltuionary theory includes the origin of life, it isn't true. Evolutionary theory explains observed changes in the genetic makeup of living things. Life is assumed and no attempt is made to show that it exists or to find how it came about. Evolutionary science doesn't deal with the origin of the universe, the solar system or the earth. They are assumed to exist. All of those assumptions are for other fields of knowledge to investigate, but evolutionary biology does not.\n \n \"Creation science\" on the other hand, assumes a creator and then selects evidence in an effort to demonstrate the assumption. Mostly, creationists don't present evidence in support of their position. Mostly, creationists pick and choose isolated tidbits of real scientific fact in an effort to make it appear that science (cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, nuclear physics, botany, zoology, population genetics, genetics, molecular biology, geology) is wrong.
