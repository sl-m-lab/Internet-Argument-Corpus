   "Never Forget the Hmong Massacre\n \n by Jay White\n \n AS NEWS OUTLETS around the country reported Monday, Hmong 'refugee' Chai Soua Vang, a trained military sharpshooter, shot eight hunters, all of them White, Sunday morning in Wisconsin's North Woods after he was caught trespassing on private property and occupying a tree stand there. Five of the hunters died at the scene, and three were seriously injured.\n \n Continued (photos of the victims) :\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=4249\n \n \n Click for graphic:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/images/news/asian_killer_wisconsin.jpg\n \n \n  Killer Plays Race Card\n \n Vang says the group made racist comments and told him to get off the property. As he walked away, he says he saw one White man point a gun at him and shoot. That's when he opened fire, according to court documents filed Tuesday.\n \n Vang's brother, Sang Vang, 33, said the killer was provoked by derogatory racial comments. \"He is a reasonable person,\" he said.\n \n One of the witnesses, a hunter who was wounded in the shootings, gave a statement contradictory to Vang's. Lauren Hesebeck said a member of the hunting party shot at Vang only after he started firing at them and that no racist comments were made, according to court documents.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=4242\n \n \n \n .",
