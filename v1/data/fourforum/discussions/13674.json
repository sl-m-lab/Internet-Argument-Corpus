   "I always hear about how the evil rich Republicans are the bane of the poor.\n \n Yup. All those evil corporate Republicans are out to do nothing but keep the downtrodden.......downtrodden.\n \n The Republican fat cats never do anything but line their pockets at the expense of the poor, minority, and working people.\n \n \n Yet I drove around several slums in St. Louis the other day. It got me to thinking......\n \n ......Certainly, if the evil Republicans were so hateful in keeping the poor in their place, they were doing an excellent job of it in the areas I drove through.\n \n Guess who controlled those areas of urban blight?\n \n Yup. PURELY DEMOCRAT!\n \n Missouri has a Democrat governor. St. Louis has a Democrat mayor, and the areas I drove through were all PURELY CONTROLLED by Democrat aldermen and Democrat controlled municipalities.\n \n I wonder what party most of the people in blighted areas of other cities vote for? I know here in St. Louis. I only have a well founded suspicion about other cities. Check for me, will ya'?\n \n So, what I need help with from a liberal perspective, is:\n \n If the Republicans are so good at keeping the poor in their place, why are the blighted areas completely controlled by Democrats?\n \n I mean, if Democrats were so loving and caring about the poor, how come their system hasn't helped those areas that have been under THEIR COMPLETE CONTROL for generations?\n \n If I were to look around and say, \"Hmmmm. This area over here is nice, crime free, respectable, and generally a nice place to raise a family. Funny, it is controlled by one of those evil Republicans.\n \n \"This area over here is covered in grafitti, has a crime problem, drug dealers on every corner, and nobody seems to be at work on a Tuesday afternoon. There must not be any jobs here. Strange, it has been controlled by Democrats for the past 50 years.\"\n \n WHY, ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH, SHOULD I VOTE FOR A DEMOCRAT?\n \n Explain the logic that says \"Hmmmm. All these evil rich Republicans are living in these big ol' mansions in snooty neighborhoods. All those Democrats are mired in gangland squalor with grafitti covered garage doors. I think I'll elect a Democrat to run my area. They seem to be doing such a great job in the decades they've completely controlled these urban places.\"\n \n If Republicans are so rich, why DON'T you want them to run things in your neighborhood?\n \n Yeah. Rich people running things. That's not for me. I choose to elect the guy who has kept the side of my house covered in gang signs for the past ten years.\n \n Look at St. Louis' North County. Nothing but squalor. Killings every weekend. Drug busts every day. Just drive down Kingshighway. Boarded up windows, burned out cars. Spray paint \"tags\" everywhere. Oh, and \"re-elect Quincy Troupe for alderman\" signs. The place has been COMPLETELY CONTROLLED BY DEMOCRATS for as long as I can remember.......\n \n \n ....but I thought Republicans were bad. How come, if Democrats are so awesome, they haven't made North County into a paradise? They've had 50 years of complete control to do it. \n \n Help me out.\n \n .......'splain it to me.\n \n .......Howzat work, 'zactly?",

   "The point that Superlite is making which Jason seems anathema to either recognize or accept is that the standard operating procedures of republican principles, when allowed to work, always lead to social prosperity from the top down in the communities which practice them. Policies like lower taxes, business incentives which increase hiring and investments in small business which is the largest segment of the american economy. \n \n Every single policy Obama is instituting is destroying growth, hiring and investment in all businesses in America now. How can employers expand their business when banks tell them \"Sorry\", we aren't lending any money for any reason for the rest of the year? Then why the bank bail out to motivate lending when nobody is being forced to lend? Or when employers don't have any idea how much this new socialized medicine debacle will cost them? Also, don't forget about the AGW scam which will cost the tax payer untold billions of dollars if this fascist in the making gets his way. \n \n And what do we the people do about a government which continues to print money like its toilet paper as the dollar plunges so low that OPEC will no longer accept it from countries for the purchase of oil, the previous only acceptable currency for oil purchases since WW2, due to their concern for its impending crash in value? How can his so called objective supporters be so blind to these realities as they continue to carry his water and defend his lies?\n \n Why do these ignorant leftists point to Obama as a capable intellectual when every move he and the dems are making is designed to bankrupt our economy and bring us to the level of a third world country? How can these sheeple not recognize that they have supported and defended the source of their own personal future economic, social and financial destruction? What miracle do they expect to rise up and save us when our own president is working to collapse the very free market system which made us the envy of the world? And here is how they are doing it. In the past eleven months, Pelosi and her puppets have PROPOSED HUNDREDS OF TAX INCREASES on hard working Americans. Some examples include:\n \n Allowing the 2001 and 2003 Tax Cuts to expire\n War Tax\n Tobacco Tax\n National Energy Tax\n Stock Tax\n Securities Tax\n Health Savings Account Tax\n Health Insurance Tax\n Business Healthcare Tax\n Personal Healthcare Tax\n Eliminating middle-class Making Work Pay tax credit\n International Business Tax\n Small Business Tax\n Gas Tax\n Mileage Tax\n Payroll Tax\n Reducing Personal Income Deductions\n \n Are these the actions of a party which is looking out for the little guy?
