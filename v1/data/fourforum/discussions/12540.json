   "Just read the following story.\n \n My question is thus, should this child be put to death per bible based rules governing a child's unruleiness?\n \n \nMost kids complain bitterly when they are grounded. Some will sneak out, while others will settle for slamming doors and announcing that they hate the person making the rules. But sometimes, kids get creative when they're punished: A 6th grader in Quebec sued her dad because she felt that his punishment was too harsh. \n \n The 12-year-old girl's parents are divorced; in the spring of 2008, the girl's mom gave her permission to go on a class trip to Quebec City in June. But the middle-schooler lived with her father, and after she disobeyed daddy's orders to stay off the Internet, he told her she couldn't go. So what did she do? She took him to court. Of course.\n \n A lower court ruled in favor of the girl, who went on the embattled class trip. Her father appealed -- on principle - -and amazingly, the girl won again. The father's attorney, Kim Beaudoin, says that her client is \"flabbergasted\" and they are considering another appeal, this time to Canada's Supreme Court. But, the attorney adds, the father has no regrets about the court proceedings. \"Either way, he doesn't have authority over this child anymore. She sued him because she doesn't respect his rules,\" Beaudoin said. \"It's very hard to raise a child who is the boss.\n",

Start here!\n THE EVIDENCE FOR JESUS'RESURRECTION.\n \n The most powerful sign of all that Jesus is who He claims to be, namely the Son of God, is His resurrection from the dead (Acts 2:29-36), Romans 1:4). Here again we are faced with a question of huge implications: Did it happen? Is the Easter story the great exception to the \"usual dreary end of human life?\" Some consider the resurrection of Jesus Christ to be superstition. But take notice of the following partial review of the evidences supporting it as one of the sure and certain events of history.\n \n A critical debate on the question \"Did Jesus rise from the dead?\" took place recently between world-renowned atheistic philosopher, Dr. Antony Flew, and New Testament scholar, Dr. Gary Habermas. A panel of five philosophers from leading universities judged the outcome. What was the conclusion? Four votes for Habermas. None for Flew. And one draw. One respondent to the debate, philosopher Charles Hartshorne, admitted against his own bias, \"I can neither explain away the evidence to which Habermas appeals, nor can I simply agree with Flew's or Hume's positions.\"20 Dr. Flew was judged to have retreated into philosophical sophistry while evading a whole host of widely-acknowledged historical facts.\n \n TWELVE WIDELY-ACKNOWLEDGED HISTORICAL FACTS\n \n These facts include: \"(1) Jesus died due to the rigors of crucifixion and (2) was buried. (3) Jesus' death caused the disciples to despair and lose hope. (4) ...Many scholars hold that Jesus' tomb was discovered to be empty just a few days later. (5) ...At this time the disciples had real experiences that they believed to be literal experiences of the risen Jesus. (6) ...The disciples were transformed from doubters who were afraid to identify with Jesus, to bold proclaimers of His death and resurrection, even being willing to die for this belief. (7) [The resurrection] was central to [their message] and (8) ...proclaimed in Jerusalem [where critics could easily examine the facts surrounding the tomb]. As a result... (9) the Church was born and grew, (10) with Sunday the primary day of worship. (11) James [Jesus' skeptical brother], and (12) Paul, the great persecutor of the faith, [were both converted by the resurrection].\"21\n \n So momentous was this single event in the First Century, its effects have been described as a \"widening circle of ripples\" from \"a boulder crashing into the pool of History.\" 22 In one of the oddest turns in history, a message resting on the death of a condemned outcast (1 Corinthians 1:23) came to be proclaimed as the foundation for \"good news\"-which is what the word Gospel means. Equally amazing was the extent of the transformation of the Mediterranean world following from its proclamation. The impetus for this movement was the conviction that the same Jesus who was crucified was now seen alive again. These facts are admitted even by knowledgeable skeptics.23\n \n The Easter story, of course, has had its critics, ever since Day One. From the account of the first guards in Matthew 28:11f, all the way to the present, there have been efforts to explain away the resurrection. Each new attempt, however, is more perverse than those which came before,24 while still failing to account for the range of indisputable facts. Let's look at the weaknesses of six objections most frequently leveled by critics.\n \n OBJECTION: \"THE EASTER ACCOUNTS ARE MYTH; NOT HISTORY.\"\n \n ANSWER: Negative critics charge that the Gospels have cloaked the original \"primitive\" Jesus (who is represented in the hypothetical Gospel of Q-see endnote 19), in layers of legend and myth.25 Yet there are at least FOUR REASONS why the mythological interpretation fails. Firstly, comparative literature demonstrates that myth requires a number of generations to develop. There are simply no parallels in other literature of myth developing and being believed in the presence of eye-witnesses and within the short time-frame in which the New Testament was formed.26 Secondly, many of these eye-witnesses to His public ministry were hostile toward the Jesus the Gospels describe (Matthew 12:22f). These opponents had both the motives and the means to correct falsehoods about Him had the first disciples attempted them.27 Yet their opportunity did not produce a serious correction. Thirdly, the Gospels are demonstrably independent from the mystery religions. Nor do they resemble either pagan myth or Jewish legend.28 Rather, the Gospels are absent of embellishment and naked in their descriptions. They betray no burning desire to persuade. They also lack theological reflection, but to the contrary, use rather \"primitive\" language (\"the first day of the week\"-Matthew 28:1, John 20:1, as opposed to \"on the third day\"-1 Corinthians 15:4). They also contain other details that are counter-productive to the invention of legendary heroes. For example, the following six factors in John chapter 20 are at odds with the tendency of legendary material: a) With great restraint, no attempt is made to describe the actual drama itself of Jesus rising from the dead. b) Mary neither recognized Jesus (the \"hero\") initially (v.14), c) nor even considered there was anything special about Him (v.16). d) Indeed, even by the end of the day His disciples were still in hiding \"for fear of the Jews\" (v.19). e) And were the Gospels the product of paternalistic (male dominant) bias, as feminists charge, it is incredible their alleged \"inventors\" would have chosen to create women as the first witnesses of the Risen Jesus. The testimony of women didn't even count legally in ancient Middle Eastern cultures.29 f) Yet it was their courage going to the tomb on Easter morning that effectively put the men's contrasting cowardice to shame. Fourthly, the Jews were the poorest candidates for inventing a mythical Christ. No other culture in history has more opposed mythically confusing deity with humanity, than they.30\n \n OBJECTION: \"MIRACLES ARE NOT POSSIBLE.\"\n \n ANSWER: The success of modern science in explaining the world in terms of cosmic regularity has led some to rule out miracles as an outmoded and impossible concept. Yet that is an unwarranted philosophical assumption and not a scientific conclusion. And philosophy cannot dogmatically forbid miracle apart from proof of no reality outside of nature. Once the existence of a transcendent, wise and powerful God (as in the God of Israel) is granted as a possibility, miracles can't be dismissed out of hand. For the actual strength of the case for His existence consider the 2nd reference in both endnotes no. 1 and 36. Skeptical prejudice typically leads to an evasion of the evidence, rather than to that kind of critical analysis which is required on a case-by-case basis.31\n \n OBJECTION: \"THE BODY WAS STOLEN.\"\n \n ANSWER: The tomb was indeed empty.32 Yet neither the Jewish nor the Roman leaders, who had the tomb guarded (Matthew 27:62f), would have taken the body. Rather, both had every motive to produce the body publicly in order to humiliate the first disciples and nip their movement in the bud. And since the scene in question was right at Jerusalem, it was completely within their power to locate the corpse should it still have existed. Yet to their dismay, no such body was ever produced.\n \n In addition to the hostile guards, Jesus' followers likewise had no incentive for hiding the corpse to pretend the resurrection. The dire consequences of their loyalty to Him included beating, imprisonments, and even death. No sane person chooses these for what they know is false. Under such pressures liars confess their deceptions and betray their cohorts.\n \n Some assert, however, that Jesus was raised only spiritually and not bodily, so that whether the body remained in the tomb is irrelevant. But Jewish anthropology rejected both the body/soul dualism and the notion of the immortality of the soul of Greco-Roman thought. Judaism could not conceive of a \"spiritual\" resurrection without a body. And if it indeed actually had happened that Jesus' body remained in the grave, Paul's teaching on the resurrection of the body (1 Corinthians 15) would have attempted to reconcile the apparent contradiction.33\n \n OBJECTION: \"JESUS MERELY RECOVERED FROM HIS WOUNDS\".\n \n ANSWER: Crucifixion was in reality an excruciating experience-indeed, these two words are clearly related. The cause of death by crucifixion was multi-factorial and torturous! These factors included exhaustion asphyxia, dehydration, and congestive heart failure.34 That Jesus could have survived such agony on a Roman cross, to limp out of the tomb by His own power is improbable enough! That His bloodied appearance could have been overlooked, so that He could deceive despairing disciples into believing He was the \"Risen Lord of Life\" is absurd! And such an attempt would have incriminated Jesus as a fraud. Only a supernaturally raised Jesus was capable of healing and empowering the broken hearts of the disciples.\n \n OBJECTION: \"THE WITNESSES WERE JUST 'SEEING THINGS.'\"\n \n ANSWER: On one point virtually all scholars of every stripe agree: The first disciples were themselves utterly convinced they had seen the risen Christ.35 The Easter message breathes through virtually every New Testament document. So the real question is, how do we account for their obvious conviction? Were they just hallucinating? While sounding plausible, many factors contradict it.36 For one, the large number of witnesses (1 Corinthians 15:5-8), covering the spectrum of personality types (John 20 -- Peter, Thomas, the two Marys, etc.), contradict the theory of hallucinations which, by definition, are not shared experiences. Also, the substantial, permanent, and positive change in lifestyle of many of the converted overthrows any theory of hallucination. Jewish scholar, Dr. Pinchas Lapide, has written:\n \n When this frightened band of Apostles suddenly could be changed over-night into a confident mission society...Then no vision or hallucination is sufficient to explain such a revolutionary transformation.\n \n \n OBJECTION: \"THE EASTER STORIES ARE FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS.\"\n \n ANSWER: The Gospels admittedly take work to reconcile. But this problem, as it is typically framed, is vastly overstated. It is important to note that a contradiction goes beyond two parties merely sharing differing sets of observations (which may both finally be shown to be true). Contradictory observations must be shown to be impossible to reconcile. It is true that Matthew focuses on Jesus' Galillean appearances while Luke gives his entire attention to His appearances in Jerusalem. Yet neither says He only appeared in their respective areas. So there is no reason to infer from either of them dishonesty or ignorance of the larger story. Reporters to any event (secular or religious), following all standards of accuracy and integrity, will each edit their stories differently with their eyes on what is relevant to their readers. Since none of the Gospel writers were \"under strict orders\" to tell absolutely everything Jesus ever did, the rigid demands of the hypercritics that all four Gospels tell exactly the same story, are arbitrary and artificial. Regarding Easter morning's first hours, Dr. Sayers provides urgently needed common sense by writing:\n \n One is often surprised to find how many apparent contradictions turn out to be not contradictory at all, but merely supplementary... Divergences appear very great on first sight... But the fact remains that all of the [Easter accounts], without exception, can be made to fall into a place in a single orderly and coherent narrative, without the smallest contradiction or difficulty and without any suppression, invention, or manipulation, beyond a trifling effort to imagine the natural behavior of a bunch of startled people running about in the dawnlight between Jerusalem and the garden.38\n \n FURTHER EVIDENCE FOR THE RESURRECTION\n \n The explosive growth of the Church demands the resurrection of Jesus to account for it. It wasn't the powerful, backed by armies, wealth, and prestige, but mere commoners,39 burdened with every cultural strike against them (1 Corinthians 1:26f), whose Easter message peacefully overcame the Roman Empire. Who could have predicted such an impossible feat? Yet the \"impossible\" actually did happen!40\n \n That Christianity had its origin in Judaism41 is further evidence for His resurrection. What else could have led so many Jews who had longed for a military deliverer, instead to accept a shamefully hung \"criminal\" (Galatians 3:13) as their promised Messiah? And what else could have moved Jews to break their monotheistic42 convictions to worship Jesus as God the Son (John 1:18, Acts 6:7), or change their day of worship from Saturday to Sunday (Acts 20:7)? Jewish bias against the Jesus of the New Testament was massive. A mere invented myth would have been powerless to overthrow their hopes and traditions in favor of a condemned outcast.43 Neither could metaphor have empowered Jews into their willing martyrdom.\n \n In addition, the conversion of Saul of Tarsus points to a momentous miracle. Without question something major happened to this most influential figure of the entire 1st Century apart from Christ.44 Having begun as a violent enemy of the Church (Acts 8:3; 9:1), he was utterly turned around into becoming Jesus' servant. Henceforth choosing suffering for Christ's sake (2 Corinthians 11:23f), Paul gave up all he had, endured persecution, and preached \"Christ crucified\" in city after city all the way to Rome, where he died a martyr's death. For reasons described in the previous paragraph, his new faith was \"miles\" from a natural progression out of Judaism. Nor was his conversion impelled by a sense of guilt and inadequacy. Rather, he had been a proud and satisfied Pharisaic Jew (Galatians 1:13-15, Philippians 3:4-7). Nothing short of an encounter with the risen Christ has remotely explained his major about-face.\n \n The other Apostles also, overcame fear to brave suffering, imprisonment, and death as they proclaimed the Good News of the Risen Christ across their world. Is it thinkable these people would die so willingly for merely a myth?45 In contrast to others who have died for an unverifiable hope beyond the grave (e.g. mystics seeking reincarnation or Moslem militants expecting reward from Allah), Jesus' disciples lived and died for the publicly verifiable claim that the grave was empty and He was seen alive again. Legal scholar, Dr. Simon Greenleaf, writes::\n \n Propagating this new faith, even in the most inoffensive and peaceful manner, [early Christians received] contempt, opposition ...and cruel deaths. Yet this faith they zealously did propagate, and all these miseries they endured undismayed, nay rejoicing. As one after another was put to a miserable death, the survivors only [continued] their work with increased vigor and resolution...The annals of military warfare afford scarcely an example of like heroic constancy... and unblenching courage...If it were morally possible for them to have been deceived in this matter, every human motive operated to lead them to discover and avow their error...From these [considerations] there is no escape but in the perfect conviction and admission that they were good men, testifying to that which they had carefully observed...and well knew to be true.46\n \n THAT CONCLUSION WHICH LEADS TO A NEW BEGINNING\n \n \"Easter is not primarily a comfort, but a challenge,\" writes J.N.D. Anderson, late Dean of the School of Law at the University of London \"...If it is true, then it is the supreme fact of history, and to fail to adjust one's life to its implications means irreparable loss.\"47\n \n Indeed, this essay is not about mere historical curiosity, but about an event of enormous consequences to you. For according to Romans 1:4, Jesus' resurrection affirms the Bible's high claims about Him (see p. 2 of this essay), and that He is the way to heaven that God has provided (John 14:6, Acts 4:12). It guarantees there will be a Last Judgment (Acts 17:31), and that there is a Heaven and a Hell (Revelation 1:18). Yet this Risen Christ offers the forgiveness of sins and everlasting salvation for whoever believes in Him (John 11:25,26, Romans 4:24,25). Everyone is inescapably affected by these implications. Therefore you cannot afford to remain an agnostic regarding Jesus and His claim on you. While many today are indifferent to such matters, avoiding Him is not an honest proposition. The mounting evidence supporting His claims demands your consideration.\n \n And consideration is demanded not only for your intellect, but for your whole being! For the One who is \"Alive forevermore\" (Revelation 1:18) says, \"Behold I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and [fellowship with you]\" (Revelation 3:20). By \"door\" is meant access to your heart, mind, and will. Jesus wills entry into your life that He may be your Savior and Lord. So \"Today...Do not harden your heart\" (Hebrews 4:7). Rather, open your heart, and let the One who died and rose for you come in!48Evidence for Physical Resurrection of Jesus",

That should be FINE for every tru(tm) believah here.\n The kid's guilty.\n \n \n \n Of course EZ, if you're going to cite scripture, please cite the ones that state that Jesus IS God.\n You know, where He says 'The Father and I are One' and 'When you see me, you see the Father.'\n Stuffs like that.\n \n Then, use your magic to translate that to mean that they are the exact same entity.\n Rather than an analogy to mean that 'When you see my son, you are seeing my likeness.'\n \n \n \n And Archy,\n WHY do you always have a habit of cutting and pasting someone elses nonsense?\n I can understand it once in a while, or when a brief snippet is used to stress a point you're trying to make.\n But, typically, a sample reading of a few sentences leaves many of us non-plussed. I don't want to scroll through 5 screens worth of drivel.\n \n The majority of Christians don't read much of their bibles.\n Most barely have a working knowledge of what it acgtually states.\n A lot tend to interject current teachings and beliefs into it that it doesn't state.\n In effect, the vast majority of Christians are as 'Christian' as Pres. Obama is. i.e., mostly atheistic with a thin coat of christinish gilt to help them blend in with the others who do the same. At best, doing things because it's TRADITION.\n \n Most of those who DO know what the bible says either ignore chunks of it.\n Or, realize how insane it is.\n Or, are insane enough to accept it's insanity.\n \n The first are 'liberal' Christians. Those who graps at concepts and philosophy.\n The next are those who reject it for atheism or some other belief system.\n The last...are you guys...nutters.\n \n If Jesus were a living person today, unless he pulled some authentic magic tricks, he'd be in a padded room on mega doses of anti-psychotic medications.\n Just like all the other people who make such claims and engage in such beliefs.\n \n Or, if he were very fortunate, he'd have a small group of like minded wackos living in a compound somewhere pushing some self-fulfilling prophesy about how those in the corrupt world were out to get them and they needed to do criminal things (by mans law of course) to save themselves.\n \n Oh well,\n \n Happy Resurrection Day.\n emoticon_hb",

I could swear there are people here actually calling for the brutal murder by stoning of a disobedient child. It might have just been a bluff to illustrate the reductio ad absurdum of biblical barbarism, but it does seem that a number of people have voted in favor of the punitive extreme.\n \n I'll spare you people my rant, until I can be sure I am understanding this correctly. \n \n So the brat gets away with her disobedience, thanks to the stupidity of the courts. That sets a dangerous precedent, as other children will demand their 'right' to sue for unfair punishment. Instead of saying \"that is not for a court to decide\" and stepping aside, they will quite likely be inundated with nuisance claims of disgruntled teenagers, who will use this case as a precedent. If it isn't overturned then parents will have to dance on eggshells. \n \n The child needs to be sent to one of those boot camps where you are made to fend for yourself to survive and rely on cooperation with other team members. Of course the discipline in those 'tough love' style boot camps, is much harsher than being kept back from a school excursion. By the metric of this court, they would also be outlawed. The prosecution and the Judge in this case, needs to be hauled over the coals, unless there is more to the story. It seems suspect, that the father appealed and lost a second time.\n \n Anyhow what have the savage acts of barbaric cruelty and evil, endorsed by that disgusting book of filth, violence and lies, The Bible, got to do with this story and how (without tongue in cheek) could anybody advocate the disgusting acts of savagery? What kind of worthless, lowlife scum, would seriously endorse the murder (by their own hands and even then, by bludgeoning with stones) of their own child? emoticon_wow Is that what we are actually talking about here?

He has also frequently threatened to move her far away from her mother (something else he can't do).\n \n If this father in Canada is anything like my neice's dad, some self-absorbed jerk who barely has his parental rights, I would side with the daughter, too.

Then Jesus made it fairly clear in Matthew, that he believed marriage is between a man and a woman. So it can be fairly argued that one can be consistent with what the Bible says without arbitrarily picking and choosing.\n \n I would have thought a great Biblical scholar like you would have known about that.

They might see it, if only they could remove their blinkers.\n \n \nThe New Testiment DOES NOT countermand those provisions.\n\n \n Even if it did, it would be one set of supposedly divine scriptures contradicting the other.

Are they serious? emoticon_confused We know this kind of thing is still prolific in the Muslim world, but I often wonder how easily Christian fundies would regress to their native, barbaric religious mindset, without the sobering influence of secular law and morality. I suspect some of them would prefer to live under the old dispensation, and perhaps most are eager to bring on Armageddon and yearn for the end times. Sick pups.\n \n Anyhow thanks again for the rundown. emoticon_xgood\n \n \n \n Your theology is as pathetic, sophomoric, and deluded as Zardoz's (who apparently has run and hid because he can't produce a New Testament verse that says to stone children). \n \n Doesn't sound like you ever read the Bible, much less delved into it with a studious disposition. But that's what I would have expected from someone who has an avatar of the devil in his posts. \n \n John 8:44",

Confused again? Here's what those words mean:\n licentious |l&#299;&#712;sen sh &#601;s|\n adjective\n 1 promiscuous and unprincipled in sexual matters.\n 2 archaic disregarding accepted rules or conventions\n So you believe this minor child was promiscuous and unprincipled in sexual matters? Here's what dissolute means:\n dissolute |&#712;dis&#601;&#716;lo&#333;t|\n adjective\n lax in morals; licentious : a dissolute, drunken, disreputable rogue.\n Do you actually think that a minor child would be referred to as a disreputable rogue and a drunkard? This young man was at least 19 years old and of the age when his character was formed and seen as a threat to the communities moral stability. By allowing such a person to continue in his ways would threaten others morals in the community since they understood that no sin is committed in a vacuum. Something you are obviously too ignorant to appreciate. \n \n Also, When it says this: If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him, given what we now see were his rebellious actions, then it is, or should be obvious this was a young adult who rejected all forms of correction and guidance from his parents to the point that they had no choice but to take the problem which they didn't want to unleash on the community, to the elders for judgement. If he was a minor child they would have easily spanked, punished or otherwise disciplined him as they saw fit.\n \n Unless you can show with reason and a rational argument that this is referring to a minor child rather than a prodigal son who is of an age to be an unrepentant degenerate, then you have once again been shown that you must misinterpret and pervert the word of God by ripping it out of historical and scriptural context in order to fit your modern amoral and judgmental sensibilities.",

You make statements but offer nothing as evidence. \n \n \nYou want to know the TRUE BELIEVERS reasons these rules existed?\n Because GOD would put the smack down on the entire community if they started deviating...and allowing unrulely children to have their own way...simply upset the natural order. Train them when they are small Archy...so they grow up right. And, like a mad dog, if you don't deal with it, God will.\n\n \n Unless you can show that minor boys of that time had access to liquor and licentious sex then your interpretation of this passage is as ignorant as the rest of this hateful tirade. \n \n \nLook, there are cases where God killed children.\n David's son. No? 2 Samuel 7.\n\n \n Really? so allowing a child to die in child birth is an act of murder now? Yet you will defend abortion at all cost as right and good. Zardoz, thy name is hypocrite. \n \n \nAnd what about the various generational curses. God has/had a tendency to 'punish' others for the sins of one.\n\n \n Really? Must you lie and pervert the truth at every turn Zardoz? You are asserting that Gods warning about the cause and affect aspect of parents sinning is something God does to curse the offspring. But here is what the bible actually says.\n Eze 18:20 The soul who sins is the one who will die. The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.\n Like satan himself, you pervert and corrupt the truth in every post.\n \n \nAs to the site I used when doing quick searches...they're Christian discussion sites. Typically because there are MANY more out there dealing with bible discussion issues that there are atheistic sites. \n I tend to use BibleGateway to find the passages quickly (when it's taking me time to sort through the printed ones I have here on my computer (YES, I DO have the 'good book' on hand for most all discussions))\n For the record, I rarely visit a pure atheistic site.\n Simply because when discussion these issues, I try to do so on your level.\n\n \n Regarding the bolded, what a joke. You further show your ignorance by thinking that your fleshly interpretation of Gods word can come close to the spirit filled revelations which those who possess the Holy Spirit receive. \n \n \nNow, can you find anything to countermand the OT rules on dealing with children in the NT?\n\n \n I have already. Can you prove that this licentious drunkard a was a minor child below the age of accountability, according to Jewish tradition? All you have done in response to my post is rant and rave while proving nothing at all.\n \n \nAnd 2000+ years ago...most all people drank wine. Water tended to be contaminated easily. The whole point in the bible was to drink...but not to excess where you became a drunkard. It had medicinal purposes too. cf Pauls instructions in the NT if need be.\n\n \n More ignorance. Will you never learn that you can't lie? First of all, Deuteronomy was written around 3400 years ago, and the wine they drank was not fermented but was more like grape juice for daily consumption. And what does wine having beneficial effects for medicinal purposes have to do with minor boys drinking to drunkenness? The answer is none, but you will throw out any rationalization and hope it sticks.\n \n \nAs for your cherry picking on which definition you use for profligate (an english word used for the Hebrew), being wasteful is a pretty big sin PERIOD.\n And licentious is simply diobeying established rules.\n And as pointed out, this all deals with CHILDREN.\n Not young 'men' or 'adults'.\n\n \n Again, really? Show where the bible deals with the problem of licentious behavior in minor children, ANYWHERE!!! If it was a real problem, it would have dealt with it. But all you and Jo can do is misinterpret one passage and attempt to apply it to minor children\n \n \n In effect. This is no different that dog breeding. You keep the well bred and trainable dogs...and destroy the unfit, illtempered and untrainable ones.\n \n Anything else?\n Or are you going to continue spreading ignorance about the bible and historical context.\n I seriously think you think you're a good Christian but, you're failing Arch.\n You continuously try to make the holy word fit with current desires...the carnal flesh you have rather than simply accept that that IS what God desires.\n You struggle so hard to be seen as a 'compassionate and good guy' by us lost and damned people that you bend Gods word to do so.\n You compromise.\n \n You tickle your own ears...or listen to those that do it for you.\n \n You KNOW full well that following your God's chosen path isn't easy.\n It's hard and fraught with temptations and peril.\n You are asked to have FAITH and to trust that what was writen 2000+ years ago is correct then, today and always.\n So, why doubt it?\n \n Do you seriously want to be cast aside like us upon judgement day?\n Will you be the one who cries out \"Lord, Lord...Have I not...?\" And get a reply of \"I know you not!\"\n \n You really should repent and turn your face from sin.\n Embrace Gods Word...even if it is babaric by todays, fallen-man, concepts.\n \n If a child is unruley, kill them if need be. You can always make more. And, if you honor God with that devoutness...He'll surely reward you with better children next time your reproduce.\n Says so in the bible.\n\n \n The only reason I left this quote even though there is nothing worthy of defending against or responding to is so the objective observer can read once again how warped and disturbed you are. You have no concept of what is true in any way, yet you attempt to speak as if you understand Gods word. May God have mercy on your soul my lost friend. :(",

   "Who's applying modern definitions to this ancient culture, Jo? Not me!! I'm simply interpreting the passage with common sense based on what it says.\n \n \n \n Now here you are doing precisely what you accuse me of doing above. How absolutely hypocritical of you.

   "Archy, get it through your thick skull.\n Jews have a ritual where a 'boy' becomes a man. It happens at a specific age and has a specific title.\n They're a funny culture like that.\n Since the issue at hand is BASED on the god of the Jews we look to their ancient culture to see what is applicable.\n According to this common knowledge.\n Jews are adults at 13 years of age for boys.\n Pretty simple.\n\n \n Get it through your skull Zardoz, you are dead wrong in your understanding of what it means for jews to reach THE AGE OF ACCOUNTABILITY. They are in no way expected to take on the responsibilities of being independent adults although they are expected to observe the commandments after reaching the age of 12 for girls and 13 for boys. Here is the lowdown on precisely what reaching this age means to jewish kids.\n \n Bar and Bat Mitzvah\n \n Under Jewish law, children are not required to observe the commandments, though they are certainly encouraged and taught to do so. But upon turning 13, a boy is considered an adult under the law and is expected to obey all the commandments from then on. He has become a Bar Mitzvah, or \"Son of the Commandments.\" Similarly, a girl becomes a Bat Mitzvah, \"daughter of the commandment,\" upon turning 12.\n \n In addition to conveying moral responsibility, the new status enables the young person to lead religious services, count towards a minyan (a quota of ten required for some religious services), enter into contracts and marry. {1}\n \n This does not mean, however, that Jewish law considers boys of 13 or girls of 12 ready to marry and strike out on their own, even historically. The Talmud states that 18 is the proper age for marriage and 20 is the proper age to begin earning a living {2}.\n \n The age of 12 or 13 is simply the time at which a young person becomes responsible under religious law and has met the minimum qualification for marriage. (This is not so different from secular law: in many states, children may marry as young as 14 with their parents' permission.)\n \n A Jewish youth automatically becomes a Bar or Bat Mitzvah upon reaching the appropriate age. The accompanying ceremonies are not necessary to attain this status, and they are not mentioned in the Torah or Talmud. They are actually a relatively recent invention, especially the elaborate nature of the celebration.\n \n In its earliest observance, the rite of passage was marked by a boy's first reciting of the aliyah (benediction over the Torah reading), at the first Sabbath service after the 13th birthday. These duties have gradually increased over the years, and may now include reciting the haftarah (selection from the Prophets), reading the entire weekly Torah portion, leading part of the service, or leading prayers.\n \n It is also customary for the youth to make a short speech, which usually begins with the words, \"Today I have become a man [or woman].\" The father then says a blessing, thanking God for removing from him the burden of responsibility for his child 's sins. This ceremony is usually followed by a reception, which can be as elaborate as a wedding reception.Bar and Bat Mitzvah - ReligionFacts\n \n Notice the bolded directly above. The fathers prayer thanking God for removing from him the burden of responsibility for his child's sins. That is what it means to reach the age of accountability. The knowledge by the young people that they are now responsible for their actions. Not independence as adults. It is a spiritual milestone, not a physical one.\n \n Does this mean that their parents will take them to the elders and have them killed if they sin? Of course not, and neither does it mean that Jewish parents absolve themselves of any and all responsibility for their children at that age. Both your premise and your reasoning, although it is consistent for you, is ignorant in the extreme..\n \n And notice how the age for marrying is younger than the age for earning a living by 2 years? This is because young couples would live with the parents for the first 2 years of marriage. More jewish tradition which proves that to be Bar-Mitzvah'd doesn't mean to be cut loose as independent adults. \n \n \nOnce they are NO LONGER children, new rules apply to them\n Many are married LONG before that 19 yo age you pushed forward.\n\n \n Really? And what dark cavern in your mind did that little diddy come from? Here's what the Talmud says: The Talmud states that 18 is the proper age for marriage and 20 is the proper age to begin earning a living  \n \n \nThe children discussed in Deut. are under 13.\n YOU are the one applying 'drunken' status to the definition. Because that cherry picked definition suits your CURRENT desires.\n It has NOTHING to do with the facts of how life was thousands of years ago.\n\n \n Really? By actually reading and relying on the verse YOU POSTED, I am just applying drunken status to the definition? Speaking of drunken status, how much have you had today? Here is the relevant line for the verse again. \n 20 They shall say to the elders, \"This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a profligate and a drunkard.\" \n So how am I cherry picking definitions to suit my argument, Zardoz? Or is it you ignoring what this passage actually says in order to demonize God as some ogre who condones killing children? You are pathetic in your ability to deny the truth in order to serve the vile bitterness which motivates your shallow, yet self serving interpretations of Gods word.\n  profligate son. Once again:\n profligate |&#712;pr\u00e4flig&#601;t; -l&#601;&#716;g&#257;t|\n adjective\n recklessly extravagant or wasteful in the use of resources : profligate consumers of energy.\n \u0095 licentious; dissolute : he succumbed to drink and a profligate lifestyle.\n \nYou know **** about history and your own bible.\n You've been repeatedly feed a mush diet by your pimps who water the message down with current, feel good, secularist humanisitic beliefs.\n You HAVE to think your god is a nice loving guy because that is what is preached. You're brain-washed.\n\n \n Thanks for the comedy relief Zardoz, this paragraph actually made me laugh out loud. I'll tell you this my lost friend, one of us is brainwashed, but you don't even have a clue that it's you. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Still don't want a one on one debate so you can crush me with your perverted knowledge of Gods word, huh? That's ok, I can just as easily expose your lies and distortions in meetings like this. emoticon_xgood\n \n Oh, and by the way, what's this about God holding one person responsible for the sins of another again? You forgot to respond to this verse too. But yeah, I'm the one who's brainwashed and believing lies. :xbanghead\n Eze 18:20 The soul who sins is the one who will die.

This young man was at least 19 years old and of the age when his character was formed and seen as a threat to the communities moral stability. By allowing such a person to continue in his ways would threaten others morals in the community since they understood that no sin is committed in a vacuum.

I'm only stating the reality of why the Law held Jews to a stricter moral discipline in order to maintain a civilized society for ALL of its citizens. How sad that you prefer the chaos and lawlessness which existed in the nations which surrounded Israel at that time. \n \n You also reveal your lack of compassion for the innocent by condemning and excoriating the concept of holding the law breakers responsible for their lascivious acts according to the customs and morals of the day in that society. emoticon_xgood",
