   "Well I've got news for you, preppie: While tragic, if the dead gay guy (Frew) did not repent of his gay sex and other sins and receive Christ, the Bible says he's most likely in Hell. And Susan Atkins, who murdered Sharon Tate, would get to heaven before Frew would.\n \n LOS ANGELES (Sept. 24, 2009) - Susan Atkins, a follower of cult leader Charles Manson whose remorseless witness stand confession to killing pregnant actress Sharon Tate in 1969 shocked the world, has died. She was 61 and had been suffering from brain cancer.\n \n The matronly, gray-haired Atkins who appeared before a parole board in 2000 cut a far different figure than that of the cocky young defendant some 30 years earlier. \n \n \"I don't have to just make amends to the victims and families,\" she said softly. \"I have to make amends to society. I sinned against God and everything this country stands for.\" She said she had found redemption in Christianity. The last words she spoke in public at the September hearing were to say in unison with her husband: \"My God is an amazing God.\"\n \n Charles Manson Follower Susan Atkins Dies\n \n The Bishop of Rochester, Dr Michael Nazir-Ali, has defended traditional biblical teachings on homosexuality and said the Church should not be \"rolled over by culture\". \n \"The Bible's teaching shows that marriage is between a man and a woman. That is the way to express our sexual nature. \"We welcome homosexuals, we don't want to exclude people, but we want them to repent and be changed.\" \n \n Change and repent, bishop tells gays - Telegraph\n \n Assuming Susan Atkins repentance and conversion was legitimate, she will get to heaven before the unrepentant gay pride practicioners. And that would include Matthew Shepard and Frew, were they ones who refused to repent of any gay sex sin in his life.\n\n \n This exactly why I lost my faith. The idea that God would condone the murder of any of his children as long as the murderer is sorry, but will condemn someone for behaving the way he created them, truly shows that his love is not extended to all.",

If you do not like living where you are COMPLETELY free to practice your religion with with the understanding that the rest of us have the exact same freedom - then move to your own little \"me, myself and myland\" and leave the land of the free alone.\n \n \nMore bull. What is it about love they neighbor that you find hateful? \n\n \n Nothing. And there is much in the Bible I agree with. If you re-read what I posted, I was not condemning the Bible or anyone in it. I was condemning the institution of religion, and not just your's.\n \n \nAnd where's your tolerance for the Word of God?\n\n \n I am going to assume you mean the Bible and its teachings when you say this. I completely tolerate them. I more than tolerate them. The Hebrew and Greek scriptures, both those within the Bible canon and without are some of the most important documents to have influenced and shaped western civilization. I would never tolerate their being banned, anymore than I would any book. I simply do not believe they are divine.\n \n \nCan you show me where Jesus instructed his followers to do those things? \n\n \n I never claimed that he did. However, his followers have engaged in these things in his name. Same holds true Allah and other dieties.\n \n I will also give credit where its due. Religion and faith have been the inspiration for some incredible things - charitable works, art, music, and architecture. The Catholic church and Islam have both produced some of the greatest minds and instututions of education the world has ever known.\n \n Sadly, religion has its dark side - and it basically boils down to what you demonstrate on this board. When someone thinks they have the truth about the divine it becomes an excuse and jusitifcation for doing any number of atrocities to those who do not share your opinion/faith.\n \n Believe it or not, I do not hold your faith against you. But you do hold my lack of (your) faith against me. I also believe that you would galdly strip religious freedom from anyone who is not Christian and you have openly stated that people with different faiths and opinions should be kicked out of the country. Those actions, I do hold against you. They are truly intolerant and frankly, un-American. \n \n \nYou're not going to fare well in hell, Jito. It's not by works of righteousness that people are saved, because ALL HAVE SINNED AND FALLEN SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD. You too. Which is why you need Christ for salvation.\n\n \n I don't believe in hell. I believe the only real evil that exists is intentionally doing harm to others, good is its opposite - most things fall in the middle of being nuetral or accidental or dumb luck. I don't even know if I believe in a life after death. I think I believe in a higher power (for nothing comes from nothing and this universe exists). I do not waste my time trying define the divine, a thing I really don't believe mere mortals have the capacity to truly comprehend and which, as I said before, too often leads to being an excuse to harm others. I seriously doubt any higher being's interest in the minutia of our daily lives.\n \n This is what I believe. Can you tolerate my faith?",

I am not interested in Bible quotes or in all the reasons why you believe your faith is the correct one. I do not doubt for a second that you think so. I am asking you about tactics.)\n \n There are very devout people of many faiths in the world. Lets say one of them (does not matter which) started preaching to you, telling you why his faith is correct and yours was not and how your current beliefs would be your doom - would you just walk away from your own faith, god and life experience because he said so (or showed you some book that said so)? And should he rudely insult your faith and your character because of that faith, would that compel you to change your mind?\n\n \n If they were speaking the truth they would be well heard. But I know the truth, and the truth is a person, Jesus Christ (John 14:6).\n \n \nUnless your answer to my questions above is \"yes\", what makes you think that your engaging in these tactics will make anyone else do so?\n\n \n I'd be surprised if any of the stiff-necked crowd around here did change their minds. But I have a duty to God to give you the Word and counter your politically correct, pro gay-sex nonsense.\n \n So once again, come out of Sodom. Come out of Gomorrah, and understand that by continuing to pat the pro-gay crowd on the back as they travel the road down to perdition, you are not doing them any favors. You'd be better off telling them to repent of their gay sex folly and receive Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior for the remission of their sins. THEN, you would be doing something constructive.\n \n The fact is you've just been deceived all these years. Now it's time to come to God and leave the politically correct world behind you.",

Christianity may no longer be true, then?\n\n \n Nice try, but evangelical Christianity is growing, and atheism is what's on the rocks.\n \n The most recent \"Religious Congregations and Membership\" study, published in 2000 (the study is conducted each decade) by the Glenmary Research Center, tells the statistical story. Progressive churches are progressing, it seems, ever closer to oblivion. The Presbyterian Church U.S.A. (11,106 churches) has experienced a decline of 11.6 percent over the previous ten years; the United Methodist Church (35,721 churches) was down 6.7 percent; and the Episcopal Church (7,314 churches) lost 5.3 percent of its membership. Also, the United Churches of Christ (5,863 churches) declined 14.8 percent while the American Baptist Churches USA were down 5.7 percent. \n The denominations showing growth included the deeply conservative Southern Baptist Convention, a collection of 41,514 churches, whose overall growth rate was 5 percent. The traditionalist Presbyterian Church in America (as opposed the mainline Presbyterian Church U.S.A.) experienced an impressive 42.4 percent increase, while the Christian and Missionary Alliance rose 21.8 percent. Meanwhile, the Evangelical Free Church was up 57.2 percent, and Pentecostal denominations also boomed. The Assemblies of God, with 11,880 churches, saw 18.5 percent growth, while the Church of God, with 5,612 churches, saw growth of 40.2 percent. \n \n What is behind this traditionalist rise and progressive decline? The New York Times, in its summary of the survey, noted, \"Socially conservative churches that demand high commitment from their members grew faster than other religious denominations in the last decade....\" Glenmary director Ken Sanchagrin told the paper he was \"astounded to see that by and large the growing churches are those that we ordinarily call conservative. And when I looked at those that were declining, most were moderate or liberal churches. And the more liberal the denomination, by most people's definition, the more they were losing.\" \n \n \n Dave Shiflett on Christianity in America on National Review Online\n \n \n Following is a poll on widespread growth of Evangelism / Fundamentalism\n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061005/ap_on_re_us/pentecostals_poll \n \n \n In addition, atheism itself is in decline.\n \n Mass exodus from atheism worldwide \n \n The world is obviously a far smaller place now and it seems that the areas of the world where atheism and secularism have their greatest strength are in decline. For example, economic and political commentator Robert J. Samuelson wrote a very compelling article called The End of Europe where he argues that European influence in the world will decline.[12] In an increasingly global community, of course, this is not good news for European atheism, which is likely to have less influence on the world. In addition, conservative Christianity, which is certainly evangelistic and asserting itself in the world's public intellectual arena, is growing in the USA and especially in the Third World. (For the growth of conservative Christianity in the USA, see the book Exodus: Why Americans are Fleeing Liberal Churches for Conservative Christianity by Dave Shiflett). Since, generally speaking, liberal theologians are more likely to embrace materialist ideas, such as macroevolution, this of course means that fewer Christians are likely to support these ideas, which will reduce the influence of atheism. \n \n Penn State professor Philip Jenkins, author of The Next Christendom: The Coming of Global Christianity, has also pointed out that Christians living in Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia are far more conservative theologically than Christians who live in the West, so one would expect they would be less likely to adopt or embrace materialist and atheist macroevolutionary ideas.[13\n \n http://creationwiki.org/Decline_of_atheism",

Currently that exists only in the form of the bible.\n \n \n\n Nice try, but evangelical Christianity is growing, and atheism is what's on the rocks.\n\n \n Oh it was better than a nice try because I'm right. We can talk about America specifically, and you can dance with the schisms all you want, but the evidence shows that Christianity as a whole is on the decline. Since, apparently, the number of believers is what makes a religion right or wrong, Christianity is becoming less true every decade. While it is true that most of the decline is due to mainline denominations (I guess those are what you are calling \"Progressive\"), the loss isn't made up for in other Christian churches.\n \n An exerpt from the link: \n \n\n Percent Decline of Non-Catholic Christians, 1990 - 2008\n \n Texas: -20%\n South Carolina: -15%\n Georgia: -14%\n Florida: -13%\n North Carolina: -13%\n West Virginia: -13%\n Kentucky: -13%\n Tennessee: -13%\n Virginia: -13%\n Alabama: -9%\n Mississippi: -8%\n Arkansas: -6%\n Louisiana: +8%*\n\n *due to faith-group's efforts during Katrina and other disasters\n \n \n\n The most recent &#8220;Religious Congregations and Membership&#8221; study, published in 2000\n\n \n No longer the most recent study of religious statistics.

They don't depend on tithes and they don't need to \"re-affirm\" any beliefs (since they don't believe in anything) by going to a gathering such as a church. So the amount of athiests doesn't seem to make any difference to anyone. Well, except to you of course, Easyrider.\n \n Besides, you're wrong. If you check out that link: The \"Nones\" (no stated religious preference, atheist, or agnostic) continue to grow, though at a much slower pace than in the 1990s, from 8.2% in 1990, to 14.1% in 2001, to 15.0% in 2008.",

The only confirmation of the Holy Spirit is the bible.\n\n \n Well, you have your opinions and I have the Word of God. Here's some more info for you. The Wise will understand this Parable:\n \n Parable of the Wedding Feast - Matthew 22:1-14\n \n 2\"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. 3He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come. 4\"Then he sent some more servants and said, `Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.' 5\"But they paid no attention and went off--one to his field, another to his business. 6The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them. 7The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. \n 8\"Then he said to his servants, `The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. 9Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.' 10So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. 11\"But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. 12`Friend,' he asked, `how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man was speechless. 13\"Then the king told the attendants, `Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' 14\"For many are invited, but few are chosen.\" \n \n In this Parable:\n 1. The King = God the Father \n 2. The Son = God the Son, Jesus Christ\n 3. The first group that was invited = The Israelites who declined\n 4. The second group that was invited = The Gentiles and those Jews who accepted\n 5. The servants = those who preach the Gospel of Christ's salvation\n \n Explanation of the Parable:\n \n God's chosen people, the Jews, were the first to receive the invitation to receive their Savior Jesus Christ, the Son of God whom they rejected. The Wedding / Gospel invitation was then given to others (the gentiles - note Romans 1:16, etc.). In short, everyone had received an invitation, but not everyone accepted the invitation.\n \n Note that the Book of Revelation describes a future marriage of the Lamb (Jesus - John 1:29) and His Bride (Revelation 19:7).\n \n The guest who was not arrayed in the proper wedding attire was one who had declined God's gift of salvation and righteousness - a robe of righteousness that comes not from man, but from Christ/God only:\n \n Isaiah 61:10, \"I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.\"\n \n Note that in Genesis 15:6, this righteousness comes through faith in God: \"Abram believed (had faith in) the Lord, and it was credited to him as righteousness.\" Also note Ephesians 2:8-9 in the New Testament.\n \n Believers are covered with God's garment of righteousness / salvation. When God looks at the repentant sinner He does not see the filthy attire of sin, but the robe of righteousness obtained by Christ's perfect obedience to the law. There are none righteous apart from this God-given righteousness. A perfect example that this righteousness is not obtained by man's own inherent \"goodness\" is found in Zechariah chapter 3:\n \n 3 Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel. 4 The angel said to those who were standing before him, \"Take off his filthy clothes.\" Then he said to Joshua, \"See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put rich garments on you.\"\n \n Filthy clothes = sin in the above scripture, while a robe of righteousness = a garment of salvation in Isaiah 61:10.\n \n From the New Testament we find:\n \n Romans 13:14 - \"Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ...\" \n Philippians 3:9 - \"..not having a righteousness of my own that comes from (keeping ) the law, but that which is through faith in Christ...\"\n \n Also note that in Matthew 22:10 - \"...the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.\"\n \n Here we see the illustration of those gathered off the streets - people who may well have not been able to afford special wedding garments on such short notice. Also note that those gathered were both \"good and bad,\" so that the invitation was not based on works alone, otherwise just the \"good\" would have been invited. So the wedding garments - the garments of salvation - were God's gift to those who accepted the invitation to the Son's (Christ's) wedding to his bride - his church of true believers.\n \n In the end, those without the God / Christ-given robe of righteousness / salvation were cast into the outer darkness, where there is weeping and the gnashing of teeth.\n \n \"For many are invited, but few are chosen.\" Matthew 22:14\n \n How to be Saved in Jesus (Includes a prayer of salvation):\n \n Getting Saved By Jesus\n \n Beware of what lies ahead if you keep rejecting Jesus Christ.\n \n You are not guaranteed tomorrow.
