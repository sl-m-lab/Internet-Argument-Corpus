   "Since its release July 15, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince has grossed more than $260 million in the United States and $753 million worldwide.\n \n There is no denying the popularity of the film, the sixth adaptation of J.K. Rowling's fantasy novel series about a now-teenage wizard played by Daniel Radcliffe.\n \n But what is the response of the Christian community to a film that promotes children practicing magic arts and depicts some witches and wizards as good guys, using their magic wands to evoke special powers?\n \n While Christians largely embraced C.S. Lewis' Narnia Chronicles, in print and on screen, as acceptable fantasy entertainment for children, it is divided over Harry Potter.\n \n Alicia Thompson, children's pastor at Calvary Church of the Nazarene in Spring Hill, said her own children see Potter as a hero because, despite his environment, he works to overturn evil.\n \n \"My children are 19, 18 and 16 and have read every book of Harry Potter, and we have gone as a family to see the movies,\" Thompson said. \"Being raised with a Christian background and knowing the morals and standards of what is right and wrong, they saw good things out of Harry.\"\n \n For younger children, Thompson said, seeing the movie would depend on where they are on their spiritual journey.\n \n \"You wouldn't give a baby a set of car keys and say, 'go drive,' \" she said. \"Boundaries have to be set. So I wouldn't recommend anybody to go see Harry Potter unless they have been given a good background on the difference between what is real and what is fantasy.\"\n \n Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano reviewed the film in a July 29 column by Gaetano Vallini, concluding that \" ... the demarcation line between those who do good and those who do evil seems very clear, and the spectator or reader readily identifies with the former. In this most recent film in particular the distinction is even clearer. It conveys to viewers that it is right to do good and makes them realize that this sometimes demands both great effort and sacrifice.\"\n \n Plugged In, the movie review site for Focus on the Family, disagrees.\n \n \"Magic is ever present and, sometimes, dangerously evil,\" reads its review. \"Clearly, this isn't a straight-up good-vs.-evil tale of heroism and conquest. ... Harry and Co. routinely use sorcery to defeat sorcerers.\"\n \n It is the reliance on sorcery that disturbs J.F. Desmarais, who presents free Christian films to the public each month at Spring Hill Bible Church.\n \n He notes passages in the Bible that talk of the dire consequences for those who practice \"magic arts.\"\n \n \"After reading these passages, why would anyone want to even flirt with evil represented in the magic arts?\" Desmarais asks.\n \n In a poll conducted online by Christianity Today Movies on July 24, readers were asked to rate how harmful they believe the Potter series to be. \"On a scale of 1-5 (1=very dangerous, 5=completely harmless), how would you rate the Harry Potter books and movies?\" the poll asked. The majority of respondents, 34 percent, selected 4. Fifteen percent selected 1.\n\n Latest \"Harry Potter\" film's themes of black arts, rule-breaking cause a divide among some Christians - St. Petersburg Times\n \n Normally I think such issues are typically talking about an incredibly small population of Christians.\n And while this article does show that there are more people who have little to no problem with the movie, I was amazed that the number of Christians who consider it \"very dangerous\" was over 1 in 8...",

   "Um... you do know the fundies have had a vendetta against D&D for years..... \n\n \n Fundies! I'd be more worried about liberal fundies. Liberal fundies have been screwing up this country for decades now, if not longer.\n \n Liberal Fundamentalism \n \n Someone once said to beware of zealots. Yet Jesus Christ was a zealot for the ways of God, and Mother Theresa was certainly a zealot for helping the sick and needy. Being a zealot, then, is not automatically a prescription for hated. Likewise, religious fundamentalism. One can certainly believe in the fundamental teachings of Jesus Christ and Biblical values, practice them, and not be a threat to society or one&#8217;s neighbors. On the other hand, there&#8217;s a new and particularly pernicious brand of fundamentalism making the rounds in America today &#8211; liberal fundamentalism. \n \n Liberal Fundamentalism is a failed and destructive philosophical enterprise, replete with a host of anti-Biblical, pseudo-religious doctrines that seeks to elevate the ways and &#8220;wisdom&#8221; of man above the wisdom and desires of God. Its principle aim is the sacking of traditional Judaic and Christian values and beliefs, which are revisited through suspect liberal &#8220;scholarship&#8221; or politically-correct dogma in an effort to replace them with the tenets of carnal moral hedonism and the failed social doctrines of today&#8217;s liberal elitists. \n \n The genesis of today&#8217;s liberal fundamentalists was the anti-traditionalist hedonists of the 1960's and 70's. They advocated fornication and &#8220;free-love,&#8221; illegal substance abuse, moral relativism, contempt for authority, and they enjoyed a prosperous America founded on the very hard work and enterprise they sought to distance themselves from. The freedoms they enjoyed were purchased by the blood, sweat and personal sacrifices of the very forefathers they held in contempt. \n \n Personal responsibility, self-restraint and self-sacrifice are often foreign concepts to them. &#8220;Right and wrong,&#8221; and &#8220;good and evil&#8221; were arbitrarily revisited, for such concepts had no objective meaning to them. They had no objective rationality for their hedonistic philosophy other than if it &#8220;feels good, let&#8217;s do it.&#8221; The only righteous cause that qualified for support in their &#8220;progressive&#8221; mindset was the undermining and revising of traditional American and Judeo-Christian values. They said not to trust anyone \"over 30,\" and now they're over 30 and say, \"Trust us, and what we teach!\" Thank you, FOXNews.com - University of Colorado Board Votes to Fire Embattled Professor Ward Churchill - Local News | News Articles | National News | US News Ward Churchill. \n \n One of the most revered mantras of liberal fundamentalism is &#8220;equality.&#8221; The net effect of this experiment, in many instances, was to super-elevate women via the degradation of men, promote racial equality by instituting race-based preferences and reverse discrimination, engender class warfare against people of means via their socialistic redistribution of wealth schemes (a concept centered in greed for other people&#8217;s money, rather than relying on one&#8217;s own personal initiative and work ethic - Hello, Obama!), and elevate wickedness (sodomy, fornication, pornography, and other ungodly issues) to the plateau of respectability at the expense of traditional Godly values. \n \n Along with the failed liberal concept of equality was the mantra of liberal &#8220;tolerance.&#8221; However, liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be. It is a contradictory, partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas. It assumes, for instance, a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge. This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality, abortion rights, and religious truth claims, leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs. But this posture is often dogmatic, intolerant, and coercive, for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues, and if one does not embrace it, one may likely face public ridicule, demagogic tactics, and perhaps even legal reprisals. Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant. \n \n Rather than truly embrace &#8220;freedom,&#8221; liberal fundamentalists seek to control virtually every aspect of the lives of the masses that are unfortunate enough to be under their fundamentalist rulership. They seek to outlaw SUV&#8217;s, impose smoking bans while advocating marijuana use, prohibit freedom of religious expression in government and public schools, advocate compulsory training in politically correct opinions and attitudes, seek to enforce Bible bans in schools and the workplace, embrace a de-facto litmus test against pro-life judicial nominees, seek to criminalize pro-life demonstrations through the RICO racketeering statute, try to squelch legitimate religious speech via &#8220;hate-speech&#8221; laws (note Canada), ram expensive government programs down the throats of voters, and generally engage in a wide range of behaviors designed to subvert the U.S. Constitution and traditional American values. \n \n Ii is certainly arguable, then, that &#8220;progressive&#8221; liberal fundamentalism substantially undermines the basic effectiveness of the government and other societal elements of democracy. Despite the idealistic goals of liberalism, attempts to build a utopian liberal society in America have only led to heightened outbreaks of AIDS, VD, porno-related crime, social divisions, divorce, abortion, drug addictions, deficit spending, the welfare state, a crushing tax burden, the breakdown of the family unit, moral depravity, and numerous other such scourges which have resulted in enormous societal suffering and discontent. As a result, liberal fundamentalism is strongly associated with left-wing fanaticism, reverse-racism, anti-intellectualism, elitism, nihilism, godlessness, and societal violence. &#8211; Author Unknown",
