I also share some of your concerns about the weakness with which we have been taught to operate from. Embrace your enemy while they slit your throat, seems to be the liberal line of the day. I fail to see how our culture will win this culture war when many of us appear unwilling to admit the value of such a culture. Liberal nonsense about how every immigrant has a right to sh*t in our backyard, must be replaced with a hardline view that places our own survival above the 'rights' of our enemies to come here and blow up buildings.\n \n It is no accident that the left-wing is finding itself more allied with the brutal dictators who wish to imposed a theocratic state out of the 6th century. Both liberals and the islamo-fascists fear the same things, those being progress, modernity, and the strength of the human spirit. Their fear of such qualities is the sole reason they seek to destroy those aims.\n \n Listen to how Fallingupwards points to globalization being the most dreadful aspect of the world today. Why would a society seek to better the lives of millions by offering their products to them on a global market? Nobody is able to explain why free-market systems remain dangerous? They simply oppose them out of a will to deny progress. They point to the starving children in third world nations all over the globe as reason to garnish some of my wages, but oppose the institutions that seek to help those countries generate products that are able to compete in the global markets. I am convinced that the only level of globalization that is acceptable to leftist is the design called for by Karl Marx himself.

   "WJim: 1.) I think that for the most part people DO care that Saddam is a dangerous man. It's not apathy, it's a matter of weighing the possibilities. We invade, we get Saddam (positive), we move into other \"threat\" countries (negative), we inflame the entire Muslim world which already loathes the ground we walk on (negative), we isolate and attempt to seperate ourselves from our allies (negative), terrorist attacks are worse due to the intense anti-US hatred across the world (negative). That's why I am against the war. I don't delude myself in saying that ALL wars and ALL violence is wrong. I believe it to be necessary at times, just not these times. Saddam is crippled, his military is at 1/8 what it was in Desert Storm, the economy has long falllen off it's last leg, he's not as much of a threat as Bush makes him out to be. Every CIA report since the 90's has said that Saddam is only a threat when provoked, so what do we do? \n \n And that leads to the final reason I oppose this war. Whenever an administration has to lie to the extent in which they did gain support, warning flags jump in my head. I was absolutely furious the number of times that Bush called our attack a response to 9/11. The number of times he said that upon the removal of Saddam terrorism would end. He lied to everyone, and he manipulated the deaths of the thousands on 9/11 to get what he wanted. \n \n Simply because someone does not agree with you does not mean that they are apathetic.",

Why live if you have no hope? What is the meaning of life? Life becomes meaningless without Christ. I think that this is pretty much true: existentialism = life is meaningless\n \n \nabortion is painful? are we talking about the child? if so, you are wrong... it most likely feels nothing. i won't get into detail (so not to scare the young ones), but it would be like jumping off of a building... you feel pain for 1/1000 of a second.\n\n \n The child feels no pain?! Have you heard of the abortion procedures? (100% of which are painful and last much more than \"1/100 of a second\"?!?!?) Here are some popular methods:\n \n Vacuum Aspiration or Sharp Curettage (D&C): (6 to 16 wks) powerful suction tube inserted\n through the cervix and into the uterus. The fetal body parts and placenta are sucked into a jar, the unbornchild often torn apart by the force of the suction. Possible complications include infection, cervicallaceration and uterine perforation. Details of an 11 week abortion (warning: some graphic material). \n \n Mifepristone: (5 to 7 wks) is also known as RU-486 or the \"Abortion Pill.\" This chemical causes an abortion by interfering with the function of the placenta, starving the unborn child to death. Prostaglandins (misoprostol, see below) are then administered to expel the fetus. This method of abortion takes place over the span of several days; the average woman using it bleeds heavily for more than nine days, but some women have bled for over four weeks. Because mifepristone is a new method, long term health risks are not yet known. \n \n Methotrexate: (5 to 9 wks) though not approved by the FDA for this use, a methotrexate injection kills the unborn child by interfering with the growth process (cell division). Several days later, the woman is treated with prostaglandin (misoprostol) suppositories to expel the fetus; woman aborts at home. Requires three visits to a doctor to complete process. \n \n \n Dilation & Evacuation (D&E): (13 to 20+ wks) the cervix is pried open. Using forceps, the abortionist tears the child out of the womb, limb by limb. The child is then reassembled to assure that no fetal parts are left inside. Possible complications include infection, cervical laceration and uterine perforation. \n \n Prostaglandin: (16 to 38 wks) also called misoprostol, this chemical which induces premature labor, is given as suppositories or an injection; live births are common. Hazards include convulsions, vomiting, and cardiac arrest. \n \n Digoxin Induction: (20 to 32 wks) involves injecting a lethal chemical directly into the baby's heart followed by labor induction with prostaglandin. \n \n Saline Abortion: (16 to 32+ wks) a long needle is inserted into the woman's abdomen, and a salty solution is injected into the amnionic fluid. The salt poisons the child, burning its lungs and skin. A dead baby is then delivered within 24 hours. This method is rarely used any more due to the serious health risks to the woman. \n \n Hysterotomy: (24 to 38 wks) like a c-section, an incision is made in the woman's abdomen. The baby is removed then allowed to die by neglect. This procedure carries the same health risks as a c-section. \n \n D&X: (20 to 32+ wks) also known as \"partial-birth abortion\" this dangerous method of late abortion, termed \"bad medicine\" by the American Medical Association, involves pulling the baby out feet first into the birth canal while the head remains in the uterus. The abortionist then makes a hole in the back of the skull to remove the brains with a suction catheter. The head collapses allowing the child to be removed in one piece. \n \n \nyou think people like me are making \"this country\" (assuming you mean usa) go downhill? i beg to differ, but what do my personal beliefs have to do with the condition of our country? you are just as bad as the witch hunters of the 1600's, or the communist hunters of the 1950's.\n\n \n 1. People like you support the murder of millions of unborn fetuses every year.\n \n 2. People like you have brought evolution to be taught as fact in our school systems.\n \n 3. People like you do not believe in moral absolutes which our country was based on.\n \n Anything I've missed? You compare me to \"witch hunters\" and \"communist hunters\", yet I have no idea what we have in common. I'd say that you are the \"Christian hunters\" who are trying to rid our country of every single speck of morality we have left.\n \n \nt is people like you that make our country afraid. afraid to speak beliefs in anything other than christianity.\n\n \n Very funny. How many people on this web-site have jumped on you for being \"non-Christian\"? Now compare that number (0) to the number of people who have critisized me in every way possible for being Christian. (You, lurch, Crim, Karl, etc.) Christians are the ones being oppressed, not non-Christians.\n \n \nthis country was founded on religion and has been spread ever since. the abundance of christianity in america makes everyone think \"this is normal\". when it isn't... it is just the majority of something. in the middle east, muslim suicide bombers are common sight... and people think \"this is normal\", but it's not.\n\n \n Yes! Thank God this country was founded on Christianity. That is the reason that you can argue on the internet (or with anyone else for that matter) without worrying about being shot, tortured, etc. People in the middle east don't think that suicide bombers are \"normal\". Islamic Facists believe that they are normal.\n \n \n know you don't act this way in public, so why act this way here? please, act civilized.\n\n \n I guess you've never seen me in public then. How am I not acting civilized? You are bashing Christianity and I am bashing \"existentialism\". What's wrong with that?\n \n [quote]allgirl: you do sound preachy. try not to relate anything and everything to God... remember? we heathens know not of what you speak.[/quote\n \n Sorry, but I base everything on God. If you \"know not of what I speak\", then I guess it's my job to educate you, huh? :) \n \n Honestly if I met half of you guys (apart from the internet) we'd probably get along really well.

People like you have brought evolution to be taught as fact in our school systems.\n \n \n it is taught as a theory... but this \"theory\" is the peak of modern science... everything starts as a baby... christianity was a baby at one point... to use an example you can relate to: you know, when jesus was supposedly walking the earth. that is the point at which evolution has reached. it is a relitivly new concept. this statement is based on opinion. i guess you whether hate it or love it...\n \n \n3. People like you do not believe in moral absolutes which our country was based on.\n \n \n tradition is ancient... such as summer break, spring break, wedding ceremonies, funerals, graduation, etc. it is all archaic. i am not here to take those away. i enjoy summer break, just think it is a waste of time, i respect the dead ( i just lavish in their memory), and i attend graduation, because of its tradition. i don't destroy morals and values, i support them, only loath them silently.\n \n \n Anything I've missed? You compare me to \"witch hunters\" and \"communist hunters\", yet I have no idea what we have in common. I'd say that you are the \"Christian hunters\" who are trying to rid our country of every single speck of morality we have left.\n\n \n i don't hunt, christians hunt out non-believers all the time and try to convert. the latter day saints come to my door often, i let them in (same couple), and we discuss it. i listen, they listen (they think i'm a lost cause; they keep trying)... do i go door to door spreading my views? no, i let people choose to believe what they want.\n \n \n Very funny. How many people on this web-site have jumped on you for being \"non-Christian\"? Now compare that number (0) to the number of people who have critisized me in every way possible for being Christian. (You, lurch, Crim, Karl, etc.) Christians are the ones being oppressed, not non-Christians.\n \n \n i was not referring to the web site, i was refering to the real world. i live on \"the bible belt of america\", and if i were anywhere on this belt, i would be on the buckle. i am persecuted daily. if i were open about my beliefs, people would force an intervention on me... it got annoying after awhile. trust me, i know what being jumped on means.\n \n \n Yes! Thank God this country was founded on Christianity. That is the reason that you can argue on the internet (or with anyone else for that matter) without worrying about being shot, tortured, etc. People in the middle east don't think that suicide bombers are \"normal\". Islamic Facists believe that they are normal.\n \n \n common sight becomes a normality, it is normal to see suicide bombers. after a couple of bombings, it doesn't make as big of an impact. i'm sure the first suicide bomber was more eye-opening. unfortunately, this is normal, just as your religion is in this country.\n \n \n Honestly if I met half of you guys (apart from the internet) we'd probably get along really well. I tend to make friends with liberals, democrats, and God haters. \n \n \n you are right, we don't *know* each other, and maybe we could get along (i blend in with all), but we don't seem to be heading down that path. internet debates are radically different from face-to-face debates.\n \n even though we have different opinions, we are both human, and require the same basics to live. socialization is a basic (to at least not go crazy) and i just want to say to everyone: what i type is in no way ment to offend. words can be misread, twisted, and flipped.",
