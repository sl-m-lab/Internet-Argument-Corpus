   "I'd like to hear the other side of this. Sound to me like the guy asked his question, was given an answer, and then continued to hog the press conference. That's not journalism, that's heckling, and security were right to intervene. It's the same sort of tactics the right criticise Michael Moore for.",

   "The youtube clip seems rather... abridged. Too cut short to see all that happened.\n \n What I have seen is that the journalist asked a question, the man holding the conference started to answer: he doesn't know what was said, he doesn't trust what is claimed to have been said, and considers the emails private - and gets interrupted by the journalist, even though the journalist was already being politely asked not to disturb the order. Afterward, we see a heavy handed response by security - after apparently not having stopped disturbing the order.\n \n So, it's another case of inappropriate behavior in answer to inappropriate behavior.\n \n Me, I'd say a professional would have reacted by \"You'll have to ask the people who allegedly wrote the emails, but here, let's stay on topic.\" And if the man persisted, I'd send the hostess in, and later the security - with express orders not to prevent filming and, if available, a camera crew of their own to record the polite request that he remove himself and eventual forced removal.",
