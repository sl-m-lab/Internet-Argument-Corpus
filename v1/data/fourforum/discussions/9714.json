Parodies and what not?\n I do.\n \n Here's Land Split Asunder.\n \n I travel with my friends who love Kali\n In the land where once walked Gandhi\n I married a lady...with a dot on her forehead,\n She dance Bali for me when I am Bor-ed.\n \n I come from a land split asunder\n Hindi grow and bramin wander\n Can you wear, can you wear a turban\n Kama Sutra makes for a good lover.\n \n I eat my curry with truffles\n I pull my cart with a lot of hustle\n Dodging the bombs from the Kasmiri\n They kill a few of us but we got plenty.\n \n I come from a land split asunder\n Hindi grow and bramin wander\n Can you wear, can you wear a turban\n Kama Sutra makes for a good lover.\n \n I run a Kwik-E-Mart in Bombay\n Minimum wage there is good pay\n Would you like to buy a slushy\n Or maybe some opium to make you happy\n \n I come from a land split asunder\n Hindi grow and bramin wander\n Can you wear, can you wear a turban\n Kama Sutra makes for a good lover.\n \n \n \n Land Down Under by Men at Work.",
