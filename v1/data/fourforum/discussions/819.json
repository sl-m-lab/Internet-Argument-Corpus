   "Flat Earthers -- Members of the Flat Earth Society believe that the shape of the earth is flat because a literal reading of the Bible demands it (Schadewald, 1991). Charles K. Johnson is the head of the International Flat Earth Society, headquartered in Lancaster, CA, and he is very serious about the planet's shape being as the ancients perceived it: circular and flat, not spherical. The earth is shaped like a coin, not a ball. References in the Bible to the \"four corners of the earth\" refer to the cardinal directions; more relevant are references to the \"circle of the earth\", implying a 2-dimensional, flat plane. The International Flat Earth Society has only about 200 members (Schadewald, 1980) and is insignificant in the antievolution movement. However, it represents the most extreme biblical literalist theology: the earth is flat because the Bible says it is flat. Scientific views are of secondary importance.\n\n \n It's amazing how stupid some people are.",

Click here and read the pope's comments on evolution and also the encylical Fides et Ratio\n \n I don't know if we need the oklo example. One can look at the Grand Canyon and surmise that the earth is very old (assuming the accepted reason for how it came about is accurate). \n \n Just by knowing you're a biologist does not mean I can tell which side of the evolution debate you are on. There are not simply two sides any longer--there seem to be many interlacings as your referenced website showed us.

   "You might note that the version of the Pope's address to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences that you cited is one that is popular with creationists. One line specifically is what they point out.\n \n L'Osservatore Romano, in the original translation (the address was in French) translated the 1st line of the 2nd paragraph of section 4 as follows:\n \nToday, almost half a century after the publication of the Encyclical, new knowledge has led to the recognition of more than one hypothesis in the theory of evolution.\n\n The following day, L'Osservatore Romano printed a correction of the translation of that line. This corrected version is considered the official version.\n \nToday, more than a half-century after the appearance of that encyclical, some new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than an hypothesis.\n\n To be honest, the discussion seems silly to me. But creationists want to make it seem that the Pope was making a claim that there exist several unverified hypotheses.\n \n Actually, what the Pope was saying (you can tell if you put the phrase back into the context of the speech) was that evolution is not just an hypothesis, but a scientific theory. A few words later he said,\n \nThe convergence in the results of these independent studies-which was neither planned nor sought-constitutes in itself a significant argument in favor of the theory.\n\n All in all, creationists don't like that the Pope is telling them that they are wrong.

   "Isn't the power of the internet great! Just a couple of clicks and you can refer me to a fundamentalist christian who has a problem with what the Pope actually said. I didn't portray anything. I gave you the facts. The official translation is as I told you.\n \n But no matter what the official translation. What the Pope said (in French) cannot by any stretch be translated to convey in English the idea of \"more than one hypothesis.\" It's an easy mistake for a translater to make. The pressure is to do it fast and accurate translation requires expression of ideas - not words. Whoever first translated the Pope's address translated the words rather than ideas. The correction expressed the ideas.\n \n If you have a problem, then learn French and read it in the original.\n \n However, your link pretty much reflects the young earth, protestant opinion. The author of the site you cited must be one of those rare Catholics who is also a YEC. Why is his opionion more impressive than mine? Why is his opinion more meaningful that that of the Vatican?\n \n As the Pope said, evolution is more than an hypothesis. It is, in fact, a well supported scientific theory.\n \n And of course there is this from your own link:\n \nA: I have run the French sentence past multiple French-speakers. Those who are native English-speakers and learned French in school have been uncertain what the correct translation is, but all of the people who have French as their native tongue have said that the most widely reported translation of the key phrase -- \"more than a hypothesis\" -- is undoubtedly correct and that if he had intended to say \"more than one hypothesis\" French idiom would have required it to be phrased a different way.\n\n Now I have a B.A. in Spanish with a minor in Latin and an M.A. in Linguistics and I speak Spanish. With my knowledge of three languages, I can assure you that \"more than a hypothesis\" is, as your link asserts, correct.",

   "Mr. Lurch,\n Easy dude, I did not say that the guy from the website was more knowledgeable than you but rather, more knowledgeable than me. I value his opinion because what I know of him seems trustworthy.\n \n I do not understand the points of contention in your most recent post. I disagree that the website puts forth a young earth position in its explanation of the pope's message. I do not see evidence of that. It states that the pope has neither endorsed nor attacked evolution. I don't think it puts forth any position because it states what the Church has stated--that evolution is a possibility that would not contradict the faith. Several explanations are possible. Ongoing evaluation is necessary--isn't this a component of science? (One must qualify the use of the word endorsement though. The pope endorses evolution as a possible explanation but not as THE explanation. So he does endorse it in that sense. He does not seek to dismiss it as pure creationists do.)\n \n Is the following not part of the pope's message? \n \n \n[R]ather than the theory of evolution, we should speak of several theories of evolution. On the one hand, this plurality has to do with the different explanations advanced for the mechanism of evolution, and on the other, with the various philosophies on which it is based. Hence the existence of materialist, reductionist, and spiritualist interpretations\" (emphasis in original).\n \n \n Let me sum up very concisely what I was trying to convey on the other thread and here. I will use the words of Pope Pius XII from Humani Generis, Both religion and science are founded in truth; therefore, true religion and true science can never be in contradiction.\n \n peace",

   "You seem to have misunderstood. Perhaps it is because you do not know of the history of the Pope's message to the Pontifical Academy of Science. (By the way, did you know that Steven Hawking is a member?)\n \n The Pope's message was delivered in French. In reading some discussion of it at the time, it seems that the Pope used the Pontifical Academy of Science for its intended purpose, to advise the Pontif in matters of science. He discussed the points he would make with appropriate members.\n \n Okay - as I said the message was originally in French. Immediately after it was delivered, it was translated into various languages and printed in the papers, the English version appearing in L'Osservatore Romano, the official English newspaper of the Vatican. The rush to print caused a hurried translation in which words rather than ideas were translated. Thus, the first English version had the Pope saying that there is more than one hypothesis in evolution. The next day L'Osservatore Romano printed a corrected version in which the Pope said that evolution was more than an hypothesis.\n \n Well, in spite of the fact that the second version is the \"official\" version from the Vatican, American fundamentalists cling to the first. Their point is that if evolution is more than one hypothesis, how can we know that any of them are true (and they must be in conflict) and therefore the Pope is saying that evolution is in doubt. Creationism must be true by default.\n \n The first version, the one that was corrected, is the version that you linked. You will find that version used on fundamentalist christian and young earth web sites, claiming that the corrected version is wrong.\n \n It is quite clear from the context that the second, corrected version is what the Pope intended to say. And of course, consider what native speakers of French said from your own link. That is also true in Spanish. The Spanish words, word order, and grammar are quite similar to the French. But if I wanted to express the original translation, I would have to change it to make clear that the indefinite article was the number one.\n \n Further down in the same paragraph the Pope said, \"The convergence, neither sought nor fabricated, of the results of work that was conducted independently is in itself a significant argument in favor of this theory.\" It seems quite clear that the Pope was supporting the theory of evolution. I'm really not concerned with how or whether the theory of evolution can be reconciled with Catholicism or creationism. The Pope seems to think that there isn't a problem within certain guidelines. Pius XII also stated, ex cathedra, that there is no conflict as long as one didn't deny certain tenets of faith.\n \n And of course, the last paragraph of section 4 does mention that there are several theories of evolution - not hypotheses. And there are. The Pope is correct that there are several mechanisms of evolution and theories have been developed and tested to explain each. Darwin himself proposed at least 5 theories of evolution, each of which could be accepted or rejected independantly of the others. How remarkable that all have been accepted.",
