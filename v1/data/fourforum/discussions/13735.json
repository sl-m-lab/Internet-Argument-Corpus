And here's the evidence that supports Easyriders claim.\n \n Messianic Prophecy: What Is It?\n Messianic prophecy is the collection of over 100 predictions (a conservative estimate) in the Old Testament about the future Messiah of the Jewish people. These predictions were written by multiple authors, in numerous books, over approximately 1,000 years. Messianic Prophecy is so dramatic today, because with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the reliability of the Septuagint version of the Old Testament (both of which have been proven to exist prior to the time Jesus walked on the earth) you can be assured that these prophecies were not &#8220;conspired&#8221; after-the-fact.\n \n Messianic Prophecy: Fulfillment by Jesus Christ\n Messianic prophecy was fulfilled by the Messiah, Jesus Christ. Although many Jews did not accept Jesus as their Messiah, many did, and they became the Jewish sect later known as the Christians. Christianity, based in dramatic part on the fulfillment of historical prophecy, spread rapidly throughout the Roman Empire of the 1st Century. Examine the prophecies yourself, and calculate the probability of one man fulfilling just a handful of the most specific ones, and you&#8217;ll be amazed.\n \n &#8220;Jesus said to them, &#8216;This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.&#8217;&#8221; Luke 24:44 (NIV)\n \n The Old Testament verses are the prophecy; the New Testament verses proclaim the fulfillment.

Because man is so flawed there is no possibility he would ever be capable of achieving the worthiness required to be allowed in by himself\n \n \nMessianic Prophecy: What Is It?\n Messianic prophecy is the collection of over 100 predictions (a conservative estimate) in the Old Testament about the future Messiah of the Jewish people. These predictions were written by multiple authors, in numerous books, over approximately 1,000 years. Messianic Prophecy is so dramatic today, because with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the reliability of the Septuagint version of the Old Testament (both of which have been proven to exist prior to the time Jesus walked on the earth) you can be assured that these prophecies were not \"conspired\" after-the-fact.\n \n Messianic Prophecy: Fulfillment by Jesus Christ\n Messianic prophecy was fulfilled by the Messiah, Jesus Christ. Although many Jews did not accept Jesus as their Messiah, many did, and they became the Jewish sect later known as the Christians. Christianity, based in dramatic part on the fulfillment of historical prophecy, spread rapidly throughout the Roman Empire of the 1st Century. Examine the prophecies yourself, and calculate the probability of one man fulfilling just a handful of the most specific ones, and you'll be amazed.\n \n \"Jesus said to them, 'This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.'\" Luke 24:44 (NIV)\n \n The Old Testament verses are the prophecy; the New Testament verses proclaim the fulfillment. Check them all out for yourself!\n \n Born of a virgin (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:21-23)\n A descendant of Abraham (Genesis 12:1-3; 22:18; Matthew 1:1; Galatians 3:16)\n Of the tribe of Judah (Genesis 49:10; Luke 3:23, 33; Hebrews 7:14)\n Of the house of David (2 Samuel 7:12-16; Matthew 1:1)\n Born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2, Matthew 2:1; Luke 2:4-7)\n Taken to Egypt (Hosea 11:1; Matthew 2:14-15)\n Herod's killing of the infants (Jeremiah 31:15; Matthew 2:16-18)\n Anointed by the Holy Spirit (Isaiah 11:2; Matthew 3:16-17)\n Heralded by the messenger of the Lord (John the Baptist) (Isaiah 40:3-5; Malachi 3:1; Matthew 3:1-3)\n Would perform miracles (Isaiah 35:5-6; Matthew 9:35)\n Would preach good news (Isaiah 61:1; Luke 4:14-21)\n Would minister in Galilee (Isaiah 9:1; Matthew 4:12-16) \n Would cleanse the Temple (Malachi 3:1; Matthew 21:12-13)\n Would first present Himself as King 173,880 days from the decree to rebuild Jerusalem (Daniel 9:25; Matthew 21:4-11)\n Would enter Jerusalem as a king on a donkey (Zechariah 9:9; Matthew 21:4-9)\n Would be rejected by Jews (Psalm 118:22; I Peter 2:7)\n Die a humiliating death (Psalm 22; Isaiah 53) \n \n involving:\n \n rejection (Isaiah 53:3; John 1:10-11; 7:5,48)\n betrayal by a friend (Psalm 41:9; Luke 22:3-4; John 13:18)\n sold for 30 pieces of silver (Zechariah 11:12; Matthew 26:14-15)\n silence before His accusers (Isaiah 53:7; Matthew 27:12-14)\n being mocked (Psalm 22: 7-8; Matthew 27:31)\n beaten (Isaiah 52:14; Matthew 27:26)\n spit upon (Isaiah 50:6; Matthew 27:30)\n piercing His hands and feet (Psalm 22:16; Matthew 27:31)\n being crucified with thieves (Isaiah 53:12; Matthew 27:38)\n praying for His persecutors (Isaiah 53:12; Luke 23:34)\n piercing His side (Zechariah 12:10; John 19:34)\n given gall and vinegar to drink (Psalm 69:21, Matthew 27:34, Luke 23:36)\n no broken bones (Psalm 34:20; John 19:32-36)\n buried in a rich man's tomb (Isaiah 53:9; Matthew 27:57-60)\n casting lots for His garments (Psalm 22:18; John 19:23-24)\n Would rise from the dead!!

What I don't have the patience to do as rider seems to have is to defend what I know to be absolutely true ad infinitum against a bunco of irrational Christ deniers.\n\n \n Here is an example of easy it is to find fulfilled prophecy. This doesn't even take into consideration the fact that Christians felt it necessary to change text and willfully misinterprete some verses considered prophetic.\n \n A Chassidic Rabbi Makes a Startling Discovery\n \n Moshe Shulman, [ mshulman@ix.netcom.com ]\n \n My name is Moshe and I am a Chassidic Jew who has, from my youth, learned the words of our Holy Prophets, and has been puzzled by their meaning. Then, on the day before Yom Kippur, I contemplated the solemnity of the day and was made aware of the amazing meaning of G-d's words. I recognized the fulfillment of 42 Messianic prophecies of the Tenach, and they changed my life forever.\n \n 1. Early in the morning I went to get my rooster to fulfill the ancient custom. There in the light I looked into his eyes and saw fulfilled the words, 'I am the rooster* who has seen affliction.' (Lam. 3:1)\n 2. I took him and swung him around my head as the verse says, 'And he circled his head**.' (Lam 3:5)\n 3. I moved my hands as I swirled him, as it says, 'Only against me did he turn his hand.' (Lam 3:3)\n 4. With this he leaped from my hand and started to run. As it says, 'They have run away without seeing good.' (Job 9:25)\n 5. I cried a short pray to HaShem as it says, 'My words I say out of the bitterness of my soul.' (Job 10:1)\n 6. He ran from me, fulfilling the verse, 'To me they showed their back and not their face.' (Jer. 32:33)\n 7. I borrowed a cane from a man near me so as to catch him with the rounded edge, as the verse says, 'And Moshe took the stick.' (Ex. 4:20,\n 8. (Num 20:8 -- same)\n 9. I tried to catch him with the hook, but only the blows of the cane hit his back as it says, 'Afflicted by the rod of his anger.' (Lam. 3:1)\n 10. It also says, 'I struck you with the blows of an enemy.' (Jer. 30:12)\n 11. He turned to me and I got him right on the cheek fulfilling the verse, 'I have offered my cheek to the one who strikes me.' (Lam. 3:30)\n 12. He ran from me into a dark corner and I followed after him, as the verse says, 'He has led me and driven me into the darkness and not light.' (Lam. 3:2)\n 13. I had him there in the corner as it says; 'All her pursuers overtook her in the small place.' (Lam. 1:3)\n 14. He stood there silent, as he had been to this time in fulfillment of the words of the prophet, 'He was persecuted and afflicted, be he did not open his mouth.' (Is. 53:7)\n 15. In that corner there was just nowhere for him to hide from me as the verse says, 'Can a person hide in a concealed place, and I should not see him?' (Jer. 23:25)\n 16. He was now trapped as the verse says, 'He has walled me in so I cannot escape.' (Lam. 3:7)\n 17. In his eyes I could see him praying silently to HaShem, 'My G-d my G-d why have you forsaken me?' (Psalm 22:1)\n 18. Clearly it was fulfilled for him, 'The mighty ones of Bashan encircle me.' (Psalm 22:13)\n 19. I grabbed him and he started to call out to HaShem. As the verse says, 'My G-d, I call to you by day and you do not answer and by night and there is no respite.' (Psalm 22:3)\n 20. But there was no answer as it says, 'Though I would scream out and plead he shut out my prayer.' (Lam. 3:8)\n 21. It was clearly the end. I grabbed him and took my place in the line waiting to give my rooster to the shochet (ritual slaughterer.) He was silent, 'Like a sheep being led to the slaughter or a ewe to her sharers he did not open his mouth.' (Is. 53:7)\n 22. The shochet took him by the neck as it says; 'He grasped me by the neck.' (Job 16:12)\n 23. With that he screamed out, 'Be not far from me because distress is near and there is none to help me.' (Psalm 22:12)\n 24. He also said, 'Save my soul from the sword.' (Psalm 22:21)\n 25. He slaughtered him fulfilling 'He was removed from the living land.' (Is. 53:8)\n 26. He let the blood fall on the floor, as it says, 'I am poured out like water.' (Psalm 22:15)\n 27. I took the dead chicken and gazed at it as the prophet says, 'They have looked upon me whom they have pierced.' (Zech 12:10)\n 28. I took it to be made kosher. We separated it into pieces snapping it's bones as the verses say, 'All my bones became disjointed.' (Psalm 22:15)\n 29. Also 'He has broken my bones.' (Lam 3:4)\n 30. Then I took him home to cook. My wife removed the skin as it says, 'He has worn away my flesh and skin.' (Lam. 3:4)\n 31. She placed him in a pot with water, as it says, 'For the waters have reached unto my soul.' (Psalm 69:2)\n 32. She added many spices as it says, 'And she gave ...many spices.' (1 Kings 10:10)\n 33. She covered up the pot so it could cook as it says; 'He has placed me in darkness.' (Lam 3:6)\n 34. The smell of it filled the room as it says, 'That the spices may flow out.' (Song 4:16)\n 35. After that it was served on the table and we gazed upon it as the verse says, 'I count my bones and they gaze and look upon me.' (Psalm 22:18)\n 36. He was divided among the members of my family, as it says, 'Therefore I will divide him among the many.' (Is. 53:12)\n 37. We rejoiced and sang as we ate him, as it says, 'I have become a thing of laughter for my people, they sing all day long.' (Lam. 3:14)\n 38. Also, 'In him our hearts were joyful.' (Psalm 33:21)\n 39. 39/40/41. After which we were full and praised G-d as it says, 'You shall eat and be satisfied and praise HaShem your G-d.' (Deut. 6:11,\n 40. (Same for Deut 8:10)\n 41. (Same for Deut 11:15).\n 42. We truly saw the goodness of G-d as it says, 'You should taste and see that HaShem is good.' (Psalm 34:9) \n \n There were many more messianic prophecies that I could have added that applied to my messianic rooster. Many more he will fulfill when he comes back.\n \n In all seriousness the above example is no different then the lists claiming 200/300/400 prophecies fulfilled by Jesus. They claim the odds against a single person fulfilling them are astronomical. Or of their claims that passages like Psalms 22, or Isaiah 53 are about their messiah/god. Consider this well when you see or hear the claims made by missionaries or just simple Christians who you may meet. If not there may be a prophecy that does really apply: 'They are a people bereft of council and they don't have understanding.'\n \n emoticon_xchickenemoticon_xangelemoticon_wowemoticon_xbye",

   "That isn't what our faith is based on at all. In fact your assumption regarding this appeal to the masses just reveals your own ignorance regarding what we base our faith on, and that is that multiple millions of other people have had the same personal interaction with the living God and therefore have experienced the same indwelling of Gods Holy Spirit in them just as we have. It is that Holy Spirit which indwells us which is our point of identification with all other believers. \n\n \n \n Nice! Why don't you try comprehension with your reading. He states \n \n \"I have no evidence but if other unknowledgable people believe it also it must be true\" \n \n to make clear his point. You say he is ignorant and assuming and your faith is really based on\n \n I have no evidence but if other people with unverifiable experiences believe it, it must be true.\n \n \nIn no way to we all rely on the promises or word of other men as you evolutionists do when you defend this alleged pseudo science which you never arrived at yourselves, personally. \n\n \n Are you kidding? Salvation by faith in God's grace alone is a promise made by Paul and the entire NT was written by a human hand (every version)\n \n \nI take nobodies word for it that God is alive and well, and a personal God since I have experienced that relationship with Him first hand. I know the truth and the truth has set me free indeed. You on the other hand parrot your shallow world view and are so deluded and ignorant about it that you do it arrogantly like the sanctimonious and dishonest sheeple that you are. \n\n \n When was the last time you saw him?

I am happy you got released from whatever kept you restrained, but kindly accept that I possibly was not in the same prison as you.\n \n ummm your confused Christians are the ones who keep making changes to the word of God. I mean it is your book, it's your responsibility.

   "And I say you're both spiritually-challenged and don't know what you're talking about.\n \n\n \n \n Huh? \n \n I am not following you here. Trebor pointed out that relying on the unsupported opinion of the masses is a logical fallacy. He identified it as an \"argument by popularity\". I pointed out that the correct term is \"appeal to the masses\" and that it is a defacto appeal to ignorance.\n \n I dont care at all about the thread topic, which I personally think is stupid, nor am I interested in the faith of people like you or Archie (if heaven is full of folks like you two, I hope fervently that I burn in hell). I was merely pointing out that in the context of the debate....and this is a debate forum....that a logical fallacy had been introduced mis identified. \n \n You are welcome to believe anything you want, as are millions of other people. It is illogical, though, to assume that just because something is commonly held to be true that it is so the fact that millions of people do or do not believe as you do does not serve as any kind of evidence in a debate. \n \n This is the problem with having a \"religion\" section on a debate board at all. Religion by its very nature demands a display of faith. It cannot be logically argued or proven because it is by its very nature illogical. IT leads to a situation where the faithful are trying to prove something that by design and definition cannot be proven If you actually managed to \"prove\" that your religion was correct it would cease to be a religion as it would no longer be based on faith. \n \n Frankly it makes the faithful look like a bunch of complete XXXXXX who are utterly incapable of carrying on a logical argument. I have seriously wondered in the past if Archie and trebor are the same person (archie being a second account to make christians look ignorant and foolish). \n \n I cant help but wonder what kind of christian is so weak in their faith that they feel they need to defend it to anonymous strangers on the internet? Feel free, of course, bandwidth is cheap, but dont get upset when people point out that the argument you are making is fallacious. It is not possible to argue in the affirmative when it comes to religion without using fallacious arguments. That is the nature of religion.",

The problem you have is that only Jesus fulfilled them and nobody else.\n \n Also, my ignorant Christ denier, it wasn't new testament christians who applied the NT fulfillments to the OT prophecies as you like to claim. The NT believers in Messiah, the followers of Him, the Apostles who lived with Him and witnessed His miracles, testimony and sacrifice on the Cross were all faithful Jews who lived according to the OT Law and had no desire to abandon the God of the Old Testament.

I liken you to a blind man who would stand on a street corner yelling at all the sighted people and insisting that the world they see with their own eyes is just a figment of their imaginations. And he has the audacity to insist that even though there are multiple millions of them who say they see the same thing, then they are all coming from a position of shared ignorance.

Ours is a personal relationship with God and transcends words between men. My salvation experience was a personal and private revelation which only God gets credit for accomplishing. No man or church saved my soul, only the Lord my savior who died that I might live.\n \n To summarize, your interpretation of Easyrider saying this: Nope.

   "Soooo sushi and green beans tomorrow?\n \n I grew up in the 2nd largest Jewish community in the US (at least in the 80s) and I also know about the \"Jews for Jesus\" organization. I know that they have nothing to do with mainstream Judaism. \n \n If you believe Christ is the Messiah, you aren't a Jew, you are a Christian. Really, this isn't rocket science.\n\n \n Since the definition of christian is somebody who believes that jesus was the christ (messiah) that would seem to fit. \n \n Now, since the term \"jew\" identifies both a race and a religion, it could certainly be argued that there are ethnic jews that believe that jesus was the messiah, in which case they would be definition cease to be jews in a religious sense and become christians despite still wearing the \"jew\" ethnic label. \n \n This may, in fact, be the stupidest thread I have ever seen in any forum EVER. \n \n IIRC jito, you have christian leanings. Were you ever so insecure in your faith that you had to defend it to strangers on the internet by filling entire threads with links to show how many people agree with you???? \n \n I dont know that I would classify myself as a christian. I am an agnostic and I do have some very definite ideas about God and to tell you the truth I dont care if I am the only person on the entire planet that agrees with my views on god. I certainly dont feel compelled to post pages and pages of \"Oh, yea...well millions believe what I do and here is the proof of it\". Personally, I think that it is hilarious that somebody who goes on about their \"personal\" relationship with god feels compelled to smear it all over the internet. I firther think that it is pretty funny that this \"personal\" relationship needs to be defined and quantified by the beliefs of millions of other people. The only thing that takes away from the haw haw quality of the posts is that the greatest gift that God gave us....what elevates us above animals...is our intellect. We alone on this planet have the ability to comprehend and solve complex, abstract problems. We were given the gift of logical thought and to refuse to use logic is to spit in the eye of god. \n \n I would further go on to point out (Along the same lines) that to cling to a 2000 year old dogmatic text that any logical, thinking person can recognize dozens of factual flaws in, whether due to problems in translation or downright fabrication by the authors is NOT a sign of a \"personal\" relationship with god. It is a sign of a shallow faith, if it is any faith at all. \n \n It was bible thumpers like those who post here that drove me away from Christianity. I am not interested in any \"faith\" or dogma that requires that I abandon the greatest gift god gave me in order to attain salvation. If god wanted us to be ignorant he would have made us that way and while my view on god may be different than other peoples (or not....I consider my relationship with god to be a personal one, so I dont spend a lot of time discussing it like God is the CRAZIEST whore that I rented for an hour while I was in cuba) I am fairly certain that taking a dump on him by not using the gifts he gave me is not good. It just aint good.",

   "WOW, could you post a more ignorant load of drivel pappi? I mean, if the Messiah was prophesied to be a rooster your lunatic rabbi might have been on to something. Or if you can point to any other historical figure(s) who fulfill the prophecies I posted above and which you quoted, you might also be onto something. The problem you have is that only Jesus fulfilled them and nobody else.\n\n \n OK, let us try and explain this again. The point was to show that with a little effort even a chicken can be shown to fulfill a prophecy. A worthwhile prophecy is going to be given at one time in it's entirety not spread out over centuries. \n \n All you have is random verses (some incorrectly translated and some taken out of context) chosen because someone was able to see a connection between it and Jesus. Prophecy is a extremely poor type of evidence. You can never know with 100% certainty if it's been fulfilled or just seems that way. That of course assumes it's valid in the first place.\n \n So at the end of the day the fact that you can point to several verses and try to say it is evidence for Jesus or salvation for gentiles through faith or anything else just doesn't have much credibility.\n \n Would you put the same amount of trust in John Edwards talking to dead people or Jean Dixon? How about Nostradamus? At least he kept his together and it was not necessary to figure out if what he wrote was supposed to be prophecy or not. \n \n \nAlso, my ignorant Christ denier, it wasn't new testament christians who applied the NT fulfillments to the OT prophecies as you like to claim. The NT believers in Messiah, the followers of Him, the Apostles who lived with Him and witnessed His miracles, testimony and sacrifice on the Cross were all faithful Jews who lived according to the OT Law and had no desire to abandon the God of the Old Testament. Jesus didn't come to bring a new Gospel but to fulfill the Old Testament prophecies which promised His coming. So all of you naysayers attempts to imply that christianity is some perversion of Judaism are missing the boat entirely since the NT is the fulfillment of the OT promises. \n\n \n That is interesting spin, ridiculous idea, but worth a try I guess. Do you also consider Joseph Smith an Orthodox? How about Montanus or Marcion? No they are heretics. I guess technically your right since Paul never lived with him nor witnessed his miracles, testimony or sacrifice. Yet through his teachings within 100 years any semblance to Judaism was gone from Christianity. Hardly what would be considered faithful and devout. \n \n Christians just negotiated better than the Jewish people. In their deal God said this is what I will do and this is what you will do. So it's established what God wants, but Christians didn't want to live by the conditions imposed by God so they gave God what he wanted but changed their obligations. \n \n Again, the prophecy concept I have clearly shown to have no value. \n \n A promise is one sided. God's covenant not to flood the world again is his promise and man is not obligated to do anything. The remaining covenants would be agreements God will do something as long as the people of Israel do something. Go back and read the covenants and tell me what is the time limit stated? Something the equivalent of forever isn't it. So what promise is being fulfilled? Where is it stated that God and Israel no longer are obligated under the agreements made? All Christianity is based on suppositions made by Paul interpreting verses from the Torah. \n \n Christians just negotiated better than the Jewish people. In their deal God said this is what I will do and this is what you will do. So it's established what God wants, but Christians didn't want to live by the conditions imposed by God so they gave God what he wanted but changed their obligations.\n \n \nYou see, \"The stone which the builders (the Jews) rejected, became the cornerstone of the Gentiles faith.\" I'm not sure you are capable of comprehending this quote, but if you are, it could change your eternity. I repeat the fulfilled prophecies for your edification.[/b]\n\n \n I understand it, but it seems you may not fully grasp the what lies behind the statement. You start with the statement to validate what you already believe or wish to. I am looking at the reason for the statement was even uttered.\n \n \n[CENTER][COLOR=&quot;DarkRed&quot;]The Old Testament verses are the prophecy; the New Testament verses proclaim the fulfillment. Check them all out for yourself!\n\n \n Why? I have shown that with such a large pool to choose from, being that any verse is eligible to be prophetic, that anything or anybody can be shown to be the Messiah. \n \n I will ask why it was necessary to misinterpret, change some verses or take them out of context to fit Jesus?",

   "It is main stream Judaism which ostracizes the messianic Jews, not the other way around. But that in no way means that messianic Jews are no longer Jews, or practicing Jews. That you think that making Jesus the center of their worship life means they are no longer jews just reveals how uninformed you are regarding true christianity and Judaism.\n \n \n \nYes it most certainly and without any doubt whatsoever means they are not Jewish. Your confidence in such a ludicrous answer goes beyond ignorance. To be ignorant is to simply not know something, to intentionally refuse to know is fatuous.\n\n \n \nThe messianic Jew is the completed Jew who is precisely what God intended every Jew to be once Messiah came to redeem them. Why you can't see this is beyond me since it seems so obvious to everyone with even an inkling of understanding. Then again, that explains it, right there. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n \nSpoken as a true and biased believer in Jesus defending another believer in Jesus. Perhaps if you bothered to take the entire 2 minutes required to read why Judaism doesn't accept Jews for Jesus. Your understanding of what you understand is obviously misunderstood.\n\n \n And like responding to daewoo, it is equally a waste of time attempting to reason spiritual issues with pappi. He is spiritually blind and can only discern eternal wisdom with the fleshly mind so as to humanize and therefore miss all of the insights available to us in and through Gods Holy Word. None of his arguments are historically or spiritually relevant according to theological principles yet he relies on them as if they are substantial refutations of Mans relationship with his Creator. How sad for you pappi, and what a rude awakening awaits you when you finally learn of your errors. And be assured my lost friend, all of you scoffers and mockers of God and His truths will have to face yourselves one day. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "What gets me about the alleged christians here is that they spew venom and hatred and accuse people of being spiritually dead, and throw their \"personal\" relationship with go in peoples faces like it is explicit pictures of the other persons wife and they throw bible verses around like they really believe them.....but apparently none of their bibles contain the gospel of Matthew.\n \n \n \n Does that not seem to fit those around here who feel compelled to scream that everybody who does not follow their rigid, hate filled version of Christianity is spiritually dead? That is one of my favorite verses in the entire damn book because it does not say \"do not judge unless you think you are right\". \n \n It is followed by this:\n \n \n \n That CERTAINLY fits a number of posters here who claim to be christians but spew nothing but hate and venom. They are not looking for converts. They are not approaching religious conversations in the spirit of any god that anybody who claims to be a christian should be worshiping. They spew hate, they spew venom, they drive people away from the god they claim to follow. \n \n According to the bible, a lot of these people are going to be disappointed:\n \n \n \n If you work against god, even if you do it in his name, who do you serve and if the standard christian understanding of hell and heaven are correct, where are you likely to end up?\n\n \n I know it.

   "Unfortunately you people have bought into the typical politically correct nonsense that Christians cannot make judgment calls about bad behavior. How about you folks start reading the rest of the relevant scriptures?\n \n \"Judge not, and you will not be judged.\" (Matthew 7:1)\n \n Jesus is not saying that we cannot make judgments about people, he is saying that we should not be hypocrites if we do. In Matthew 7:5 he says, \"You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brothers eye.\"\n \n God acknowledges the legitimacy of civil authorities to judge:  \n \n Romans 13:1-4: \"Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. (v. 4) For he (the reigning authority) is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of God's wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.\" (Also note Matthew 5:25; Acts 25:10-11)\n \n God has commanded the church to make correct judgments:\n \n John 7:24: \"Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment.\"\n \n Matthew 18:15-17: \"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses (note Deuteronomy 19:15). If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector .\"\n \n God commands us to judge according to one's 'fruits.'\n \n Matthew 7:17-20: \"Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.....every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.\"\n \n Saints of Christ will judge the world, and angels:\n \n I Corinthians 6:2: \"Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?\"\n \n I Corinthians 6:3: \"Do you not know that we will judge angels?\"\n \n Jesus condemned the teachers of the law and the Pharisees:\n \n Matthew 23:27-28: \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.\"\n \n \n John the Baptist rebukes King Herod for adultery and other sins:\n \n Luke 3:19: \"But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other things he had done, Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.\" \n \n Stephen rebukes the Jewish leaders:\n \n Acts 7:51-53: \"You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit!  Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him - you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.\" \n \n Also note all the Old Testament prophets who condemned sin and corrupt moral leadership, and who were persecuted for their discernment and duty.\n \n Finally, when someone accuses you of being judgmental, are they not being critical and judgmental in making that accusation?\n \n And now you have the rest of the story.\n\n \n You are not judging actions you are judging people which is gods prerogative, not yours.\n \n But then, you dont serve god, do you? Driving people away from christianity by your words and actions....we know who you are serving, regardless of what you claim. \n \n Again:\n \n \n 7:15 \"Watch out for false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are voracious wolves. 7:16 You will recognize them by their fruit. Grapes are not gathered from thorns or figs from thistles, are they? 7:17 In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. 7:18 A good tree is not able to bear bad fruit, nor a bad tree to bear good fruit. 7:19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 7:20 So then, you will recognize them by their fruit. \n\n \n That is you 100%. You claim to walk in gods shadow but spew nothing but venom and hate. You quote scripture for your own ends and claim to be spreading gods word but in all honesty I have debated neo nazis over at stormfront who show more humanity and piety than you. At one point I argued with a guy who was all for rounding up black children and killing them, but I think he is more likely to end up in heaven than you because he was up front about who he was. He did not claim to be spreading hate and venom in the name of god. \n \n Luke 15:3\n \n \nSo he told them this parable: \"What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open country, and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it? And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.' Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.\n\n \n That would seem to indicate to me that when you die and stand before god for judgement, when the discussion turns to how many people you DROVE AWAY from god with the hate and venom and arrogance that you spew in HIS NAME that it is not likely to go well for you. \n \n There is no \"politically correct nonsense\" here. Just some jackass with the user name \"easyrider\" holding himself above God. God does not judge people well enough so you are doing it for him.\n \n Burn in hell false prophet. We know who you serve.",

   "Coming on the board, proclaiming yourself holy and then condemning everyone else to hell isn't debate. \n\n \n I would love for you to post \"ONE\" quote of any of us proclaiming ourselves to be holy while just condemning anyone here to hell. Just one jito, that's all it would take to actually prove your point that we do that at all and take some perverse joy as you infer.\n \n \n I will give credit where its due though, at least Archie has a sense a humor, a few other interests (music) and can stick to the topic at hand. Easy on the other hand just looks for any opportunity to jump in and shout \"you are the devil and going to hell\" regardless of whether it even has anything to do with the thread topic. \n\n \n Easy gets to the crux of the issue by pointing out the futility of your misguided humanist leanings. The only sad part is that his warnings of your impending condemnation goes unheeded.\n \n \n Also, Easy and Archie are not the only right wingers on the board. There are Jyoshu, Jim's Trucking, JP to name a few. At least two of them identify as Christian. None of them resort to these redundant, preach and condemn tactics in every single bloody post.\n\n \n You must learn that just because you take offense at and are convicted by certain debate tactics which some of us practice, that in no way means that our tactics are wrong or offensive. On the contrary, your responses to these tactics means to me that they are very affective in getting your attention regarding the most important message and decision any human being will have to make in their lifetime. \n \n And I'm not condoning blanket condemnations to hell in every post, but am defending that reminding people that hell is the ultimate destination for unrepentant Christ deniers \"in spiritual debates\" is par for the course and proper in such debates. Especially since neither Easy, me or anyone else gives that warning gleefully or with pleasure but does it solemnly as an eternal consequence for those who rebel against a holy God with sanctimonious arrogance. \n \n You know, the people like you who say they would prefer to burn in hell than to go to heaven with people like me. It is a fair warning to say to you that unless you repent, you will most assuredly get your wish to your eternal sorrow and regret. This warning doesn't mean I am condemning you to hell at all. It means I am warning you that you are condemning yourself to hell. So your twisting of the facts by misrepresenting the motivation is dishonest and very telling in regard to your intellectual honesty.",

   "You are not judging actions you are judging people which is gods prerogative, not yours.\n\n \n Did God call the Jews a \"stiff-necked people\" or not? Did Jesus call the pharisees a \"brood of vipers\" or not? Did Stephen not tell the Sanhedrin they were a group of \"stiff-necked people with uncircumcised hearts and minds?\" And so on from the prophet Moses through the New Testament. \n \n By the way, you don't seem to mind judging people yourself, hypocrite. If you weren't so intent on bashing Christians you'd undoubtedly catch a lot less flack around here.\n \n \nBut then, you dont serve god, do you? Driving people away from christianity by your words and actions....we know who you are serving, regardless of what you claim. \n\n \n Stow that nonsense. You've rejected your own Jewish Messiah and now you berate his own people, just like your stiff-necked forefathers did. Like Stephen said in Acts 7, \"You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit! Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One....\"\n \n \nThat is you 100%. You claim to walk in gods shadow...\n\n \n Show me where I claimed that?\n \n \n but spew nothing but venom and hate. You quote scripture for your own ends and claim to be spreading gods word but in all honesty I have debated neo nazis over at stormfront who show more humanity and piety than you. At one point I argued with a guy who was all for rounding up black children and killing them, but I think he is more likely to end up in heaven than you because he was up front about who he was. He did not claim to be spreading hate and venom in the name of god. \n\n \n Daewoo spews his hate and venom...\n \n \n \n...when the discussion turns to how many people you DROVE AWAY from god with the hate and venom and arrogance that you spew in HIS NAME that it is not likely to go well for you. \n\n \n That's just more inane rubbish. There's been nice Christians preaching Christ all your life and you haven't received Christ yet. Plus you've undoubtedly read about Jesus in the Gospels and you've still rejected him. So in reality it doesn't matter whether you get a nice presentation of if someone calls you out for what you are - you're going to spew your anti-Christian venom and no doubt try to lead others down to the same Pit of destrution you yourself are destined for, unless you repent and receive Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior for the remission of your sins. \n \n \n...There is no \"politically correct nonsense\" here. Just some jackass with the user name \"easyrider\" holding himself above God. God does not judge people well enough so you are doing it for him.\n \n Burn in hell false prophet. We know who you serve.\n\n \n You don't know squat. You're full of your own folly. Take another lap around Mt. Sinai, preppie.You're just a modern day version of the spiritually-challenged, cantankerous, Christ deniers that we read about in John chapter 8.\n \n Shall I get you a hammer and some nails so you can start crucifying people?\n \n emoticon_xbouncer",

   "[QUOTE]\nAnd like responding to daewoo, it is equally a waste of time attempting to reason spiritual issues with pappi. He is spiritually blind and can only discern eternal wisdom with the fleshly mind so as to humanize and therefore miss all of the insights available to us in and through Gods Holy Word.\n \n \n AA we are human beings. That is what God's intention for us is. The salvation you believe is to come will not make Christians Gods. Maybe a transformation like a caterpillar to butterfly, but a butterfly in simple words is an adult or evolved caterpillar. We think with a fleshly mind because that is what we have. Eternal spiritual wisdom is not ours, it is promised, but in the future. \n \n How much of man is in God? God has all the emotions of man, but why? We subject God to our contradictions is the only explanation that permits God to retain integrity in what is said to come from God. The commandment speaks of doing unto others and love thy neighbor, but not if you lived in the land of Canaan. What need would an omnipotent God have for a multitude of beings who do nothing but praise their maker.\n \n You stand aloof in your perceived superiority of spiritual knowledge, but is that because of what you actually know or what you don't want to know. Don't kid yourself Christianity teaches that man is a failure, incapable of living up to God's expectations. Having givin up trying, it is the hope that Jesus will talk God into taking pity on man permitting him to enter Heaven conditionally. That is what Christianity has made God's creation.\n \n \nNone of his arguments are historically or spiritually relevant according to theological principles yet he relies on them as if they are substantial refutations of Mans relationship with his Creator. How sad for you pappi, and what a rude awakening awaits you when you finally learn of your errors. And be assured my lost friend, all of you scoffers and mockers of God and His truths will have to face yourselves one day. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Do you think the people at McDonald's get this bitter when people go to Burger King? You are acting like a Cubs fan. Yes they are very relevant to theological principals, they disagree and that is what makes them relevant. Perhaps not to you since your not interested in anything that is contrary to what you believe. \n \n What is worse being spiritually blind or or faithfully blind?",

   "I know it. The behavior is absolutely self-righteous, self-serving. They aren't here to demonstrate their faith in or love for their creator. They are here to resoundingly let us know just how holy they are and how those of us who are different aren't. I have not once seen them approach a discussion with someone who believes differently in way that would do anything except drive them away. Their actions are divisive and thoughtless. Their tactic simple and never deviated from. \"Here is what I believe, here is the religious text that I base it on, believe like me or you are spiritually dead/ignorant/reprobate/etc.\" You can see the same tactics employed by your basic 3rd grade bully for pretty much the same reasons - the use of insult to boost ones own self-esteem. The fact that they operate so narrowly is their misfortune and hardly worth your energy. I just jumped on this thread due to the ridiculousness of it. The idea of a couple of born-agains speaking for the Jewish faith. HIGHSTERICAL!  Maybe the Muslims will come along and start speaking for Christains next. \n \n WOOT!\n emoticon_xbouncer\n\n \n \nLook at the ridiculous response I got to the post where I quoted matthew. We conveniently ignored the following verses where it is pointed out that the mud slingin, venom, and hate being tossed around by the alleged chrisitans here likely identifies them as being in league with satan, regardless of who they claim (or believe to) worship. \n \n Even the respons on JUST the portion about bing judgmental is a steaming pile of ignorant monkey feces. In the verse in matthew they say not to jusde because you will be judged by the same standard. In this case, complete adherence to the \"correct\" beliefs and a \"personal\" relationship with god that you throw around the internet like a high school boy talking about the cheer leader he nailed last weekend.\n \n The problem with that is simple to any thinking person. If nothing but strict adherence and belief in the \"correct\" religion leads to salvation, these people are all obviously going to burn in hell....archie and easy burning the brightest. IF the christian view of god is correct and he is an omnipotent, timeless, infinite being, then there is NO possible way that a human being could actually conceive of him. We are talking about a creature so different from us that we could not possibly comprehend even the simplest aspect of the guy. That makes the odds of the religion they practice being \"right\" being somewhere between zero and none. This is especially true since they are working from a 2000 yr old book that we know is inaccurate and has been changed by politics and human failings over the years.\n \n So, if the standard they put forth is strict adherence to the \"right\" religion and doing it the \"right\" way...well....you can see how they are likely to come out if that is the standard they are judged by.\n\n \n You guys are two peas from the same pod, literally! emoticon_xgood Both speaking about things you have no concept of at all, not to mention the typical self righteous and accusatory condemnation of actual believers in Christ just for daring to call you on your spiritual rebellion. You are here judging and attacking people who live by standards and values which were established in Gods word thousands of years ago, Yet you are completely clueless regarding the shallowness and destitution of your own spiritual condition which according to that same bible says you're in rebellion against our Creator God, and eternally lost. \n \n You are completely incapable of interpreting that the bible is a handbook given to us by a personal God as a personal guide for both salvation and living, yet you claim to be capable of interpreting it in order to condemn us. Well, I'm here to tell you that you couldn't interpret the bible as God intends if your very soul depended on it in your present spiritual condition, which of course it does. And daewoos use of the passages he applied to judge us with which Easyrider correctly placed in proper context showed that you will not only pervert what we represent as believers in Christ, but you will also pervert Gods word in order to condemn us with it dishonestly. You are at least consistent in fulfilling the adage that you are filthy vessels which corrupt and pervert every truth you are exposed to. \n \n Now let me respond to your specific criticism that we are both self righteous and condemning of anyone who disagrees with us because it exposes either your incredible dishonesty or your abject ignorance in grasping what we represent after debating us for years here, and over at least 2 forums in jito's case. \n \n We are here at a secular debate forum as members just like everyone else here. We aren't placed here to evangelize or proselytize but to debate and share our opinions about many issues, not just religious issues. Also, I challenge you once again to show where either of us have ever attacked anyone who asked us sincere questions about our faith. \n \n Like the dishonest liars that you are, you condemn us for properly opposing and pointing out your defense of unscriptural principles and values in debate here. That isn't evidence of self righteous, superior or a condemning to hell attitude at all on our part, but is evidence that we will defend our spiritual values against the lies you represent with uncompromising consistency. And that is the crux of your frustration with us. You hate that we will continue to condemn NOT YOU, but the perverse lies of secular humanism which you define in every self serving post you write. I constantly remind you that you are condemning yourself by rebelling against Gods truths, that not even God Himself will condemn you in that final day since you will clearly see each and every attempt He made to reach you in this life but was soundly rebuffed by you every time. So, you are now, and will literally condemn yourself on that day when in the light of Gods Holy illumination you realize, accept and then admit that He was all around you in this life and that you consciously rejected Him every time the thought of Him entered into your mind and heart.\n \n You will also remember our posts which have reminded you of these spiritual truths and finally you wont hate us anymore, but you will hate yourselves for having rejected, attacked and arrogantly looked down upon us, the only people who continued to share the gospel soul saving eternal truth with you in spite of the sanctimonious and condescending hate speech you directed toward us in every post you ever wrote to us. You will finally realize that you wasted your whole life in a shallow and empty journey of denials of Gods truth with selfish attempts at accomplishing nothing more than satisfying your own lusts of the flesh as you built yourself up at the expense of everyone you ever came into contact with. You will finally understand that unless you were attempting to glorify God with your life, who is worthy and who created you for fellowship, that you were in fact attempting to glorify yourself and the creature over the Creator who is worthy of all glory and honor for ever and ever, amen. Thus, your condemnation is completely self inflicted and has no origin with us in any way. After all, the only eternity we can control is our own.",

I searched out this site based on your recommendation and post it here for your agreement that it reflects your opinion: The Netzarim All I want to say is that I agree with you, and Jesus/Yeshua never intended to oppose the teaching in Deuteronomy 13:1-6 in spirit or in practice, nor did He in any way. \n \n Deu 13:1 If there arise in the midst of you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he give you a sign or a wonder,\n Deu 13:2 and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spoke to you, saying, Let us go after other gods, which you have not known, and let us serve them;\n Deu 13:3 you shall not listen to the words of that prophet, or to that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proves you, to know whether you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.\n Deu 13:4 You shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his mitzvot, and obey his voice, and you shall serve him, and cleave to him.\n Deu 13:5 That prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because he has spoken rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Mitzrayim, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to draw you aside out of the way which the LORD your God commanded you to walk in. So shall you put away the evil from the midst of you.\n Deu 13:6 If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend, who is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known, you, nor your fathers;\n Deu 13:7 of the gods of the peoples who are round about you, near to you, or far off from you, from the one end of the eretz even to the other end of the eretz;\n Deu 13:8 you shall not consent to him, nor listen to him; neither shall your eye pity him, neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him:\n Deu 13:9 but you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.\n Deu 13:10 You shall stone him to death with stones, because he has sought to draw you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Mitzrayim, out of the house of bondage.\n \n Remember, it was Yeshua Messiah who said this to the Jews of His day as He travelled Galilee with His message of salvation.

   "Archangel,\n Thanks for your welcome! I am glad to hear that you researched our site!\n You quote Matt 5.17 and I want to comment on that.\n \n A logical analysis (found here: [netzarim.co.il]) of the earliest manusscripts (including the logical implications of the research by Ben-Gurion Univ. Prof. of Linguistics Elisha Qimron of Dead Sea Scroll 4Q MMT) of \"Matthew\", implies that Ribi Yehoshua was a Perushi (Pharisee). Ribi Yehoshua was called a Ribi and only the Perushim had Ribis.\n \n This implies that Ribi Yehoshua cannot have uttered all the words found in \"Matthew\" and that a reconstruction is necessary.\n Ribi Yehoshua said this in the original version:\n \n \"Don't think that I came to uproot the Torah or the Neviim [prophets], but rather I came to reconcile them with the Oral Law of emet (truth). Should the heavens and ha-aretz (the land, particularly referring to Israel) exchange places, still, not even one ' (yod) nor one ` (qeren) of the Oral Law of Mosheh shall so much as exchange places; until it shall become that it is all being fully ratified and performed non-selectively. For whoever deletes one Oral Law from the Torah, or shall teach others such, by those in the Realm of the heavens he shall be called \"deleted.\" Both he who preserves and he who teaches them shall be called Ribi in the Realm of the heavens. For I tell you that unless your Tzedaqah (righteousness) is over and above that of the Sophrim, and of the [probably 'Herodian'] Rabbinic-Perushim (Perushim is hellenized to \"Pharisees\"), there is no way you will enter into the Realm of the heavens! \"\n Netzarim Reconstruction of Hebrew Matityahu 5:17-20.\n \n The first paragraph above with facts implies that Ribi Yehoshua was a Torah-teacher who didn't deviate from Torah. Thus his view of foregiveness can impossibly have deviated from Torah.\n \n Here follows the Tan''kh (the Jewish Bible)-view of foregiveness:\n How to live in order to enable the Creator in His loving kindness to provide His foregivness is outlined in Tan''kh ( the Jewish Bible) ; and was also taught by the first century Ribi Yehoshua from Nazareth (the Mashiakh; the Messiah) (His teachings are found in the above Netzarim-website.) \n \n Tan''kh - for example Yekh\u00ebzqeil (Hezekiel) 18 - promises foregivness to those and only those who do their sincerest to keep the mitzwot (commandments) in Torah. The Creator cannot lie and He does not change (Malakhi 3:6)! According to Tehilim (\"Psalms\") 103 the Creator gives His foregivness to those who do their sincerest to keep His berit (\"covenant\"; the pre-conditions to be included in the berit is according to the Jewish Bible to do ones sincerest to keep Torah). \n \n No human can keep Torah perfectly. There is a provision. Ribi Yehoshua ha-Mashiakh lived and kept Torah with the sincerest of his heart, died innocently and became a sacrifice. Because of that the Creator can give His foregiveness for the short comings (in keeping Torah) to everyone doing his/her sincerest to keep His instructions found in Torah, and to everyone turning away from their Torah-breaches to instead starting to do their sincerest to keep the instructions in Torah.\n \n Living in the above described way until one dies implies that the Creator will continue to give His forgiveness during one's whole life, which will keep ones nephesh (psyche) in a connection with the Creator, which will lead to ha-olam haba (which Christians would call \"heaven\"). While not living in the above described way, according to Yekhezeqeil, won't lead to ha-olam haba.\n \n The view presented in John 3:16 contradicts the above view on atonement according to Tan''kh, and thus it is impossible that Ribi Yehoshua ever taught the view found in John 3:16.\n \n The counterfeit of the historical Torah-teacher Ribi Yehoshua ha-Mashiakh (the Messiah) is named Jesus (not a historical person) is ascribed the words in John 3:16. That the two are not the same are also clear from the derivation of the name \"Ieisous\" (greek). The derivation is not from the Hebrew name \"Yehoshua\". See the above Netzarim-websitel ; \"History Museum\"; Ieisous-section.\n \n Best regards,Anders Branderud",

   "Archangel,\n Thanks for your welcome! I am glad to hear that you researched our site!\n You quote Matt 5.17 and I want to comment on that.\n \n A logical analysis (found here: [netzarim.co.il]) of the earliest manusscripts (including the logical implications of the research by Ben-Gurion Univ. Prof. of Linguistics Elisha Qimron of Dead Sea Scroll 4Q MMT) of &#8220;Matthew&#8221;, implies that Ribi Yehoshua was a Perushi (Pharisee). Ribi Yehoshua was called a Ribi and only the Perushim had Ribis.\n \n This implies that Ribi Yehoshua cannot have uttered all the words found in &#8220;Matthew&#8221; and that a reconstruction is necessary.\n Ribi Yehoshua said this in the original version:\n \n \"Don't think that I came to uproot the Torah or the Neviim [prophets], but rather I came to reconcile them with the Oral Law of emet (truth). Should the heavens and ha-aretz (the land, particularly referring to Israel) exchange places, still, not even one ' (yod) nor one ` (qeren) of the Oral Law of Mosheh shall so much as exchange places; until it shall become that it is all being fully ratified and performed non-selectively. For whoever deletes one Oral Law from the Torah, or shall teach others such, by those in the Realm of the heavens he shall be called \"deleted.\" Both he who preserves and he who teaches them shall be called Ribi in the Realm of the heavens. For I tell you that unless your Tzedaqah (righteousness) is over and above that of the Sophrim, and of the [probably 'Herodian'] Rabbinic-Perushim (Perushim is hellenized to \"Pharisees\"), there is no way you will enter into the Realm of the heavens! &#8220;\n Netzarim Reconstruction of Hebrew Matityahu 5:17-20.\n \n The first paragraph above with facts implies that Ribi Yehoshua was a Torah-teacher who didn&#8217;t deviate from Torah. Thus his view of foregiveness can impossibly have deviated from Torah.\n\n \n Greetings, Anders! I believe Archangel already responded concerning the Law. I'll go off in another direction here. The command was from the Lord to the Israelites to adhere to the Law. Later, they broke the Covenant (Jeremiah 31:32) and a new Covenant was promised (Jeremiah 31:31-34).\n \n But God gave the Old Covenant and it's Laws. That God is Jesus Christ, who is seen in the OT as \"THE Angel of the Lord\" in the Burning Bush account (aka The Jehovah Angel, and not to be confused with an angel or any other angel/messenger), where in context angel means messenger (note: the same Hebrew word used as angel in the Burning Bush account is translated as \"messenger\" in a Messianic prophecy in Malachi:\n \n \"See, I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come,\" says the LORD Almighty. - Malachi 3:1\n \n Here's some info on \"THE Angel of the Lord\": \n \n The Angel of the Lord\n \n Ministering Spirits - The Angel Of The Lord\n \n And, as God, Jesus has the authority to fulfill an old covenant and create a new covenant, especially when the old covenant was broken. Remember, the commands in Deuteronomy and the Torah were given to men, not to God, but by him - by Jesus.\n \n Either that, or you have an angel giving out the Law, forgiving sin, etc., etc. \n \n In addition, no one besides Christ has ever been able to keep the Law. Not in thought or in deed. And if you want to state that you are still under the Law, someone might say we need to start seeing some animal sacrifices, the stoning of gays and adulterers, and a lot of other things that just aren't seen any more.\n \n There is also the question of the \"Prophet like Moses\" (Deuteronomy 18). Jesus is the Prophet like Moses (The Israelites were told to listen to him and do what he commands). \n \n Jesus, the Prophet Like Moses\n \n http://www.hebrew4christians.com/Articles/Like_Moses/like_moses.html\n \n It is my contention that Torah followers are in violation of the commandment of God / Christ in Deuteronomy 18 to follow the teachings of Jesus.\n \n Those are some of my thoughts.\n \n Happy New Year!\n \n Easyrider.",

   "Hi Anders, welcome to the forum. I searched out this site based on your recommendation and post it here for your agreement that it reflects your opinion: The Netzarim All I want to say is that I agree with you, and Jesus/Yeshua never intended to oppose the teaching in Deuteronomy 13:1-6 in spirit or in practice, nor did He in any way. \n \n Deu 13:1 If there arise in the midst of you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he give you a sign or a wonder,\n Deu 13:2 and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spoke to you, saying, Let us go after other gods, which you have not known, and let us serve them;\n Deu 13:3 you shall not listen to the words of that prophet, or to that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proves you, to know whether you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.\n Deu 13:4 You shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his mitzvot, and obey his voice, and you shall serve him, and cleave to him.\n Deu 13:5 That prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because he has spoken rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Mitzrayim, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to draw you aside out of the way which the LORD your God commanded you to walk in. So shall you put away the evil from the midst of you.\n Deu 13:6 If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend, who is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known, you, nor your fathers;\n Deu 13:7 of the gods of the peoples who are round about you, near to you, or far off from you, from the one end of the eretz even to the other end of the eretz;\n Deu 13:8 you shall not consent to him, nor listen to him; neither shall your eye pity him, neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him:\n Deu 13:9 but you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.\n Deu 13:10 You shall stone him to death with stones, because he has sought to draw you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Mitzrayim, out of the house of bondage.\n \n Remember, it was Yeshua Messiah who said this to the Jews of His day as He travelled Galilee with His message of salvation. He was very clear in telling the Jew that HE was the promised Messiah in fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy.\n \n Mat 5:17 \"Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.\n Mat 5:18 \"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished.\n Mat 5:19 \"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others {to do} the same, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches {them,} he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\n\n \n I really see this differently. Reading it objectively my first question is what about the Writings?\n \n Heaven and Earth are still here so the Law should not have changed as all has not been accomplished. Those things left undone are thought to be done at the 2nd coming.\n \n Paul without question annuls the law, but Jesus I believe points out interpretation problems, but I don't believe goes as far as actually saying do not do that anymore.",
