(Jesus Seminar) to name a few.\n \n I call these authors Anti-Supernatural, Anti-Biblical, and Historical Revisionists, and Orion retorts that my sources are \"fundamentalists\" or that my websites lack credibility.\n \n So, what is all this broohaha, and what is the big debate concerning the Jesus Christ of History Vs. the Jesus of the Christian Faith?\n \n Orion has Paul Tillich, I would answer with the great Protestant martyr Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Craig Blomberg, Ph. D., and C.S. Lewis.\n \n Orion, has the student and fan of Tillich, Jack Spong, and his paganistic pantheism. (PanENtheism?) In reply, I have this stunning refutation from: Apologia Magazine - Click Here - Spong Rebuked\n \n Next, I would cite one of the stars of the Angelican firmament, Tom Wright, or Bishop NT Wright (See his Quest for Jesus) Also J.P. Moreland, and his book:Click Here:Scaling the Secular City - The Historicity of the New Testament - By J.P.

Coming from the Evangelical POV, many of Orion's sources are Non-Christian, heretical or out and out Apostasy! \n \n A few historical top topics of cyber mud wrestling have been, the Vigin Birth, Jesus and Miracles, the Resurrection and the Harmony of the Gospel accounts, Alledged Biblical Contradictions and assorted Prophesies.

   "If there is one common theme for Orion and his authors, it is attacking the Historical Jesus Christ and the Bible.\n \n But this is nothing new, as history is full of attacks on the veracity of the Gospels\n \n Over the last two hundred years, the historical veracity of the Bible has been under attack from both within and without the faith. The attacks range from questioning whether Jesus ever existed (He did), to postulating bizarre theories regarding Jesus that have far less empirical evidence to back them than do the Gospels themselves. The chart below lists some of the primary skeptics since the 18th century:\n \n Skeptic - Date - Premise\n \n H.S. Reimarus 1778\n \n Claimed disciples stole the body of Jesus, and made up the resurrection story \n \n David Friedrich Strauss 1835\n \n In Life of Jesus, doubted historical accuracy of gospels \n \n Bruno Bauer 1882\n \n Denied that Jesus actually lived \n \n William Wrede 1901\n \n In Messianic Secret, claimed that the evangelists had put words in the mouth of Jesus to make theological points \n \n Albert Schweitzer 1906\n \n In The Quest of the Historical Jesus, denies that Jesus was the Messiah \n Religions-geschichtliche Schule c. 1900\n \n Drew parallels between Christianity and other religious sects in the Mideast \n \n K.L. Schmidt 1919\n \n Claims details of time and place in the Gospels are fabricated \n \n Elizabeth Clare Prophet 1984\n \n In Lost Years of Jesus, pictures Jesus as a mystic traveling in India for 17 years \n \n Michael Bagent, Henry Lincoln 1982\n \n In Holy Blood, Holy Grail, Jesus as the husband of Mary Magdalene \n \n G.A. Wells 1971, 1975, 1982\n \n In three different books, questions whether Jesus ever existed \n \n Jesus Seminar 1993\n \n Panel members voted on which words of Jesus are \"accurate\"; The Five Gospels claim that only 18% of the words attributed to Jesus are verifiable\n \n Gardner, Laurence 1996\n \n In Bloodline of the Holy Grail, Jesus as 1) husband of Mary Magdalene; 2) an Essene teacher; 3) brother of Joseph of Arimathea\n \n As we procede through the list of Orion sources, you will see this theme reapeated over andover again.",

   "This is a classic, and about three years ago, we posted over on The Atlantic, all the various retorts to:\n \n The Gnostic Gospels\n \n Elaine Pagels\n \n This book is a classic in the field of revisionist Gospel scholarship and part of the thinking that newly discovered documents much later than the Gospels give us a clearer view of early Christianity than the New Testament. Since the Gnostic Gospels was first published in 1979 the Nag Hammadi library has become much better known and many other authors have joined in trying to show they are of much greater significance than they actually are.\n \n What they tell us about is an off shoot of Christianity called Gnosticism that thrived in Egypt between the second and forth centuries. The ideas of this sect were far more mystical than orthodox Christianity and seem to tie in nicely with our own New Age philosophy. This makes Gnosticism seem relevant and appealing today. Pagels attempts to show how there was a battle for the soul of Christianity in the second century that was won by the masochistic tyrants of the Catholic church rather than the free loving feminists of Gnosticism. To achieve this she quotes from selected passages and tries to present a coherent Gnostic philosophy from the hopeless mish-mash of ideas in the original sources.\n \n Professional scholar that she is Pagels couches her ideas in plenty of maybes, perhapses and possiblies. But her central claim, that Christianity was formed because of the political agendas of the early Christians rather than from the teachings of Jesus and the apostles has become the dominant revisionist hypothesis.\n \n Bede.org.uk - Click Here",

   "Look folks, somebody - anybody can read Orion's fave' authors, but if you don't mind, most Christians have no interest.\n \n One more book review, from my Liberal source: Bede - Click Here\n \n Well, two, indeed, here are a pair of Anti-Biblical clowns!\n \n The Historical Jesus - the Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant\n \n The Jesus that emerges from all this book, is one that seems remarkably consistent with the Marxist methodology of the author - John Dominic Crossan\n \n and\n \n Resurrection: Myth or Reality\n \n John Shelby Spong\n \n Spong is a liberal Episcopal bishop who has written a number of books attacking Christian fundamentalism. His point that the central message of the inclusiveness of God's love seems to be missing from much extremist rhetoric is a good one. Unfortunately, that doesn't excuse this book which is a piece of all round poor scholarship.\n \n His thesis depends on reading the Gospels as a Jewish mid rash, that is as allegorical or fictional accounts based on Hebrew scripture that are intended to enlighten the reader. Certainly if one chooses to call the Gospels allegorical and fictional one is going to conclude that much of what is described did not happen. The trouble is that there is no evidence that the Gospels were intended to be read in this way. In particular, Luke insists he is writing down what happened and John twice claims eye witness attestation. Spong could claim they were making it up but not that they intended that their readers wouldn't believe what they wrote was true.\n \n This book is a good example of revisionist thinking. The author rejects the miraculous a priori. He is then left with the texts that contradict his point of view so he has to explain why they say what they do. The usual method is to make the texts so remote from the events they describe that we can simply interpret them any way we like. The revisionist will then interpret them as fictional. Historians, of course, cannot do this. They just have to take the evidence as they find it. And that means that they accept that the tomb was empty on Sunday morning. If they don't believe Jesus rose from the dead then they have to claim persons unknown moved the body. They also accept that the disciples thought he had risen and founded a religion on the strength of it.",

   "Frequently, Orion makes the claim that only a few make exclusive claims of Truth, or a Literal interpretation, yet all the while making his own exclusive claims about Jesus, God and Religion.\n \n So, what is Truth?\n \n Very simply stated, truth is the judgment expressed when we use the word \"is.\"\n \n The verb \"is\" asserts some-thing about reality to which the statement conforms. \n \n In other words, the statement \"This is so,\" expresses a state of existence that is real, and not dependent on belief in it in order to make it true. The reality being represented is objective, universal, and transcendent. This is precisely the logic by which we operate, and the logic by which we either make statements about reality or make denials about what is not real. \n \n \"The logic of truth is the same for all exclusionary claims to truth\"\n \n (Mortimer Adler, Truth in Religion, p. 10).\n \n Truth by definition is exclusive. If truth were all-inclusive, nothing would be false. And if nothing were false, what would be the meaning of true? Furthermore, if nothing were false, would it be true to say that everything is false? It quickly becomes evident that nonsense would follow. In short, therefore, truth boils down to two tests: Statements must correspond to reality, and any system of thought that is developed as a result must be coherent. The correspondence and coherence tests are applied by all of us in matters that affect us.\n \n Therefore, when Jesus said, \"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No man comes to the Father except through me,\" He was making a very reasonable statement by affirming truth's exclusivity. \n \n The question one may legitimately ask is whether He demonstrated that claim rather than just stating it.\n \n The Inextinguishable Light",

Three things can be said about them. First, they are pre-Pauline and very early. They use language which is not characteristically Pauline, they often translate easily back into Aramaic, and they show features of Hebrew poetry and thought-forms. This means that they came into existence while the church was heavily Jewish and that they became standard, recognized creeds and hymns well before their incorporation into Paul's letters. Most scholars date them from 33 to 48. Some, like Hengel, date many of them in the first decade after Jesus&#8217; death.\n \n Second, the content of these creeds and hymns centers on the death, resurrection, and deity of Christ. They consistently present a portrait of a miraculous and divine Jesus who rose from the dead. Third, they served as hymns of worship in the liturgy of the early assemblies and as didactic expressions for teaching the Christology of the church.\n \n In sum, the idea of a fully divine, miracle-working Jesus who rose from the dead was present during the first decade of Christianity. Such a view was not a legend which arose several decades after the crucifixion.\n \n Galatians 1 and 2\n \n All scholars agree that Galatians was written by Paul. Paul tells us that he received his understanding of who Jesus was and what he did from a supernatural experience within a year or two after the crucifixion. He also points out that he went to Jerusalem three years later and the apostles there agreed that his message of a divine Son of God who was crucified and rose from the dead was correct. There is no reason to doubt that Paul visited the apostles, since he has no motive for lying and, further, such a visit fits well with the Jewish practice of looking to authorized teachers of a Rabbi's doctrines for controls on doctrinal purity. Thus, belief in a divine, risen Jesus was in existence within just a few years after his death.\n \n Excerpt from Scaling the Secular City - By J.P.

One might think that the natural alternative to a (unlikely) virgin birth would be a (likely) normal birth. Christians who believed that Jesus was divine exercised the widespread Hellenistic prerogative of having their hero also born exceptionally.\n \n But Spong&#8217;s rage against \"literalists,\" whose belief in the virgin birth and whose honor of Mary have apparently been responsible for every oppression against women in Western civilization, demands a conspiracy of more sinister and titillating character. Enter his therapeutic rereading: Mary was in reality a teenaged girl who was raped and became pregnant with an illegitimate child and was taken under the protection of Joseph. Spong offers no evidence for this speculation beyond Schaberg&#8217;s already highly tendentious appropriation of anti-Christian slanders (apparently deriving from Jewish [Talmud] sources) peddled in the second century by Celsus.\n \n It is apparent, however, that Spong is not truly interested in \"what really happened.\"\n \n His interest is in freeing Christianity from its dogmative entanglements, which he more or less identifies with fundamentalism. Spong is negative toward the birth narratives because, he suggests, they represent a displacement in Christianity which began as an Easter rather than a Christmas event. But what is Easter for Spong? Well, it seems to have been \"not so muc. . . a supernatural external miracle but. . . the dawning internal realization that this life of Jesus reflected a new image of God, an image that defied the conventional wisdom, an image that called into question the exalted king as the primary analogy by which God could be understood.\" The resurrection as end to patriarchy via conceptual correction? Of course, Spong insists that Christians got all this wrong from the start by thinking that Jesus was divine. Now, let&#8217;s follow the argument. The infancy narratives are simply a further expression of the fundamental error that birthed Christianity? Having a bishop with these views is a little like hiring a plumber who wants to \"rethink pipes.\"\n \n Bishop Spong thinks he has escaped his fundamentalist past, but he has not. He remains defined by the literalism he so strenuously battles, and his vaunted \"liberalism\" is one confined by a tired rationalism.\n Reshuffling the Gospels - Clcik Here",
