   "Isn't this ironic? The government tried to protect society from the harmfulness of alcohol but ended up deliberately making alcohol even more harmful.\n\n Another way to look at it is that the government tried to protect stores of industrial ethanol that were targeted by organized crime as an easy score and used to turn a quick profit. The alcohol was never intended to be consumed in the first place.",
