   "so i watched a documentary last night on PBS about how flight started; apparently two trains of thought: either flight arose from dinosaurs, starting on the ground and developing the flapping skill, or animals with wings started off being completely arboreous, gliding from tree to tree like the flying squirrel and developing wing-flapping latter on. check out this fossil called Microraptor:\n \n too big to post\n \n 4 wings, yo. crazy XXXX. so either it looked like this:\n http://images.livescience.com/images/Avian_Microraptor_03_10.jpg\n gliding one, or this:\n http://www.planetdinosaur.com/dinosaur_list/images/microraptor_web.jpg\n ground-dwelling.\n \n the whole debate was really crazy. heres the link to the video:\n The Four-Winged Dinosaur | NOVA | PBS Video\n \n me, im throwing in the the Harvard folk, microraptor was a land dweller. the most compelling piece of rebuttal is that the glider believers used casts from the original fossil, and the bones were clearly crushed. they built their model resembling a crushed skeleton! but then again, four wings suggests gliding.\n \n and of course, theres always the argument that God threw some birds in the air and they started to fly, but you know...",

I guess bats did it though.\n\n Well, not exactly. Some birds do eat insects and catch them on the fly (swallows), at night (goatsuckers and swifts). But, it's a big niche. There are enough insects to go around. Last summer I went up to Austin to see the Mexican free tailed bats exit the Congress street bridge. In late summer, about 1.5 million bats fly out from under the bridge to hunt insects. But while we were waiting for the sun to set and the bats to begin their forays, we watched the nighthawks (Chordeiles minor - Family Caprimulgidae, the Goatsuckers) soaring overhead, preying on the same insects as the bats. Of course, the birds don't use echolocation to find prey, so they aren't in the same niche as the bats. Moreover, there are many, many species of fruit bats (some 44 genera with 194 species), some known as flying foxes, that don't use echolocation and don't eat insects.",

I think it supports my statement that the niche squirrels would move into would have to push birds out the way first, this being because the only reason bats were able to do it is because of their echolocation and the ability to hunt at night. \n \n So squirrels might need their own gimmick?",
