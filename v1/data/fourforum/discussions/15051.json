So here you go...\n \n I believe in and support Evolution as the explanation for the advancement of Life and hope that the scientists of the world will continue to compile enough evidence to prove to the rest of the world that there is no creator and that we all evolved .\n \n As far as religion, well religion has trampled on the rights of others since it's inception so what comes around goes around is my view. I don't have a problem with religious people if they choose to believe in fairy tales, but when religious people force their doctrine on society and into Government I do have a problem with it. Religion In my Opinion should be eradicated from the planet. It's Dangerous, Promotes Bigotry and hate, Teaches Outright Lies, and the list goes on. So I guess in answer of your question I would say for me it's a resounding YES...I would like to Rid the world of religion.",

In doing that, they inadvertently realized that abigenesis, and other sciences like SETI, didn't fit the criteria that they themselves established! The keeping of abiogenesis and SETI established as science has had no choice but to quickly spiral into a web of lies, deceit, and most importantly, using the U.S. court system with its ACLU warchest, not public opinion, to maintain the atheist status quo in the scientific community. \n \n \nwhat is relevant is that there is no evidence to support anything other than a natural origin to modern biological entities by means of evolutionary theory, and thus, any challenges must have massive substantial emperical evidence, with an absolutely mindblowing theory to assist. \n\n \n \"Natural origin\", by means of \"evolutionary theory\"?

After you check all that out, you can then decide if you'd like to come back here and contribute to a deeper exploration of DOUBLE STANDARDS throughout the scientific community.\n\n \n first of all, not directed at me, abiogenesis is not considered an accepted scientific theory. very little evidence exists for the theory more is being discovered and researched, and the theory is still being constructed - in no way is it considered by anyone to be accepted science. it is researched in universities which are publically funded, and theres a good reason for that. thats because there IS evidence to support the theory. thus, research will commence.\n \n thanks for sharing that information. but would a possibility also be that the more educated a person is, the more they will drift to the left? you musnt just jump to the conclusion that universities are politically biased based on these statistics, maybe they hire based solely on intellect and teaching ability, and those individuals are found to be politically left. afterall, university students are mainly liberal as well, and theres no way to tell where a person is politically by a university application, so the enrollment services have no way to bias their decisions. coincidence? maybe not.\n \n you said \"atheists are freely allowed to use evolution/abiogenesis as an atheist tool\"... ok, but since when were we talking about atheists? i was referring only to science, and evolution is NOT a tool used by scientists to bring down religion. atheists will use certain pieces of information against religion, sure. thats what they do. and evolution can be used as such. but is that the premise which evolution was founded upon? absolutely not. is that the \"goal\" evolution has in the scientific community? absolutely not. evolution in the science realm is strictly scientific, as with all areas of study in the scientific realm.\n \n now, it is also true that the religious people use ID as an attack against evolution and atheism, but again, i dont care what these people use - they dont make any impact on the scientific community. i am only arguing in the defense of SCIENCE, not atheism, and against the ID BIG SHOTS, not just any old religious person or ID supporter.\n \n so, lets compare again:\n evolution in the science world is strictly science based.\n ID in the science world (or ID big shot world) is meant to bring down evolution and replace it with religious studies.\n evolution is not used by scientists to attack religion.\n ID is used by ID big shots to attack evolution-accepted science.\n \n it would have to be Darwin's writing because i was talking about the founding member of each ideology (Darwin and Johnson), devising their ideas based on either destroying religion or destroying evolution-accepted science, respectively. if Dawkins wrote about evolution being a tool against religion, i dont care. he would be speaking as an atheist, not a scientists, which ive stated before, i dont care about what atheists use against religion in this discussion. if it were Darwin, that would be an issue of concern, but his theory would still be correct nonetheless.\n \n about abiogenesis and SETI, abiogenesis is studied because there is a little bit of evidence for it, and more is being discovered. SETI is not studied in universities, its more of an after school project. and atheists have nothing to do with science. scientists are the ones focused on science, atheists are focused on religion.\n \n if you read what i had wrote, i said:\n \n \"a natural origin to modern biological entities by means of evolutionary theory\"\n \n MODERN... as in the biological organisms we have today. as in the ones that developed by means of evolutionary theory.\n \n so ID is a thorn in the side of atheism, correct? so it's purpose for existence is to convert atheists to christianity? so the reason ID supporters are trying to get ID into science classrooms is to destroy evolution, in order to convert atheists? right?",

Without the addition of outside intelligence, raw matter and energy will not produce auto organization and machinery. This latter assertion is actually repeatedly borne out by experimental observation - new machinery requires intelligence. And intelligence in biological systems is from the non-material instructions of DNA. \n\n \n That was about 1/3 down the page at this link;\n \n CSC - Peer-Reviewed & Peer-Edited Scientific Publications Supporting the Theory of Intelligent Design (Annotated)\n \n This is ID research, it is not religion, it is scientific experimentation. Abiogenesis studies are not one bit more scientific than this. \n \n \nthanks for sharing that information. but would a possibility also be that the more educated a person is, the more they will drift to the left? \n\n \n Yes, but \"education\" is an imperfect human endeavor. Being taught WHAT to think, not HOW to think, is suspected by many of being a problem with today's educational systems. Science isn't the only source of knowledge, especially when it comes to politics. \n \n \nyou musnt just jump to the conclusion that universities are politically biased based on these statistics, maybe they hire based solely on intellect and teaching ability, and those individuals are found to be politically left. afterall, university students are mainly liberal as well, and theres no way to tell where a person is politically by a university application, so the enrollment services have no way to bias their decisions. coincidence? maybe not. \n\n \n I'm not jumping to conclusions, I've done some research on it. I've read a book called \"The Professors\" that shows proof of drastic anti-American leanings of 100 U.S. university professors. \n \n \nyou said \"atheists are freely allowed to use evolution/abiogenesis as an atheist tool\"... ok, but since when were we talking about atheists? i was referring only to science, and evolution is NOT a tool used by scientists to bring down religion. atheists will use certain pieces of information against religion, sure. thats what they do. and evolution can be used as such. but is that the premise which evolution was founded upon? absolutely not. is that the \"goal\" evolution has in the scientific community? absolutely not. evolution in the science realm is strictly scientific, as with all areas of study in the scientific realm. \n\n \n We just have to agree to disagree - I believe, considering Darwin's state of mind in 1859, and considering the subsequent works of Huxley, Spencer, and many others leading up to all the authors of the books I showed in post #24, evolution was founded upon the premise of atheism, to a comparable degree that ID was founded on the premise of religion. Both of them have been extended into secular science. Evolution has more, simply because it has had more time, and didn't have to face any 'entrance requirements' to become science. Evolution was largely rejected by the scientific community when Darwin's non-peer reviewed book, 'Origin of Species' was released. Yet no one politically blocked it from the public scientific realm. \n \n \nnow, it is also true that the religious people use ID as an attack against evolution and atheism, but again, i dont care what these people use - they dont make any impact on the scientific community. \n\n \n Not everyone sees it as an attack, some see it as new scientific pathways. As \"falsification\" science, something that the open inquiry of science is supposed to embrace. That it doesn't make the slightest impact on the scientific community indicates that they may be atheists first, and scientists second. \n \n \ni am only arguing in the defense of SCIENCE, not atheism, and against the ID BIG SHOTS, not just any old religious person or ID supporter. \n\n \n As I'm only arguing in the defense of science, not religion, and against the SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY BIG SHOTS, like Steven Weinberg, and the authors of all those books I referenced above. You seem to see a threat (a political threat?) from ID big shots. I fear a political threat from scientific community big shots. I believe that, at least in the U.S., my fear is more justified than yours. If you're not from the U.S., then our discussion on it is probably going to have to be limited. Not because I respect you less than I do a U.S. citizen, (I don't at all) but because of the ignorance both of us have about the political structure of the other one's country. \n \n \nso, lets compare again:\n evolution in the science world is strictly science based. \n\n \n Unless scientific community big shots like Steven Weinberg claim that it should be used to by the scientific community to destroy religion, and the rest of the scientific community doesn't criticize in any way. \n \n \nID in the science world (or ID big shot world) is meant to bring down evolution and replace it with religious studies. \n\n \n Not forcibly. If the scientific discoveries it makes about pathways and origins of information in the cell cause that to happen, it's not religion's fault. \n \n \nevolution is not used by scientists to attack religion. \n\n \n If noted scientists say it should be, and other scientists wink and nod at that statement, it's common sense to believe that it is. \n \n \nID is used by ID big shots to attack evolution-accepted science. \n\n \n Double standard. No one responding to me has yet to address the double standards. \n \n \nit would have to be Darwin's writing because i was talking about the founding member of each ideology (Darwin and Johnson), devising their ideas based on either destroying religion or destroying evolution-accepted science, respectively. if Dawkins wrote about evolution being a tool against religion, i dont care. he would be speaking as an atheist, not a scientists, which ive stated before, i dont care about what atheists use against religion in this discussion. if it were Darwin, that would be an issue of concern, but his theory would still be correct nonetheless. \n\n \n It's just that ID proponents don't' worship Johnson like you do Darwin. Those credentialed scientists who took his idea and applied actual science to it, left Johnson's religion in the dust. Similar to the way that modern biology left Darwin's ideas of the simplest forms of life in the dust. \n \n \nabout abiogenesis and SETI, abiogenesis is studied because there is a little bit of evidence for it, and more is being discovered. SETI is not studied in universities, its more of an after school project. and atheists have nothing to do with science. scientists are the ones focused on science, atheists are focused on religion. \n\n \n \nWe're in classrooms across the nation. Institute scientists are co-authors of college-level textbooks: Life in the Universe, a national best-seller for introductory astrobiology, and Perspectives on Astronomy, a widely adopted text for introductory astronomy. \n\n \n SETI Institute\n \n SETI stands for \" Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence\". Nothing found yet. Nothing testable, repeatable, observable, falsifiable. Yet it automatically became science, with no 'entrance qualifications' like ID has demanded of it. \n \n \nif you read what i had wrote, i said:\n \n \"a natural origin to modern biological entities by means of evolutionary theory\"\n \n MODERN... as in the biological organisms we have today. as in the ones that developed by means of evolutionary theory. \n\n \n Yes modern, as in recent discoveries about the staggering complexity in the simplest forms of life. About modern comparisons of design, about similarities in human designed systems (one part missing, entire system ceases to operate - and in biology, one part missing, entire system ceases to operate.) \n \n \nso ID is a thorn in the side of atheism, correct? so it's purpose for existence is to convert atheists to christianity? so the reason ID supporters are trying to get ID into science classrooms is to destroy evolution, in order to convert atheists? right?\n\n \n It's purpose for existence is open inquiry. It's purpose for existence is to provide balance to atheism, to teach new entrants in the field HOW to think, not WHAT to think.",

   "ID could also indicate that technologically advanced aliens designed then planted the seeds of life on earth. If that turns out to be true how would you feel about ID then? My guess is that you and your people would drop it like a hot potato.\n\n \n The way ID is put forward by Behe and Dembski, there's really no way it could identify a specific designer. It could possibly identify some characteristics of a designer, and of course different people would interpret the identity of the designer in different ways. It would be like someone buying a house from a realtor, long after the designer(s)/builder(s) had left the scene, with the intent of gutting it, and remodeling/adding to it. He could, for example, take note of how the basic structural members seem overbuilt to him, while the trim, gutters, HVAC, etc, would seem careless and underbuilt. He could determine that the builder took the basics more seriously than the trim. Or he could determine that there were two different people, (or crews) that did each job. If he saw some structural members much better built than others, he could speculate that there was more than one person, or crew, doing the designing. Or that there was only one, but that one might have been an old guy, and was in a bad mood on some days. It wouldn't be anything more than speculation. But the facts of how it was built wouldn't be speculation. Or he could be an atheist, and try to make the case that the rain fell and beat dead trees into boards, and the wind blew them all into a nice house. :p",

ID has no empirical evidence to base their theoretical assertions on, and minimal work is being done to find any, because as jyoshu said, evidence for a designer is unfindable. a peer reviewed article means nothing if you are writing based on assertions and not evidence. the SC will reject it based on that alone. so, both abiogenesis and ID are not accepted by the SC as of yet, the people working on abiogenesis dont complain, but rather work their arses off getting more evidence, whereas ID people whine and complain that their measely excuse for a \"scientific theory\" without any evidence whatsoever to support, is ignored by the SC based on that alone...\n \n \"Yes, but &#8220;education&#8221; is an imperfect human endeavor.

ID is slightly different, in that it claims to be a theory, however its a \"theory\" founded upon nothing empirical. how can one start a theory without any evidence to begin with? thats an epic assertion that deserves no recognition from the SC or schools right off the bat. find some evidence first, then conduct a theory - thats how its worked ever since Galileo's time, but ID proponents ignored this in their struggle to get ID and thus creationism and thus religion taught in schools and printed in textbooks. they dont care for science! if they did, they would follow the scientific method.\n \n \"Yes modern, as in recent discoveries about the staggering complexity in the simplest forms of life.

We have a hypothesis:If intelligent extraterrestrial life exists, we should be able to detect EM signals if we look in the right place at the right time.\n \n What do we do then? We go looking for it. We test it. There is nothing unscientific about this. Maybe one day we will find it, maybe we never will. \n \n For ID the hypothesis is:God created everything so there must be a way to prove alternate theories false since a belief we hold as true is ultimately uncontradictable. \n \n That is what ID is and that is why it is unscientific.

   "i never said abiogenesis wasnt science... i said its not yet an accepted scientific theory. heres the difference between abiogenesis and ID in terms of scientific acceptance: abiogenesis has theoretical and empirical evidence to support the theory, not enough for the scientific community (SC) to accept it just yet, the abiogenesis people are still working on it. \n\n \n With public funding/grants. \n \n \nID has no empirical evidence to base their theoretical assertions on, and minimal work is being done to find any, \n\n \n Because it has no public funding/grants. Violates the constitutionally mandated separation of church and state, donchaknow. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nbecause as jyoshu said, evidence for a designer is unfindable. \n\n \n As is evidence for naturalistic origins of life. Even if today's scientific community finally manages to create life from non life in a test tube, it doesn't mean it had to have happened that way originally on earth. Evidence for a designer and evidence for naturalistic origins are equally findable/unfindable. \n \n \na peer reviewed article means nothing if you are writing based on assertions and not evidence. the SC will reject it based on that alone. so, both abiogenesis and ID are not accepted by the SC as of yet, the people working on abiogenesis dont complain, but rather work their arses off getting more evidence, whereas ID people whine and complain that their measely excuse for a \"scientific theory\" without any evidence whatsoever to support, is ignored by the SC based on that alone...\n\n \n They don't complain because they get public funding! ID studies do not. They don't complain because the scientific community is looking over their shoulder and encouraging them every step of the way, all the while shouting that ID will never be science no matter what it does. They don't complain because they're free to write about their speculation in public school science textbooks, and don't have to worry about being hauled into court.\n \n \nevolution was not founded on atheism, in fact Darwin was not an atheist when he came up with his theory - he only became such afterwards. evolution was founded on the same principles as other scientific theories of its time - evidence, reason and inquiry. he spent 20 years collecting evidence and refining his theory to the best of his abilities before publishing \"Origin\", and no, it was not rejected by the SC. it was rejected by the public on religious bounds, but the theory was hesitantly accepted by the SC.\n \n heres the major problem with ID being accepted: if it is, evolution must be false, in part or in whole. and considering the amount of evidence, that is nearly impossible. every piece of evidence collected in 170 years + must either be a hoax, or an incorrect assessment. \n\n \n Not every piece, just some pieces. Much of that evidence was collected by Darwin, and many others, who thought that the cell wasn't much more than a simple blob of protoplasm. Things have changed, in our knowledge of the simplest forms of life. The scientific community doesn't like anything that lessens the chances of something happening in nature that isn't the result of blind, undirected processes. It can't prove wrong what Behe and a few others have found, but it can ignore/downplay it. \n \n \ninteresting how none of the books youve mentioned are scientific publications - but rather atheist publications.\n\n \n I referenced a Nobel Prize winning scientist. He, however indirectly, lavished praise on those books. \n \n \n if you plan to argue against the SC big shots, as you say, i would suggest referencing scientific publications as opposed to books on atheism. if you truly cared about science, you wouldnt care about atheist books, and you wouldnt be against the scientific community (you would be on their side, afterall), but you would pay attention to scientific literature and the basis on which the SC judges accepted theories. maybe if you did that, you would realize why ID is rejected. check out some books by Stephen Jay Gould. \n\n \n I prefer books by Behe and Dembski, and the movie \"Expelled\". It caught Steven Jay Gould, and others like him, without their normal talking points as handy as they usually are. \n \n \ndo you honestly think modern science has left Darwin in the dust? every biologist ive ever asked has said that the best scientist in the world was Darwin, and for good reason. his theory has stood over 150 years with very little modifications, and additions made as technology developed. the man was a genius! every year my department celebrates his birthday (which coincidentally is my birthdayemoticon_xbouncer yea, i share my birthday with Darwin!!!) with a community dinner. thats how much the SC appreciates the work he did, and still accepts him as a brilliant scientist. \n\n \n Yet in another thread, you said this;\n \n \nnobody acknowledges \"Darwinian evolution\" as being the forefront of evolutionary theory. we have constructed and advanced Darwin's original theory to the point where it can no longer be referred to as \"Darwin's theory\". we call it the \"Modern Synthesis\" now or modern biological synthesis - something along those lines referrs to the current evolutionary theory. \n\n \n Looks like YOU said modern science has left Darwin in the dust. Which of the above two paragraphs you wrote do you actually believe? \"Very little modifications\", or \"advanced Darwin's original theory to the point where it can no longer be referred to as \"Darwin's theory\". we call it the \"Modern Synthesis\"? \n \n \nSETI is an experiment. it isnt taught as scientific fact, for the reasons you said. students may be shown how it works, and what could potentially be found by it, but it isnt even a scientific theory - its an experiment. aliens are not taught in classrooms, or accepted by the SC, because there is no evidence for them - just like ID. \n\n \n \"What could potentially be found by it\"? How is that defined? How could it be more objective than what could be found by ID, concerning pathways of information in keeping with known laws of thermodynamics? \n \n \nand again, its SETI who is progressing and continuing to search - ID continues to attack the evolution-accepted SC for not accepting their rubbish \"theory\" on the basis that there is NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE. lets pretend SETI is a scientific theory that doesnt have any evidence to support it. would it be right for the SETI people to protest the SC for not accepting them based on them not finding anything yet? no, they will continue to look until they find something, and if they dont find anything, the SETI theory goes in the trash. \n\n \n So when will that be - what are the timelines? I can't find the 'SETI dissolve date' anywhere on their website. \n \n \nID is slightly different, in that it claims to be a theory, however its a \"theory\" founded upon nothing empirical. how can one start a theory without any evidence to begin with? thats an epic assertion that deserves no recognition from the SC or schools right off the bat. find some evidence first, then conduct a theory - thats how its worked ever since Galileo's time, but ID proponents ignored this in their struggle to get ID and thus creationism and thus religion taught in schools and printed in textbooks. they dont care for science! if they did, they would follow the scientific method.\n\n \n I've shown you ways they follow the scientific method. \"...thus religion taught in schools\", you're shutting your eyes and holding your ears.

   "This is actually a good example of what science is. We have a hypothesis:If intelligent extraterrestrial life exists, we should be able to detect EM signals if we look in the right place at the right time.\n \n What do we do then? We go looking for it. We test it. There is nothing unscientific about this. Maybe one day we will find it, maybe we never will. \n\n \n That's exactly identical to ID. It's a hypothesis, recent discoveries about the simplest forms of life show decreased likelihood that it arose by random, unguided processes. Maybe the information in DNA was there from the beginning (top down, from the peer reviewed paper that I linked). What do we do then? We go looking for it (if we're not an atheist) We test it, if we're not an atheist. There's nothing unscientific about this. \n \n \nFor ID the hypothesis is:God created everything so there must be a way to prove alternate theories false since a belief we hold as true is ultimately uncontradictable. \n\n \n That's not what ID is, and most in the scientific community know it. \n \n \nThat is what ID is and that is why it is unscientific. The former starts with an actual hypothesis. ID starts with nothing more than a bold statement. \n\n \n From the SETI website;\n \nThe mission of the SETI Institute is to explore, understand and explain the origin, nature and prevalence of life in the universe.\n We believe we are conducting the most profound search in human history - to know our beginnings and our place among the stars. \n\n \n You don't see bold statements there, and I do. What is a bold statement and what is a thoughtful hypothesis is completely subjective. Different worldviews see them differently. \n \n \nLook at IC. The hypothesis here is:IC structures cannot evolve by a stepwise process required by the TOE because any subsequent version would be nonfunctional. \n\n \n Where do you get that hypothesis? Wouldn't \"may be nonfunctional\" be more accurate? \n \n \nAgain, no hypothesis but instead a bold statement taking advantage of the chaotic nature and non-repeatable history of evolution. You can't test it and it's therefore non-scientific. Further, it has been debunked by actual science that proposes the opposite and then supports it with observation. \n \n To sum it up, ID supporters need to quit crying about their non-acceptance into the scientific community. If you want to be accepted you must be scientific. If you want to be scientific, you have to come up with answers that make sense and have something to back them up. Until you do, you will continue to look nothing more than religious.\n\n \n Like abiogenesis, I know. Like SETI's sightings of space men, I know.",

What is a bold statement and what is a thoughtful hypothesis is completely subjective. Different worldviews see them differently. \n\n What bold statement? That is in fact their mission. They're not claiming anything is absolutely true like ID does. They are simply saying that want to find proof of intelligent life and to understand the origins of life in the universe. The only thing they would make an absolute claim about is that no religion has yet come up with a satisfactory answer to the question of the origin of life. \n \n \nLook at IC. The hypothesis here is:IC structures cannot evolve by a stepwise process required by the TOE because any subsequent version would be nonfunctional.\n \n\n \n Where do you get that hypothesis? Wouldn't \"may be nonfunctional\" be more accurate? \n\n \n I meant previous instead of subsequent. \n \n Anyways, any science needs to make predictions. If ID is in fact science, you would need to provide some testable prediction. It doesn't even matter if it has been tested, you just have to provide something. \n \n Here is what I found:\n \n \n\n \n FAQ: Does intelligent design make predictions? Is it testable?\n \n \n The Short Answer: Yes. Intelligent design theory predicts: 1) that we will find specified complexity in biology. One special easily detectable form of specified complexity is irreducible complexity. We can test design by trying to reverse engineer biological structures to determine if there is an \"irreducible core.\" Intelligent design also makes other predictions, such as 2) rapid appearance of complexity in the fossil record, 3) re-usage of similar parts in different organisms, and 4) function for biological structures. Each of these predictions may be tested--and have been confirmed through testing!\n\n \n 1) Specified complexity is very vaguely defined and basically says that you should find complex information with a specific purpose within a genome. Well duh, biology is complicated. Life is complicated, functions are complicated etc etc. Basically, if the sky is blue, then I predict you should be able to see blue when you look up. Give us something here, how about predicting a signature or a story encoded in DNA or information that isn't linked to the survival of the organism. \n \n 2) Why? Because God created life and did it in 6 days? Where is this prediction derived - what in ID says this must be true and that exactly the pace we see in nature of the introduction of new species is what ID predicts? What about the huge sways in this pace that are evident in the fossil record? \n \n 3) Why? Where did this come from? If different organisms should re-use the same parts, why so many variations? This is no prediction, it is simply tagging along with what is already evident. \n \n 4) ID predicts that there should be functions for biological parts? Please...\n \n Very weak...surely someone has come up with something that at least makes you stop and think.",
