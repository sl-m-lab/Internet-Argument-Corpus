He was 91.\n \n Roberts died of complications from pneumonia in Newport Beach, Calif., according to his spokesman, A. Larry Ross. The evangelist was hospitalized after a fall on Saturday. He had survived two heart attacks in the 1990s and a broken hip in 2006.\n Evangelist Oral Roberts dies in Calif. at age 91 - Yahoo!

Mom went and asked when they would call the R's so we could go up to the podium and Roberts could lay ahold of me with those 'healing hands' and restore my hearing. \n \n On the last day of the crusade, an assistant told all in the audience who needed 'healing' to line up along the walls of the auditorium and Roberts walked along the line laid ahold of each on the head and muttered some words, I don't recall what. I couldn't hear him anyway as I refused to wear my hearing aid, believing he would heal me.\n \n Afterwards, when I returned to school, sans hearing aid, and people asked if he had healed me and I told them that he had.

No one can destroy your faith unless You allow them to do so and one cannot lose something they never had in the first place. Still, however, I view Oral Roberts and his ilk as only slightly above bottom dwelling unscrupulous lawyers and lying used car salesmen.\n \n Certainly I forgave Roberts a long, long, time ago. He was a charlatan pure and simple, and I believe my greatest issue with him was not me, but the fact of my mom's and dad's hope as they felt so guilty all their life for the streptomycin even though it was the doctor who administered it. \n \n It has been no great loss. If I don't want to listen to someone, I simply turn off my hearing aid and let them ramble on to their hearts content while I stare at them with that 'dazed' and 'attentive' look. \n \n I would much rather be deaf than be blind.",
