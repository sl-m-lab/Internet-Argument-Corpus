   "The author is spot on. Chirac is a disaster. I was no fan of de Gaulle but compared to Chirac he was a saint.\n ===========================\n \n Chirac, Europe's Weakest Link\n By Denis MacShane\n Newsweek International\n \n May 23 issue - The scene: one of those interminable wrangles in the cold, bunkerlike building in Brussels where Europe's leaders meet to advance by inches the construction of the old continent. As Britain's Europe minister, I am helping myself to a ham sandwich and chatting to Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer. Suddenly a tall, slightly stooped figure rushes up. \"Quick, quick, I need something to eat and a drink.\"\n \n It is Jacques Chirac. He looks eagerly at the well-filled ham baguettes on the German's plate. But Fischer says: \"You're not having mine.\" I step forward and say he can have my untouched food. \"Merci, merci, l'Angleterre,\" he says, and grabs a glass of beer to loop back into the meeting.\n \n Anyone who sits in on the talkfests that keep Europe moving knows the French president loves to eat. Yet there is not a spare pound on his rangy frame, with its long arms and mobile, expressive hands always ready to grasp an arm or shake any proffered hand-a European version of Lyndon Johnson in his need for physical contact and his passion for politics, politics, politics.\n \n Chirac is the fifth president of France under its Fifth Republic, whose Constitution endows immense powers upon its president. It presumes that France needs one single executive leader-a democratic Bonaparte. The system worked under de Gaulle, in the 1960s, who transformed France by quitting Algeria, building nuclear weapons and forging a strong statist economy. It worked under Giscard d'Estaing, in the 1970s, who liberalized France by allowing abortion and built a network of nuclear power plants that freed France from Middle East oil dependency. It worked under Mitterrand, in the 1980s, who pursued a ruthless (if well disguised) policy of modernizing French industry and expanding its export capabilities, even while strengthening the European Union through the single market and laying the base for its single currency, the euro.\n \n Then, in May 1995, came Chirac, a man who was already prime minister when Tony Blair fronted an Oxford student rock band. Now, after a decade as president, all of France and all of Europe ask one question: what has he achieved? France has had its worst decade of economic growth since World War II. Poverty is increasing. Tourists still flock to Paris, Avignon and Cannes, but they don't visit the districts where France's 5 million Muslims live in underclass conditions. And Chirac has weakened France on the world stage, in contrast to all his predecessors.\n \n Every French friend I talk to sounds such criticism...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7856477/site/newsweek/",

However, in retrospect, one could easily think back to Mitterand and see we had far better relations with him and he was most certainly a socialist. I think Chirac has been an utter disaster. Not that he isn't a capable politician. He can probably communicate rather well (although I don't speak French) than our \"cowboy\" president. But that doesn't measure the man.
