   "What are the chances of this being an extinct species of ape that we have never known about. Could it be possible?\n\n The question doesn't make sense. Of course it is an extinct species of ape that we have never known about. It lived 13 million years ago, which explains why we haven't known about it.\n \n As the BBC article explains, the great apes are thought to have separated from the lesser apes between 11 and 16 million years ago. This extimate is based on genetic evidence as well as other fossils. And here is a fossil that lived at the right time and shows characteristics of the lesser apes as well as the great apes. The hands indicate that it walked like monkeys, on its hands rather than on the knuckles like the great apes, and yet other characteristics indicate that it may have climbed like the great apes rather than monkeys.\n \n Probably there were several similar species. Evolution rarely seems to procede like a ladder where a single species is followed by another single species. Evolution is usually bushy, with several similar species that usually exist at the same time. The significance here is that if the great apes and the lesser apes share an ancestor, we would expect it to look much like this animal and we would expect it to have lived at about the time that this animal did. This is a transitional.",

   "Sorry, its just that i had a read of the article, and they were suggesting this could fill one of the missing links in the human evolution tree.\n\n Certainly. Lots of evidence suggests that the lesser apes and the great apes had a common ancestor. There has been some fossil evidence in the past. The problem is that the environment in which apes live doesn't preserve fossils. Thus, ape fossils are quite rare.\n \n The term \"missing link\" became meaningless before I was born. It is essentially a nonsense term that is only used by creationists and the media. If you think about it, if we have the \"link\" it isn't missing, and if it is missing then we have no knowledge of it.\n \nSo i guess what i was trieing to say is that, this could have nothing to do with the evolution tree, and that it could well be just another ape, just like we have other apes today that are seperate from the human evolution tree?.\n\n Everything has to do with the tree of life. This isn't just another ape. It is one that shows characteristics of both the lesser apes and the great apes. It was found in strata that are of the correct age for such a presumed transitional. Unless someone can show that it is actually much older or much younger, or that it shows characteristics that are not derivative of monkeys, or that it shows characteristics that are not precursive of the great apes, then it seems to be a transitional.\n \n Yes. Today we have apes that are separate from the human evolutionary tree. But we have a common ancestor with the chimps, and the chimps and humans have a common ancestor with the gorilla, and chimps, gorillas and humans have a common ancestor with the orangutan. This fossil (Pierolapithecus catalaunicus) seems to be in the tree between monkeys and modern African apes. From what I have read, current opinion is that this animal lived after the common ancestor with the orangutan. In fact, oranutan ancestral fossils have been found way to the east, much closer to the current habitat of the orang.\n \nAfter all we are still evolving in some direction....\n\n And tomorrow we may be evolving in a different direction. There is no \"direction\" to evolution. Evolution is adaptive. What works in any given environment is what determines the direction of evolution. It's a matter of who gets the most mates and how likely those offspring are to mate.\n \n To state, \"we are still evolving\" would have been enough. We don't really know the \"direction\", whatever that means in evolutionary terms.",
