It is reportable. There is no doctor who would not at least tell someone else. There are clearly some \"non-progressors\", those who have HIV infection, yet never become immunocompromised. That is an area of intense investigation. No one has ever converted from HIV positive to negative. Therefore your story lacks verisimilitude is many aspects, hence it received the attention it did. You friend, if he is a Christian, could help millions by coming forward and telling his story. \n \n I thought you originally said you had two friends cured of AIDS.\n \n The second is possible.

Now, about 30 years later, he is still alive and well and AIDs/HIV negative.\n\n \n Ahh yes... a true miracle. Praise Jesus indeed!!!\n \n I assume by \"fungus thing\" you actually mean Candidiasis, also known as Thrush or a yeast infection. A fungal infection most commonly caused by a diploid fungus known as Candida albicans. Candidiasis is a far less common symptom of HIV infection. By itself in the absense of other symptoms, it would rarely ever lead to an HIV test. Candidiasis is much more prevelent in females than males, however it does occur in males. I still however find it unlikely that a physician would test someone for HIV simply on the diagnosis of Candidiasis. It just does not happen like that. \n \n But now we get to the true miracle of your account. 30 years later, and still HIV free. This is where the true miracle comes in. The virus that causes AIDS was first identified in 1983 (that would be 24 years ago if my 3rd grade math calculations are correct.) It was initially named lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV) by the French scientists who discovered it, then in 1984 renamed human T lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) by Gallo et.al. The term HIV was not coined until the French and US came together to agree on 1 term for the virus, finally settling on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the year 1986. \n \n Now, the first test for HIV was the ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay). It is highly sensitive, and very nonspecific, which means it gives a positive result easily even when there is no HIV present. As many as four out of five ELISA tests cannot be confirmed by Western Blot. This test was first developed and used in 1985 (which if my 3rd grade math is still warmed up, would make make identification of HIV (HTLV-III) possible only 22 years ago). Sure...22...it's like 30 sorta.\n \n Yes indeed, truely a miracle to behold!!!",

   "One friend had recieved a blood transfusion after surgery. It was tainted with HIV, and he ended up getting symptoms of it - that fungus thing. He went in and the Doctor diagnosed it. He and his wifecame to church and asked us to keep them in their prayers. I prayed every night, and a few weeks later, when he went tothe Doctor for checkup on the progression of the disease, the octor nearly fainted. He managed to tell him that there was no markers of HIV/AIDS, etc. Tehy did numerous follow-up tests, and all turned up negative. Now, about 30 years later, he is still alive and well and AIDs/HIV negative.\n \n Another friend, more recently, went to the doctor when she found numerous lumps in her breasts. The doctor examined her and they found she had cancer, and that it had metastisised to her lungs. The doctor figured she needed surgery and also chemotherapy, and even then, she would die within a few years. \n She asked us to pray for her, and every night our Church met and prayed, and i prayedevery moment of the day that I could. When she went in for the surgery, they scanned her to see if it had spreaded and so they knew whatthey were going to remove, and they found that every single cancerous tumor and growth had disappeared, and there wasn't even any scarring or anything where the grwoths had been.\nLet's assume you are correct in your belief that the power of prayer DID in fact heal these two people.\n \n The problem in my mind is that the power of prayer seems to be quite selective in its delivery of divine help. I can't believe that god would permit innocent children to die of cancer yet heal others. Does this make any rational sense? People pray everyday for help from terminal diseases, thousands, and yet they die. Does this make any rational sense? It sure doesn't to me. What about the families who have prayed for their children, siblings and others serving in Iraq to return safely, yet they return in a casket.\n \n To me, it isn't that it may or may not work. The bigger question is why does it only work for a select few? My answer is that it doesn't. There was a recent study of heart procedures. One group was prayed for (double blind study) the other group was not. The results were that those who were prayed for did worse in recovery than those who were not prayed for.

   "Ahh yes... a true miracle. Praise Jesus indeed!!!\n \n I assume by \"fungus thing\" you actually mean Candidiasis, also known as Thrush or a yeast infection. A fungal infection most commonly caused by a diploid fungus known as Candida albicans. Candidiasis is a far less common symptom of HIV infection. By itself in the absense of other symptoms, it would rarely ever lead to an HIV test. Candidiasis is much more prevelent in females than males, however it does occur in males. I still however find it unlikely that a physician would test someone for HIV simply on the diagnosis of Candidiasis. It just does not happen like that. \n \n But now we get to the true miracle of your account. 30 years later, and still HIV free. This is where the true miracle comes in. The virus that causes AIDS was first identified in 1983 (that would be 24 years ago if my 3rd grade math calculations are correct.) It was initially named lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV) by the French scientists who discovered it, then in 1984 renamed human T lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) by Gallo et.al. The term HIV was not coined until the French and US came together to agree on 1 term for the virus, finally settling on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the year 1986. \n \n Now, the first test for HIV was the ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay). It is highly sensitive, and very nonspecific, which means it gives a positive result easily even when there is no HIV present. As many as four out of five ELISA tests cannot be confirmed by Western Blot. This test was first developed and used in 1985 (which if my 3rd grade math is still warmed up, would make make identification of HIV (HTLV-III) possible only 22 years ago). Sure...22...it's like 30 sorta.\n \n Yes indeed, truely a miracle to behold!!!\n\n \n I said ABOUT 30 years later. I couldn't rememberthe exact year, and as time goes by it becomes harder to remember the exact dates of the innumerous miracles that God has preformed as a result of the prayer of me and my church",

Does this provide proof of the existence of a particular deity? Or does it merely suggest that those who were prayed for had a greater belief that they would recover (and therefore their bodies produced the right chemicals to aid that recovery)? Believing in or wanting to recover greatly helps that recovery.\n \n Surely, for a proper analysis you would need a group that were told they were being prayed for and a group that were told they were not being prayed for. Would this be a kind thing to do? Of course, you would also need a group that was told they were being prayed for, but the teller would have their fingers crossed behind their back at the time of telling.\n \n Stretching this a bit further. Let us next say that those doing the praying were a mixture of many religions. Would positive results in this study prove the existence of more than one deity? Would positive results in this study prove that it is just the positive attitude of the prayee (one who is prayed for) that is the significant telling factor?\n \n If a more intricate analysis were done of the recovery rates of those prayed for by each religious group, would it show that many deities exist but some are more concerned about people's health than others?\n \n What if you had a group of atheists who just hoped for the recovery of the patients?\n \n Too many questions . . . \n \n The thing that really gets me is the suggestion that if someone does not recover, then it is their fault for not believing enough. This is the get out clause used by too many 'religious healers' to hide their fraud.\n \n Unfortunately, they are, to some extent, right. Believing in your cure is a major factor in your recovery.

That He does as he pleases and wishes...regardless of what anyone else wants. He rewards and punishes according to his own desires.

   "You said more than that. In addition to admitting one cannot demonstrate that prayer has any effect, you also made the claim that the opposite can neither be demonstrated. \n You are claiming we can never know either way. Because you cannot prove that something is real, does not mean the converse is true.\n You are claiming that the negative cannot be proven.\n\n \n Correct. You can't. Yours is a double-standard because you seem to think that you CAN prove prayer doesn't work. But you can't prove it does OR doesn't. The same reasons that apply to why you can't prove it works also apply to why you can't prove it doesn't. The reason is that you would never know if it would or wouldn't without the prayer being said, on any given event. As Carl Sagan used to say, absence of evidence is NOT evidence of absence.\n \n \nI assume you are defining miracle as meaning \"god did it.\"\n\n \n Yep, that's what I'm talking about. A supernatural event done by God. We are discussing within the context of the topic of prayer, after all, and by definition, any event that happens as a result of prayer would be a miracle.\n \n So if I read the rest of your answer correctly, these two items are what it would take to convince you:\n [*]being shown \"that the event could not be reasonably explained by more mundane reasons\"[*]being shown evidence that \"God did it\".\n Both of those things are impossible to prove. Because with requirement #1, any non-supernatural reason is always going to be the more 'reasonable' explanation to you. I dare say that if someone somewhere grew back an amputated limb, you'd more readily explain this by the possibility of a very, very rare genetic mutation than you would a supernatural miracle. Correct me if I'm wrong. And with requirement #2, well, that's sort of like proving the existence of God--you can't prove God did it. It's a matter of faith. \n \n So the bottom line here is that you are already to the point that nothing could ever convince you that miracles--answered prayers--are real. You've already essentially made up your mind.\n \n \nAsking for the tiniest shred of evidence that a miracle occurred is not being dogmatic.\n\n \n But you're asking for evidence you're going to always reject in favor of a more 'reasonable' answer, because there's always going to be some way to answer it a different way.

Brain washing from the earliest age.\n\n \n It explains the logic disconnect and bizaar beliefs many create, they have an inbuilt inability to break away from it all.\n \n This is seen in self professed Christians who's stated belief systems barely mirror what's stated in their holy text. Many trying to live in the rational and scientific world but, having that claw of belief clinging to them. \n For example, point out to a evolutionist believing Christian that without a literal Genesis there's no 'Fall from grace'. Without that Fall, there's no need for salvation by a Messiah...Fundamentalists understand this. But, liberal Christians, in order to justify their belief system, create new stories that 'sound good' almost out of whole cloth.\n Some try to cling to their beliefs simply because the morality they sift out of the garbage is good. Tell them they can have the same morality with a different system free of the garbage...and it seems they have trouble accepting that.\n \n You can also see it in many who follow NRM (new religious movements). They get upset with the tenants of their 'non-sensical' belief system and jump out of it...and right into another system...that could be worse than the one before it.\n When asked why they do this, most say they 'feel something is there', not understanding that that feeling is simply the primitive chord that was bound into them from conditioning. \n \n This is not to say I condone the removal of such conditioning for all.
