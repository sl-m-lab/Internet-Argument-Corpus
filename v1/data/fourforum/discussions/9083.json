   "Evolutionists, in an attempt to win converts, have a habit of saying evolution is a fact. Here is a quote from Ernst Mayr from \"What Evolution Is.\":\n \n \"Evolution is not merely an idea, a theory or a conept, but is the name of a process in nature, the occurrence of which can be documented by mountains of evidence that nobody has been able to refute....It is now actually misleading to refer to evolution as a theory, considering the massive evidence that has been discovered over the last 140 years documenting its existence. Evolution is no longer a theory it is simply a fact.\"\n \n And of course, when Mayr says \"evolution\" is a fact, he's obviously referring to the evolution that is presented in his book(s) ....which is Neo-darwinism....Neo-darwinism, of course, supposedly confirms the fossils found in the geologic column.\n \n But see, anyone who knows just a little bit about it can quickly see that neo-darwinism is nothing but a theory. It's a fairytale based on pure philosophy....and this philosophy is based on a foundation of assumptions. And the problem is, if one of these assumption is proven incorrect, then the whole theory collapses. And if the whole theory collapses, then science has to start over and re-evaluate everything.\n \n As I see it there are 3 main assumptions. The first is that evolution procedes by random mutations. The second is that selection is non-random on the level of the organism. The third is that evolution is gradual. If you take any of these away then the whole philosophy collapses. But see, this wouldn't be the case if the theory was actually a fact -- as Mayr claims.\n \n So let's start out by looking at the bottom paragraph of the following link:\n \n http://www.molevol.org/camel/projects/synthesis/\n \n Here's what it says:\n \n Thus, while there are clearly common threads linking past and present thought in evolutionary biology, the evolutionary theory of today is not that of Darwin, nor even that of Darwin's mid-20th-century successors. This yet-to-be-named new view, with its empirical emphasis on rates and patterns of divergence, and its reliance on, not only natural selection, but also mutation biases and developmental constraints as causes of non-randomness in evolution, has already enjoyed considerable success. \n \n Ok...the sentence to remember is the last one, specifically the words \"mutation biases.\" See, those two simple words cause the whole theory -- er..\"fact\" -- of evolution to crash. And not only that, but it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that the version which atheists around the world have fallen in love with is nothing but an unfounded philosophy...and that's because the simple falsification of random mutations can dismantle the whole theory. Check out these quotes from Gould:\n \n By the way, as you're reading them, please keep in mind this quote from Dawkins: \n \n Without natural selection there is no evolution -- Richard Dawkins\n -----------------------------------------------------\n \n In a sense, the specter of directed variability threatens Darwinism even more seriously than any putative failure of the other two postulates. Insufficient variation stalls natural selection; saltation deprives selection of a creative role but still calls upon Darwin's mechanism as a negative force. With directed variation, however, natural selection can be bypassed entirely. If adaptive pressures automatically trigger heritable variation in favored directions, then trends can proceed under regimes of random mortality; natural selection, acting as a negative force, can, at most, accelerate the change. (Gould 2002: 145) \n \n and another...\n \n Selection becomes creative only if it can impart direction to evolution by superintending the slow and steady accumulation of favored subsets from an isotropic pool of variation. If gradualism does not accompany this process of change, selection must relinquish this creative role and Darwinism then fails as a creative source of evolutionary novelty. If important new features, or entire new taxa, arise as large and discontinuous variations, then creativity lies in the production of the variation itself. Natural selection no longer causes evolution, and can only act as a headsman for the unfit, thus promoting changes that originated in other ways. Gradualism therefore becomes a logical consequence of the operation of natural selection in Darwin's creative mode. (Gould 2002: 149)\n \n and another...\n \n In order to act as raw material only, variation must walk a tightrope between two unacceptable alternatives. first and foremost, variation must exist in sufficient amounts, for natural selection can make nothing, and must rely upon bounty thus provided; but variation must not be too florid or showy either, lest it become the creative agent of change itself. Variation, in short, must be copious, small in extent, and undirected. A full taxonomy of non-Darwinian evolutionary theories may be elaborated by their denials of one or more of these central assumptions. (Gould 2002: 141) \n \n and another:\n \n Darwin held firmly to the credo of small-scale variability as raw material because both poles of his great accomplishment required this proviso.... At the theoretical pole, natural selection can only operate in a creative manner if its cumulating force builds adaptation step by step from an isotropic pool of small-scale variability. If the primary source of evolutionary innovation must be sought in the occasional luck of fortuitous saltations, then internal forces of variation become the creative agents of change, and natural selection can only help to eliminate the unfit after the fit arise by some other process. (Gould 2002: 143-142) \n -------------------------------------\n \n Ok.....so from Mayr we were told that evolution is a \"fact\"....Yet Gould says that directed variation stalls selection.\n \n And indeed, like Dawkins says, without natural selection there is no darwinism...there is no evolution...at least not the kind you chance-worshiping evolutionists want. Instead, we must assume that biological change arises from within the individual via cues from the enviornment See, it's either one or the other. Either animals change via random mutations + selection (selectionism) or they change internally via directed/biased variation cued by the enviornment (structuralism). It's one or the other. If animals change via structuralism then it must somehow be shown how a monkey could change into a human by a mere change of environment.\n \n But see, evolutionists aren't stupid....even they know that no matter what environment a human is in, he will remain a human. In fact, the only feasible way that a tree-swinging monkey could change into a man would be through some freak accident (aka -- random mutations.) And that is why evolutionists for the past century have been hiding from, denying, laughing, and scoffing at the notion that variation is non-random....because it destroys their whole theory -- a theory, of which is based on a platform of philosophy -- the philosophy of the unseen, unproven beneficial random mutation.\n \n And so there it is. Evolutionists fight and claw their way into people's hearts by convincing them that evolution is a \"FACT\" --- but it's no more a fact than Republicans or Democrats claiming their political views are facts. If evolution was indeed a fact, it would not crumble so easily by a simple falsification.\n \n And with just one falsification, it raises eyebrows about everything. Look at the fossil record. They say each level of earth represents millions of years....and these millions of years were necessary because it took animals that long to change via RM + NS -- and indeed it might. But heck, if variation is non-random, then it nullifies gradualism -- which nullifies the whole time-frame allocated for change in the geologic column. Then what?\n \n Evolution is a fact? Right.",

   "And of course, when Mayr says \"evolution\" is a fact, he's obviously referring to the evolution that is presented in his book(s) ....which is Neo-darwinism\n\n No, this is a clumsy conflation. Mayr is stating that the process in nature called evolution is a fact. We have observed it happening; the evidence is overwhelming. That evolution has occurred and is occurring is as much a fact as the earth's orbitting the sun or the atomic theory of matter. The mechanisms by which it occurs are still open to investigation, as your out-of-context quotes illustrate.\n \nIn fact, the only feasible way that a tree-swinging monkey could change into a man would be through some freak accident (aka -- random mutations.)\n\n On a technicality, monkeys don't swing from trees: it is the apes that brachiate. On a more important technicality, no evolutionary biologist (or intelligent lay-person) would ever claim that humans evolved directly from monkeys. There is a huge abundance of non-human hominid fossils,including some late Homo erectus types from which H. sapiens probably did evolve; though not merely by 'random mutations'.\n \nEvolution is a fact?

   "Evolutionists, in an attempt to win converts, have a habit of saying evolution is a fact.\nWhat a silly idea. Nearly every legitimate scientist, not to mention virtually all biological scientist are already evolutionists. Why would any moderately intelligent person claim that anyone is attempting to win converts?\n \nHere is a quote from Ernst Mayr from \"What Evolution Is.\":\n \n \"Evolution is not merely an idea, a theory or a con[c]ept, but is the name of a process in nature, the occurrence of which can be documented by mountains of evidence that nobody has been able to refute....It is now actually misleading to refer to evolution as a theory, considering the massive evidence that has been discovered over the last 140 years documenting its existence. Evolution is no longer a theory it is simply a fact.\"\nAn honest person gives the complete source of a quote. In not doing so, you give the impression of dishonesty. It seems that you are trying to hide something by not allowing anyone the opportunity to return the quote to context.\n \n Nevertheless, it is clear from your following comments that you failed to understand your own quote, perhaps willfully. Mayr is not saying that evolution is not an idea, theory or concept. He is saying that evolution is all of those and more. It is an observed process in nature.\n \nAnd of course, when Mayr says \"evolution\" is a fact, he's obviously referring to the evolution that is presented in his book(s) ....which is Neo-darwinism....Neo-darwinism, of course, supposedly confirms the fossils found in the geologic column.\nThere really isn't much purpose in referring to the theory of evolution as neo-Darwinism since that term was meant to distinguish the modern synthesis from other extant, now defunct, theories. Evolutionary biologists don't use the term much, except in an historical sense. For some reason, those who don't understand the theory still cling to the term.\n \nBut see, anyone who knows just a little bit about it can quickly see that neo-darwinism is nothing but a theory.\nClearly you missed the entire point of you quote. Evolution is an idea, a theory, a concept and a process. The process has been observed and is explained by the theories.\n \nIt's a fairytale based on pure philosophy....and this philosophy is based on a foundation of assumptions. And the problem is, if one of these assumption is proven incorrect, then the whole theory collapses. And if the whole theory collapses, then science has to start over and re-evaluate everything.\nMake up your mind. Is it philosophy or science? It is quite telling that you can't avoid referring to evolutionary theory as science. Makes one wonder what your motivations are. Are you trying to win converts?\n \nAs I see it there are 3 main assumptions. The first is that evolution procedes by random mutations.\nPatently false. That has been explained to you on several occasions and yet you continue to make this claim that you know to be false. There are several other mechanisms of evolution that have been observed and tested.\n \nThe second is that selection is non-random on the level of the organism.\nAlso explained to you before. Why do you continue to spout assertions that you know to be inerror. What kind of selection are you talking about? Generally, natural selection is non-random at the level of the population. It is a statistical tendency of some genetic characteristics to have differential reproductive success over others.\n \nThe third is that evolution is gradual.\nDefine \"gradual.\" Natura non facit saltum. In fact, non-gradualism is one of the straw men that we frequently hear from creationists who wonder if organism 'X' suddenly arose by saltation, what did it mate with? But gradualism is one of Darwin's theories formulated to explain his observations, not an assumption.\n \nIf you take any of these away then the whole philosophy collapses. But see, this wouldn't be the case if the theory was actually a fact -- as Mayr claims.\nAnd you don't understand that it isn't the case since those aren't assumptions in the first place, and \n \nSo let's start out by looking at the bottom paragraph of the following link:\n [snip of poorly understood and badly chosen quote]\n\n \nSee, those two simple words cause the whole theory -- er..\"fact\" -- of evolution to crash.\nThat's nonsense. It only serves to demonstrate your poor grasp of evolutionary theory.\n \nAnd not only that, but it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that the version which atheists around the world have fallen in love with is nothing but an unfounded philosophy...and that's because the simple falsification of random mutations can dismantle the whole theory.\nWhat does evolutionary theory have to do with atheism? That certainly makes your religious crusade agains science clear.\n \nCheck out these quotes from Gould:\nWhy. How do we know that these are quotes from Gould? Where did they come from? \"Gould 2002\" is meaningful to you? Why are you afraid to tell us from where you are mining these quotes?\n \n[snip of clearly misunderstood quotes in which Dawkins and Gould agree]\nI'm not sure of your point. The point I thought you were making isn't supported by your (alleged) quotes. Why did you select (or invent) them?\n \nOk.....so from Mayr we were told that evolution is a \"fact\"....Yet Gould says that directed variation stalls selection.\n \n And indeed, like Dawkins says, without natural selection there is no darwinism...there is no evolution...at least not the kind you chance-worshiping evolutionists want.\nFirst, why did you misquote your own quote? Above Dawkins says \"evolution\" and now you pretend that he said \"Darwinism.\" Why try to mislead. You're not being honest. Secondly, why do you feel that what Mayr said, what Gould said, and what Dawkins said are mutually exclusive statements. Dawkins and Gould disagreed about a lot of things, but they both recognized the importance of natural selection, as did Mayr.\n \nInstead, we must assume that biological change arises from within the individual via cues from the enviornment\nAn unfounded assumption. Above you make noise about your invented claims of what evolutionary theory assumes, and now you do even worse. There is no basis in observation to support your assumption. In fact, you are assuming your conclusion.\n \nBut see, evolutionists aren't stupid....even they know that no matter what environment a human is in, he will remain a human.\nCan you support that assumption? Observational evidence indicates that humans have changed considerably over time.\n \nIn fact, the only feasible way that a tree-swinging monkey could change into a man would be through some freak accident (aka -- random mutations.)\nWhy the straw man? Who makes such a claim?\n \nIf evolution was indeed a fact, it would not crumble so easily by a simple falsification.\nActually, since Darwin first proposed his theories, the have not been falsified. Your assumptions and unsupported claims certainly don't do so.\n \nBut heck, if variation is non-random, then it nullifies gradualism -- which nullifies the whole time-frame allocated for change in the geologic column. Then what?\nPlease show that variation is non-random. Why do you continue to make this claim without once offering empirical evidence to support it? It seems that your conclusions are based on philosophy - worse, on religion. From there you argue against what you don't like about science.\n \nEvolution is a fact? Right.\nNow you're getting the idea.",

After all, there are precedents...\n \nIn a sense, the specter of directed variability threatens Darwinism even more seriously than any putative failure of the other two postulates. Insufficient variation stalls natural selection; saltation deprives selection of a creative role but still calls upon Darwin's mechanism as a negative force. \n\n \"Threatens\" does not = destroys; and insufficient variation would stall natural selection.

Could you provide a link?\n \n Also, what is \"143-142\" supposed to mean? Do we read the pages backwards? I suppose that would explain why you are so confused...:)\n \nOk.....so from Mayr we were told that evolution is a \"fact\"....Yet Gould says that directed variation stalls selection.\n\n Evolution is a fact in the sense that it has been observed in many contexts. The Theory of Evolution is about as well supported, but because of the number of things it explains (successfully, I might add), it cannot be classified as a \"law\" or \"fact.\" This does not mean that people in general doubt its validity.\n \n As for Gould, he has said nothing that contradicts the ToE. Directed variation has not been observed (as far as anyone knows, it doesn't exist), so selection cannot be said to be \"stalled.\"\n \nAnd indeed, like Dawkins says, without natural selection there is no darwinism...there is no evolution...\n\n And with natural selection?\n Are you trying to get us to accept your conclusions without providing evidence for your premises? It doesn't work.\n \nat least not the kind you chance-worshiping evolutionists want. \n\n So I pray to chance every night before I go to bed?\n \nInstead, we must assume that biological change arises from within the individual via cues from the enviornment. \n\n Not really: mutations arise randomly. They do not wait for cues.\n \n Also, before you attempt to quote mine me, do not think that I meant that I \"worship\" chance. I accept chance. It is part of life (and the universe, and everything). It is not a deity and it will not \"care\" if I worship it.\n \nSee, it's either one or the other. Either animals change via random mutations + selection (selectionism) or they change internally via directed/biased variation cued by the enviornment (structuralism). \n\n So you attempt to refute natural selection with directed variation and then attempt to use that to convince us of directed variation? Again, it doesn't work.\n \nIt's one or the other. If animals change via structuralism then it must somehow be shown how a monkey could change into a human by a mere change of environment.\n\n Actually, monkeys do not change into humans. The ancestor of all primates had the potential to become many different things. If a primate were to change (somehow), it probably would not become human.\n By the way, such a change will not be shown within your lifetime. Aren't you aware of the thousands of years involved?\n \nBut see, evolutionists aren't stupid....even they know that no matter what environment a human is in, he will remain a human.\n\n At least while he is alive. Living things don't change that fast. Punctuated equilibrium would speed things up if enough people survived, but the change would be something like 10-20 (or many more) generations.\n \nIn fact, the only feasible way that a tree-swinging monkey could change into a man would be through some freak accident (aka -- random mutations.) \n\n Well, if you breed them, you could get taller monkeys with less hair (and other humanlike characteristics). Even so, it would take a long time.\n \nAnd that is why evolutionists for the past century have been hiding from, denying, laughing, and scoffing at the notion that variation is non-random....because it destroys their whole theory -- a theory, of which is based on a platform of philosophy -- the philosophy of the unseen, unproven beneficial random mutation.\n\n Hmmm...\n 1) You have not talked about \"philosophy\" and now you present it as fact?\n 2) Random mutations have a mechanism that has been observed (cells dividing). Directed mutations would be much less likely to occur (who is directing and why?)\n 3) Directed mutations have not been observed, and they are much further from being proven.\n 4) If you want to bring up god, first consider GazzaElliott's signature.\n \nAnd so there it is. Evolutionists fight and claw their way into people's hearts by convincing them that evolution is a \"FACT\" --- but it's no more a fact than Republicans or Democrats claiming their political views are facts. If evolution was indeed a fact, it would not crumble so easily by a simple falsification.\n\n So we don't know if it is a fact (from what you stated). Here's why:\n A: evolution is a fact\n B: evolution crumbles easily\n If B, then A is false.\n B is false.\n Therefore, A may be true or false.\n \nAnd with just one falsification, it raises eyebrows about everything. \n\n So no eyebrows are raised?\n \nLook at the fossil record. They say each level of earth represents millions of years....and these millions of years were necessary because it took animals that long to change via RM + NS -- and indeed it might. But heck, if variation is non-random, then it nullifies gradualism -- which nullifies the whole time-frame allocated for change in the geologic column. Then what?\n\n Well, there's also carbon dating... Didn't you post something about a decay curve? Are you now going to deny the accuracy of that?\n \nEvolution is a fact? Right.\n\n <do not insert sarcasm here<",

   "Wow! Dawkins got something wrong?\nI don't think so. Think about what he said. He didn't say that natural selection was all there was to evolution. He didn't say that there were no other mechanisms. He didn't claim that natural selection didn't exist before Darwin discovered it. He said that without natural selection there is no evolution. Maybe he was overstating it a bit, but his point is hard to determine in an out of context, unsourced quote. In fact, how do we know that Dawkins even said that?",

If natural selection were somehow shown to be the wrong mechanism, evolution would not be falsified.\n 2) Dawkins probably didn't mean that. He may have said it, but we can't be sure of that.",
