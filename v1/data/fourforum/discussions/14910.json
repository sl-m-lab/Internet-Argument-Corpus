He's a cold-hearted killer who doesn't care about the children! After all, he's completely against making everything out of styrofoam. Doesn't he realize that lives can be saved by laws requiring dangerous heavy objects be made from styrofoam? (After all, he's the one promoting the idea that people aren't responsible for their actions, it's the inanimate objects they use.) \n \n This proves he's nothing but a heavy object nut shilling for the huge, corporate heavy object lobby!",
