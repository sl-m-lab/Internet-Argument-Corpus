   "I'm new here. Just found this website. But the topic of abortion interests me so much that I'd like to join in if I may. My story is a long one, so please be patient. There isn't a quick way to tell it.\n \n I am 50 years old. I grew up in Buffalo, NY. That would be the first state to make abortion legal. It was legal during my teenage years. By the way, no parental consent was required. NY was the place that Row (of Row v. Wade) wanted to visit. I am absolutely pro-choice - but not for the reason you'd think. I suppose that it was the change in the law regarding abortion that caused the following family story to be told to me.\n \n I was born to my parents late in life. Today, my parents would be in their 90's. My father never stopped talking about his mother. He had told me she died in surgery. Nothing else. During my teenage years, my mother shared the details of her death. She did die in surgery. It would have taken place somewhere around 1935, as best as I can figure. The surgery was an attempt to undo the damage she had done to herself through repeated self abortions. My father was actually called in to the operating room with her where they attempted a transfusion to save her. He laid on a table beside her and they directly connected a surgical tube from him to her. I've often wondered if, at that time, they had a thorough understanding of blood types. Well, my grandmother didn't make it. And my father's heart never healed.\n \n As I sat there with my mouth open, my mother also went on to tell me that back in the day, the practice of self abortion was very common. Ladies, married ladies, had groups, so to speak. Maybe sisters, cousins, etc. that would assist each other and, as my mother put it, \"clean everything up before the husband came home.\" Bear in mind, that those years were pre-birth control. While moral standards for unmarried girls was very strict, married women were at the mercy of nature. I can only guess that the men didn't fully understand the consequences. The way my mother told it, I got the impression that the women kept it pretty much under wraps.\n \n I would also like to say that, to me, it seems logical. More families were moving to a city environment. Smaller houses. Less land. A dozen kids, as they could have on a farm, wasn't practical. Children were no longer a helping hand in the barn. They were a financial drain. My father came from a family of 2 kids. What today, is still considered by many to be an ideal family size. But in the early 1900's that wasn't achieved with the help of the birth control pill. Any 2 child families back in your family trees?\n \n So, why am I pro-choice? Because way back then, my parents, both of my parents, were pro-choice. I grew up thinking that the change in the law was a huge step forward for society.\n \n Well, that's my story. I've told everything I know, as my mother never spoke of it again. She was a woman of few words. But she made her words count.\n \n I am going on vacation shortly, so I'll be gone for a couple of weeks. But this ought to spice up your conversation in my absence. I'll check in when I get home.",

   "In my opinion abortion is nothing but murder. The only one who has a choice in who should live and who should die is God.\n\n \n If you wish to live without medical intervention, that is your business. If you are willing to be hit by a bus and say \"Hey, God is the one who is deciding that I will die. I don't want to be helped\" that is completely up to you. \n \n However, what right do you have to decide this for others? Are you God? Have you been personally vested by God to tell women that they must have 10 children to see 2 make it to adulthood? \n \n Are you God that you can say \"The fetus that is living off of the woman's organs is more important than the woman\"? Is the woman's life so insignificant that you would rather see more women die to unsafe abortions, either self-performed or performed without modern advances?\n \n Tell me, is it still murder if the abortion is to save the mother's life? If it's justified murder, why are you allowed to justify murder?\n \n \n\n Conclusion: If you screw around, you get the consequences: a child that you have to take care of.\n\n \n That's all a child is to you, then. A consequence that you can inflict on slutty women that screw around. \"You did wrong so I'm going to punish you with this child\". It doesn't matter if it's wanted, if it can be cared for, only that you can punish those evil women for having sex.\n \n Tell me, do you advocate \"dealing with the consequences\" with other things? If you, heaven forbid, got an STD, would you deny yourself treatment? It is, after all, a consequence of having sex. Do you feel yourself filled with rightousness when you tell others that they cannot seek treatment?\n \n Lets take the bus scenario. Getting hit by a bus is a \"known possible consequence\" of crossing the street. If you leave the sidewalk, you're just asking for trouble. And, according to you, medical treatment is not allowed when you've accepted the possibility by perfoming actions (namely actually crossing the street). Those who don't want to live in broken bodies unaided by medicine should just stay on their blocks, right? No crossing streets.",

As to your points above, It would be innacurate to say that women would be forced to gestate for others morals. Here again, the unborn child is essentially being ignored or treated as a pawn or a nuisance instead the subject of concern. What is being asked is that women make a temporary sacrifice (pregnancy is after all not a premanent condition but a 9 month period of inconvenience and difficulty) for the sake, not of other people's morals as you put it but for the life of the unborn.

Pregnancy is a possible result of sex and that is not at all unknown to the participants. Pregnancy prevention, however that is achieved, should be the main focus for people who want to have sex knowing that pregnancy is a possibility. \n \n \nAs to being punished, there has to be a percieved fault or offense for the fetus to be punished.

Those being:\n 1. the most common abortion was in the home - not that famous back alley with a dirty knife.\n 2. it neither began nor increased in popularity with Row v. Wade. I would venture to say the number has probably dropped dramatically with each passing decade. Who wants an abortion. Today, birth control is easier but it didn't exist. Thank goodness it does now. Nothing, however is 100%.\n 3. it was most common among married women. Remember that my story takes place around the time of the Great Depression. Another mouth to feed was a big deal.\n 4. married women were (and still are) expected to submit to their husbands -- at least if they want to keep their husbands. That's where the original comes in - Who's Choice Is It? I'm betting it wasn't hers to keeping getting in that mess.\n \n My story takes place in a time and a place that was very different from the one we live in today.

It is much much more than an \"inconvenience\". Your words belittle and ignore the huge difference and impact pregnancy (not to mention childbirth) has on a woman mentally, emotionally, physically and financially. And, yes, it is forcing a woman to gestate for another's morals when you use the law to force a woman to carry the fetus to term. You say that she should do it for the unborn, but she cannot make the choice when you force that choice. Then it is not a choice to do it for the \"unborn\", she is doing it because she can do nothing else. \n \n I realize that you do not want to make it illegal, just do not wish it performed while still allowing it to be legal. We are both pro-choice. If a woman is not forced by law, then it is up to her to decide if she is able to carry the fetus to term. If she feels she can do it \"for the unborn\" then good for her :) If she does not feel she can handle it, then no one has the right to force her. Pregnancy and childbirth is life-changing, not a \"temporary sacrifice\".\n \n As for giving \"up parental responsibility then she can move on with her life\", that is a parenting decision, not a pregnancy decision. Abortion is a pregnancy decision.\n \n \n \n\n This point is obviously valid. In this case it is not right to ask the woman to trade her life for the unborn although she may freely decide to do so anyway.\n\n \n Of course. \n \n \n \n\n It seems to me a moot point to say that a woman is not consenting to pregnancy when she consents to sex. Pregnancy is a possible result of sex and that is not at all unknown to the participants. Pregnancy prevention, however that is achieved, should be the main focus for people who want to have sex knowing that pregnancy is a possibility. \n\n \n Agreed. Pregnancy should be prevented if it is undesired.\n \n \n \n\n Then I would simply say that it is not unlike an unjustified execution when abortion becomes the CHOICE as you put it.\n\n \n Again you say unjustified. I don't believe you can make a case that it is unjustified.",

   "I'm still here for one more day. So, I checked back early. I did liven the place up a bit.\n \n I'm amazed that noboby seems to have commented on the important points of my story. Those being:\n 1. the most common abortion was in the home - not that famous back alley with a dirty knife.\n 2. it neither began nor increased in popularity with Row v. Wade. I would venture to say the number has probably dropped dramatically with each passing decade. Who wants an abortion. Today, birth control is easier but it didn't exist. Thank goodness it does now. Nothing, however is 100%.\n 3. it was most common among married women. Remember that my story takes place around the time of the Great Depression. Another mouth to feed was a big deal.\n 4. married women were (and still are) expected to submit to their husbands -- at least if they want to keep their husbands. That's where the original comes in - Who's Choice Is It? I'm betting it wasn't hers to keeping getting in that mess.\n \n My story takes place in a time and a place that was very different from the one we live in today. We're here in 2004 in a medically advanced, affluent society with birth control and Head Start and tax deductions for day care.\n \n I'm just trying to put a time line on this thing and bring a new perspective.\n\n \n I really wish we could have accurate statistics on self-performed abortions before abortions were legal. The deaths and maimings that can be a result would probably go a long way to silence the \"moral outcry\" that many pro-life people bring.",

We are lucky enough to live in a time where that's a possibility.\n \n The point I'm trying to make is that the human race HAS made huge strides toward that goal. Given a little time and patience abortion will, with the help of medical science be a thing of the past. But Rome wasn't built in a day.\n \n I'm logically running the numbers here:\n 30 years (the reproductive years of a \"moral, married woman)\n x 365 (days in a year)\n ------\n 10950\n / 28 (the number of days in a menstrual cycle)\n ------\n 391 (cycles for a woman to become pregnant between the ages of 20 & 50)\n \n If you divide 391 by 9 months - EACH woman could conceivably (no pun intended) bear 43.4 children.\n \n Of course the numbers go up from there if we're more generous with the ages. Consider that if a couple, who is trying to get pregnant, hasn't been able to do so within 12 cycles, the doctor starts testing to find the problem.\n \n I think that I've proved exactly how fertile the human animal is - and I've proved just how responsible we're being. In the scheme of things, abortion has already become relatively extinct. I for one, am proud of us. We are not a society of unfeeling, uncaring, heavy-breathing good-for-nothings.\n \n We're just doing our best. And trying to improve.

   "In my opinion abortion is nothing but murder. The only one who has a choice in who should live and who should die is God.\n \n Conclusion: If you screw around, you get the consequences: a child that you have to take care of.\n\n \n Realistically, life long virginity just isn't an option.\n \n I am most amazed by what appears to be an inconsistency in the topics of pro-life and sex education. We can all agree that avoidance is the answer. Yet, we shy away from teaching the hormone raging youth just how to do that.\n \n I am the mother of 2 grown sons, ages 26 and 23. I never needed sex education in the schools. I actually did teach it at home. Yep. I, as a woman, I talked to my teenage sons about sex. I'm mouthier than their dad. Over the years, we talked about everything from STD's, to pregnancy avoidance, to the ways girls can use sex to manipulate boys. I certainly never implied or said \"go get 'em\". I emphasized the pitfalls and the emotional consequences. I must have given them a hundred good reasons why abstinence was the way to go. It's just a parent's responsibility to pass on what they can from years of life to their children.\n \n Now the funny part. I'll start by sharing that my husband had a vasectomy years ago. Yet we always kept condoms in our night stand. Realistically, boys have been known to lift them. I wanted my sons to be able to practice what I had preached. It was just a couple years ago, when my oldest got engaged, that the topic of birth-control came up again. That was when my husband told them he had had a vasectomy.\n \n Immediately, one of them said, \"You did not. Then why are the condoms in your night stand?\"\n \n The answer ---- \"For you\"\n \n The look on their faces was priceless. That was a missed Kodak moment. My husband and I nearly laughed til we cried.\n \n NOW we're talking about avoidance. We can do the God topic later.",

   "I believe that a woman has a right to choose. She can choose whether or not she has sex. Once a woman becomes pregnant (when the little sperm goes into the egg) another life starts growing inside her womb. this life is not hers, and nine months later, it will be completely sepparate from her. People ask questions of when life begins, well, as soon as the egg cell starts splitting and duplicating and growing, that when. Is a race only a race after you cross the finish line? No, the race begins as soon as the gun goes off. The only exception for abortion is if the woman is raped. This takes away her right to choose, therefore since it was not her actions that ended up getting her pregnant, it should be her choice to abort it. People argue that if a person is not ready to take care of their child that it should be aborted, well what about adoption. There are thousands of people who are on waiting lists to adopt children because they cannot have children themselves. The child will be cared for. So, I say that abortion is completely wrong if the pregnant woman willingly had sex in the first place.",
