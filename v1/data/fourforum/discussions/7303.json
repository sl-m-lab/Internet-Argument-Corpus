The main reason is that a good judge will not decide cases based on his or her faith, but based upon the law. You seem to think that it is impossible for a Catholic judge to rule on an issue that is not supported by the Catholic church. But you are wrong. At least two of those Catholic judges have clearly upheld the death penalty as being constitutional, even though the Catholic church opposes the death penalty.\n \n The Supreme court is not a representative body, and thus it isn't necessary to have what many call \"diversity\" on the court.",

It would be like having a Supreme Court with 5 gay men from Florida, or 5 lesbian belly dancers, or 5 walmart employees from the electronics department, or 5 olympic medal ice skaters, or 5 pie eating contest winners. 5 of anything, narrowed down to such significance, is not a good idea when it comes to making fair and impartial decisions.",

   "Having 5 judges that are Roman Catholic will not create any kind of Vatican controled court system in the United States. The Vatican as far as I know would not use excommunication to push those five judges to make laws they want. Even if the Vatican did do that don't you think people in government might think something is just a little bit fishy?\n \n You should know that the Vatican has its own system of politics going on. There are priests in the Church who believe use of condoms is ok even though that is entirely against Church dogma.\n \n Thinking just because someone is Roman Catholic they will follow their religion blindly into the sun is just not true. Everyone has their own views despite their religion. John Kerry is Roman Catholic and believes in abortion and gay marriage. That is entirely against Church dogma. Just because people have the same religion is not any clear indication that they are going to believe the same things about laws and government.",
