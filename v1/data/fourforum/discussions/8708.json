   "52 citizens of Georgia were arrested in Austria for robberies and thefts. But more interesting those Georgian citizens came to Europe under the mask of Chechens refugees! And after their arrest and request to give them political asylum it became clear that in fact it were Georgians. I wonder why Georgians came to Europe under the mask of Chechens refugees and by this way damaged Chechens' reputation. I think that nobody will try to investigate it.\n I'm sure that Mass Media will try to defame and talk that all Chechens refugees are occupying themselves with robberies and thefts that they are in control of all European crime business. And sooner or later EU will begin to push us (Chechens) out from Europe because of somebody committed a crime and said that he is a Chechen. Its shame that as a result of movement of some nation representatives my nation will show as crime and terrorists. I'm afraid that in future Chechens will be on the one level with terrorist and criminals. And Georgians are helping in it! They deserve their reputation of betrayers. In the Caucasian mountains many peoples have been well aware of the fact. \n Worse, I'spose it may be kind of secret agreement between European governments and Georgian president Saakashvili to make this kind of thing.",
