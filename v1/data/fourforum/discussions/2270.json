Later he moved the explosives to locations in at least two nearby towns. \n \n \n ANd they apparently made their own chemical weapons as well\n \n \nCiting unidentified technical experts, the commentator said the suspects had made enough explosives to cause \"two explosions &#8212; conventional and chemical &#8212; which were to have directly affected an area within a one-mile radius.\" \n \n \n In other words, the chemical weapons did not come from Syria, and ceratianly did not come from Iraq.

   "That may be. Though it appears the vehicles actually came from jordan\n \n \"Syria has denied the claims. In the videotape, however, the militants said they acquired the vehicles in Jordan. \"\n \n \n Regardless, the chemicals they were using were most likely nothing special. You can make VX from supplies you geta t a grocery store, an auto parts store, and a hardware store. Mc Veigh blew up the OK city federal building with fertilizer. Odds are, none of the chemicals they were using were anything restricted (I am not sure that, besides radiological agents, any raw chemicals are really restricted, though some are a litttle hard to find). \n \n I was just pointing out that trying to link these guys to Saddams imaginary WMDs requires a pretty severe leap of blind faith.",
