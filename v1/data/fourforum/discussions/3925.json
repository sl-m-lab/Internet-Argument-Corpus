   "Originally posted by Orion: The concept of reincarnation makes more sense to me than the Christian notion wherein you go around once after which you face either eternal bliss or eternal damnation. It seems to me that such a notion violates two of the attributes which we generally ascribe to God, namely, mercy and justice.\n \n I won't get into a discussion about reincarnation except to say that there is not even the slightest shred of evidence to say that this is true. The only way that it could be true is if we could prove that the holy books of those religions (or just one religion) who believe in reincarnation (e.g. Hinduism) is actually divinely inspired. This can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt by examining accurate lines of scientific, historic, and prophetic verses in that holy book. The Bible contains all of these and other characteristics (such as it's civilising and life changing words). As such, if the Bible is true, then we can conclude that the whole concept (or belief) of reincarnation is false. To date, I am unaware of any such accurate verses in any holy book that tells people to believe in reincarnation.\n \n Does eternal suffering in hell for people who reject Jesus Christ as their LORD and Saviour contradict God's mercy and justice? Actually it does not! To understand the answer we need to go back to the beginning when Adam and Eve first rebelled against God. Through their actions, they were saying to God that they wanted nothing to do Him and that man wanted to decide truth independently of God. God, as the rightful and just judge, had to judge sin with death (which He warned Adam and Eve that He would).\n \n I was doing a google define search on the word \"mercy\" when I came across this:\n Mercy is the act of not administering justice when that justice is punitive. Because of our sinfulness we deserve death and eternal separation from God (Rom. 6:23; Isa. 59:2), but God provided an atonement for sin and through it shows us mercy. That is, He does not deliver to the Christian the natural consequence of his sin which is damnation [NL: the punishment for sin = death (from Genesis)]. That is why Jesus became sin on our behalf (2 Cor. 5:21) and bore the punishment due to us (Is. 53:4-5). It was to deliver us from damnation. (Compare with justice and grace.) God saved us according to His mercy (Titus 3:5) and we can practice mercy as a gift (Rom. 12:8). \"Let us therefore draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace to help in time of need\" (Heb. 4:16).\n \n Of course, if we don't want to acknowledge that Jesus Christ is our Saviour (by doing so we are holding on to our sins), then we are saying through our actions and thoughts that we want nothing to do with God. God will grant us our wish and remove us from His presence. This is why Jesus will say to all the evil doers when He returns, \"Depart from Me\". God's justice will shine through here when we chose to hold on to our sins, we will get what we deserve and what they asked for, i.e. eternal suffering. However, if people repent from their sins, then God's mercy will fall down on them like rain (Jesus bore their punishment on the cross) and they will reside forever in Glory with Him. \n \n Nu Leader.",

   "I won't get into a discussion about reincarnation except to say that there is not even the slightest shred of evidence to say that this is true.The only way that it could be true is if we could prove that the holy books of those religions (or just one religion) who believe in reincarnation (e.g. Hinduism) is actually divinely inspired.\n\n \n Religous philosophy does not involve an attempt to establish evidence, truth, or proof. BTW, the concept of reincarnation is not limited to the Hindus. We find mention of this belief within Buddhism as well within ancient Greek and Persian societies. \n \n \nAs such, if the Bible is true, then we can conclude that the whole concept (or belief) of reincarnation is false.\n\n \n You can neither 'prove' that the Judeo-Christian Bible is 'true' nor can you 'prove' that the concept of reincarnation is 'false'. Sorry. \n \n \nDoes eternal suffering in hell for people who reject Jesus Christ as their LORD and Saviour contradict God's mercy and justice? Actually it does not!\n\n \n Actually, it does, from a logical perspective. If someone cannot, in good conscience, accept Jesus, does that someone then deserve, in your opinion, an eternity in the 'lake-o-fire'? Would that include Jews who went to their deaths in the concentration camps professing their belief in the God of Judaism? Be careful where you tread, my little friend. \n \n \nOf course, if we don't want to acknowledge that Jesus Christ is our Saviour (by doing so we are holding on to our sins), then we are saying through our actions and thoughts that we want nothing to do with God.\n\n \n Can you at least consider the possibility that billions of people do not equate Jesus with God but who nevertheless worship God, and that their position is as least as valid as your exclusivist theology? Can you further accept the possibility that God's grace extends even to those people who happen not to believe in his existence? To this last point, I refer you to the biblical parable of the Good Samaritan. Please consider the implications of that parable. I'd be happy to discuss those implications with you.",
