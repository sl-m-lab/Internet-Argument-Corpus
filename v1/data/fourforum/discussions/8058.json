   "EU is gaining strength in its business war with USA, which is encouraging sign imo. Europeans have introduces new trade sanctions relating some American companies and actually killing the so called Byrd Amendment at last. American fat cats illegally amassing wealath here and other countries have been shown where they really should belong. Bravo! EU is really mighty. \n Now I hope EU will make it healthier in international business sphere as a whole, say WTO. I hate American drive to make WTO into political tool mainly. I still wonder why Americans granted market economy status to poor and lagging behind Ukraine e.g. And they've been vigorously pushing Ukraine to WTO 'cause it's loyal to Bush. That's not rightful and that's yet another area for EU to cast its eye on.",
