   "Hi guys,\n \n I was watching a recent documentary about the life and times of the recently deceased play write Arthur Miller. In that documentary it went over the period of the Red scare and Miller's appearance in front of McCarthy's committee of Un-American activities. \n \n Over here in the UK, McCarthy and McCarthyism is seen in a very negative light, it is basically a by word for political repression based on a person's political belief. Is it seen the same way in the US ? or was seen as a necessary step in order to protect the US from Subversive elements ?\n \n I would also contend that McCarthyism and the Cold War in general basically destroyed the far left groups in the US, for example the in US before McCarthyism had a tradition of prominent Socialist thought. Such as Paul Robson, and Woddie Guthrie(Our land is Your land), even FDR to a lesser to extent. But after McCarthyism this tradition disappeared almost without a trace. Some of you guys might not mourn the passing of the Socialist Tradition but it was and still an interesting alternative to capitalism(IMHO).\n \n The basic jist of this thread is to get your opinions on McCarthy, McCarthyism and the red scare at the time.",

Communism was a very real threat at that time and we would have been suicidal not to have recognized that fact. However, McCarthy was an opportunist and a drunk. The methods to keep Communism at bay were not handled properly but it does not mean that Communism was not a threat. During several periods of our history; most notably our Civil War, WWI and WWII, there have been excesses. The Cold War was also such a time. But make no mistake about it. Communism was a very serious threat. God only knows what might have happened had Stalin not died when he did. The Soviet Union was a malignant cancer with a madman at the helm. After he died, things became better and eventually Communism collapsed although there are still pockets popping up here and there by those who think if they try it just one more time they will get it right.
