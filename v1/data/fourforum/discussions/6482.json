   "Reform does not equal total legalisation and yes, that includes Sorros!\n \n Milton Freidman, George Shultz, Paul Volker to name a few rightwing icons;\n \n Milton; how can you outlaw a 'pot plant'? Even if they could put a dent in the trade, then what? Prices would only rise and we would have a million people growing a couple plants in cupboards in cash in. Anyone wanting cannabis can get it and that has been the the case since 1965. 45 years is a long time, so why should we believe that police efforts will all of a sudden make a difference? Every 5 years or so, I read about the 'latest strain' that is to be unleashed - and people go for it. \n \n Shultz; billions of dollars flows out of cannabis to criminal syndicates that deal in herion, crack, extortion and firearms. Cut them out of this cashflow by decriminiliosing cannabis and letting people grow a plant or two themselves. The majority of pot smokers will never have to meet someone from a crime syndicate that way and will not be drawn into the addiction. Currently, we pay for the chase which nets the user, and the criminals get the big profits. We have an incareration rate 3-4 times that of other wealthy western countries and this can be directly traced to cannabis infringements. \n \n Volker; We think we are tough on crime because we have mandatory minimum sentencing but we forget to think that all these pot smokers had jobs, fitted into society and paid taxes. But now they get a $50,000 a year state subsidy to stay in one of our fine new jails, take up our police, court and DA costs and time. When they come out, they have Degree's in Hard Crime - no job, a criminal record and a new rather unsavourey bunch of friends. \n and the revolving",
