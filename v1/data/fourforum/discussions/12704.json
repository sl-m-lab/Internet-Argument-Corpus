   "US' military command is dissatisfied with military campaign in Afghanistan. General Mckiernan was forced out as a head of US Forces in Afghanistan because of activation Tallibs and al Qaeda and of course high rank commands belonging to criminal activity in Afghanistan! To tell the truth I'm shocked by the lightness of pentagon head. Look, I heard a lot that our soldiers organized weapons trade in Afghanistan and have control over drugs traffic and just now Gates condescends to try to put this place in order! In addition to it one says that our top command in Afghanistan were implicated in ties with Muslims, it's not for nothing new official Lt. General McChrystal has a great experience of counterespionage! I wonder why this moving took place just now. May be some Washington's officials have certain interest in it!",
