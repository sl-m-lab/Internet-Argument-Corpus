If Judas didn't have any control over his decision to kill Jesus, then no one else has ever had or, will have any control or, free will, to make any decisions - it's all been prearranged or, written in stone, since 'the beginning' and is just being played out like a 3-D, Universal, video game.\n \n I've always wondered why Judas was given the label of traitor or bad guy when, without his betrayal, there would never had been a Crucifixion and no salvation option.

Each year for the past fourteen, I have made a tour of Texas, Kansas, Nevada, and California delivering a series of lectures on the evils of spiritual flatulism, excessive consumption and brain-dead liberalism. \n \n On these tours, I have been accompanied by a young man and assistant, Clyde Linson. Clyde, a young man of unknown family and questionable background, is a most unfortunate example of a life ruined by excessive indulgence in whiskey and other ungodly vices. Clyde would appear with me at the lectures and sit on the platform drunk, wheezing, staring at the audience through heavy, bleary, bloodshot eyes, sweating profusely, picking his nose, passing gas, and making obsene gestures while I pointed him out as an example of what over-indulgence and regressive human secularism can do to a person. \n \n This past summer Clyde died. A mutual poster gave me your name and I was wondering if you would be available to take Clyde's place on my 2010-2011 tour? \n \n Sincerely,\n \n The Reverend Johnny Patterson\n \n emoticon_xbouncer",

   "I think it all boils down to the fact that the authors of the OT had no idea what logic, rationality, etc. WAS. They were just making up sh!t in a primitive attempt try to explain the world as best they could. I don't knock 'em for trying, but the information they had to work with was extremely--and I mean EXTREMELY--limited. \n \n A for effort and for making lemonade out of lemons, guys, but hey, we've learned a few things since, or is this not true? Had those original authors lived a few thou years later, even they would no doubt have been compelled to reassess their theories. If Socrates and Aristotle (and logical thinking) had been around at the time, we probably wouldn't be asking questions about omniscience and omnipotence today--except as \"how many angels can dance on the head of a pin\"-type mental masturbation.\n \n As for those who devote time and energy to de-contradicting the pre-scientific theories of the authors of Genesis... people, get a life!\n\n \n Aristotle thought that the Earth was the centre of the universe.\n He is much overrated except for his golden mean.",

Free will is denied by those who espouse any of various forms of determinism. Arguments for free will are based on the subjective experience of freedom, on sentiments of guilt, on revealed religion, and on the universal supposition of responsibility for personal actions that underlies the concepts of law, reward, punishment, and incentive. In theology, the existence of free will must be reconciled with God's omniscience and goodness (in allowing man to choose badly), and with divine grace, which allegedly is necessary for any meritorious act. A prominent feature of modern Existentialism is the concept of a radical, perpetual, and frequently agonizing freedom of choice.

For many philosophers, to believe in free will is to believe that human beings can be the authors of their own actions and to reject the idea that human actions are determined by external conditions or fate.\n \n Encyclopedia\n \n free will\n \n in humans, the power or capacity to choose among alternatives or to act in certain situations independently of natural, social, or divine restraints. Free will is denied by those who espouse any of various forms of determinism. Arguments for free will are based on the subjective experience of freedom, on sentiments of guilt, on revealed religion, and on the universal supposition of responsibility for personal actions that underlies the concepts of law, reward, punishment, and incentive. In theology, the existence of free will must be reconciled with God's omniscience and goodness (in allowing man to choose badly), and with divine grace, which allegedly is necessary for any meritorious act. A prominent feature of modern Existentialism is the concept of a radical, perpetual, and frequently agonizing freedom of choice.

However, if we no longer entertain the luxury of a belief in the &#8220;magic of the soul,&#8221; then there is little else to offer in support of the concept of free will. Whereas much is written claiming to provide an explanation for free will, such writings are invariably lacking any hint of molecular details concerning mechanisms (8). Also, it is often suggested that individuals are free to choose and modify their environment and that, in this respect, they control their destiny. This argument misses the simple but crucial point that any action, as &#8220;free&#8221; as it may appear, simply reflects the genetics of the organism and the environmental history, right up to some fraction of a microsecond before any action. \n (and the rest: The Lucretian swerve: The biological basis of human behavior and the criminal justice system ? PNAS )\n \n On a previous page I asked 'what is missing from this picture - what is 'it'?)\n I did some digging last night and feel kind of stupid this morning because I'm sure most of you already were aware of and understood things like 'causality', determinism', etc....\n It seems to me, this is what I was trying to describe in my feeble way....but, not exactly.\n Karma also has an explanation for the concept of free will but, I would leave out 'god', reincarnation, 'the soul/spirit' and other non-provable, non-reality.\n This is an interesting article:\n Karma; The Laws of Cause and Effect\n \n I honestly believe that 'free will' is just an illusion.

   "Maybe. I'm not a math expert.\n But, my point is that, considering all the people that now exist and have ever existed and all of the choices they have made and are making, their action of using their free will to make choices has eliminated some of the options that are available for me to choose from. Yes, we can choose from the options available but, they are not necessarily the options that we want to choose - thus, our free will choices are an illusion. We are not choosing what we want, we are choosing options that others have made available to us.\n \n We are not acting with free will, we are reacting to the actions of others.\n\n I think I see what you mean. I probably didn't explain myself, or we are defining it differently. Its not possible to select options that aren't available or you aren't aware are available. If you have a multiple choice of a, b, c and d, it doesn't mean that you can't freely decide without e. Having less options or more options doesn't affect your free will. Not having any options that make you happy doesn't affect free will. Your ability to select any available option still remains. \n \n And yes, many options are influenced by outside factors. And our decisions create and eliminate options for ourselves and others. Calling your mother wasn't an option when telephones weren't invented. Did you have less free will before telephones were invented? Did you have more? \n \n If you look at things from a perspective of options are being eliminated, then you will find less options. Options are also being created. But the choices you can make are limited to the choices you are aware of.",

   "Read this:\n \n Whereas this so-called Cartesian duality, at least superficially, provides a nice mechanism whereby one could entertain the concept of free will, belief in this mechanism among scientific circles has ostensibly disappeared (7). However, if we no longer entertain the luxury of a belief in the \"magic of the soul,\" then there is little else to offer in support of the concept of free will. Whereas much is written claiming to provide an explanation for free will, such writings are invariably lacking any hint of molecular details concerning mechanisms (8). Also, it is often suggested that individuals are free to choose and modify their environment and that, in this respect, they control their destiny. This argument misses the simple but crucial point that any action, as \"free\" as it may appear, simply reflects the genetics of the organism and the environmental history, right up to some fraction of a microsecond before any action. \n (and the rest: The Lucretian swerve: The biological basis of human behavior and the criminal justice system ? PNAS )\n \n\n Isn't this a bit biased toward the idea that free will doesn't exist? How much of our behavior, reasoning and judgement is controlled by our genetics that we can, on a case by case basis, deem an individual not responsible for his own actions? Because the argument of determinism always leads down this road. Yeah, he murdered your mother, but he was destined to, based on his genetic composition and environmental influences. Ha! Really? \n \n And what of case studies of identical twins raised together and having very different \"destinies\"?\n \nOn a previous page I asked 'what is missing from this picture - what is 'it'?)\n I did some digging last night and feel kind of stupid this morning because I'm sure most of you already were aware of and understood things like 'causality', determinism', etc....\n It seems to me, this is what I was trying to describe in my feeble way....but, not exactly.\n Karma also has an explanation for the concept of free will but, I would leave out 'god', reincarnation, 'the soul/spirit' and other non-provable, non-reality.\n This is an interesting article:\n Karma; The Laws of Cause and Effect\n \n I honestly believe that 'free will' is just an illusion. Because of the laws of cause and effect, we cannot make a choice (effect) without being first prompted by a cause. Because this process involves everything in the Universe x infinity, backward and forward, our choices are limited to only those that are 'set up' by their causes = No free will. Because we are our environment and our genetic make up, our choices may seem like choices but, imo, in reality, we cannot 'choose' anything but what we are 'destined' to choose.\n Our 'destiny' being a product of what we are at this moment combined with what the Universe is at this monent.\n \n The only way we could have true free will and the ability to create our own destiny is if we lived in a bubble and were not effected by the rest of the Universe, imo, of course. lol\n\n I don't understand your \"living in a bubble\" paradigm when it comes to choices and limits. You see making choices as a process of infringing on other people's rights by creating the destiny of your desire. You feel as though in order for you to get something you want, someone else must lack what they want. \n \n Its a very common (too common) case of win-lose mindset. \n \n Guess what, win-lose is not the only option. But you have to be aware in order to have other options available to you",

The initial reason you go for the corn flakes is because your brain gets a signal from your tummy that you are hungry.\n \n A person who makes 'bad' or, illogical decisions or, uses their 'free will' for choices that result in non-beneficial results, does so because there is some kind of malfunction in the brain...maybe they are presented with too many choices and their brain isn't able to properly process the information.

Actions are just a result of a biological process and external stimuli. Your body would still do what your mind commands it to (under normal circumstances).\n \n 'Free will' is just an illusion - just as the belief in a god is - and the human can, does and will function just the same (for some) without the illusion of either.

   "It may appear that way to you but, that is your illusion.\n I am not 'cutting and pasting other peoples ideas because you cannot win the argument'. I am trying to explain my beliefs, which existed before I found the supporting evidence. The fact that I sometimes use the words of 'brilliant' minds, who have the same belief, to explain my beliefs, is proof that there is evidence to support my belief...and they are much better at explaining it than I am.\n \n All you have shown is that the 'ability and opportunity to choose' = the ability and opportunity to choose. The feeling of having free will is something altogether different and separate from the process of choosing.\n \n If you choose to eat corn flakes for breakfast, it is because you have them in your kitchen, because you bought them at the store, because you saw them in a commercial on t.v., because you had nothing better to do but watch t.v., because.... all simply reactions to outside causes and internal biology. The initial reason you go for the corn flakes is because your brain gets a signal from your tummy that you are hungry.\n \n A person who makes 'bad' or, illogical decisions or, uses their 'free will' for choices that result in non-beneficial results, does so because there is some kind of malfunction in the brain...maybe they are presented with too many choices and their brain isn't able to properly process the information. That is often seen in children who have undeveloped/inexperienced brains.\n \n Is an Alzheimer's patient using their free will when they choose to drop their drawers in a public place? Did their 'free will' fly out the window when their brain began to rot? Of course not. Those illogical choices are not choices at all but, misfiring or, disconnections of the neurons in the brain.\n \n How do you think you would behave any differently or, make decisions if you didn't have free will? Actions are just a result of a biological process and external stimuli. Your body would still do what your mind commands it to (under normal circumstances).\n \n 'Free will' is just an illusion - just as the belief in a god is - and the human can, does and will function just the same (for some) without the illusion of either. I would say that the majority of those who cling to the illusion of free will also cling to god. Some require these illusions to function in society.\n\n \n I did say that you think that if I had a choice between a red shirt and a green one you would think that didnt have free will because I didnt have a blue one.\n You are looking for a mystical answer to a simple concept.\n Like am athiest looking at astrology for guidance.\n \n An Alzheimer's victim does have free will but not the cognisence to exercise it to the extent that a healthy person can...but they still can choose until the is no cognisense at all.\n You seem to think that there is either infinite free will or no free will that is obviously wrong.\n Choosing is free will in action..you dont need the 'feelin' of free will.\n \n Athiests accuse religion of taking away personal responsibility, looks like you dont need God to that.",

   "I read the article that you posted. Very eloquently written, but not too convincing. The author obviously starts off with the conclusion that free will doesn't exist, the proceeds to justify in a non-linear way why he thinks such is the case. He presents arguments for and against his position, which is a good thing, though he doesn't demonstrate that the counter-arguments clearly win in support of his position. So there are a bunch of loose ends, implying that the issue is far from being settled. Still, in the end, he holds to his foregone conclusion. \n \n His strongest argument is probably that in order to believe that free will exists as an independent source outside of \"programmable\" cause and effect, one must characterize free will as a metaphysical abstract that lives in the ether of consciousness and has a process of its own that transcends the laws of physics. He mockingly refers to this as \"magical soul\" (or something like that). As a rational thinking scientist, magic as an explanation cannot be entertained, so it must be eliminated. Fair enough, if we decide to simplify free will to such a strawman definition.\n \n One classical argument he mentions in support of free will is the question \"if free will doesn't exist, how is it possible to believe that it does?\" I think this question hits the heart of the issue. If we remove free will, a massive part of our vocabulary must also vanish, as there would be no such thing as should, because, could, will, try, effort and any other term that could possibly express alternative action. There would be no such thing as plan, forecast or expectation. It would be abundantly apparent that our reactions are simply pre-programmed defaults, our existence would be robotic automatons, and consciousness would serve no purpose but to make our existence torturous. If occam's razor would eliminate the \"magical soul\" from logical existence, why wouldn't consciousness be also eliminated as a function of evolution? Are we also going to conclude that conscious is an illusion as well? The mere fact that we can question the existence of free will and debate its impact speaks volumes in support of it. \n \n The other point he goes into detail about is the issue of social order and justice. Consequence is the primary motivator of how decisions are made. It is how living things learn, adapt and continue to survive. A baby animal is intimidated by everything that comes at it when its born, but later learns that an approaching leaf results in no ill consequence, but an approaching predator does. If there is a consequence attached to making a decision, it greatly impacts the frequency of that decision. The author argues that this is an aspect of the enviromental factor, not of free will. Of course, he doesn't address the fact that regardless of how many people live in the same environment, where, say, the consequence of commiting murder is life in prison, people still opt to commit murder. However, it is widely agreed, even by those who deny that free will exists, that murder rates are greatly less if there is a consequence involved, than if there is none. \n \n This brings me to the third major argument: behavioral science. For the life of me I cannot understand how this even passes for a science. We begin with the hypothesis that all behavior is governed by a degree of genetic predisposition, environmental pressure, and a chaotic element of quantum randomness. In other words, all actions are the result of our chemical composition going through the motions of pre-programmed data processing, while our na\u00efve consciousness sits back helplessly to the dictates of fate (fate being the output from the genetic, enviromental and chaotic inputs). So you cannot choose you identity, nor can you control habits, tendencies or preferences. This is a mainstream argument for gay behavior, and yet the same ones that support this idea have no comment when asked about incest or pedophilia. It can be used conveniently, and that makes it appealing. So much for scientific integrity. \n \n I don't see determinism standing on its own 2 feet from this article. It stands on the weak premise that since we must necessarily remove free will, determinism is the only explanation left. Determinism doesn't even come close to explaining the fact that consciousness exist, and that, contrary to its own thesis, we aren't mindless robots. It doesn't properly address the question of being questioned. And it doesn't address the reality of the value of law and order in soceity. It simply insists that it must be correct because free will is too metaphysical to be true. \n \n But hey, I'm biased too... (Or am I......)",

But, because I don't think free will exists as commonly explained and defined does not mean that it does not exist as an illusion created in the mind...created for a specific purpose such as for basic survival or to enable us to interact with other humans and the world in general. I'm not saying we don't have the ability to choose, but rather, the idea that the actual moment of our awareness of making a conscious, willful, voluntary decision comes after the brain begins the process of affecting the action. It just makes logical sense to me on a scientific basis. But...I'm still investigating, it's possible I may change my mind before it's all said and done. ;) So far, I've not seen convincing evidence to do so.\n \n \nThe other point he goes into detail about is the issue of social order and justice.

Over the course of a lifetime, the brain accumulates a knowledge of what things are beneficial and which are not. Those that are repeated often enough don't require a (willful) conscious decision to be made and are almost made unconsciously (some are). The more complex the 'decision' is, the more thought is required to come up with the best possible or, desired outcome. Of course as we age, and those neurons deteriorate, we gradually lose that ability. Those who appear to make bad decisions habitually or, on occasion, have something wrong with their hard wiring. I don't see it as much different than the complex working of a biological computer...some work effortlessly and towards perfection and others...don't. 'Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.'...sort of thing.\n \n \nThis brings me to the third major argument: behavioral science. For the life of me I cannot understand how this even passes for a science.

So much for scientific integrity.\n 'genetic predisposition, environmental pressure, and a chaotic element of quantum randomness' or, what the author refers to as 'GES'...which I sort of go along with, so does the concept of Karma. I do think we have the ability to 'learn' new responses though and to change our behavior from what we have been 'programed' to accept...the more 'good' we do and the more 'right' choices we make has a direct impact on our ability to act in these beneficial ways- which are beneficial to our survival as human beings and beneficial to the rest of the Universe.

   " Agreed. But, because I don't think free will exists as commonly explained and defined does not mean that it does not exist as an illusion created in the mind...created for a specific purpose such as for basic survival or to enable us to interact with other humans and the world in general. I'm not saying we don't have the ability to choose, but rather, the idea that the actual moment of our awareness of making a conscious, willful, voluntary decision comes after the brain begins the process of affecting the action. It just makes logical sense to me on a scientific basis. But...I'm still investigating, it's possible I may change my mind before it's all said and done. ;) So far, I've not seen convincing evidence to do so.\n \n\n I looked at the part that reported on this experiment, but didn't think it deserved comment. What if we cannot separare the \"response\" activity from the \"mental\" activity? I mean, if we assume that our voluntary actions are really all involuntary, why would there be distinguishable mental activity at all? Why would the term \"voluntary\" even exist?\n \n \n If a human has good, 'healthy' basic survival instincts, it will do things that ensure good and healthy results - the path of least resistance. Over the course of a lifetime, the brain accumulates a knowledge of what things are beneficial and which are not. Those that are repeated often enough don't require a (willful) conscious decision to be made and are almost made unconsciously (some are). The more complex the 'decision' is, the more thought is required to come up with the best possible or, desired outcome. Of course as we age, and those neurons deteriorate, we gradually lose that ability. Those who appear to make bad decisions habitually or, on occasion, have something wrong with their hard wiring. I don't see it as much different than the complex working of a biological computer...some work effortlessly and towards perfection and others...don't. 'Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.'...sort of thing.\n \n\n There may be another explanation, under the deterministic premise, for bad decisions. They simply have bad data as input. GIGO, like computers. It doesn't necessarily mean that the computer itself is defective. Some people can be fooled repeatedly because they reject the lesson, not because they are retarded, but possibly because they have other programming that conflicts with what the lesson is trying to make them receive. \n \n If we are talking about a deterministic world, then our entire conversation has to be structured in terms of laws of math as it applies to data processing and robotic responses. We cannot speak in terms of desire, voluntary, hunch, attempt, etc. There would only be do or not do. \"Decisions\" would be nothing more than binary output. It wouldn't matter how you felt about the decision you made, you'd do it anyway. \n \n 'genetic predisposition, environmental pressure, and a chaotic element of quantum randomness' or, what the author refers to as 'GES'...which I sort of go along with, so does the concept of Karma. I do think we have the ability to 'learn' new responses though and to change our behavior from what we have been 'programed' to accept...the more 'good' we do and the more 'right' choices we make has a direct impact on our ability to act in these beneficial ways- which are beneficial to our survival as human beings and beneficial to the rest of the Universe. I also think that continued education and acquired, new life experiences and information is essential to perfecting and streamlining the decision making process.\n \n\n How can we discuss karma without invoking the metaphysical realm? Traditionally, karma refers to an inner sense of well-being that comes from \"good decisions\", that projects outward and attracts good events back to you, and vice versa with bad decisions or actions (as in the law of attraction). \n in a deterministic worldview, we cannot manipulate karma. In fact, in concept of karma itself is too \"magical\" for us to even entertain to begin with\n \n I don't see it standing on it's own two feet either but, it makes more sense to me than anything I have see to the contrary. While browsing for 'free will' I came across a Catholic forum discussing free will in animals- simply ridiculous! \n \n I don't think you are. I think you are like me (and ganso) in that we trying to explain what makes the most sense to us...and that 'ain't easy! emoticon_xdonno:p\n \n I'm still reading the GoogleBook (and it's annoying because of the cut out pages!) and a lot of it is going over my head but, if you have the time to browse through it, I'd be grateful for your opinion on it.\n\n I appreciate that, you're being a very good sport about this debate, something you rarely see on forums like this. Because neither of us are strongly attached to the beliefs or emotions we have concerning the issue, we are more willing to tackle challenges that go against either side, and it gives us a level of freedom to address those challenges that probably wouldn't be possible if we were trying to desperately grasp on to our positions emoticon_xgood",

   "\n How can we discuss karma without invoking the metaphysical realm? Traditionally, karma refers to an inner sense of well-being that comes from \"good decisions\", that projects outward and attracts good events back to you, and vice versa with bad decisions or actions (as in the law of attraction). in a deterministic worldview, we cannot manipulate karma. In fact, in concept of karma itself is too \"magical\" for us to even entertain to begin with\n \n\n From: Karma; The Laws of Cause and Effect\n I will highlight in red the parts that I would omit and blue, what I would add:\n \n In its major conception, karma is the physical, mental and supramental system of neutral rebound, \"cause and effect,\" that is inherent in existence within the bounds of time, space, and causation. Essentially what this means is that the very being which one experiences (say, as a human being) is governed by an immutable preservation of energy, vibration, and action. It is comparable to the Golden Rule but denies the ostenisble arbitrariness of Fate, Destiny, Kismet, or other such Western conceptions by attributing absolute reason and determinism to the workings of the cosmos.(natural Universe)\n \n Karma, for these reasons, naturally implies reincarnation since thoughts and deeds in past lives will affect one's current situation (I would say that our GES affects our lives and omit reincarnation altogether). \n Thus, humanity (through a sort of collective karma) and individuals alike are responsible for the tragedies and good 'fortunes' which they experience. (along with and limited by outside factors such as mere interaction with everything else that exists in the Universe) \n The concept of an inscrutable \"God\" figure is not necessary with the idea of karma. It is vital to note that karma is not an instrument of a god, or a single God, but is rather the physical and spiritual 'physics' of being.

The answer that gets pulled out of the air is 'FREE WILL', and I see the concept of free will as meaningless. It answers nothing.. .. but is a great big excuse.\n\n Free will comes with it the gravity of taking responsibilty for your choices and accountability for your actions.

You want to believe that God is omnipotent and can fix all the bad things with the snap of his fingers. You want to believe that since God is omnipotent and yet evil exist, God cannot be benevolent and therefore you have a good reason to reject him. \n \n On the other hand, for those who believe in free will, then you can't blame God for the evil in the world, you cannot accuse him of not being benevolent, and you have to face the reality that mankind is responsible for making the world the way it is by our actions.

   "From: Karma; The Laws of Cause and Effect\n I will highlight in red the parts that I would omit and blue, what I would add:\n \n In its major conception, karma is the physical, mental and supramental system of neutral rebound, \"cause and effect,\" that is inherent in existence within the bounds of time, space, and causation. Essentially what this means is that the very being which one experiences (say, as a human being) is governed by an immutable preservation of energy, vibration, and action. It is comparable to the Golden Rule but denies the ostenisble arbitrariness of Fate, Destiny, Kismet, or other such Western conceptions by attributing absolute reason and determinism to the workings of the cosmos.(natural Universe)\n \n Karma, for these reasons, naturally implies reincarnation since thoughts and deeds in past lives will affect one's current situation (I would say that our GES affects our lives and omit reincarnation altogether). \n Thus, humanity (through a sort of collective karma) and individuals alike are responsible for the tragedies and good 'fortunes' which they experience. (along with and limited by outside factors such as mere interaction with everything else that exists in the Universe) \n The concept of an inscrutable \"God\" figure is not necessary with the idea of karma. It is vital to note that karma is not an instrument of a god, or a single God, but is rather the physical and spiritual 'physics' of being. As gravity governs the motions of heavenly bodies and objects on the surface of the earth, karma governs the motions and happenings of life, both inanimate and animate, unconscious and conscious, in the cosmic realm. I think 'Karma' can be just another word for 'laws of Nature', plain and simple and forget about this mystical 'cosmic realm'. \n \n\n At its core, the idea of karma embraces free will and rejects fate, destiny and determinism. Karma necessitate responsibility for one's actions, and the idea of atonement, forgiveness and self-improvement are also closely linked to this philosophy. By trying to strip away the metaphysical aspect of karma, and at the same time trying to integrate it with your idea of determinism, I suspect that you will run into a logical dead end. \n \n \nTechnically, Karma doesn't fit into my beliefs but, it's edited version does.

   "This has been something that is somewhat a thorn in my side that I need to address. Its the popular sentiment that is shared by the author of that article I read, the youtube video guy, and our forum residents sandycane, trebor and gansao. No doubt its quite a popular belief among anyone who subscribes to determinism. That is, free will is an illusion. \n \n First, by declaring that free will is an illusion, we are admitting that we don't know enough about free will to make a conclusion about it, but are doing so anyway. In fact, to make such a claim is to say that even though it seems as though we have evidence of free will before us, let's believe the opposite instead. \n \n Second, let's look at the evolutionary implications. Most people can easily accept that animals, lower forms of life, and inanimate objects have no free will, even among those who believe that humans have it. If this is the case, then at some point we adapted a mechanism that gives us a distorted view of reality. Our consciousness is tricking us into believing that something we think is real isn't. As a matter of fact, even our consciousness must be something that we adapted. If we don't make decisions, but rather react in predefined ways to external stimuli, why would a conscience be necessary for survival? Why would we then need to adopt a self-deceiving function in order to compensate for the fact that we have a conscience that doesn't help us function at all? If we cannot consciously control our actions, why does consciousness exist? Or is consciousness itself also an illusion?\n \n Third is the question of whether we can control behavior. For the determinist the answer is no. Interestingly enough, there is a huge concern among determinists that if the world population were taught that free will doesn't exist, people would give themselves liberty to utterly do anything they wanted to, under the claim that they have no control of their actions. The fear is that chaos would abound and all forms of order in our society would disappear. This is actually quite a legitimate fear. So the solution is to continue to let society at large believe that free will exists, and therefore that we have reason to keep a system of law and order in place, and to judge individuals for their own actions. What's interesting is that this is based on the hypothesis that behavior can be controlled if we tell people their behavior can be controlled, but it cannot be controlled if we tell them it cannot be controlled. As far as I see, either an individual can control his own behavior, or he cannot. Why does this fear of chaos in a deterministic world exist?\n \n Finally (and probably my favorite), is the fact that this debate exists. If determinism is the order of the world, wouldn't it be abundantly apparent that our actions are out of our control, and that we cannot will ourselves to do anything? We would be no more than programmable robots, motivated by species continuation, and automatically operating under preset patterns and algorithms. At some point throughout history, we would realise that attempt, effort, plan and desire are all useless, and that what we believe to be voluntary action is really calculated reflexes. The reality is, however, that we are not mindless robots. Not only can we conceive and even simulate alternative actions, but we discover, invent and innovate. We can question options even if we don't select them. We can think independently enough to imagine that we cannot think independently! That says a lot. \n \n I don't see these issues being addressed. Claiming that free will is an illusion, without even attempting to build a solid case for such a hypothesis, is intellectual laziness if ever there was an instance of it. I'm sure better can be done than that. Its one thing to say that you believe (or in many cases know without doubt) that free will is an illusion. This dogma in the face of evidence to the contrary reminds me of another school of thought I would think that most determinists would have grown out of. Or maybe not....",

I'm amazed to see determinists engaging in the rankest sort of mind-body (or feeling-body) dualism.\n\n I actually realized the flaw in that argument when I made it. However, if we consider that all actions are predetermined reflexes, then feelings should be a non-issue to our functionality. Yes feelings exist, and yes we cannot ignore them as an input factor, but why would it be necessary to for them to exist in the first place? I'm not talking about the physical sensations of pain, comfort, hunger, etc, but the higher emotions of accomplishment, optimism, gratitude, etc. \n \n As you pointed out, its easy to say that, in hindsight, everything that looks like elements of free will must be elements of determinism, in keeping with the foregone conclusion that there is no free will.

What happened to 'Fall'???emoticon_angry\n \n Okay, back on topic.emoticon_xgood OP:\n \n Here is a question for theists. \n You presume that God is all powerful, and he has created everything.\n \n You also presume that God is all knowing, that he can see all times past, present, and future. He has a plan for each and every human and we need to to follow his will. \n \n You also presume that God is all loving, and every single human life is precious to him.\n \n If all of these things are true, then it is also true that God created a huge amount of people specifically to go to hell. \n \n If he knew, before I was born, that I would not believe in him, then he created me knowing he was creating me to eventually go to hell. This can be applied to any other atheist or otherwise hell-bound individual.\n \n I see no free will in this equation. Before I was ever born, God in his infinite wisdom knew that I would not believe. He made me knowing I would burn. My life and actions were predetermined. My burning was planned a millenia ago!\n \n Is this the loving God I am told about? I don't think so. How is my life precious if my creator knew I was going to hell before I was ever born.\n \n 'for theists'\n 16 pages of non-theists discussing god and the concept of free will as it applies to god! \n \n Here's what my one and only reply to the OP should have been: \n DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT! THERE AIN'T NO STINCKIN' GOD!\n I would, however like to continue a discussion of free will - from a non-theist (no gods allowed) perspective...new thread, anyone? :)",

   "She said that free will is the ability and opportunity to make choices, which is almost identical to entry 2 in your list.\n \n \n Free will and having a choice are two very similar yet drastically different concepts. \n \n \n \nIt depends on what flavor of religious follower you ask. Omniscience doesn't necessarily mean you know the future. Omniscience means knowledge of everything, or to know all that is. The future doesn't exist yet, and therefore isn't something that need be known to have knowledge of all that is. But its a battle to explain this to a theist, who insists that God cannot be limited, and then corner themselves into a logical contradiction. \n\n \n \n The wrench in the cog is prophecy. Almost all the major religions have it and need it to support doctrine, but prophecy by definition confirms the position that the future is set and known. \n \n \n \nYou seem to think that these \"other factors that went into you having that choice\" somehow hampers or removes free will. I don't get your reasoning behind that idea\n\n \n Free will is not the same as having choices. Using your example with the gun I have choices, but they are not being made by me without external influence. That is the distinction, choosing options by your will alone free from any external circumstances, rewards, punishment, coercion, misrepresentations etc. \n \n Of course choice is a part of the free will debate which is probably why it is often difficult to keep one separate from the other. The difference is subtle but significant.",

   "Again, we have 2 situations involving you being suddenly forced to choose between 2 options that you don't want. Situation 1 is me pointing a gun to your head and forcing you to choose between losing your wallet or dying. I, the third party, am setting you up in the situation where these are your only 2 options. Situation 2 is you falling from a plane with a parachute, forcing you to choose between landing in an unknown location you don't want to be in or dying. (The choices are open the parachute or not open the parachute; defying gravity, growing wings, magically wiggling your nose has nothing to with anything.) There is no third party, but all the other factors are relatively the same. \n\n \n Is your free will being taken away in situation 1? Is your free will being taken away in situation 2?[/QUOTE]\n \n What is the singular difference between scenario 1 and 2? The one significant difference? I really thought the last sentences from my prior post were pretty cut and dry, but maybe not. \n \n Since you are forcing me against my will to make a choice it is difficult to think in scenario 1 I have free will. Certainly I have choices, but having choice is not the same as exercising free will.\n \n Scenario 2 is again about choices, which differs from free will. If you will notice though if free will was involved and unless I had left the plane against my will there is no influence by someone else who desires a particular choice be made by me. Keeping consistent with the definition of the term\n \n \n Trying to draw comparisons about having to make quick decisions from among few and and unwanted possibilities is meaningless to the argument. That is why I tried pointing out instead of a gun you used $10.

You created the situation, you created the choices How does that equate to you having no influence?\n \n\n I have influence. In fact, you can say that I hold the majority of influence in this situation. But I'm not making the decision for you. Just because the 2 available options are heavily one-sided doesn't mean that free will to choose no longer exists. \n \nI could also jump in front of a bus. Having the capacity to select a course of action from available possibilities isn't free will.\n \nI don't get this. If you jump in front of a bus, what are the choices you have?\n \nNo free will is not the ability to choose. It is not having someone trying to make you choose for their own reasons. Even if those reason are in your best interest. It isn't the actual choice amd it isn't ability. \n \n\n Interesting that you use the word \"trying\". I can influence your choice with begging, intimidation, bait, lure, threats, even certain death. But the most power I can possibly have over the decision you make is to try to make you choose something. I can never make you choose something. \n \n \nConsequences only matter if they are used by you to get me to choose what you want me to.\n \n The differnce in you putting a gun to my head and saying give me your wallet or I will shoot you and me randomly just walking up to you and saying here take this as I hand you my wallet is YOU. You attempt to cause me to act the way you want me to regardless of whether I want to or not. When I walk up to having never seen you before and give you my wallet I caused that to happen without anybody else participating in any part of the decision or implementation\n\n Consequences are always attached to decisions. They may not always be as severe as life and death, and they may not always involve the consequence being enforced by another person, but consequences are always there. You seem to be saying that free will can only exist if the consequence of the decision is not being enforced by a human being. I really don't know where you're getting this definition from. \n \n We've gone around in circles enough times to get a good grip on the core issue here. I feel we understand clearly what the other person is saying, we simply disagree on what the definition of free will is. I say that free will is the ability to choose any option among all the available options. You say that free will is ability to act without influence or pressure from another person. The very simple solution to this dilema is to simply look up the definition of free will....\n \n Free will | Define Free will at Dictionary.com\n \n Free will\n -n\n 1. the apparent human ability to make choices that are not externally determined\n 2. the ability to make a choice without coercion\n \n Well wadya know!
