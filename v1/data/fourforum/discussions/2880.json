   "so i just got a copy of this book the other day, and i'm part way through the second chapter, and i think it's really really interesting. \n \n So far it seems to be very impartial. it explains what happened, when, how, and sometimes they speculate as to why. the commission states what happened, weather it's an FAA official going outside of standard procedure to scramble F-15 jets, or the military claiming that it had advanced notice of some of the hijacked flights, when they really didn't. \n \n However i am a little concerned that this book is a massive piece of propaganda meant to restore faith in my government, and solidify my feelings about fundamentalist islam. \n \n The book hasn't been exonerating the US government, and hasn't been painting the hijackers as evil scum of the earth... and the book is approved by both parties... but then again is there really much difference between the two major parties?\n \n I'm working on the second chapter which talks briefly about islam, and more specifically about fundamentalist islam, and has now moved on to bin Laden and his history. \n \n something that was revealing to me was the US did not actually aid bin Laden as much as some US critics have lead me to believe. The US did fund the movement to get a soviet presence out of Afghanistan, but both the US and an individual close to bin Laden have said that the US did not (or not significantly) aid bin Laden's movement. \n \n how accurate do you all think this book is? is it propaganda? what are your thoughts?",

When the book discusses the intelligence that was available before 9/11 I may come back and talk about it.\n \n \nWhat are they saying about Islam?\n\n \n It talks about the prophet Mohammed, the Qur'an, the Hadith, and the Sharia. Also what the difference between the branches Sunni and Shia are, and where the groups are prevalent. The self perceived \"golden age\".

Do you see this distinction?\n \n Furthermore, in funding the Afgan resistance we in no way (according to the book) supported, trained, or funded Osama Bin Laden (if you have any evidence otherwise please present it... one of the questions in my OP was did the US really not fund Bin Laden at all).

These CIA trained mujahideen forces murdered teachers, doctors and nurses, tortured women for not wearing the veil, and shot down civilian airliners with U.S.-supplied stinger missiles. Nevertheless, many of these mujahideen probably never knew they were being funded by the CIA.\n http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/TAL111A.html (note this is the same article as above, but at a different site)\n \"CIA provided funds to financiers of Sept 11 bomber\"\n http://www.btinternet.com/~nlpwessex/Documents/FightSmart18-11-2001.htm\n NEW YORK, Aug. 24, 1998 ? At the CIA, it happens often enough to have a code name: Blowback. Simply defined, this is the term that describes an agent, an operative or an operation that has turned on its creators. Osama bin Laden, our new public enemy Number 1, is the personification of blowback. And the fact that he is viewed as a hero by millions in the Islamic world proves again the old adage: Reap what you sow.\n http://www.msnbc.com/news/190144.asp?cp1=1\n also\n \"The link between the U.S and Al Queda\"\n http://www.geocities.com/notowaroniraq/usqueda.html\n and\n \"AMERICAN TALIBAN\"\n http://geocities.com/vwp27/americantaliban\n \n Although in the interest of 'balance' these links are attacked at\n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C98115%2C00.html\n Though Fox is not the most balanced news reporting service\n \n What was his cause? It wasn't solely to get rid of the Soviet presence in Afghanistan, that was your cause. His was the advancement of Islam at the expense of non-Moslems. He was bound to turn on you. \n\n \nAgain, since it seems we did not help, support, train, or fund him in any way (please provide evidence otherwise) he can?t be considered to have turned on us. \n\n You gave out money to all the groups fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan.\n \n ((Fundamentalist)) Islam has as much time for the liberal-democratic notions espoused by the USA as communism does.\n\n \nAnd in choosing the lesser of the two evils, the US sided with Islam\n\n Then we agree that the US gets what they deserve in 'sowing' these seeds.\n \n(I?m resistant to add the ?fundimental? prefix to it).\n\n So am I. But I wanted to limit myself to one debate.\n \n Correct the US would place fundamental Islam in the same box as communism? however a government that relies heavily on Islamic teachings would not necessarily be a problem.\n\n no comment. :)\n \n This is nothing new to the US. Of a horrid dictator, Somoza, Franklin D. Roosevelt said \"He may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch\"\n Simply put, the US doesn't care who they support. You never have... as long as they do business with you, it's fine... whether its a truly oppressive man like Saddam, or less oppressive nations as long as business goes on. \n\n \nI?ve been trying to limit this thread to 9/11, Islam, and Osama Bin Laden (what is contained in the book).\n\n Sure, but it goes to modus operandi. You've always supported b*stards.\n \nFor what its worth, that's what I believe. You reap what you sow.\n\n \nDid we ?sow? Osama Bin Laden? What did the US do that was immoral? Apparently it wasn?t funding/training/supporting Osama Bin Laden.\n\n That's what we're here to debate :) I don't think you just saying \"No it's not\" resolves the issue.\n \n PS you may have noted that one or two sites deals with the Taliban. This is still relevant because the US government argues in fighting them that they are partners in terrorism",

   "Yes the US has done morally deplorable things in the past. Just like every other country. And no the fact that everyone does it makes it ok, or all countries are on equal footing. The OP has a very limited scope and I'd appreciate it if you stayed with in those bounds.\n \n \nNo... the means of Al Queda were to cause terror. They may have had the same limited aim as the USA - to oust the USSR, but their means of terror made them terrorists. That they would be hired by the USA means that the USA aided terrorists.\n\n \n As has been mentioned several times on this thread, Al Queda did not exist when the US was funding the movement to push the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan.\n \n Here is the passage in the book:\n \"The international environment for Bin Ladin's efforts was ideal. Saudi Arabia and the United States supplied billions of dollars worth of secret assistance to rebel groups in Afghanistan fighting the Soviet occupation. This assistance was funneled through Pakistan: the Pakistani military intelligence service (... ISID), helped train the rebels and distribute the arms. But Bin Ladin and his comrades had their own sources of support and training, and they received little or no assistance from the United States.*\n \n (a footnote) *In his memoir, Ayman al Zawahiri contemptuously rejects the claim that the Arab mujahideen were financed (even \"one penny\") or trained by the U.S... CIA officials involved in aiding the Afghan resistance regard Bin Ladin and his \"Arab Afghans\" as having been militarily insignificant in the war and recall having little to do with him.\"\n \n \nIf you launder money through 'fronts' then you are still culpable. That you did so through Pakistan and Saudi Arabia doesn't lessen the guilt.\n\n \n the book acknowledges that it used Pakistan as a front for supplying Afghan rebels, but that's not what I was asking evidence for.\n \n Your first site says the CIA \"incubated\" Osama Bin Ladin's organization, but then as evidence says the CIA trained the mujahideen that opposed the soviet union... but the group that opposed the soviet union was not headed by Osama Bin Ladin. Osama came to fame and leadership only after the Soviet Union was pushed out of Afghanistan.\n \n \nhttp://www.msnbc.com/news/190144.asp?cp1=1\n\n \n from this website we find \"It should be pointed out that the evidence of bin Ladin's connection to these activities is mostly classified, though its hard to imagine the CIA rushing to take credit for a Frankenstein's monster like this.\" \n \n Saying he doesn't actually have the sources for the evidence he provides... but it should be taken as true because the CIA would deny it. \n \n \n \n\"The link between the U.S and Al Queda\"\n \n \n \"AMERICAN TALIBAN\"\n\n \n could you please direct me to a passage or specific part of the article... instead of just repeating its title?\n \n \n \nYou gave out money to all the groups fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan.\n\n \n though it seems except this group.\n \n \nThen we agree that the US gets what they deserve in 'sowing' these seeds.\n\n \n I don't know if you can ever justify the death of 3,000 civilians. The US funded and supported terrorist activities against the Soviet government in Afghanistan, which was wrong; and Osama Bin Ladin planned and executed the 9/11 attacks which was also wrong.\n \n \nThat's what we're here to debate :) I don't think you just saying \"No it's not\" resolves the issue.\n \n \n Pointing out what other sources say, and showing how your bits of evidence don't quite show what you are asserting does help resolve the issue.",

   "whew! i bought the book on friday, and r ead the first 3 chapters so far. its a very difficult read, almost 500 pages of fine print, diplmatic language. i find myself falling asleep and rereading lines a lot, and because the pages are not very white, its even more difficult to read in anything less than very good lighting\n \n with that said, the book is very intriguing, and it is packed with information about the terrost system, its development through the years, and america's developments to deal with terrorism. it starts off with a highly detailed account of the morning of september 11th itself, from the terrorists boarding the plane to the reaction of bush and the administration. chapter 2 talks about how al qaeda developed and gives a lot of info about bin laden and his compadres. chapter 3 gives a full disection of the us intellegence and defense authorities and how they contribute to the fight against terrorism. it emphasizes the inadequacies of these organisations for dealing with terrorism, citing a lack of information management and disemination as a repeating cause of failure.\n \n as i read through, i start to understand some of the underlying policies of decision making when it comes to national threat in general. america doesnt really care that much if other atrocities are escalating in the outside world. as long as those atrocities have no immediate or foreseeable danger to america itself, we dont really feel obliged to do anything about it. the image that america tries to be the global police state of the world is in a way a misconception. if it doesnt affect our personal economic or political safety, then its not an issue we bother with. the main itellegence agencies have held to this policy closely over the years, reserving their \"global policing\" for targets that are deemed imminent threats. such a case was russia and communism in general. although vietnam had no wmds, china and russia did, and any grounds gained for communism meant more percieved danger of nuclear war for us. attacking communism itself was dealing with this threat from the root. with terrorism, its different, because the source is not a centralized political force but a spread out and shared ideal\n \n so far the report has not cited iraq as a significant terrorist contributor. one iraqi stayed with bin laden and helped train al qaedas in bomb techniqes. bin laden never worked with the iraqi government or saddam, even though he did hav some sort of asylum there if he needed it. on page 57 it talks about the invasion of kuwait by iraq. bin laden offered the saudis to send fighters to reclaim kuwait, but saudi arabia turned him down. also, another report from the commission talks about bin laden helping terrorists in their plot to assasinate saddam. to state that bin laden and saddam had any type of cooperative relationship is totally false.\n \n i recommend that as many of you as possible read the report if you really want to get some unbiased facts into this war on terrorism situation.",

What really happening on sept 11 America's day of deception .\n \n See his 911 articles and site here\n \n http://www.willthomas.net/911/index.htm\n\n what is the most important question?\n \n thomas insists that our fighter jets were more than capable of shooting the planes out of the air before they struck the wtc and pentagon. after reading thomas' \"is bush nuts\" it obvious that thomas presents what is clearly unfounded speculation as some kind of serious thesis. however, it is reasonable to assume that somewhere along the line, dishonesty with public disclosure is to be expected by all politicians, even joint boards\n \n the commision report emphasizes that our defenses were totally unprepared for investigating, analysing, intercepting and dealing with terrorist attacks of most kinds, particularly withing in us, and particularly involving hijacked planes. the commission points out our miserable failures at negoitating and coping with nostage situations. it also points out the fault of information dissemination policies among organisations handling terrorism.\n \n i think the most important issue is not what should have been done then, but what is being done now. there is no shortage of people speculating their \"shouldas, couldas and wouldas\" about the action of 9/11, but what is the point. it is much more relevant to focus on what we are doing now about the very real situation of a large part of al qaeda and the taliban still at large and operational, as well as many other america-hating terrorist groups in egypt, jordan, lybia, sudan and iran that america has not even batted an eye at\n \n scrambling a defensive effort minutes before an imminent attack is already too late. the problem exists as long as bin laden, mullah and other charismatic terrorist inciters are alive and allowed to preach violence. defending our buildings and tightening security is as effective as building a steel fortress on a bog swamp. the root of the problem is not even being addressed, but america is continually raising public fear, and not dealing with the element putting us in fear. thats plain dumb",
