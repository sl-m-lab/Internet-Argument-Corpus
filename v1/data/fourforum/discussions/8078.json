   " \n Shouldn't someone be allowed to die if they want to? \n \n\n what a name \"snatch\" <--- like \"steals\", huh?\n \n People are freely doing so all the time now, via various means: \n 1. Fast suicide: killing her/himself quickly. \n 2. Slower suicide: Dieing from strategies like cancer, depression, etc.\n 3. suicide-Bombers: Intent on killing others with them.\n 4. Poll-makers: like you here.\n 5. Fear-mongers: philosophers instilling in others a Fear-of-life, sadly including often medical-imprinting. \n Most people know that practicing 'medicine' is a Business. \n \n Many medical-doctors we are familiar with, have NO interest in 'linduistically-manipulating' their \"patients' - towards Death. \n \n Be cause they are *passionate :) FOR---<\"life\", Abundantly*\n \n\n Who made physicians God and \n said that they could take life away from someone?\n \n\n since GOD wisely judged not giving ordinary human simpletons such power, \n apparently it's man, her/himself, who chooses taking on such control.\n in movies \n like \"Patch Adams\", and others - the General-public can get a foretaste insight how med-students are indoctrinated with delusions like \"I am god, and I issue Orders\" <--- yes, very militaristic terms.\n Otoh, \n there are also Medical-doctors, who underwent the \"same-training\", who are oriented (like I said above already) **passionate :) FOR---<\"life\", Abundantly**\n \n Be ever careful, in \"Choosing a medical-doctor\" aligned with whatever *your own LIFE-goals* are, eh? - while you still can, make that CHOICE.\n Said, because our current culture holds a steep fascination with death ANY-way possible Just look at how this poll was worded; ie linguistically manipulated.\n \n \n \n Write your arguments as to whether :) , or \n not, you think euthanasia should be legal and get passionate people!\n \n\n We know what side you're on!\n Euthanasia, or wholesale human slaughter has been practiced for 1000's of years - including in \n medicine in the last 100+ years, via :\n 1. \"Early-abortion\", against the Youngest humanity, \n 2. \"Middle-abortion\", against Preborns that in some instances, have proven they can, in fact, live.\n 3. \"Birth-abortions\", against babies AS all (but their head) is *allready birthed*.\n 4. Dangerous side-effects from increasing pharmaceuticals.\n 5. Robbing people (of their GOD-blest organs) by cutting them out, in Surgery or for \"Transplantation\"\n 6. Intentionally over-dosing people, in Hospice, so they'll die.\n 7. And yes LEGAL-izing, or expanding \"License$ to kill\".\n yup, right around the corner.\n \n As surely, as \"abortion\" was legalized. It was \"planned\" that way, evidently. And \n \n Not by GOD. How ironic that what life GOD *creates*, man only chooses \"killing\".\n \n \n Should euthanasia be legalized? \n \n\n Obviously, you've cast your own vote already, via your own Perception, orientations, and outcome.\n (as opposed to writing polls like this, designed to take as many people, down into another \n senseless hole),\n \n A much more useful, helpful question would be: What are atheists & others \"suffering\" from?, and\n Let's get you some personal-Help with that; such that\n you will be able to *contribute finer ways of Serving humanity* - via Beneficial, \n fascinatingly Innovative ways like:\n 1.

   "Another opinion", 
   "As I understand the modern sense of the term \"Euthanasia\", there seem to be two categories that are discussed:\n \n 1) Doctor-assisted suicide: Here I agree that a person has the right to kill themselves when they are in such a miserable state of health that continued life no longer has any purpose. It would be cruel to force them to continue living when there is no hope or negligeable hope of recovery. The only caveat that I would add is that there are situations in which a patient might get depressed to the point of suicide where those situations do promise a reasonable hope of recovery. In such situations, I would advocate a delay before any such decision is implemented to allow for psychotherapy and for the patient to possibly change their minds.\n \n 2) Disconnecting a patient in long-term / terminal coma: If a person is in a persistent vegitative state or otherwise not able to communicate and there is no or negligeable hope of recovery, then I believe that at some point a decision has to be made whether or not to \"unplug\" the patient, thereby causing their death. I strongly support people's right to write living wills to outline the circumstances under which they should be disconnected. Otherwise, loved ones should usually make such decisions. When there is a dispute, such as in the Terry Schiavo case, then the state should then have the right to intervene, taking into account the state of the patient as determined by the medical expertise.\n \n So, in those two cases, I do support Euthanasia. However, it has an older malevolent meaning as well - as in Hitler killing the mentally ill or mentally challenged for the purpose of ratial purity. I highly doubt that anyone other than fringe nutcases are advocating for that type of Euthanasia.",

It is not a doctors place to suggest such a thing. It is a decision that should be made by the patient and his/her designated agents only. It has nothing to do with the \"value\" of life, or the worth of life...especially when it is the patient who determines the course in the first place. And more importantly, it is an individual decision that the government or private citizens not directly involved in the case should keep their nose out of. \n \n \nThe only chance I think euthanasia is plausible is when the person is already practically dead but is artificially sustained by machines or medicines. This is the only case of euthanasia I would agree with.\n\n This is not true euthanasia either. This is a normal withdrawl of care or life support. This thankfully is already legal in the US when a patient meets certain criteria. I for one do not want to be left on a ventilator, feeding tube, or in a comatose state for years. These are decisions that are already spelled out in living wills, or are left to a patients power of attorney to decide. While they are end of life issues, this is not euthanasia.",

Isn't the greatest show of being able to controll your own LIFE the right to end it? Unless we can prove that they are not mentally well, let them die. Now any doctor who tries to convince their patients to die should in my opinion be immediately fired and stripped of their doctor's liscense. They should be able to inform the patient of the option, but trying to sway them towards death is the dirtiest thing you could ever pull. If they really want to die, let them.

Article 11 of the Treaty of Tripoli, along with our 1st Amendment establishes religious neutrality, and the euthenasia debate needs to be established with that same neutrality.\n\n \n I disagree wth this statement 100%. Lets take a look at why I disagree.\n \n 1. Dependence on prescribtion drugs- That is almost the whole population of people worlwide. That are on sevral types of prescription drugs. Because of high blood pressure, blood sugar, mental illness, athritis, etc. That dose not mean that they should be able to end their lives because of it? As a matter of fact, alot of the pills give people such bad side effects. Lessening the dosage has rendered successful results. Allowing people to kill themselves, just because they take too many pills is not all together a wise course of action.\n \n 2. Just because someone is paralaised dose not mean that is an excuse for suicide. I have taken care of patients that lead happy lives even though they can't move. Family is involved in their lives. And although there are times when a person has noone, in that instance a program set up, to work with those mentally who are restricted with their movement, should be put in place. To better help those deal with the situation that they are in.\n \n 3. In-mates- They should not have the opinon at all. Why should they be allowed to get out of their punishment with death?! They were sentenced for a reason, and should be allowed to finish that sentence. Hopefully to become a better person.\n \n 4. Post-war problems- This is cureable. Through therapy they can be helped out of a certain frame of mind, that has become destructive for them.\n \n I disagree with these, because there are other options then suicide when it comes to these things. And I do agree that legalizing euthanasia, will bring future problems.\n \n People who are depressed and want to end their lives will start to complain about why they are denied the use of it. When it is only restricted by use for some. And things can sart taking a turn for the worst. People will start wanting to use it, when they think times are too tough, and then we have alot of senseless deaths on our hands.\n \n It is also, like one other person said, a decaying of society. Letting people kill themselves, is disregard for life. They talk about restraining people because they are a threat to themselves, and others. This would be a contridiction on their part if they allow euthanasia to take place. Because they would be alowing people to be a threat to themselves, the very thing they restrain them for.",

   "I disagree wth this statement 100%. Lets take a look at why I disagree.\n \n 1. Dependence on prescribtion drugs- That is almost the whole population of people worlwide. That are on sevral types of prescription drugs. Because of high blood pressure, blood sugar, mental illness, athritis, etc. That dose not mean that they should be able to end their lives because of it? As a matter of fact, alot of the pills give people such bad side effects. Lessening the dosage has rendered successful results. Allowing people to kill themselves, just because they take too many pills is not all together a wise course of action.\n \n (What if they cant live without the drugs, its the only thing keeping them living, I would rather die and be free than owe my life to drugs personally\n \n 2. Just because someone is paralaised dose not mean that is an excuse for suicide. I have taken care of patients that lead happy lives even though they can't move. Family is involved in their lives. And although there are times when a person has noone, in that instance a program set up, to work with those mentally who are restricted with their movement, should be put in place. To better help those deal with the situation that they are in.\n \n What if they cant if they have been paralyzed for years and are ready to give up or they don't have family cuz they are dead or they dont want to lvie or being paralyzed killed their dreams like they were paralyzed in a racing accident or a horseback riding fall or something like that? Let them give up their lives so they can not be paralyzed and be free to have people have them remembered they way they want to remember. if they dont want to live dont deny them that\n \n 3. In-mates- They should not have the opinon at all. Why should they be allowed to get out of their punishment with death?! They were sentenced for a reason, and should be allowed to finish that sentence. Hopefully to become a better person.\n \n Whats the point then if they dont want to reform or hate to much to do it,?\n \n 4. Post-war problems- This is cureable. Through therapy they can be helped out of a certain frame of mind, that has become destructive for them.\n \n If it is not curable?",

First of all, it is always subjective for doctors to diagnose a \"terminally\" comatosed patient. The brain is very unpredictable and who is to decide the cut-off. If not specifically detailed in a will, can the government force a family to continue paying for the care of a terminally comatosed patient?
