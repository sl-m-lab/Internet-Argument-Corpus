This should have happened a long time ago as we have been urging them. This is a \"win-win\" situation.\n\n \n Except that has not happened. You are essentially trying (once again) to use a dmbified version of a fairly complex theory which has led you to yet another unsupportable, idiotic conclusion.\n \n The dolalr has been slowly falling for several years, and contrary to the dumbed down version of economic theory that you are pushing here, it has not made our manufactured goods sell. It has not encouraged increased shopping by foreigners (people do not cross oceans just to shop). It has, in fact, driven prices UP and made us even less competitive. No opinion there, just fact.\n \n Prices have been driven UP by our falling dollar because we import over 80% of the manufactured raw materials we use in production. A falling dollar means a higher cost for those materials. The majority of industrial machinery used in the US today is also imported, meaning higher costs for that as well. The only thing that a lower dollar gets us is coceptually cheaper labor.\n \n First, if I was in your mental class, I would not cheer cheaper labor prices for XXXXXX. Second, the increased volume margin on the raw materials more than negates the effectof the cheaper labor.\n \n Again, no specualtion, just cold, hard facts. The dollar has been falling for long enough that we know damn well what the effect is. Those pushing the \"lower dollar is good becuase it = cheaper exports\" are just banking on the fact that most americans have only an extremely slight grasp of how the economy works, and many are stupid enough to actually buy the BS that the talking heads on their TV are selling.",
