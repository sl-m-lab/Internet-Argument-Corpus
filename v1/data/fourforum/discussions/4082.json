   "This thread may not apply to many.\n \n Anyone do debate in high school? Maybe you're in your high school&#8217;s debate team right now. I did Lincoln Douglas, or value debate. In essence the four years I spent debating taught me how to think. It didn't give me opinions, it told me how to evaluate them.\n \n I'm concerned that LD isn't doing that nearly as well anymore. I've been judging debate now, rather than competing in it for 2 years and I'm finding a trend in the group away from being persuasive and toward an artificial skill, which I will refer to as being a master-debater.\n \n A master-debater is not concerned with whether or not his arguments make sense, he is primarily concerned with releasing these arguments as fast as possible so that his opening speech sounds like one 6 minute sentence in the hopes his opponent will not be able to refute the arguments and \"drop\" them in the round. \"Dropped\" arguments must \"flow\" to the side who didn't drop them.\n \n The master-debater doesn't have time to formulate a well thought out argument against his opponent's points so he will quote some buzzword, often with a philosopher's name in it, and say that is his refutation. In essence, this is the sort of person that is overly concerned with how to be good at debating and not how to properly argue an issue. Thus they are a master at debate but nothing else.\n \n The scary part about this process is it feeds on itself as master-debaters who graduate and come back to judge their brethren so that to them the buzzword is a proper argument. These judges will give victory to other master-debaters, thus to get ahead in debate others are forced to adopt these master-debating virtues. Thus the system breeds more of them.\n \n One of the signs of this process is the demand for evidence. In policy debate, the foil of Lincoln Douglas, evidence is everything. If you do not have a piece of evidence that shows the sky is blue, you cannot claim so in a debate round. Lincoln Douglas, on the other hand (in the old days), put more stock in logical analysis of a topic. When I first started out, you could walk into an LD round with enough evidence to fit on half of one side of a 3X5 card and that would be sufficient, the rest of the arguments you made would be analyzing and critiquing you're opponents claims. The demands of evidence are becoming ever more stringent.\n \n It doesn't help that the topics that are picked are often ones that have heavy policy overtones. For instance the current Texas LD debate topic is \"equalization of funding is desirable in Texas schools\" 1 out of ten debaters will actually debate properly while the other 9 will conduct a policy round with less time to speak.\n \n What do you think?",
