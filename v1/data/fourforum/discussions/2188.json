   "I'm going to reintroduce a topic. Here's the situation:\n \n fan claimed that since Archaeopteryx had modern feathers and a furcula that it could not be a transitional. Since it is classified as a bird, a member of the taxa and clade (Aves), that it could not be transitional.\n \n 7th_Arty mentioned that domestic chickens that are not strong flyers, also have a furculum. fan incorrectly claims that this is because the flight feathers of chickens are more symetrical than those of Archaeopteryx. That isn't true. I think that fan made that up in an effort to defend an indefensable position. Of the reasons that chickens aren't \"strong\" flyers, the symetry of the flight feathers isn't a consideration. Chickens have a well ossified furcula along with a large sternum with a huge carina. The flight feathers of chickens are just a bit more adapted as an air foil than those of Archaeopteryx. Chickens aren't good flyers because of other considerations (could it be artificial selection?).\n \n So 7th_Arty presented a list of characteristics for discussion and fan ducked the question with a comment about his unwillingness to discuss bird features. The problem is that the list isn't just bird characteristics. Anyone who is familiar with ornithology would know that. Instead, fan ducks the questions because he is unable to answer. Better to claim that the questions are below him than to admit his ignorance.\n \n Here's the list from 7th_Arty. astronomyfan. Pick one and discuss it. Your choice. Then we can move on to the next point.\n \nopposable hallux\n \n beak\n \n Vertebra in trunk region fused\n \n Hollow (pneumatic) bones\n \n Elongate cerebral hemispheres\n \n Cerebellum behind mid-brain\n \n Concave articular facets on cervical vertebrae\n \n tail composed of free vertebrae\n \n teeth\n \n Ribs with uncinate processes articulated with sternum\n \n carina\n \n Archosaurian pelvic femur joint\n \n Sacrum occupies 6 vetebra\n \n Free metacarpals\n \n Free metatarsals\n \n preorbital fenestra\n \n Deltiod ridge of humerus and radial and ulnar condyles face forward\n \n Claws on unfused digits of forelimbs\n \n Developed fibula\n \n Gastralia\n\n I apologize to anyone who lacks the education to understand the terminology in the above list. Perhaps I might have expressed the points in more pedestrian terms. But that would require 4 times the space. One presumes that someone who claims to speak with authority of Archaeopteryx understands all of the above terms. If not, then nothing that they say on the topic can be trusted.\n \n fan's problem is whether Archey was transitional. Was it a bird? You betchum, Red Rider! Was it transitional? Is the Pope Catholic?\n \n From my perspective it seems that astronomyfan lacks the knoweldged to discuss the topic. That means that astronomyfan is ignorant. astronomyfan is aware of his ignorance and avoides discussion, pretending that he doesn't want to discuss a list of bird charistics. But no bird has gastralia (a suggestion for initial discussion).\n \n But hey! There is a long list of topics for friendly discussion.\n \n If you are unable to offer some intelligent discussion, then at least have the honesty to admit your ignorance of the topic. It doesn't support your position when you demonstrate your ignorance by stating that the above list is a list of bird characteristics. For example, birds don't have teeth or a tail composed of tail composed of free vertebrae. None. If you wish to claim that Archaeopteryx isn't a transitional, why are you unable to address the above list of questions?\n \n I suspect that I will bump, bump, bump this question as did 7th_Arty. I suspect that no creationist will be able to intelligently discuss any of the characteristics mentioned.",

   "I see that 7th_Arty posted a list of characteristics for discussion, Garioch reposted that list, and Glen_Fiddich bumped the topic. Perhaps it is unfair to creationists to ask for responses about specific characteristics. Even though if one is making a claim about the status of a particular organism we might expect some knowledge of those characteristics that distinguish an organism from another.\n \n I'll explain since I do have some education and experience in matters of vertebrate zoology and in ornithology.\n \n The last item on the list is gastralia. These are abdominal ribs composed of dermal bone. The exist in reptiles and fossil dinosaurs also had them, even theropod dinosaurs. Birds don't have gastralia - not a single known example of a living bird has gastralia (and I am not aware of a single reptile that lacks them in one form or another). Archaeopteryx had gastralia - they are quite obvious and one of the reasons why some specimens were classified as dinosaurs.\n \n If Archaeopteryx is just a bird, why does it have gastralia? The other characteristics mentioned are similar - birds and Archaeopteryx have them while reptiles and dinosaurs don't, others reptiles, dinosaurs and Archaeopteryx have, while birds don't. The problem is which is which and to explain it from the point of creationism. Why is a bird with dinosaur characteristics not a transitional?",

   "Then I stand corrected. But as I said, \"I am not aware of...\" I pulled out my dictionary of biology and looked up \"gastralia.\" Wasn't there. (How sad. Maybe I should trash it.)\n \n At any rate, gastralia are characteristic of diapsids (except turtles). They are found in the lepidosaurs (of which snakes and lizards are members) as well as the sauropods and theropods. Gastralia are derived from the archosaurs. They may be lost in some lineages (birds for example, or advanced therapsids as you point out [logical since mammals don't have gastralia], and maybe other dinosaurs).\n \n However, Archaeopteryx isn't a therapsid, it is a theropod, and it has gastralia, just like saruopods and theropods. Birds (none, not any) do not have gastralia - just like the therapsids don't have gastralia.\n \n Nevertheless, my point still stands. Why are YECs unable to explain the gastralia of Archaeopteryx or any of the other characteristics on the list?\n \n It seems that it is just you an I chatting, Barbarian. It' nice to chat.",
