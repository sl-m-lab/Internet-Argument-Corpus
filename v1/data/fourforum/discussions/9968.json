   "Just wondering if anyone has any thoughts on Hillary as far as leading the LGBT community towards equality. She is apparantly for equal adoption rights, repealing DADT and expanding hate crime laws. I don't yet trust any one candidate to be the best candidate for GLBT equality but am happy they are at least talking about it. \n \n http://www.gaywired.com/article.cfm?section=70&id=14955\n \n \n Statement from Hillary Clinton On Gay & Lesbian Pride Month \n 06.02.07 \n \n \"As we celebrate Gay and Lesbian Pride Month, I want to commend the LGBT community on a historic year that brought our country closer to equality and closer to ending discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. Just a year ago, I worked with my Democratic colleagues in the Senate as well as with LGBT leaders to defeat the divisive and discriminatory Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA). Since then, we not only defeated FMA, but we have been able to make real progress in achieving fairness for all Americans. In fact, since June 2006, New Jersey and New Hampshire became the third and fourth states to adopt civil unions and Washington and Iowa were added to the list of states that outlaw discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. A similar bill in Colorado is expected to be signed into law soon. And in Congress, we are finally on the verge of passing the Matthew Shepherd Act, which would expand hate crimes laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity. What a difference a year makes. \n \n \"The start of Gay and Lesbian Pride Month is a great time to celebrate these recent victories but also to reflect on all the work that still needs to be done. Unfortunately, while this is the first time in years that hate crimes legislation has a strong chance of passing both houses of Congress, President Bush has already signaled that he would veto this landmark bill. The truth is we will see little progress for the LGBT community at the national level until we have a new Democratic president. For six long years, the Bush Administration has only seen the families that matter to them. It's been a government of the few, by the few, and for the few. And no community has been more invisible to this administration than the LGBT community. \n \n \"I'm running for president to replace the divisive leadership of the past six years - leadership that views no issue and no family above the reach of politics. America deserves a president who appeals to the best in each of us, not the worst; a president who values and respects all Americans, gay and straight; a president who treats all Americans equally no matter who they are or who they love. \n \n \"I'm proud of my record standing up for the LGBT community during my years as First Lady and as a U.S. Senator. But when I take office in January 2009, we'll finally be able to define success by more than the bigotry we stopped and the bad decisions we prevented. America will finally have a president who moves this country forward. When I am president, we will work together to make sure that all Americans in committed relationships have equal benefits and that nothing stands in the way of loving couples who want to adopt children in need. We're going to finally expand our federal hate crimes legislation and pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. It is just plain wrong that in the year 2007, people who work hard and do a good job every day can still be fired because of who they love. And finally, we will put an end to the failed policy of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Courage, honor, patriotism and sacrifice - the traits that define our men and women in uniform - have nothing to do with sexual orientation. \n \n \"I am honored to have the support of so many people in the LGBT community and look forward to working with the community closely throughout the campaign. Together, we can continue the journey America has been on from the very beginning - to form a more perfect union and realize the goals and values we believe in. That's the promise of America - and that's why I'm running for president.\"",

I mean, given a GOP Congress for most of his administration, even if Clinton had been a rollicking gay rights advocate instead of a tepid supporter, how much could he have hoped to accomplish? It's a wonder he did so well, given the opposition of GOP conservatives to equal rights for all.\n \n Could or should he have tried harder? Undoubtedly. His caving to prejudice on DADT and DOMA was not the stuff of heroic leadership. But let's not pretend that the current maladministration, which has actively attempted to roll back civil rights for gay people on every front, is at all comparable to Clinton. It's been far worse, and has hurt more people than Clinton's ever did.\n \n I acknowledge that there are inveterate, knee-jerk Clinton haters on the right. Why, I have no idea. It wasn't as though he was particularly liberal, being on the right of the Democratic party. Well, maybe that's why they hated him, as he pulled the rug out from under them, and despite their worst efforts to bring him down by impeachment, remained a popular president till he left. Unlike the present incumbent. But isn't it time for you guys to move on? Clinton is history, and Hillary isn't Bill. Or is the Bush record so dismal you have to attack the last president to distract attention from this one?\n \n Oh, and as for Hillary, I don't much trust her, at any rate less than most Democratic pols, though more than any GOP ones. Not that I think any pols should be trusted on left or right. The Democrats can and probably will do better picking another candidate. That is something the knee-jerk Clinton haters will probably do for them; make them think twice about picking what would probably be a poor candidate.\n \n What I do know, however, is that gay rights are better off in the hands of a Democratic Congress and White House than a GOP one, and so do most gays who aren't wealthy. Ideally, gay rights shouldn't be a left-right issue. The left has traditionally been quite hostile to gay people, and gay marriage is very much a conservative value. However, as long as the GOP owes so much to religious extremists, it cannot be trusted with the civil rights of gay Americans. Gay voters have virtually no choice but to hold their noses and vote Democrat in 2008 -- even if it is Hillary. Hillary is far from perfect, but she'd be more reliable on this issue than any GOP candidate.",

Poor thing :( ... you might actually find yourself in a situation where someone is sharing their faith if proselytizing is allowed. How awful. How dare those religious people actually have the audacity to TELL you something they're excited about and something that means something to them, huh?\n\n \n Not on my doorstep they don't dare. I dispatch them with alacrity. But the issue isn't just them preaching on soapboxes. It's them subverting the Constitution in order to privilege their religion.\n \n \nAnyone who has 'discomfort' with proselytizing has issues. And you shouldn't conflate proselytizing with \"forcing their religion on others\". Those are very rarely ever the same thing, and certainly you don't seem to limit your intolerance toward just those few cases where it is 'forced'. This 'discomfort with proselytizing' canard is just way to sugarcoat intolerance toward religion. \n\n \n Fine. I do have a low tolerance for pushy religious zealots. So sue me. It's a free country, and they don't have a right to be free from criticism of their zealotry, especially when they demand it be written into law.\n \n \nYou mean like sharing their faith (proselytizing)? Oh, wait ... that alone doesn't infringe on people. Hmm...\n\n \n Sharing their condemnation of gay people is the issue. You are surprised I'd have a problem with that? Why am I not surprised you would be?\n \n \nThe 1st amendment doesn't mean people can't vote based on what they feel is important. (even if it's religious values.) It also doesn't mean that lawmakers and elected officials can't make descisions based on what they feel is important. (even if it's religious values.) EVERYONE makes decisions based on their values--that's the only way people can possibly operate. Whether it's religion that helps lead one to support Roe v. Wade, or religion that helps lead one to oppose it, the 1st Amendment never meant that we shouldn't be able to do that. That is NOT the same as letting one's religion infringe on the rights of other people.\n\n \n What disingenuous prattle. What you want is other people to be compelled to follow your religious beliefs. Your religion condemns homosexuality, so you believe your government should, too. You can vote according to your religious belief, but that doesn't mean you are constitutionally allowed to restrict rights the way you would like to. The Constitution exists to protect minorities against tyrannies of sanctimonious majorities. If you don't understand that, you know nothing of US history.\n \n When some religious nincompoop in government forces their belief on me, you bet your patootie it's a constitutional issue. They are free to believe whatever nonsense they want to, but they aren't permitted to use government to force anyone else to kowtow to their bible worship. The sooner you folk realise the Constitution does limit your ability to make others abide by your religious beliefs, say in the context of gay marriage, the sooner we can throw off the yoke of religious prejudice.\n \n You are free to practice your religion. It condemns gays, fine. Don't be gay. It's your problem, not that I think you have a problem not being gay, which is why you can be so smug in dismissing gay rights. You insist on making it ours, and that isn't reasonable. That's why you are on the other side. You can't abide equality.",

Basically, your logic so far means that if someone does it for religious reasons it's bad, but hey, if they don't like gay marriage and want it stopped for purely non-religious reasons, no problem!\n\n \n Well, I presume you've heard of the Lemon Test imposed by the Supreme Court to judge the constitutionality of legislation. Or maybe you haven't. I'll assume you aren't familiar with it, and link:\n Lemon test\n The first of these tests is a three-part assessment sometimes referred to as the Lemon test. The test derives its name from the 1971 decision Lemon v. Kurtzman, in which the Court struck down a state program providing aid to religious elementary and secondary schools. Using the Lemon test, a court must first determine whether the law or government action in question has a bona fide secular purpose. This prong is based on the idea that government should only concern itself in civil matters, leaving religion to the conscience of the individual. Second, a court would ask whether the state action has the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion. Finally, the court would consider whether the action excessively entangles religion and government. While religion and government must interact at some points while co-existing in society, the concern here is that they do not so overlap and intertwine that people have difficulty differentiating between the two.\n Now, reasonable people can reasonably disagree about the application of the Lemon Test, the point is to prevent people from imposing religious tyranny on those who do not wish to accept it. So if you argue that because your religion prohibits gay marriage, the secular state should not allow it, you are inflicting the tyranny of religion on those who would not accept it. Show us a secular reason not infected with religious bias.\n \n I am surprised you seem unfamiliar with this basic element of American jurisprudence.\n \n \nThat's the problem with your logic: just stick a Religious\u0099 in front of it and it becomes bad; but take it away, it's just fine.\n\n \n I will admit I do think religion is a very bad idea, but what I am really talking about here is constitutional protections. My low opinion of your religion is irrelevant to the constitutional question.\n \n \nThat's why your interpretation of the 1st amendment is so twisted.\n\n \n Actually, it's conservative and mainstream. Your religion has no place in government, or vice versa. Your refusal to deal with it is odd. But I really rest my case on the 14th Amendment.\n \n \n You have this idea that it means people can't let their views influence what they think is best for the country (if their views have the big R), and that's just ridiculous. You don't get to trump and decide who or what I vote for (or anyone else). Get that straight right now. That's the sort of tyranny that this country was founded to get away from.\n\n \n The sort of tyranny we are trying to avoid is the sort your reasoning, if I may be permitted to stretch the meaning of the word, would impose. You want to decide the civil rights of gay people, based on your religious prejudices. It's past time you learned this simply isn't acceptable under the Constitution. You might as well try to ban Catholic marriage, or Jewish marriage, because they aren't your co-religionists. In fact, religious bigots agree with me, which is why they have been desperately trying to write bigotry into the Constitution with a ban on equal protections for gay married couples.\n \n If they felt the Constitution permitted carving out special discrimination against gay people, they wouldn't be so keen to amend it. You can vote for bigotry and discrimination, but that doesn't mean I can't appeal to the Constitution to stop you in your tracks. That's what the 14th Amendment guarantees: your religious prejudice cannot negate my human rights. And that, of course, is why religious bigots want to amend it, to write in an \"Except for homosexuals\" clause into it.\n \n And you wonder why I find this appalling?",

Then your whole argument would fall apart. That's why your logic here is so weak.\n \n \n \nWell, I presume you've heard of the Lemon Test\n\n \n Oh my. The 'Lemon test' is one of the most controversial cases ever, and there has been much discussion here of it, naturally so since it basically gave the first Amendment a whole new meaning it had never had before. It is one of the most unrealistic decisions in history and the fact it has been so difficult to apply only underscores that.\n \n A couple of other posters said it better than I probably could:\n \n \"But, this is worlds apart from saying that the Supreme Court determines \"what the law ought to be.\" The Supreme Court has engaged in this throughout history, and has received a great scolding for it. Dred Scott v. Sandford and Lochner v. New York are perfect examples of this.\n \n The court interpreted the First Amendment to have a new meaning in this case, it did not interpret it in its original meaning. That is why its decision was wrong.\n \n The First Amendment had never been interpreted before to require that a law have a \"legitimate secular purpose.\" That may sound nice, and it may even be a good idea. But that was not what the Constitution said in 1971. If we assume that the doctrine of incorporation was actually legitimate (I am not so certain), then why did the Court not simply apply against the states the same standard it applied against the Federal government rather than conjuring up some new \"legitimate secular purpose\" standard? (http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=258916&highlight=lemon+test#post258916)\n \n I often bring up the point that the Lemon test has often been eroded and sometimes not used. To say this is the defining standard is inaccurate and I'd go as far as to say the Lemon v. Kurtzman cause was incorrect in establishing the so called \"Lemon test\". (http://www.4forums.com/political/258812-post45.html)\n In essence, citing the Lemon vs. Kurtzman case is sort of like citing Roe v. Wade in arguing against the pro-life position. The case itself is the contention, so you're basically citing the problem in response to the problem. The Lemon vs. Kurtzman decision was a travesty in constitutional interpretation. It was wrong.\n \n \nNow, reasonable people can reasonably disagree about the application of the Lemon Test\n\n \n Well, yeah!! That's pretty much the bottom line.\n \n \nI am surprised you seem unfamiliar with this basic element of American jurisprudence.\n\n \n Rest assured, I am quite familiar with the sort of one-sided bad logic you are using with the 1st Amendment.\n \n \nYou want to decide the civil rights of gay people, based on your religious prejudices. It's past time you learned this simply isn't acceptable under the Constitution. You might as well try to ban Catholic marriage, or Jewish marriage\n\n \n Sweetie, I don't care one iota if you get marriage benefits or not. No one here is trying to \"ban\" your marriage. You can join in matrimony with your right big toe for all I care. But with your dogma that people can't vote their views, you might as well be taking away peoples' right to vote. Not only is your view that people can't vote their views wrong, it's impossible to enforce without taking away freedom. Please stay away from our constitution.",

It demonstrated nothing. It did not identify how many Arabic speakers had been discharged. That was my question based on your assertion. The data does not back up your claim. I did not skitter about pouring through the website as, frankly, it is your job, as the affirmative, to provide the data, not tell me to fetch a stick out of a wood pile. \n \n Regardless, their is nothing stopping those translators from going to work at the FBI or CIA where they would be in a position to stop the next 9-11. One is not likely to prevent the next 9-11 as a member of a fire team kicking in doors in Mahmudiyah. \n \n But do keep calling folks sweetie. Ye are impossible to dislike when ye can tell folks to go to hell in such a friendly manner.\n \n \n If you can't tell the difference between an Arab linguist and an Arabic linguist, you have a long way to go to understand the issue. Apparently you haven't figured out that firing Arabic linguists actually puts this country into danger, because it disables its ability to translate communications in Arabic between Arab terrorists.\n \n But I suppose that isn't really very important.\n \n If ye can't tell the difference between Arabic and other languages, ye have a long way to go to understand the issue. Anyone who adopts Arabic speech and mannerisms is generally referred to as an Arab. To be an Arab is not to come from a particular place or tribe. It is a cultural identity. It is not technically correct to refer to an Arabic Translator unless ye mean those who speak Arabic. An Arab translator may be able to translate Arabic, Farsii, Kurdish, Turkish, etc etc etc. Apparently ye are unaware that firing Farsi, Kurdish and Turkish speakers is as bad as firing Arabic speakers. \n \n Be careful when referring to the Arabic Language as some Muslims feel that the language is holy and should not be written or profaned by non-Muslims. \n \n Nice attempt to deflect the argument with a grammar snipe. Do ye really want me to turn into Conan the Grammarian? \n \n But let's not be disingenuous and pretend its bigotry doesn't put people into danger, simply because it is bigoted against gay people.\n \n Is the Army bigoted because it excludes the hideously overweight? I am going to go out on a limb and guess that their are far more fat homosexuals than Arabic speaking homosexuals. One of those fat asses could be the one to stop the next 9-11! Should we therefore end the bigoted physical training policies of the US Army to preserve our national security?",

   "That's not \"using religion\". What if said I was against it for NON-religious reasons? Then your whole argument would fall apart. That's why your logic here is so weak.\n\n \n Yes, but none of you anti-gay marriage typists have managed between the lot of you to come up with a non-religious reason. You just want the state to discriminate against gay people to satisfy your religious prejudices.\n \n \nOh my. The 'Lemon test' is one of the most controversial cases ever, and there has been much discussion here of it, naturally so since it basically gave the first Amendment a whole new meaning it had never had before. It is one of the most unrealistic decisions in history and the fact it has been so difficult to apply only underscores that.\n\n \n I am so not surprised you find the lemon test problematic, because it stands in the way of forcing people to obey your religious beliefs. Or at least act as if they do. It's a bulwark against religious tyranny, but I guess religious tyranny is fine, so long as it's your religion, and not someone else's. The founding fathers had your number OK.\n \n \n \nI often bring up the point that the Lemon test has often been eroded and sometimes not used.\n\n \n I am sure you you do, and are gleeful about those occasions. Still, it is a useful test, no matter how much you religious types rail against it. It protects us from you.\n \n \nThe Lemon vs. Kurtzman decision was a travesty in constitutional interpretation. It was wrong.\n\n \n It's a practical way of determining whether one party is trying to force their religion on another. No wonder you object to it so much! The Constitution is wonderful when it works for you and against those you oppose, but not so wonderful when it protects them from you. You're nothing more than a fair weather constitutionalist, only glad to abide the Constitution when judges render decisions you like.\n \n \nRest assured, I am quite familiar with the sort of one-sided bad logic you are using with the 1st Amendment.\n\n \n You are familiar with logic? I'd never have guessed from reading your posts.\n \n \nSweetie, I don't care one iota if you get marriage benefits or not.\n\n \n Yes, I know you don't. You are, after all, one of the obstacles in the way of equality.\n \n \nNo one here is trying to \"ban\" your marriage.\n\n \n Except you and a bunch of other people who object to equal rights for gays.\n \n \nYou can join in matrimony with your right big toe for all I care.\n\n \n If you didn't care, you wouldn't spend so much of your time and energy attacking equal rights.\n \n \nBut with your dogma that people can't vote their views, you might as well be taking away peoples' right to vote. Not only is your view that people can't vote their views wrong, it's impossible to enforce without taking away freedom. Please stay away from our constitution.\n\n \n You are the one wanting to strip gays of their freedom and rights under the Constitution, in accordance with your religious beliefs. The Constitution exists as it does precisely to stop folk like you from doing what you are doing.\n \n Kindly stay away from it till you can understand and respect it.",

Maybe so-and-so who was a soldier would have been the one to shoot the next Osama or something. We'll never know something like that. Look, I have no problem with anyone opposing DADT. I agree with you--it's a silly policy. But national security as a reason isn't necessary, and not very good reasoning, IMO. People all the time get bent out of shape all the time because Bush or others use the \"prevent-another-9/11\" argument for things. So it seems disingenuous for you to turn around and do the same thing. There is already ample reason to not have DADT; no need to pull out and play the 'prevent-another-9/11' card.

Now, maybe you feel that Lemon isn't the best standard for sorting out any entanglement of church and state, or maybe you feel it's inconsistently applied. Fine, make your argument, as that, unlike the morality of being gay, is something reasonable people can reasonably disagree about. However, it is a standard that allows courts to figure out whether a law is passed with the intent to make people adhere to some religious standard, such as a ban on gay marriage. Some such standard is needed. If you have a better one than Lemon, trot it out and let's take a look.\n \n Neither you nor James, despite several appeals from me, have managed between you to produce a non-religious reason to ban gay marriage, but you are certainly keen that gay marriage must be banned, and you, if not your buddy James who has not made any arguments at all, have only made religious arguments in support of this view.\n \n If you want to make a non-religious argument, I am all ears, but I warn you, I've heard every anti-gay argument under the sun, and none of them have the water carrying capacity of a sieve.\n \n It's not disagreement I object to.

   "And I have told you, more than once now, that I have no interest whatsoever in 'banning' your marriage. My stance is that I think the govt needs to get out of the marriage business altogether.\n\n \n And I've pointed the reasons why govt. has traditionally been in the marriage business in the first place, necessitating some identical civil institution to replace it, only for some reason (that completely escapes me) it couldn't be called marriage. \n \n \nBesides, no one is preventing you from marrying someone. It won't be recognized, but that's not the same as \"banning\" you.\n\n \n Well, you're back to being disingenuous here. Fine, so we aren't talking about banning marriage outright, just the legal recognition of it. Pretty much comes to the same thing as far as the law is concerned, and the distinction is of no importance. The issues are family security, justice and equality. If marriage didn't exist for anyone, as you seem to be advocating for reasons that you haven't specified, then obviously gays wouldn't have a case. \n \n However, the issue under discussion is, given the fact that the civil institution of marriage exists and is separate from any religious notions, how should gay married couples be treated legally compared to straight ones? In one breath you claim to be in favour of equal treatment, and in the next you baulk at the simplest and most effective way of getting it, namely legal recognition of gays who are married.\n \n Obviously gays have already achieved, after a considerable struggle, the right to live and love together, and this is a marriage in everything but the legal recognition. However, it's a bit of a cop-out to change the subject and say you think there should be no legal recognition of marriage when that is simply not an option that's on the table. No-one is about to abolish the institution of civil marriage, because it's too helpful to families and society in general, and certainly it would be a lousy way to bring about equality for gay people. \n \n And if it's just about the word, why can't churches change theirs? It's not as though they hold the copyright or trademark. The state is perfectly entitled to call a civil marriage a marriage -- lord knows, it's been regulating them since long before the Christian church started getting into the act. It doesn't really matter what the name of the civil marriage is, of course, but I'm curious why you think the state shouldn't call it a marriage.\n \n \nAnd your demand for a non-religious reason is an invalid demand to begin with. \n\n \n It is not an invalid demand, it's a constitutional one, no matter how much you try to deny it. Your religious doctrines should not be imposed on others in the guise of civil law. This is the meaning of the separation of church and state. If you want to ban legal recognition of gay marriage for religious reasons, then that is imposition of your religious doctrines on people who do not accept them. This is why the 1st Amendment was written. In banning legal recognition of gay marriage, there is no secular purpose to the law: it exists solely to uphold a religious belief that a gay person, or gay sex, is wrong, immoral or sinful.\n \n However, I do not rest my case against the DOMA laws on the 1st Amendment. What really makes them unconstitutional -- and even the religious zealots who passed them are worried that we are right about this -- is the 14th Amendment. Laws banning legal recognition of gay marriage are a transparent effort to single out gay people and, in the language of Romer v. Evans, make them strangers to the law. Let me quote a couple of sections from the decision, in which the court applied strict scrutiny to Colorado's Amendment 2, which banned all anti-discrimination laws in the state that applied to gay citizens:\n The primary rationale the State offers for Amendment 2 is respect for other citizens' freedom of association, and in [ ROMER v. EVANS, ___ U.S. ___ (1996) , 13] particular the liberties of landlords or employers who have personal or religious objections to homosexuality. Colorado also cites its interest in conserving resources to fight discrimination against other groups. The breadth of the Amendment is so far removed from these particular justifications that we find it impossible to credit them. We cannot say that Amendment 2 is directed to any identifiable legitimate purpose or discrete objective. It is a status-based enactment divorced from any factual context from which we could discern a relationship to legitimate state interests; it is a classification of persons undertaken for its own sake, something the Equal Protection Clause does not permit. \"[C]lass legislation . . . [is] obnoxious to the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment . . . .\" Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S., at 24.\n \n We must conclude that Amendment 2 classifies homosexuals not to further a proper legislative end but to make them unequal to everyone else. This Colorado cannot do. A State cannot so deem a class of persons a stranger to its laws. Amendment 2 violates the Equal Protection Clause, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Colorado is affirmed. \n Now, irrespective of any opinions about the worth or principle of anti-discrimination laws, it seems to me that the intent of the various state and federal DOMA laws are pretty much the same as Colorado's notorious Amendment 2. Consequently, the same arguments apply. These laws, and many of them are pretty malicious, are not intended to protect the \"sanctity\" of anyone's marriage, let alone the institution, which is not the state's business, anyway, but the churches'. They are intended to take a swipe at gay families, and as I am sure you are aware, many of them are so sweeping they prevent any legal institution of anything remotely resembling a right or benefit of marriage. They consequently even harm the interests of unmarried straight couples! Talk about shooting one's self in the foot.\n \n \nNo one has to give you a reason at all. On the other hand, you're the one wanting to change things. The onus is (and has been on you) all along to give the reasons.\n\n \n Then don't pretend to me you are interested in debate, if all you really care to make is unsupported assertions and dodge your onus of presenting your case. Besides, you've already given your reasons in various other posts: your religious beliefs. And I've already presented the many non-religious reasons for recognising gay marriage. It's fair and just, and fulfills the promise of equal protections given by the Constitution. It's good for gay families, because it gives them legal and financial protections that are otherwise expensive to get through a variety of legal contracts, wills, powers of attorney, adoptions, etc., etc., and frequently difficult or expensive to enforce anyway against the interests and greed of blood relatives. It's good for society because it gives support and stability to gay families. Healthy and stable families make for a healthy and stable society.\n \n And lastly, this change is not a big one, at least not to anyone who genuinely has the interests of gay people at heart. Who is harmed by it? And the honest answer is: no-one at all. However, lots of families gain.\n \n I've given you the arguments one more time. Please do not waste my time by pretending yet again that I haven't.",

   "By Stephen Benjamin (in this morning's NY Times)\n \nIMAGINE for a moment an American soldier deep in the Iraqi desert. His unit is about to head out when he receives a cable detailing an insurgent ambush right in his convoy's path. With this information, he and his soldiers are now prepared for the danger that lies ahead.\n \n Reports like these are regularly sent from military translators' desks, providing critical, often life-saving intelligence to troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. But the military has a desperate shortage of linguists trained to translate such invaluable information and convey it to the war zone.\n \n The lack of qualified translators has been a pressing issue for some time - the Army had filled only half its authorized positions for Arabic translators in 2001. Cables went untranslated on Sept. 10 that might have prevented the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. Today, the American Embassy in Baghdad has nearly 1,000 personnel, but only a handful of fluent Arabic speakers.\n \n I was an Arabic translator. After joining the Navy in 2003, I attended the Defense Language Institute, graduated in the top 10 percent of my class and then spent two years giving our troops the critical translation services they desperately needed. I was ready to serve in Iraq.\n \n But I never got to. In March, I was ousted from the Navy under the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, which mandates dismissal if a service member is found to be gay.\n \n My story begins almost a year ago when my roommate, who is also gay, was deployed to Falluja. We communicated the only way we could: using the military's instant-messaging system on monitored government computers. These electronic conversations are lifelines, keeping soldiers sane while mortars land meters away.\n \n Then, last October the annual inspection of my base, Fort Gordon, Ga., included a perusal of the government computer chat system; inspectors identified 70 service members whose use violated policy. The range of violations was broad: people were flagged for everything from profanity to outright discussions of explicit sexual activity. Among those charged were my former roommate and me. Our messages had included references to our social lives - comments that were otherwise unremarkable, except that they indicated we were both gay.\n \n I could have written a statement denying that I was homosexual, but lying did not seem like the right thing to do. My roommate made the same decision, though he was allowed to remain in Iraq until the scheduled end of his tour.\n \n The result was the termination of our careers, and the loss to the military of two more Arabic translators. The 68 other - heterosexual - service members remained on active duty, despite many having committed violations far more egregious than ours; the Pentagon apparently doesn't consider hate speech, derogatory comments about women or sexual misconduct grounds for dismissal.\n \n My supervisors did not want to lose me. Most of my peers knew I was gay, and that didn't bother them. I was always accepted as a member of the team. And my experience was not anomalous: polls of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan show an overwhelming majority are comfortable with gays. Many were aware of at least one gay person in their unit and had no problem with it.\n \n \"Don't ask, don't tell\" does nothing but deprive the military of talent it needs and invade the privacy of gay service members just trying to do their jobs and live their lives. Political and military leaders who support the current law may believe that homosexual soldiers threaten unit cohesion and military readiness, but the real damage is caused by denying enlistment to patriotic Americans and wrenching qualified individuals out of effective military units. This does not serve the military or the nation well.\n \n Consider: more than 58 Arabic linguists have been kicked out since \"don't ask, don't tell\" was instituted. How much valuable intelligence could those men and women be providing today to troops in harm's way?\n \n In addition to those translators, 11,000 other service members have been ousted since the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy was passed by Congress in 1993. Many held critical jobs in intelligence, medicine and counterterrorism. An untold number of closeted gay military members don't re-enlist because of the pressure the law puts on them. This is the real cost of the ban - and, with our military so overcommitted and undermanned, it's too high to pay.\n \n In response to difficult recruiting prospects, the Army has already taken a number of steps, lengthening soldiers' deployments to 15 months from 12, enlisting felons and extending the age limit to 42. Why then won't Congress pass a bill like the Military Readiness Enhancement Act, which would repeal \"don't ask, don't tell\"? The bipartisan bill, by some analysts' estimates, could add more than 41,000 soldiers - all gay, of course.\n \n As the friends I once served with head off to 15-month deployments, I regret I'm not there to lessen their burden and to serve my country. I'm trained to fight, I speak Arabic and I'm willing to serve. No recruiter needs to make a persuasive argument to sign me up. I'm ready, and I'm waiting.\n \n Stephen Benjamin is a former petty officer second class in the Navy. \n http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/08/opinion/08benjamin.html?_r=1&oref=slogin",

   "And I've pointed the reasons why govt. has traditionally been in the marriage business in the first place, necessitating some identical civil institution to replace it, only for some reason (that completely escapes me) it couldn't be called marriage. \n\n \n Doesn't make them good reasons. The U.S. govt. didn't have all these benefits in place originally; they were added and added over time. Getting govt out of marriage would get us back to the way things were more intended to be. The founding fathers didn't want govt. into every detail of peoples' lives. You harp about church and state a lot here, but you don't seem to have any problem with the govt. sanctioning churches' ceremonies and clergy's signatures--after all, that's what happening with the govt. having it's hand in marriage and recognizing it as criteria for benefits. Well, at least you seem to have no problem with it as long as it has 'gay' attached as well.\n \n \nWell, you're back to being disingenuous here. Fine, so we aren't talking about banning marriage outright, just the legal recognition of it. Pretty much comes to the same thing as far as the law is concerned, and the distinction is of no importance. The issues are family security, justice and equality. If marriage didn't exist for anyone, as you seem to be advocating for reasons that you haven't specified, then obviously gays wouldn't have a case.\n\n \n Marriage is always going to exist, in terms of people uniting in commitment with each other religiously or at least culturally. It is something that goes on independently of the state--all the state does is recognize unions, and use it for criteria. A license isn't the marriage--the commitment is the marriage. My view isn't that marriage shouldn't exist, but that the state should find some other (more equitable) way to use for criteria than a religious/cultural ceremony. If you're being \"banned\" from anything, it's the benefits the govt. gives. You aren't being banned from getting married. You say that's an unimportant distinction, but it most certainly is important because the debate over these issues requires getting the terminology and issues right--propaganda doesn't get to the real heart of the issues.\n \n \nHowever, the issue under discussion is, given the fact that the civil institution of marriage exists and is separate from any religious notions\n\n \n All the \"civil institution of marriage\" really is, is just the govt. recognizing peoples' commitments to each other. There's no magic or spiritual thing afoot there. It's a piece of paper that signifies the govt. recognizes what's happened in the religious/cultural arena and gives benefits for it. That's why it's a poor standard for criteria. It's a.) a breach of church and state, and b.) it's the state basing it's criteria on rather subjective cultural notions. What you refer to as \"civil marriage\" is really just the govt. recognizing a ceremony (whether in a church or a courthouse). That's ALL it is. \n \n \nIn one breath you claim to be in favour of equal treatment, and in the next you baulk at the simplest and most effective way of getting it, namely legal recognition of gays who are married.\n\n \n Actually, I'm more in favor of equal treatment than you are, because you just want the recognition of gays added to an already inequitable (by default) process, making it a little less inequitable perhaps, but certainly not fixing the real problem. The gay marriage issue is just one facet of a larger issue. \n \n \nObviously gays have already achieved, after a considerable struggle, the right to live and love together, and this is a marriage in everything but the legal recognition. However, it's a bit of a cop-out to change the subject and say you think there should be no legal recognition of marriage when that is simply not an option that's on the table.\n\n \n At one time, ending sodomy laws was \"not an option on the table\" either. Neither was it an option for black people to vote. Something not being an option at the time is a very, very poor reason to not believe a certain way.\n \n \nAnd if it's just about the word, why can't churches change theirs? It's not as though they hold the copyright or trademark.\n\n \n Because, quite simply, they hold the cultural advantage. I don't see the point of churches and culture (remember not all marriages are religious ceremonies) changing their terminology to fit the government; if anything it should be the other way around if it's going to happen. After all, it is a government by the people and for the people, not a people by the government and for the government.\n \n \nThe state is perfectly entitled to call a civil marriage a marriage -- lord knows, it's been regulating them since long before the Christian church started getting into the act.\n\n \n I seriously doubt that government was giving benefits to couples before people started being couples. No, cultural marriage certainly came first. It's the only logical possibility. Men and woman (and maybe gays too) have probably been getting together in some form before the dawn of what we even consider governments.\n \n \nYour religious doctrines should not be imposed on others in the guise of civil law.\n\n \n There is a big difference between people supporting a law or candidates because of their beliefs, and imposing beliefs. Imposing a religious belief means you would be saying \"hey, you have to agree to this belief.\" When the RCC made everyone agree to certain doctrines or face the inquisition, THAT was imposing doctrine. That's not what's happening here. No one is saying you have to be Catholic or hold to any given doctrines. What we're talking about is people voting and supporting things based on their beliefs, and if you believe in democracy in any decent form, you HAVE to support people having the right to do that. Telling them otherwise is to tell them 'sorry, you can't vote based on your conscience.\" You like to use the term \"tyranny\"; well THAT would be tyranny.\n \n However, I do not rest my case against the DOMA laws on the 1st Amendment. What really makes them unconstitutional -- and even the religious zealots who passed them are worried that we are right about this -- is the 14th Amendment. [/quote]\n \n I don't support DOMA laws, or any law to define govt.'s role in marriage. It's wrong. The govt. having it's hand in marriage to begin with is a violation of the 14th Amendment.\n \n \nThen don't pretend to me you are interested in debate, if all you really care to make is unsupported assertions and dodge your onus of presenting your case.\n\n \n Why should I accept an onus that's not mine to accept? You're the one wanting change from the status quo in-acted--this is the reality of the situation. If you want change, you should show and give your reasons, rather than expect everyone else to prove a negative. ('why should it not be this way'). Your position has to be argued and presented to begin with. Now, no doubt you don't like having to prove your case, but you can't just snap your fingers and have society change to your whim. You're going to have to convince people. Welcome to society. \n \n It's a reckless game to say \"I have yet to see a good reason\" to not do so-and-so, because that's ultimately your opinion (even if it falls under the auspices of constitutional interpretation). People can just as easily turn right around to you and say \"I have yet to see a good reason for gay marriage.\" It's all opinion.\n \n \nAnd lastly, this change is not a big one, at least not to anyone who genuinely has the interests of gay people at heart. Who is harmed by it? And the honest answer is: no-one at all. However, lots of families gain.\n\n \n I just think all this does is puts a band-aid on one part of the much larger issue. Marriage recognition by the govt. is never going to be truly equitable--by default it favors certain people--married people. \n \n \n \n \nI've given you the arguments one more time. Please do not waste my time by pretending yet again that I haven't.\n",

   "Doesn't make them good reasons.\n\n \n It's not as though you've spent an iota of your extremely valuable time proving they aren't. After all, your religion is sufficient to justify prejudice against gay people.\n \n \nThe U.S. govt. didn't have all these benefits in place originally; they were added and added over time.

Well, at least you seem to have no problem with it as long as it has 'gay' attached as well.\n\n \n You know, dear, this is just a convenience. I have no problem with excluding clergymen from the marriage process, but since most people find it convenient, I see no reason to make a fuss about it. I don't care whom people choose to officiate at their weddings: clergymen, judges, town clerks or Kermit the Frog. What I care about is that government treat marriages equally under the law.\n \n The founding fathers didn't prohibit civil marriage, for the very good reason that it has always been regulated by the state. I see no reason to change it, and you certainly haven't managed to provide one.\n \n \nMy view isn't that marriage shouldn't exist, but that the state should find some other (more equitable) way to use for criteria than a religious/cultural ceremony.\n\n \n Civil marriage isn't a religious ceremony. It's a legal contract. That's the only issue here.\n \n \nIf you're being \"banned\" from anything, it's the benefits the govt. gives. You aren't being banned from getting married. You say that's an unimportant distinction, but it most certainly is important because the debate over these issues requires getting the terminology and issues right--propaganda doesn't get to the real heart of the issues.\n\n \n Not just benefits. Protections. Equal protections. Not that this is something you care to acknowledge.\n \n \nAll the \"civil institution of marriage\" really is, is just the govt. recognizing peoples' commitments to each other. There's no magic or spiritual thing afoot there. It's a piece of paper that signifies the govt. recognizes what's happened in the religious/cultural arena and gives benefits for it.

What you refer to as \"civil marriage\" is really just the govt. recognizing a ceremony (whether in a church or a courthouse). That's ALL it is. \n\n \n Ridiculous. Civil marriage is not a breach of church and state. You really think only religious believers get married? What a crock! You folk don't own marriage, mate. Marriage is a civil ceremony and has traditionally been governed by civil laws. Kindly keep your church out of it. Or at least, don't allow your religion to intrude on civil traditions.\n \n \nActually, I'm more in favor of equal treatment than you are, because you just want the recognition of gays added to an already inequitable (by default) process, making it a little less inequitable perhaps, but certainly not fixing the real problem. The gay marriage issue is just one facet of a larger issue. \n\n \n The only thing inequitable about marriage is the exclusion of gay married couples. But then, I guess you aren't too troubled by this inequity.\n \n \n \nI don't see the point of churches and culture (remember not all marriages are religious ceremonies) changing their terminology to fit the government; if anything it should be the other way around if it's going to happen. After all, it is a government by the people and for the people, not a people by the government and for the government.\n\n \n I don't care whether the churches change their terminology or not. I do care they don't foist their religious superstitions on the secular state.\n \n \nNo, cultural marriage certainly came first. It's the only logical possibility. Men and woman (and maybe gays too) have probably been getting together in some form before the dawn of what we even consider governments.\n\n \n Yes, marriage is indeed an ancient institution, far older than your Christian religion. All the more reason that Christian animus against gays shouldn't be allowed to keep gays away from marriage.\n \n \nThere is a big difference between people supporting a law or candidates because of their beliefs, and imposing beliefs. Imposing a religious belief means you would be saying \"hey, you have to agree to this belief.\" When the RCC made everyone agree to certain doctrines or face the inquisition, THAT was imposing doctrine.

Telling them otherwise is to tell them 'sorry, you can't vote based on your conscience.\" You like to use the term \"tyranny\"; well THAT would be tyranny.\n\n \n What you seem to be claiming is that because gay people can't be married in your church, and I can't imagine why any of us would want to set foot in it, they also can't be married under civil law. That is what's objectionable, though obviously you can't understand why it would be.\n \n \nI don't support DOMA laws, or any law to define govt.'s role in marriage. It's wrong. The govt. having it's hand in marriage to begin with is a violation of the 14th Amendment.\n\n \n Once again, you are being disingenuous. Single people aren't married, and need no special rights. Married people are a different issue, and they do benefit from civil protections of their special relationship. Gay married couples are no different in that respect from straight ones, but I've lost hope you'll ever appreciate that.\n \n Marriage laws are no violation of the 14th Amendment, and I have absolutely no idea why this silly notion should have entered your head.\n \n \nI just think all this does is puts a band-aid on one part of the much larger issue. Marriage recognition by the govt. is never going to be truly equitable--by default it favors certain people--married people.\n\n \n Equitable to whom? You're changing the subject. A married couple is not the same as two unrelated single people. That's why there are special laws to deal with married people. They have different needs. However, married straight and gay people have identical needs.\n \n Fine. You want to argue against marriage, make your case to the public. They'll laugh you out of court because your idea is nonsense. But you are making this case only because gay people demand equal rights. If they hadn't done that, you would never have adopted this bogus position of being against marriage, period. If gays vanished off the face of the earth, so would your new-found opposition to marriage laws. :xbanghead",

   "Who the heck are you referring to with \"you folk\"?\n\n \n Religious people like you who object to practical proposals for gay equality in marriage. *shrug* Who else? \n \n \nI think you're having trouble following this thread.\n\n \n I think you are having trouble trying to change the subject from gay equality under existing law, to a total ban on civil marriage to avoid the issue of gay equality.\n \n \nI just reminded YOU that people have marriages that are just cultural and not religious. You're the one conflating marriage in culture with what the govt. does. Two different things: one is marriage, the other is recognition of it.\n\n \n My dear, you didn't have to \"remind\" me of anything. I am perfectly well aware that marriage is a cultural institution. I am the one who is talking about civil marriage, which is run by our secular government. You are the one who wants to ban civil marriage for gay people, for religious reasons. I wish you would sort your confusion out, but I think you are trying to sow confusion to avoid dealing with the issue of gay equality.\n \n Sorry, but as long as marriage is a legally enforceable contract and not just a friendly, private agreement between two people, or a religious rite, the state is going to be involved, and should be involved. This isn't going to change, so it's still a matter of treating gay people equally under the law.\n \n \nIt's fascinating that suddenly you don't have a problem with church and state being intermingled here, because with the govt. sanctioning religious marriage, they indeed ARE intermingled. I can't imagine why you don't understand that. The state essentially gives clergy the power to sign a marriage. certificate. \n \n \n So what? It gives it to ships' captains and mayors, too. It is the state that issues licenses to marry people. Not some pope or other religious panjandrum. The state doesn't recognise any religious ceremony, however. It merely licenses priests and pastors to sign state marriage certificates, in addition to certain civic functionaries. It could license whomever it pleased. This isn't an entanglement of church and state as you seem mind-bogglingly to imagine. It's just a convenience for most citizens who want to get married in a church.\n \n You are really very confused about the legal issues involved here.\n \n \nHate to tell you this, pal, but that train has loooong left the station. Churches are already a part of civil marriage because the govt. recognizes religious marriage, and has been for a very long time.\n\n \n I hate to tell you this buddy, but THE STATE DOES NOT RECOGNIZE RELIGIOUS MARRIAGE. If it recognised religious marriage, it would recognise the religious marriages of gay couples in the Metropolitan Community Church, the Unitarian Universalists, or the Congregationalists. It would even recognise polygamy under Islam or LDS. It recognises ONLY state-sanctioned marriages, and licenses preachers to sign certificates as a convenience to believers -- which I magnanimously don't really have a problem with. That's what you apparently don't realize. \n \n \nAnd it's why I favor the govt getting out of marriage and finding another way to provide benefits. It's absolutely bizarre to me that you portray yourself as such a champion of separate of church and state and apparently have no problem with that.\n\n \n If anyone MUST get out of the marriage business, I'd rather your churches got out of it and left it to the civil authorities. After all, they're the ones who have to enforce the laws.\n \n \nIt's the only inequity you're concerned with, indeed.\n\n \n Indeed.\n \n \nYou just said (and I quote) \"why can't churches change theirs? [the word]\" You apparently DO care, or you wouldn't have asked that question.\n\n \n I don't care what churches call it. You are the one with a buzzing bee in your bonnet about gay people using the \"marriage\" word officially on civil marriage certificates. And you didn't answer the perfectly legitimate question of why you think your church owns civil \"marriage\" so that gay people shouldn't get civil \"marriage\" certificates? It's not as though we are all asking the blessing of your church, or feel we aren't married without it. We are discussing the civil institution of marriage.\n \n \nI don't think you're following me.\n\n \n It's pretty hard to follow a logical pretzel.\n \n \nI said govt. doesn't need it's hand it marriage to begin with--and I'm saying the fact that church and state are intermingled when it comes to marriage is reason enough for that stance. You say you want separation of church and state, then support it for goodness' sake. Get govt. out of marriage. Let it give benefits equally to everyone (gays or whomever) rather than on the basis of marriage. Call it a civil union for everyone. I know your argument has been that we shouldn't go that route because you think it's less likely to happen, but that's a poor reason to have or abandon a view.\n\n \n Oh good grief. This is a change of subject from equal treatment under the law to the validity of civil marriage. OK. So you think couples should be treated as if they were single people? The state, you argue, has no interest in promoting secure, stable families? Well, you can argue that if you want, but I doubt you'll find many who'd agree with you. It just doesn't make any sense for the state to stay out of marriage. It would be more practical for churches to butt out of civil marriage.\n \n If they want to bless civilly married couples or whatever, that's their prerogative if they want. I've no objection. I don't even object if the state graciously allows them to roll two separate ceremonies into one. I do object when religious busybodies try to tell the state it can't treat its citizens equally because they have condemned them as 'sinners\".\n \n \nWhat if they want to just co-habitate? Not everyone wants to tie the knot, Lesz. \n \n \n So what? The argument isn't about forcing people to marry if they don't want to. it's about treating gay families equally with straight families, and not having separate standards for gay and straight families. Irrespective of religious prejudices. Why is this such a hard concept for you to grasp?\n \n \nFunny then, that the very thing I support (civil unions) is exactly what is happening in most cases for gays, in which states have tried to deal with this. Apparently it's not so laughable after all. The only difference is I think we should all be under the same system. But go ahead, keep going the way you are and get civil unions just for gays. You seem to favor that.\n\n \n Don't be silly. I don't favour civil unions for gays only -- that's daft. I favour civil marriage for families who want and need it. Equally. Without religious prejudice.\n \n I don't mind your priests and pastors being licensed to issue marriage certificates on behalf of the civil authorities responsible for marriage laws, but I do mind your religion dictating to the rest of us what is or isn't a civil marriage. However, if you insist on forcing that issue, I'd support banning churches from having anything further to do with civil marriage. But I'm easy either way. I'm for marriage, and for equality.",

   "I think you are having trouble trying to change the subject from gay equality under existing law, to a total ban on civil marriage\n\n \n That's because marriage, more generally, is the real issue. Gay marriage is merely one small facet of the broader issue.\n \n \nSorry, but as long as marriage is a legally enforceable contract and not just a friendly, private agreement between two people, or a religious rite, the state is going to be involved, and should be involved. This isn't going to change, so it's still a matter of treating gay people equally under the law.\n\n \n Citing the current situation doesn't make it any more equitable.\n \n \nSo what? It gives it to ships' captains and mayors, too.\n\n \n emoticon_xdonno Ok, that comment makes it obvious that the point has gone right over your head. You aren't getting it. Captains and mayors aren't part of a religious institution. You know, the thing that earlier you were going so far out of your way to berate in terms of being tied to the govt in any way? Clergy ARE religious. One would think you'd at least TRY to be consistent in your views on church and state, but I guess not.\n \n \nIt merely licenses priests and pastors to sign state marriage certificates,\n\n \n Yes, that's the point! But with your cafeteria-style approach to church and state, I guess you just don't care. Oh well, so much for consistency on your part.\n \n \nI hate to tell you this buddy, but THE STATE DOES NOT RECOGNIZE RELIGIOUS MARRIAGE. If it recognised religious marriage, it would recognise the religious marriages of gay couples in the Metropolitan Community Church, the Unitarian Universalists, or the Congregationalists\n\n \n It's non-recognition of gay couples has nothing to do with the religious issue. You're conflating two separate matters. It recognizes cultural/religious marriages ALL THE TIME, and it recognized mine. So, you're just wrong. No surprise. When a clergyperson (as an agent of the state) signs a marriage license, that IS the state recognizing my marriage (religious or otherwise). I can't imagine why this is so hard for you to grasp.\n \n \nIf anyone MUST get out of the marriage business, I'd rather your churches got out of it and left it to the civil authorities. After all, they're the ones who have to enforce the laws.\n\n \n I thought you just said you don't have a problem with clergy being able to sign licenses. Now you think churches should get out and just leave it to civil authorities. At this point, you're pretty much just flat out talking out both sides of your mouth. emoticon_xdonno I don't think you even know what you think. This is the second time you've contradicted yourself between one post to another.\n \n \nAnd you didn't answer the perfectly legitimate question of why you think your church owns civil \"marriage\"\n\n \n It's only a legitimate question if it is indeed what I think. I have never said my church \"owns civil marriage\". \n \n \nOK. So you think couples should be treated as if they were single people? The state, you argue, has no interest in promoting secure, stable families? \n\n \n Not with a system of inequality. \n \n \nWell, you can argue that if you want, but I doubt you'll find many who'd agree with you.\n\n \n A lot of people feel the way I do. I've seen numerous people argue this very same thing right here in these forums. The concept of putting everyone under civil unions and leaving marriage to the culture is a well-known concept that isn't without interest.\n \n \nSo what? The argument isn't about forcing people to marry if they don't want to. it's about treating gay families equally with straight families, and not having separate standards for gay and straight families. \n\n \n But thats just joining two groups into one (in terms of marriage); it does nothing to to address the rest of the inequality of civil marriage. Civil marriage is, by default, an inequitable concept. That's the problem with it.

However, if you insist on forcing that issue...\n\n \n Ok, let's get something straight here. I am NOT part of a religion that does that. Comprende? You keep saying things like \"you\" and \"your religion\" and \"you insist\" and inaccurate things like that. MY religion does not dictate anything to you. So, get off your high horse and take your invective to somewhere and someone who needs to hear it. I 've told you umpteen times my stance and it's NOT that. So you're just being intentionally disingenuous at this point, arguing a point toward me that's something I've repeatedly asserted to you that I don't hold to.

The concept of putting everyone under civil unions and leaving marriage to the culture is a well-known concept that isn't without interest.\n I think this is a fine idea. In colonial days in the Province of Quebec at least, this is the way it was done. The civil contract would be drawn up by a solicitor, establishing the dowry etc., and then later a religious ceremony would be held in the church. Those old records are still held in archives in Montreal, though many of them were abstracted in the first half of the 20th Century and can be researched at genealogical libraries, and possibly on-line now. For my former wife, I was able to identify close to 1000 grandparents, her being of Canadian French ancestry. I wasn't able to learn much about them, though. Many lived in the same parishes for generations. I think they farmed and breed. They had huge families. I guess that's how they stayed warm in the harsh Canadian winters!",

   "That's because marriage, more generally, is the real issue. Gay marriage is merely one small facet of the broader issue.\n\n \n Fine. So now that gay marriage is an issue, you have discovered you have an issue with the concept of marriage itself. Well, I'm not going to agree with you, but frankly, it's besides the point. The point is equality under the law. No amount of pontificating about how the state shouldn't support marriages is going to affect that. And I think you are way out on a limb arguing the state has no business in marriage. It's always been involved, for very good legal reasons.\n \n \nOk, that comment makes it obvious that the point has gone right over your head. You aren't getting it.\n\n \n Well, it is true your points are pretty obscure, and irrelevant to the central argument.\n \n \nCaptains and mayors aren't part of a religious institution.\n\n \n Neither are priests or pastors part of the civil institution. They are simply licensed by the state to officiate for the convenience of citizens. No-one cares about the religious institution from a legal perspective. That's the business of churches, not the law, and people can take it or leave it.\n \n \nClergy ARE religious. One would think you'd at least TRY to be consistent in your views on church and state, but I guess not.\n\n \n Of course clergy are religiou. They still can't marry anyone without a license from the state. They are acting as state functionaries, not merely as clerics, in this role. There is no church-state issue involved in this. Religious people are allowed to be functionaries of the state, after all!\n \n \nBut with your cafeteria-style approach to church and state, I guess you just don't care. Oh well, so much for consistency on your part.\n\n \n I leave cafeteria approaches to Christians who seem well versed in them. I strive for rationality, instead.\n \n \nIt's non-recognition of gay couples has nothing to do with the religious issue. You're conflating two separate matters. It recognizes cultural/religious marriages ALL THE TIME, and it recognized mine.\n\n \n Well, dear, it doesn't recognise the religious marriages of gay couples in other churches. So you're wrong about that.\n \n \nSo, you're just wrong. No surprise.\n\n \n No, you are, and indeed, I am not surprised. The state isn't recognising the religious nature of the marriage -- that's prohibited. It's licensing religious people to perform marriages. There's nothing wrong with that. The only marriages it recognises are those it licenses people to perform. It's not a mater of recognising a religious rite, but allowing religious people to perform a civil function. Perfectly OK with moi.\n \n \nWhen a clergyperson (as an agent of the state) signs a marriage license, that IS the state recognizing my marriage (religious or otherwise). I can't imagine why this is so hard for you to grasp.\n\n \n It's not hard for me at all. The clergyman is acting as a proxy for the state. The state is not approving of his religion. The relevant legal marriage is a civil one.\n \n Why is that so hard for you to grasp?\n \n \nI thought you just said you don't have a problem with clergy being able to sign licenses. Now you think churches should get out and just leave it to civil authorities.\n\n \n Sweetie, now you are just being disingenuous as usual. I don't have a problem with clergy acting as state functionaries. Fine by moi. I was merely saying that if you insist that the state licensing of clergy amounts to state endorsement of a religious definition of marriage, then I'd rather clergy weren't involved. If you you don't insist on this ludicrous interpretation, however, I really don't care what clergy do. \n \n The state defines civil mariage. Not your religion. Why is this so hard for you to understand? \n \n \nIt's only a legitimate question if it is indeed what I think. I have never said my church \"owns civil marriage\". \n\n \n Not in so many words, but you demand the state not recognise gay marriages because of your religious prejudices.\n \n \nA lot of people feel the way I do. I've seen numerous people argue this very same thing right here in these forums. The concept of putting everyone under civil unions and leaving marriage to the culture is a well-known concept that isn't without interest.\n\n \n So you have company in error. Not the first time, I'm sure.Just because a majority feels something doesn't make them right. And sorry, but government is as much a part of culture as any religion. I have no idea why you'd think it isn't. \n \n Letting everyone who chooses to marry under civil law and leaving Holy Matrimony to religion isn't without interest, either. Culture doesn't have to be religious, you know.\n \n \nBut thats just joining two groups into one (in terms of marriage); it does nothing to to address the rest of the inequality of civil marriage. Civil marriage is, by default, an inequitable concept. That's the problem with it. Adding gay marriage is just a band-aid to treat one part of a larger issue.\n\n \n What's inequitable about civil marriage? A married couple doesn't have the same legal needs and interests two unrelated, uninvolved single people do. Duh!\n \n \nOk, let's get something straight here. I am NOT part of a religion that does that. Comprende? You keep saying things like \"you\" and \"your religion\" and \"you insist\" and inaccurate things like that.

If all you want to do is play games here, go find yourself a playmate. I'm only interested in real discussion of the issues.\n\n \n Oh get off the high horse yourself. YOU are the one arguing against civil marriage for gay people, and the only reason you've ever stated for this opposition is your religion. It's NOT religious marriage we are discussing -- that's between you and whatever it is you think your deity is.\n \n Go pull the other one. The only issue that interests you here is your religion.

   "Unbridled growth of anti-gay sentiments has led to such tragedies as Jamie Nabozny's school experiences, a series of daily physical and verbal abuses including being urinated on, a mock rape, and kicking until he suffered internal bleeding. The abuse only ended when Nabozny moved away to Minneapolis at age 16. In 1997, Nabozny's federal lawsuit ended with a $1 million settlement for violation of the equal protection clause of the constitution (Rothman 1997). Even the Littleton and Paducah school shootings may have been partly provoked by pejorative taunts of homosexuality (Jones 2000).\n http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1259402 \nIf the experiences of the youth interviewed by Human Rights Watch are any measure, verbal harassment is very common in U.S. middle schools and high schools. Nearly every one of the 140 youth we interviewed described incidents of verbal or other nonphysical harassment in school because of their own or other students' perceived sexual orientation. For many lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth, relentless verbal abuse and other forms of harassment are \"all part of the normal daily routine,\" as Dylan N. notes. \n \n \"They used to call me all kinds of names-XXXXXX and stuff like that,\" said Jes\u00fas M., a bisexual seventeen-year-old, in a comment typical of those we heard. \"The worst thing about my first school was that they were screaming things to me in the hallways. Sometimes they would say these names in class.\" \"People called everyone `XXXXXX,'\" said Chance M., an eighteen-year-old senior in Massachusetts. \"That's like the word of the century. It turned into a routine.\"\"That's how you pick on someone, straight or gay. You call them a ###,\" said James L., a sophomore in the Los Angeles area. \"I hear it a lot of times during the course of the day, a lot, at the very least ten to twenty times a day.\" \"These guys, they'll stand in front of the lockers. They'll be, like, `Look at that XXXXXX.' You hear it every day,\" Tommy L. told us. \n \n Most of the other students we spoke with had similar experiences. Aaron G., a twenty-year-old college sophomore, told Human Rights Watch, \"I got a lot of harassment in high school. `####ing ###,' stuff like that.\" \"I had people harass me for liking girls,\" recounted Kimberly G., a nineteen-year-old who graduated from a Texas high school in 1999. \"I got a lot of that during my senior year. . . . It got to the point with me during the last three months before graduation, it probably happened every day.\" When Casey G.'s classmates at his North Carolina school discovered that he was gay, they harassed him daily. \"They'd come up to me and say, `I'll pray for you tonight.' Or just call me `XXXXXX,'\" he told us.\" The same thing happened to Dalia P. when her classmates learned shewas a lesbian during her sophomore year; \"people would be yelling `XXXX' down the hall,\" she said. And Erin B., an eighth grader in Georgia, told us about the verbal abuse one of her classmates receives. \"Taylor is the only openly gay male student at school,\" she said. \"He gets teased so badly every five seconds.\" \n http://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/uslgbt/toc.htm \nThe mother of a Missouri teen who pleaded guilty to an October 2005 school shooting says that her son's violent actions resulted from his being taunted by classmates for his \"unmanly\" appearance. \n \n Amanda Minks, who began speaking publicly about the incident late last week claimed that her 17-year-old son Joshua endured homophobic slurs from classmates at his Farmington, Missouri high school. \nhttp://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-2269.html \nThe following facts are compiled from recent releases of the National Mental Health Association (NMHA), including results of their own survey of teens' experiences of anti-gay teasing and bullying. The full survey is available on their web site at http://www.nmha.org/newsroom/system/news.vw.cfm?do=vw&rid=474 \n \n 78% of teens report that youth who are gay or thought to be gay are teased or bullied in their schools and communities. \n 93% of the teens hear youth use words like \"###,\" \"homo,\" \"XXXX,\" \"XXXXX,\" or \"gay\" at least once in a while, while 51% of them hear it every day. \n According to a l996 study by the Safe Schools Coalition, three of four youth targeted by anti-gay bullies are heterosexual. \n Gay youth suffer the worst consequences of anti-gay bullying: [*]One of three gay students is physically harassed due to his or her sexual orientation [*]One in six is beaten badly enough to require medical attention \n [*]They are four times more likely to be threatened with a weapon at school \n [*]They are two to three times more likely to attempt suicide \n [*]28% drop out of school because of harassment\nhttp://www.mhawestchester.org/mhaeducation/gaybullying.asp",

   "Do I have to go round this again?\n You are being dishonest right there in twisting my words. I never said it is dishonest to want government out of marriage.\n\n \n But that's my stance--to want govt. out of marriage. So when you say I'm being intellectually dishonest with that, then I have to assume that's what you think. Getting govt. out of marriage IS my stance in this. It's not anything else, no matter what your imagination comes up with.\n \n \nIt is dishonest to say you recognize a problem - the inequity between gay and straight with respect to marriage - and propose as a solution - having no government involvement in marriage - something that will never ever happen.\n \n \n Why the heck is that dishonest? emoticon_confused emoticon_confused I am not lying to you--it really is what I think.\n \n And you keep citing \"that will never happen\" as if the stance is automatically invalid because of that. It's not. It may never happen (for instance) that every state in the country has no crime. Doesn't mean we shouldn't oppose crime.\n \n \nThis way you have your cake and eat it, too. Pretend you are sensitive to the inequity\n\n \n If this were a matter of my feelings of \"sensitivity\", we wouldn't be having this discussion, because personally, I think gay relations are immoral. Plain and simple. The reason I support gays getting rights is because of the legal constitution and the way our Republic works, not because I agree morally with what gays do. It's not a matter of 'being sensitive' about anything--we are discussing merits of issues here, so frankly, what the heck difference to you whatsoever is it whether I or anyone else holds \"sensitivity\" to anything here? Just debate the merits. This is a DEBATE forum. Whether or not I have \"sensitivity\" here shouldn't be your concern.\n \n \nbut the only thing you are in favor of that might alleviate the inequity is something that can never happen.\n \n \n It's the only thing that can take care of every situation out there. Because gay marriage isn't the only issue, but rather part of a broader issue. The issue is MARRIAGE. \n \n \nI think your stance is \"not a good one for the country\", because you don't actually have a stance. Your stance is simply that you are against same-sex marriage.\n\n \n So basically you don't think I am for govt. being out of marriage altogether, even though I've told you numerous times now that's what I think would be best. Well, if you aren't even going to take what I say, then there's no point in continuing this debate. I might as well tell you that you really have no stance that gay marriage is the right thing for the country. Because that's the sort of thing you're doing to me here.\n \n \nThe ONLY reason you present is that same-sex marriage would change the definition of marriage.\n\n \n Again, motivations and sensitivities (even though you're wrong on that anyway) are beside the point. That's not your concern. You seem more interested in arguing motivations and reasons I might take a given stance more than the issues themselves. emoticon_confused \n \n \nAnd, as above, you do admit that it is wrong that gays cannot marry legally ... \n\n \n No, constitutionally I acknowledge they should get equal protections. That's not necessarily the same thing.\n \n \nbut your suggestion to right that wrong is an enormous change in the way our society addresses marriage that is essentially an impossibility, when a very small and simple fix would do.\n\n \n First. what's so enormous about it? A number of states are already instituting civil unions without finding such a problem of \"enormity\", so why is the possibility of doing on a national scale so beyond-possible? It's not. Second, you're basically appealing to size-of-the-solution here. That's not a value judgment at all on whether or not the problem is the most equitable solution; remember, at one time gay marriage itself was considered \"essentially an impossibility\". \n \n The problem with your fix (which you call \"very small\" and \"simple\") is that a.) it's not so simple at all because it would also require a lot of changes in legal paperwork and anywhere else that states \"men and woman\" or indicates gender of any kind, and b.) it only addresses ons single problem with marriage inequality (gays). \n \n But more importantly, the redefinition you speak of needs to be something the country wants to do. It doesn't need to be something the govt. imposes without the will of the democracy. This is not just any other issue like voting which has no relationship with a cultural version of it like marriage does.",

Doesn't mean we shouldn't oppose crime.\n \n If this were a matter of my feelings of \"sensitivity\", we wouldn't be having this discussion, because personally, I think gay relations are immoral. Plain and simple. The reason I support gays getting rights is because of the legal constitution and the way our Republic works, not because I agree morally with what gays do. It's not a matter of 'being sensitive' about anything--we are discussing merits of issues here, so frankly, what the heck difference to you whatsoever is it whether I or anyone else holds \"sensitivity\" to anything here? Just debate the merits. This is a DEBATE forum. Whether or not I have \"sensitivity\" here shouldn't be your concern.\n \n \n \n It's the only thing that can take care of every situation out there. Because gay marriage isn't the only issue, but rather part of a broader issue. The issue is MARRIAGE. \n \n \n \n So basically you don't think I am for govt. being out of marriage altogether, even though I've told you numerous times now that's what I think would be best. Well, if you aren't even going to take what I say, then there's no point in continuing this debate. I might as well tell you that you really have no stance that gay marriage is the right thing for the country. Because that's the sort of thing you're doing to me here.\n \n \n \n Again, motivations and sensitivities (even though you're wrong on that anyway) are beside the point. That's not your concern. You seem more interested in arguing motivations and reasons I might take a given stance more than the issues themselves. emoticon_confused \n \n \n \n No, constitutionally I acknowledge they should get equal protections. That's not necessarily the same thing.\n \n \n \n First. what's so enormous about it? A number of states are already instituting civil unions without finding such a problem of \"enormity\", so why is the possibility of doing on a national scale so beyond-possible? It's not. Second, you're basically appealing to size-of-the-solution here. That's not a value judgment at all on whether or not the problem is the most equitable solution; remember, at one time gay marriage itself was considered \"essentially an impossibility\". \n \n The problem with your fix (which you call \"very small\" and \"simple\") is that a.) it's not so simple at all because it would also require a lot of changes in legal paperwork and anywhere else that states \"men and woman\" or indicates gender of any kind, and b.) it only addresses ons single problem with marriage inequality (gays). \n \n But more importantly, the redefinition you speak of needs to be something the country wants to do. It doesn't need to be something the govt. imposes without the will of the democracy. This is not just any other issue like voting which has no relationship with a cultural version of it like marriage does.\n\n \n This obfuscation doesn't deserve a response.",

You claim you are \"puzzled at how folks believe they can change my mind by attacking my God and my person\". Well, let me say this.... I am puzzeled how folds believe they can change my mind by attacking my sexuality, by taking away jobs and many other opportunities, by gang-beating helpless lone gay men and leaving them to die, by snickering whenever to guys feel the impulse to hold hands, but ignoring and refusing to believe that MANY gays exist in the world. And so on and so on and so on and so on....\n \n This would be a moot subject if we had rights. Giving gays the opportunity to form stable relationships is a way to cut down on the STD rate.

Bollocks to that.\n\n \n \n I have verbally attacked several people in parking lots. They are usally shocked that anyone would question their beliefs. The word (and I can't asy it because it has been banned on this forum) usally stunns them. They mostly resond with it is just an opinion but my comeback that shuts them up is \"well that opinion is now the law that I have to live under and has made me a second class citizen. I can not believe that you hate me and my family that much\"",
