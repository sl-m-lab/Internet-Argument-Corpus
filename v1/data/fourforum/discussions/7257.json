   "Harem, Scare 'Em: Worrying About Polygamy\n By NAOMI SCHAEFER RILEY\n January 6, 2006; Page W13\n If marriage to a woman civilizes a man -- as some would have it -- it does not follow that the more women a man marries, the more civilized he becomes. It seems that the opposite is true. Still, the practice of polygamy is spreading world-wide, even in the U.S.\n \n In September, Holland registered its first civil union among three partners. A grander menage \u00e0 trois has established itself in Belgium (with three wives and 30 children), though without the government's imprimatur so far. Some conservatives, like the Weekly Standard's Stanley Kurtz, decry these developments as another step down the road to gay marriage, since one redefintion of marriage may lead to another. Perhaps so. They are indisputably another step down the road to polygamy.\n \n The idea, floated with ever greater frequency, is that polygamy is nothing objectionable; it is simply another option on our diverse menu of family types. A new HBO series called \"Big Love,\" debuting in March, will center on a man married to three women. \"It's everything that every family faces, just times three,\" co-creator Mark Olsen told Newsweek. \"The yuck factor disappears and you just see human faces.\"\n \n Mr. Olsen is articulating the progressive view of polygamy, trying to make it part of a liberationist project that began, if not with Brook Farm, then with the 1960s. According to this view, social conventions like monogamy inhibit free expression, not least in the sphere of erotic desire. Busting such conventions is thus a forward-looking task.\n \n But is it? Leaving aside the social habits of the Dutch -- always a good thing to do -- polygamy today is most popular in cultures that are relatively backward and impoverished. A couple of weeks ago, the Malaysian Parliament passed a law making it easier for men to have multiple wives. Last spring 1,000 Ugandans gathered to protest a bill that would ban polygamy; their government backed down. In Turkey, polygamy was banned 70 years ago but is now on the rise, according to an article in the Economist. Even some members of the nation's Parliament have decided to take second wives.\n \n In the poorer suburbs of Paris, polygamy is common, if illegal. Bernard Accoyer, the parliamentary leader of the Gaullist Party, blamed polygamy for the recent riots in Muslim neighborhoods. He was denounced for his supposedly racist views, but his theory has much to recommend it. Polygamy not only keeps families in poverty -- one man must provide for many wives and children -- but also creates a large population of young single men with little to do.\n \n The U.S. outlawed polygamy in 1862 -- our leaders at the time compared it to slavery. But we still have a population of polygamists who live in isolated communities throughout the western states, many of them part of the Fundamentalist Church of Latter-day Saints (not affiliated with the Mormon Church). They have not caused chaos in our major cities, but they are responsible for plenty of social havoc: physical abuse, incest, child-marriage, tax evasion, welfare fraud. They expel young men who are competing with leaders for wives, and they kidnap young women who try to escape. The local authorities have a policy of prosecuting such crimes rather than polygamy itself, assuming the crimes are reported at all.\n \n Supporters of polygamy believe that family arrangements per se are not to blame for these problems. Polygamous men, they argue, need not marry girls as young as 12. But it's a lot easier to get a girl to be part of a harem when she is young and easily threatened. Polygamous households, they say, don't need to defraud the government to live. But it's easier to support a lot of wives and children if the government helps. They say that unattached men don't have to become violent, but they are more likely to do so if they have almost no chance of finding a suitable mate.\n \n (More)",

   "The supporters of polygamy are out there, and they're eager to be heard. Principle Voices, a Salt Lake City-based pro-polygamy group, recently tried to crash a meeting of U.S. and Canadian authorities who had convened to discuss crimes associated with polygamy. \"It's a bit ironic,\" the group's executive director told AP, \"that they felt they knew better without anyone present from the [polygamy] community.\" Bryn Mawr Prof. Philip Kilbride wrote a book a few years ago called \"Plural Marriage for Our Times,\" arguing that polygamy was beneficial since it would provide more children with fathers than our monogamous (but divorce-ridden) culture does. Last January, Nadine Strossen, president of the ACLU told an audience of Yale students, \"We have defended the right for individuals to engage in polygamy. We defend the freedom of choice for mature, consenting individuals.\"\n \n Will the polygamy movement win the day? It is possible, but there may be recesses of aversion that even the most ardent advocacy cannot overcome. Jeanne Tripplehorn, who plays one of the three wives on \"Big Love,\" told Newsweek that she \"had a hard time [understanding] why a woman would share her husband.\" She's not alone.",

   "Polygamy, assuming it's one man with multiple women, makes a lot of sense if the population is skewed towards women: particularly likely in a war-torn area. In our society there is not such an inbalance, but then I doubt many people would be interested in polygamy: or at any rate many women.\n \n The arguments that it creates dangerous unattatched males is quite valid, although legislating on these grounds could end up condemning lesbians and celibate women: it has to be a practical argument rather than one of principle. As for the connection with social problems: these may well be cultural.\n \n Personally I think that I would find 'sharing' a wife with other men impossible, but that's me. There is also a sort of free love movement at the moment that encourages several long term partners. It's associated with bisexualism as well.. I can't remember what it's called.\n \n I think if this was allowed, then at the least it would require the first partners legal permission for the second marriage.",

None looked younger than 25 or so. Some were downright homely looking. (Not that that's bad.)\n \n The patiarch considered the interviewer rude when he got into the sex questions. I think they (avout polygamists) have a different mindset about it and it's not one continuous orgy like we would like to think. The wives seemed to all like the arrangement. Some of them didn't have to cook, some of them didn't have to clean house, some of them didn't have to raise the children, one of them acted as his 'official wife' when visitors were being entertained...all of them stood around a piano singing hymns.\n \n I too wonder about the young stallions and where their wives come from. Likely daughters of the rich, old, ugly bastards. The husband in the Mansion Family appeared in shadow so I couldn't tell if he was old or ugly, but either he or one or more of his wives is extremely rich. Knowing how male oriented that society is, I'd put money on his being the rich one.\n \n This was an atypical family, too. All the others had fewer wives, modest homes, drove Fords and apparently molested their own daughters. So the young stallions likely never marry virgins.\n \n What a condescending, demeaning lifestyle for the women!",
