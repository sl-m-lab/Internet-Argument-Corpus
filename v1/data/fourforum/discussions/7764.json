   "It has really increased the possibility of terror attacks on European facilities. Luckily so far terrorists have got no chance in European lands due to our special services efficiency or due to some other reason maybe. This is not the case with Iraq where blasts occur nearly every day. Americans assert those are Islamic extremists. For some time it has been a baffling mystery for me how they dare to bomb Muslim sacred shrines igniting hatreds of average Muslims. And what's about the fear of Allah retribution? I just couldn't get it. Islamic extremists according to their laws feel themselves in the position to kill apostates and that is people who don't share their beliefs, Muslims including. But they can't attack the 'houses of the Allah'= Muslim temples. Still they do! \n The latest news is that terror attack in Sadr in Iraq where hundreds Iraqis got killed was due to Wahhabites. Previously I read of Chechen Wahhibites links with CIA. So it flashed through my mind those may be Chechen Wahhibites not local ones doing this disgusting job for Americans, CIA probably. The logic is this - let Muslims busy with sorting it out with each other in Iraq while we're staying safe here in America. So far this has been sort of our guarantee for peace. But what if Muslims find out who's really to blame? Then all their hatred, they will spill it on America and her allies! It can't last for ever in Iraq.",
