They just don't realize what is really going on in the world regarding gay legislation and what does and does not exist regarding gay equality. They don't realize what exists for heterosexuals, and what is denied for homosexuals.\n \n But specifically on Johnnyturk's comments, I am familiar with this type of propagandic representation. Some anti-gay people start talking about the things that gay people CAN do in order to distract from the discrimination that EXISTS against them. It's a tactic I've seen used to try and pretend that the discrimination doesn't exist.\n \n You'll note that Johnnyturk doesn't talk about getting fired from a job because you are gay.\n He doesn't talk about military service discrimination (although he does inaccurately claim you can get any job that you want). He doesn't talk about how marriage caters to the heterosexual.\n He does inaccurately claim that gays can get civil unions and adopt, although the truth is that civil unions (or a similar form) are only available in a handful of states, and specifically recognized almost ONLY in those states. (In fact, a lot of the anti-gay marriage legislation is set up to EXPLICITLY state that other states won't recognize another state's \"civil unions\"...)",

Good thing no one's getting hostile, isn't it? :) \n \n If you want to better understand the laws and people's views on them you should stick to real world situations, instead of hypothetical ones. If Jyoshu and Bob are correct and polygamy is illegal everywhere than asking about polyamist's adoption rights is strictly hypothetical. Perhaps an interesting subject, but not one that is relelvant to anything in the real world. \n \n As for my views; kids need a loving, caring home, and a certain level of financial security is nice. If a household can and is willing to supply that, than I'm pretty much happy.
