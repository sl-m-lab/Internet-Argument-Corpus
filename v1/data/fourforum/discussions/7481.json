In the aftermath, Machado's civic group was awarded tens of thousands of American tax dollars from two major U.S. agencies \n\n \n Here is another site, from Sumate, a Machado run org. ( Machado being one of the signers of the coup decree)\n \n http://sumate.org/democracia-retroceso/cap2_en_3.htm\n \n \n In January 2005, on the occasion of the inauguration into office of the new Justices of the Supreme Court, its new President, Omar Mora, confessed his political inclination towards the \"revolutionary process\", announced the removal of \"coup-plotting\" magistrates and judges and stated his position in favor of reverting the August 14, 2002, sentence of the Supreme Court absolving four military officers accused of rebellion for participating in the events of April 2002. Among the new judges are some members of the government's party, Congressmen on the government's party ticket and even a former President of the National Electoral Council, Francisco Carrasquero. \n How nice it is to be only removed from your governmental position for signing a coup document instead of being Jailed.\n \n \nOn February 9, 2005 , the Tenth Chamber of the Caracas Circuit Court of Appeals overruled its own sentence of February 1 by which it suspended the prohibition to leave the country to 27 individuals accused of signing the Pedro Carmona-Estanga decree, extant since December 2004 \n Not being allowed to leave the country while under investigation for a coup is not particularly brutal in anyone's world.",

   "And it is getting harder to dismiss socialism as evil and socialist countries as a blight on the planet. Sure, the Swedish may talk funny and live in funny looking houses, and some of their food is kind of odd, but the place hardly qualifies an evil blight on the planet.\n\n Rather the other way around as it&#180;s the nordic countries that lauded as paragons of social progress every year in a row by the U.N. pertaining corruption, access to education, equality in front of the law, ability to rise from ones born social class etc. I can&#180;t remember what the index is called but it&#180;s something about human values.\n \n EDIT: Richard Florida is a god example of this. However right this guru may be in the end... ;)",
