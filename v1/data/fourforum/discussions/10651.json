   "Proposed: An inherent property of evolution has the potential to lead to eugenics.\n \n I have been studying how African-American women got sterilized without their consent (even without their knowledge) under the guise of \"improving the human condition\" through the eugenics movement, and that it is a direct historical application of evolution by some evolutionists, approved of and blessed by Darwin's own family.\n \n What I have learned from various forums concerning the Eugenics-Evolution Connection is that the issue is actually - is there something that's intrinsic to biological evolution that might have the potential to 'evolve', so to speak, into something like the eugenics garbage if it were to be given enough time and opportunity?\n \n Guess what - that answer is a resounding YES! \n \n There IS an intrinsic, inherent item of biological evolution that ISN'T scientifically valid and that could well be responsible over time for the eugenic-mess we've seen over the years.\n \n Evolutionary theory itself preaches and teaches No-Teleology-No-Conscious-Forethought. \n \n This teaching is system-wide and all-enveoping, and there are no exceptions to NT-NCF at any point of the evolutionary process (Futuyma, Mayr, etc), including the point where we humans originated. \n \n The fruit of NT-NCF (if it is allowed to \"evolve\" for a long enough time period within a large enough population) may very well be what we've seen the eugenics movement do right here in America. Think about it you guys. Open your eyes. The historical connection is certainly clear.\n \n In June 2007, Nature magazine openly denied (specifically in the name of evolution) that humans are created in the image of God, which simply points to what evolutionist James Rachels told everybody 17 years earlier, that Darwinian evolution makes the image-of-God claim AND its derivative claim of inherent human dignity, unsustainable and therefore Out-The-Window. \n \n What sort of fruit do you think these trends would bear if given enough time? Eugenics, maybe? Sterilizations? Survival of the fittest, wink wink nudge nudge?\n \n I think we've seen some of that fruit already. In a town I once visited, in 1929 (this is before I was born, jsut so you guys don't start freaking out about that), the eugenics people put up an exhibit. One message: Gotta do something to improve the quality of life for humanity. Do what? Do something with the \"defectives\". Better living through better breeding! ( Now remember, people actually thought this way in the name of evolution and science!)\n \n Whatever you may choose to believe about the \"validity of biological evolution\" in general, there's ONE inherent and intrinsic part of biological evolution (the part called NT-NCF) that \n \n (1) has NOT been scientifically validated.\n \n (2) could provide a very plausible historical explanation for the eugenic-mess that's gone down in America (and elsewhere).\n \n (This post is a copy of one I have made on other forums for debate)",

   "It's true that Francis Galton, a cousin of Darwin, coined the word \"eugenics\" a few years after the publication of Origin to describe the thesis that people should pay attention to \"good\" breeding, and avoid \"bad\" breeding, in order to \"improve\" the human species. It is also true that Galton quoted Darwinian theory to support his case.\n \n However, it does not follow from these facts that Darwinian theory actually supports all the claims, postulates and contentions of various eugenicists over the years, let alone mandates them. Eugenic theory (although the word itself was not coined till 1865) goes back to the days of ancient Greece, and the notion that position on society is determined by breeding is probably even older. Modern eugenics is just the old notion that breeding counts dressed in Darwinian attire, but does Darwinism support the idea? Only in the most general sense that selective breeding will isolate desired qualities -- without specifying how to determine what is or is not desirable.\n \n Darwinian theory, however, says nothing whatever about what is desirable for the human species in the future: it only attempts to account for how the human species came to be what it is. Neither does Darwinian theory specify how genes affect complex human traits such as intelligence; nor does it exclude gene-environment interactions often neglected by eugenicists; nor does it support the notion that there need be the simple mapping between genes and phenotype often assumed by eugenicists; nor can it define what constitutes \"improvement\".\n \n This Darwinism-leads-to-eugenics business is just another one of the regular bits of Creationist disinformation, based on their lack of understanding of biological theory on the one hand, and their desperate need to discredit science by associating it with tragic episodes in human history. Darwinian theory does not justify or imply eugenics, which is a matter of social policy, no matter how much eugenicists might quote it, any more than chemistry justifies cannons and gunpowder.\n \n I really wish Creationists were more skilled in logical thinking, but then, if they were, they wouldn't be Creationists.",

In some decisions the decision-makers were actually chosen by lottery. So, a bunch of non-christians came up with the system that 'the greatest nation the world has ever known' is now trying to impose on the rest of the world - despite the fact that their version is a bitter twisted version of the original, and the imposition of democracy is just, well, weird.\n \n I'm afraid I'm no historian and it is past my bedtime, so I'll leave you to see if you can understand it this time.\n \n Smiley",

Your attempt to change the subject and try to put words into my mouth (quite dishonest in my book) show that you are trying to squirm away from the fact that it seems I am right about NT-NCF.\n \n If you do not provide some evidence of the scientific validation of NT-NCF, just say so.\n \n If you avoid doing so, as well as not providing said evidence, I think we can all take your silence as evidence that no such evidence exists and that you are wrong.\n \n So - put up or shut up.\n \n Dishonesty, it seems, runs deep among some select anti-creationists.\n\n \n *sigh*\n \n Well, I had to look up what NT-NCF was supposed to be. Here it is, from the post that began this forum:\n \n \nEvolutionary theory itself preaches and teaches No-Teleology-No-Conscious-Forethought.\n\n \n Well, two things. First, evolution is a fact. We can see evolution operating over small scales today, and there is plenty of geological and genetic evidence that suggests the close ancestral kinship of all life on earth. No biologists deny evolution, somehow, happened. However, the fact THAT evolution happened doesn't necessitate any particular theory about HOW it happened. It's mere fact doesn't in principle exclude teleology, design, or even intelligent involvement in explaining how it happened.\n \n Second, does the currently dominant scientific theory of evolution, the new Darwinian synthesis, assume or require the absence of teleology and intelligent design? Certainly, prominent biologists have argued this, but in a special way: like all of natural science, the theory of evolution doesn't NEED assumptions of teleology or intelligent intent by a designer, because it invokes the demonstrated self-organising properties of matter, coupled to the non-random process of natural selection, which sieves out good variants from bad ones in the context of any given environment.\n \n That process must logically result in adaptation over many generations of any lineage that reproduces by repetitively following the basic rules of evolutionary theory: vary, inherit, select. No intelligent planning or foresight is needed. It is mimicked in modern genetic algorithms in computers built to generate complex engineering designs. In GA's, blind, evolutionary processes can zero in on optimal designs much faster than intelligent human engineers, and have been used successfully in airplane design. In all these cases, the final design is not known by the human engineer, who only programs the rules of the genetic algorithm and the standards for success (the selection sieve), and not the details of the final design... it is arrived at blindly, because evolutionary algorithms are astonishingly efficient at finding rare good design in a jungle of possibilities. This is a matter of fact now, and not mere theory.\n \n While science cannot formally exclude teleology or an intelligent designer in evolution, it certainly doesn't need to appeal to them to provide a valid scientific explanation for the fact of evolution. Natural selection appears to suffice to explain the evolution of complexity by the application of simple selective rules to random variants in a population: this has been demonstrated theoretically for such a system as the camera eye, starting from flat components. In short, there is no fundamental theoretical or logical obstacle to deriving complex systems from initially simple ones, merely by repetitively applying an algorithm of vary, inherit and select. We don't see the evolution of complex organs such as an eye in real time, because they take hundreds of thousands of generations to accomplish, and no scientist or society is going to live long enough to carry out such an experiment. However, we can observe the real time evolution of smaller complex systems, such as enzymes, which is proof of concept.\n \n Worse, if scientists did appeal to teleology and designers, they'd cease to do science, because science is about finding naturalistic explanations for natural phenomena. There is no way it can ask a supernatural designer how or why certain designs were supposedly selected over others, and biology would once again be reduced to mere stamp collecting, without any systematic explanations of why the biological world appears as it does. With ID Creationism, every explanation is effectively reduced to saying: It exists the way it does, because that's the way God intended it to be.\n \n That is the antithesis of science; that's pure religion. And even if scientists were to come to the conclusion that terrestrial life had been the result of deliberate design by some entity, say let's suppose that entity dropped down to earth and explained how and why they did it, that doesn't answer the question of how the entity came to be. It merely shoves the same problem one level up.\n \n So if it's science you want, the new Darwinian synthesis, for all the modifications it's likely to see over the next few years, is still the principal player in the scientific game. And even if it were replaced, it won't be by ID Creationism or that so-called oxymoron, Creation Science. They can't wish the facts of evolution away, nor can they appeal to the supernatural while claiming to be doing science.\n \n To return to the original question, it has not been shown that Darwinian theory supports or necessitates eugenics. Eugenics is not supported by current biological evidence, because it isn't really a science, it's a currently discredited social philosophy that people in lower social classes are less fit to breed, according to the standards of people in higher classes. Such standards have no scientific basis today, and never had. They are merely political justifications for the status quo of the day, and thus have no foundation in Darwinian theory whatever.",

Concerning the domination that man has over (or in conflict with) his invironment? The odds that evolution took all the right paths to arrive at the present state of man versus nature seem remote.\n \n What has humanity presented to you to cause you to hold them in high regard concerning \"dignity\" until the advent of Christianity?\n \n Your question concerning the realities of gravity and science is a perfect example of \"spin\".\n\n \n Either you made a mistake or you are the Elvis of non-sequiturs.\n \n First, my post you responded to is unrelated to your post. Second, I have said nothing about teleology, lucky evolution, human dignity and gravity. I really have no frigging idea what you are talking about. But what the hell, I'll give it a shot. \n \n Before my meager attempt, let me refer you to lesz's extremely eloquent post  here.\n \n I don't ascribe to any teleology about evolution, because I don't see any point for it. It simply needs no consideration. The theory stands well on its own and does not need it. Evolution happens just fine without any direction. It has nothing to do with a lucky turn of events. When will you guys finally understand that luck and monkeys with typewriters and hurricanes making jumbo jets have NOTHING to do with evolution? Cut it out, already!\n \n You feel that the odds are too great for present state to have arrived without help. You fail to understand the present state is far from perfect. In that 99% of all species that have existed are now extinct, there is a lot of failure going on. I don't know what you mean by \"the domination that man has over (or in conflict with) his invironment [sic]\" or \"man versus nature\". Considering we evolved to develop the intelligence to wipe ourselves off the planet (and maybe take the planet with us), that doesn't speak all that favorably for how well we were designed. Our knees are badly designed as well, even if it keeps orthopedic surgeons in business.\n \n I also don't understand the human dignity started with Christianity remark. Humans did some really cool stuff prior to JC. And what is it with you guys about this topic? Are humans deserving of admiration or not? If one expresses some satisfaction with humanity's achievement sans god, we are accused of hubris. If we recognize our place as another creature in the world, we are accused of wallowing in the dirt with \"mere\" animals. Make up your frigging mind!\n \n Lastly, I have no idea what you mean about gravity. I do assume you acknowledge its existence. Do you have a problem with gravitational theory as well?",

The odds that evolution took all the right paths to arrive at the present state of man versus nature seem remote.\n\n \n Oy! This is really begging the question! Why assume that the end goal of evolution is humanity? To claim that \"[t]he odds that evolution took all the right paths to arrive at the present state of man versus nature seem remote\" is to state something completely trivial. Of course they are remote. And that's totally besides the point, because the statement assumes that humanity is the end goal, whereas evolutionary theory need make no such assumption, and indeed, it is not at all self-evident that humanity IS the end goal of evolution -- that would be unpardonable hubris on our part.\n \n That statement is no more of an eye-opener than one like this:\n The odds that the Lotto randomizer mechanism took all the right paths to arrive at the winning numbers that I picked seem remote.\n Winning Lotto is so astonishingly unlikely, that therefore god intended and designed the machine so that I won the Lotto, and not someone else. That may be Creationist logic, but it isn't rational. Given the odds, someone has to win Lotto occasionally. The fact it's you is pure chance. Something had to be at the current end of evolution, and the fact that the human species happens to be among current survivors owes a lot, though not everything, to chance. \n \n Natural selection, unlike Lotto, doesn't operate by pure chance alone, so in fact, the probability of evolving any particular organism is very much higher than pure chance might suggest. Also, one must take into account the power of cumulative evolution, which doesn't evolve each species entirely from scratch, but builds only on prior, successful designs. That cuts the odds even more dramatically.\n \n Arguing that probabilities disprove evolution merely suggests one understands neither in this context.",
