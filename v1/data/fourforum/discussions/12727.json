   "Archangel, you take offence at being called bigoted but feel absolutely free in calling others 'warped and perverted' - not to mention flinging around accusations of bigotry yourself. Can't you see the double standard that you are setting up here?\n \n Furthermore, how does someone calling your views 'bigoted' affect your free speech - especially when you call their views bigoted right back? They are asserting their right to say how they perceive your views, just as you are doing about theirs. The only limits to your free speech here are the forum rules, enforced by admin and the 'report' button. However, those responding to your views can say what they like as long as they, too, meet those limits - it's freedom of speech, not freedom from responses to your speech.\n \n As to your youtube cherrypickings - they are just that, not representative of the whole. I have no doubt that some gay people are violent and break the law as you have evidenced, just as some straight people are violent and break the law.

They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.\"\n \n So there is punishment involved in their sexual perversion, just as we see in Romans 1:26-27: \"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another.

   "\"The Obama administration on Thursday failed in its attempt to exclude Fox News from participating in an interview of an administration official, as Republicans on Capitol Hill stepped up their criticism of the hardball tactics employed by the White House. \n \n The Treasury Department on Thursday tried to make \"pay czar\" Kenneth Feinberg available for interviews to every member of the network pool except Fox News. The pool is the five-network rotation that for decades has shared the costs and duties of daily coverage of the presidency and other Washington institutions. \n \n But the Washington bureau chiefs of the five TV networks consulted and decided that none of their reporters would interview Feinberg unless Fox News was included. The pool informed Treasury that Fox News, as a member of the network pool, could not be excluded from such interviews under the rules of the pool. \n \n The administration relented, making Feinberg available for all five pool members and Bloomberg TV. \n \n The pushback came after White House senior adviser David Axelrod told ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday that Fox News is not a real news organization and other news networks \"ought not to treat them that way.\" \n \n Media analysts cheered the decision to boycott the Feinberg interview unless Fox News was included, saying the administration's gambit was taking its feud with Fox News too far. President Obama has already declined to go on \"Fox News Sunday,\" even while appearing on the other Sunday shows. \n \n \"I'm really cheered by the other members saying \"No, if Fox can't be part of it, we won't be part of it,'\" said Baltimore Sun TV critic David Zurawik, calling the move to limit Feinberg's availability \"outrageous.\" \n \n \"What it's really about to me is the Executive Branch of the government trying to tell the press how it should behave. I mean, this democracy -- we know this -- only works with a free and unfettered press to provide information,\" he said. \n \n Several top White House advisers have appeared on other news channels to criticize Fox News' coverage of the administration, dismiss the network as the mouthpiece of the Republican Party and urge other news organizations not to treat Fox News as a legitimate news network. \n \n On Wednesday, Obama, speaking publicly for the first time about his administration's portrayal of Fox News as illegitimate, said he's not \"losing sleep\" over the controversy. \n \n \"I think that what our advisers simply said is, is that we are going to take media as it comes,\" Obama said when asked about his advisers targeting the network openly. \"And if media is operating, basically, as a talk radio format, then that's one thing. And if it's operating as a news outlet, then that's another. But it's not something I'm losing a lot of sleep over.\" \n \n Obama's comments also came after he met Monday with political commentators Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow of MSNBC; Eugene Robinson and E.J. Dionne of the Washington Post; Ron Brownstein of the National Journal; John Dickerson of Slate; Frank Rich, Maureen Dowd and Bob Herbert of the New York Times; Jerry Seib of the Wall Street Journal, Gloria Borger of CNN and U.S. News and World Report, and Gwen Ifill of PBS.\"",

   "This coming from the crowd that reminds us of our impending damnation every time we disagree and thinks their religous beliefs shoudl be reflected in secular law.\n \n\n \n There's room for both secular and religious influences in the U.S. You need to wake up and be aware of where America's original greatness came from - God.\n \n Concerning the outcome of the American Revolution, John Quincy Adams noted, \"The highest glory won from the American Revolution was this: it connected, in one indissoluble bond, the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity.\" \n \n In a letter to Thomas Jefferson dated June 28, 1813, John Adams wrote: \"The general principles on which the (founding) fathers achieved independence were....the general principles of Christianity.\"\n \n Founding father Noah Webster proclaimed much the same message when he said, \"The religion which has introduced civil liberty is the religion of Christ and His Apostles....This is genuine Christianity and to this we owe our free constitutions of government\" (History of the United States, 1832). \n \n Time after time, the founding fathers declared the same beliefs. From the archives of Patrick Henry's personal notes (handwritten on the back of his copy of the \"Stamp Act Resolutions,\" made public after his death) we read:\n \n \"Whether this (new government) will prove a blessing or a curse \n will depend upon the use our people make of the blessings which\n a gracious God hath bestowed on us. If they are wise they will be\n great and happy. If they are of a contrary character, they will be\n miserable. Righteousness alone can exalt them as a nation.\" \n \n Thomas Jefferson noted:\n \n \"Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have \n removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the\n people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are\n not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my\n country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice\n cannot sleep forever.\" (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781)\n \n And, you need to be aware of this principle:\n \n In the US Supreme Court decision Abington School District v. Schempp, 374, US 203, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963) Justice Clark stated: \"The State may not establish a 'religion of secularism' in the sense of affirmatively opposing or showing hostility to religion, thus 'preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.' \n \n What has liberalism produced?\n \n As one Orlando Sentinel columnist noted, \"They (liberals) wanted sexual promiscuity, drugs, disregard for the law, no censorship of pornography, no laws against sodomy or public profanity, abortion on demand, quick and easy divorces, acceptance of homosexuality, Miranda rights, a welfare system that paid women to have illegitimate children, a tax system that penalizes marriage, and a godless education system that utilizes metal detectors and drug-sniffing dogs in our public schools. And they got it. Every last bit of it.\" \n \n \"It is certainly arguable, then, that &#8220;progressive&#8221; liberal fundamentalism substantially undermines the basic effectiveness of the government and other societal elements of democracy. Despite the idealistic goals of liberalism, attempts to build a utopian liberal society in America have only led to heightened outbreaks of AIDS, VD, porno-related crime, social divisions, divorce, abortion, drug addictions, deficit spending, the welfare state, a crushing tax burden, the breakdown of the family unit, moral depravity, and numerous other such scourges which have resulted in enormous societal suffering and discontent. As a result, liberal fundamentalism is strongly associated with left-wing fanaticism, reverse-racism, anti-intellectualism, elitism, nihilism, godlessness, and societal violence.\" &#8211; Author Unknown \n \n Now, America is coming under judgment for its godless hedonism. \n \n Nice work, Jitobear! You guys must be real pleased with yourselves.\n \n By the way, what do believe will happen with you when you belly up and expire? Where do you think you will be?",

Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) said Tuesday that he'd back a GOP filibuster of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's health care reform bill. \n \n Lieberman, who caucuses with Democrats and is positioning himself as a fiscal hawk on the issue, said he opposes any health care bill that includes a government-run insurance program - even if it includes a provision allowing states to opt out of the program, as Reid has said the Senate bill will. \n \n \n \"We're trying to do too much at once,\" Lieberman said. \"To put this government-created insurance company on top of everything else is just asking for trouble for the taxpayers, for the premium payers and for the national debt. I don't think we need it now.\" \n \n \n Asked about Lieberman's threat to filibuster a final vote on the Reid plan, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said: \"I haven't seen the report from Sen. Lieberman or why he's saying what he's saying. I think Democrats and Republicans alike will be held accountable by their constituents who want to see health care reform enacted this year.\" \n \n Lieberman said that he'd vote against a public option plan \"even with an opt-out because it still creates a whole new government entitlement program for which taxpayers will be on the line.\" \n \n His comments confirmed that Reid is short of the 60 votes needed to advance the bill out of the Senate, even after Reid included the opt-out provision. Several other moderate Democrats expressed skepticism at the proposal as well, but most of the wavering Democratic senators did not go as far as Lieberman Tuesday, saying they were waiting to see the details. \n Joe Lieberman: I'll block vote on Harry Reid's plan - Manu Raju - POLITICO.com \n\n \n Get that fork ready! emoticon_xhoho",
