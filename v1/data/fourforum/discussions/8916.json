   "Lithuanian Minister for Environment Arunas Kundrotas announced about necessity of building of seismological stations in Lithuania.That's brazen lie of venal bureaucrat. In fact under pretence of stations' building USA will place here their Antiballistic Missile System's (AMS) elements. And no they are making some studies and prepare the sites. You see our American Big Brother needs security blanket. And who give us at least security \"bed-sheet\" I wonder? By the way everywhere AMS objects are favourite aims for terrorists.\n And what about Lithuanian power supply? For they already talking about some seismic danger and possible wreck of Ignalinsk power plant and its closing. Actually this power plant just impedes carrying our US plans about AMS placing! Our country is sold to American swines and they feel themselves masters here and do what they want. Has anyone asked us if want those AMS? And who cares about common Lithuanians' safety?",
