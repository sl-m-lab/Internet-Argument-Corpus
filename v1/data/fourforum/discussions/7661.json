   "Not that any zealot would be swayed by evidence, but for those that seek evidence, it's somewhat reassuring to see the wheels of justice turn in favor of reality on occasion. Actually, the only reason there are \"discussions\" of ID is because this helps the religious cause..that is, any discussion of ID vs science gives ID a large public platform from which to essentially, preach. The facts that it's pure mythological junk, is irrelevant to their ability to continually gain a large, national audience to which they preach their \"word\".\n \n Here are excerpts from the body of the ruling in:\n \n Kitmiller et al v. Dover (Pennsylvania) Shool distict\n \n (Regarding the teaching of the mythology of \"Intelligent Design\" in public schools)\n \n 4. Whether ID is Science:\n \n ...We find that ID fails on three different levels, any one of which is sufficient to preclude a determination that ID is science. They are (1) ID violates the centuries-old ground rules of science by invoking and permitting supernatural causations;(2) the argument of irreducible complexity, central to ID, employes the same flawed and illogical contrived dualism that doomed creation science in the 1980's, and (3) ID's negative attacks on evolution have been refuted by the scientific community.\n \n On the unethical conjectures conjured up by Prof. Behe (on irreducible complexity).\n \n In addition to Professor Behe's admitted failure to properly address the very phenomenon of the irreducible complexity purports to place at the issue, natural selection, Drs. Miller and Padain testified that Prf. Behe's concept of irreducible complexity depends on ignoring ways in which evolution is known to occur...\n As expert testimony revealed, the qualification on what is meant by irreducible complexity renders it meaningless as a criticism of evolution. In fact, the theory of evolution proffers exapation as a well-recognized, well documented explatnion for how systens with multiple parts could have evolved through natural means.\n \n ...\n The evidence presented in this case demonstrates that ID is not supported by any peer-reviewed research data, or publications. Behe admitted that: \"There are no peer-reviewed articles by anyone advocating for intelligent design supported by pertinent experiments or calculations which provide detailed rigourous accounts of how intellgient design of any biological system occured\".\n \n It's the same as saying there is a debate that 1+1=2 is wrong, and that's it's really 1+1=apple.\n \n It's amusing, sure, but it's not science.",

Some individuals wanted things other than knowledge (religion) spread through our education system. This is what court case dealt with.\n \n -Mach",

   "look at it this way: the creation vs evolution forum is neither a science nor religious forum. science has a distinct forum, and so does religion. the issue of creation vs evolution is where the 2 interests bump heads, and the result og this overlap is massive enough to warrant a distinct discussion forum of its own.\n \n there are a vast variety of other religious issues other than the genesis account, just as there is a lot more to science than evolutionary biology, paleontology and anthropology. likewise, there are many religious people, even christians, that have no interest in creation, as there are many scientists that do not entertain evolution topics, but neglecting either does not make them less of a christian or scientist respectively, in their views. \n \n this forum specifically focuses on the debates between the area where these different ideas intersect. as such you cant separate the two.",
