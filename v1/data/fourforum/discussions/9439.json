   "I think Mitt Romney may be the next U.S. president. He was the Republican governor from Massachusetts. He is a Mormon. There has never been a Mormon president. Can Romney be the first? He has filed with the Federal Election Commission, allowing him to raise money for the 2008 Republican nomination. \n \n Willard Mitt Romney was born March 12, 1947 in Detroit. He is the son of George Romney, a 1968 presidential candidate. He and his wife, Ann, have 5 sons. Ann has multiple sclerosis. \n \n Romney has a B.A. from Brigham Young University and an MBA from Harvard Business School. He co-founded Bain Capital, an equity investment firm, and made a fortune, helping to start Staples office-supply. \n \n He ran for the U.S. Senate in 1994 but lost to Ted Kennedy. He was elected governor of Massachusetts in 2002 and served a four-year term. Romney has conservative values, a Republican governor in a liberal state. \n \n With veterans returning from Iraq, there need to be adequate benefits and health care. Romney supports veterans. He was the first Massachusettes governor to appoint a secretary of veterans' affairs. He developed the Welcome Home Bill which gave National Guardsmen free tuition at Massachusetts universities. \n \n 12 million illegal immigrants have poured into the United States from Mexico. Romney is tough on illegals. He made an agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement which allowed Massachusetts State troopers to arrest and deport. \n \n He supports alternative energy such as ethanol and nuclear and is for drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). \n \n Romney is pro-life. He opposes Roe v. Wade. He is against abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is threatened. 46 million babies have been aborted since 1973 in what amounts to an American Holocaust. \n \n He supports the death penalty in cases which include terrorism and multiple killings. \n \n Same-sex marriage has been an improbable issue in recent years. Romney believes that marriage is a union between a man and a woman. He opposes same-sex marriage and civil unions. \n \n US PRESIDENTS http://jimcolyer.com/papers/entry?id=50",

He opposes same-sex marriage and civil unions. \n \n\n \n I think this is going to be a big lose-lose for Romney. On the one hand, he fought tooth and nail against gay marriage, even dragging up an old racist law to try to stop it. There's goes any support from the left. On the other hand, he was governor in the only state in the union to allow gay marriage, he couldn't stop it. There goes support from those on the right who want results. They don't want someone who'll fight the good fight, they want someone who'll win. Throw in his change in tone once he had decided to run for President to get the anti-flip-floppers against him, and I think this issue will really cause him some real harm.",

He'd also lose liberal support as he's not even trying to pander to them.\n \n Saying a guy seems okay doesn't mean I'd vote for him.\n \n As for EZ, he's sophmoric. Probably knows far less of his own faith than I do, it's origins and machinations. But then again he's a target market and blindly believes the nonsense even when it's demonstrably false. He follows pseudo Christianity and thinks it's the real deal, but like those he attacks as liberal Christians, definatly isn't following the 'whole' gosple (tm). \n Buit, that's another thread.\n \n As a slight righty (read: fascist for liberals or commie for conservatives) I'd lean towards McCain atm.\n \n I'd rather have the Charisma of Obama, the political machine of Hillary and a blending of 2 to 1 Reagan and Bill Clinton. With a snazy new name. Like Juanita Rexella Smith-Rodriguez. Yeah, a uniter...or a Frankenstein monster.",
