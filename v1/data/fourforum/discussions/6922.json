   "I have no clue on this. I've heard of this term called \"Gay-dar\" where a person can tell a gay person from a mile away. I have been told that all people who are gay have it and some few people who are straight have it also. I think I am one of those many more straight people who do not have it. I honestly don't think I would know \"gay\" if it came up and stared me in the face. The truth is that I know at least five people that are supposedly gay (that I have personally met) and I never even knew it until someone told me. Some of them are people who have been described in ways simular to \"shine to the brightness of many rainbows.\" Okay, not those words exactly, but something along those lines. So does \"Gay-dar\" really exist or are people simply making stuff up?\n \n Yes, I know this doesn't really have to do with gay rights so if someone complains to Admin and it gets moved to someplace better, I don't care.",

   "Studies: Biology Influences Sexual Orientation AND Gaydar\n \n From Medical News Today, there's news of a biological basis for \"gaydar,\" the rumored ability of some gay people to identify one another through poorly understood, non-verbal cues:\n \n Gay men preferred odors from gay men and heterosexual women, whereas odors from gay men were the least preferred by heterosexual men and women and by lesbian women. \n \n Reference: Yolanda Martins, George Preti, Christina R. Crabtree and Charles J. Wysocki. Preference for Human Body Odors Is Influenced by Gender and Sexual Orientation. Psychological Science, September 2005 (not yet published).\n \n Meanwhile, the New York Times reports new evidence of biological underpinnings for sexual orientation:\n \n Using a brain-imaging technique, Swedish researchers have shown that men and women respond differently to two odors that may be involved in sexual arousal, and that homosexual men respond in the same way as women. ...\n \n The new research may open the way to studying human pheromones as well as the biological basis of sexual preference. The study, by Dr. Ivanka Savic and colleagues at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, is being reported in Tuesday's issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n \n But the studies do not mean that sexual orientation is necessarily fixed...\n \n From the Chicago Tribune:\n \n The current climate of debate over whether homosexuality is a matter of choice or is inborn makes such research extremely controversial, said team leader and neuroscientist Dr. Ivanka Savic of the institute's Center for Gender Related Medicine.\n \n \"I want to be extremely cautious - this study does not tell us anything about whether sexual orientation is hardwired in the brain. It doesn't say anything about that,\" Savic said.\n \n For more information: Google News search\n \n Posted by Mike Airhart at May 9, 2005 11:14 PM\n Trackback Pings\n \n TrackBack URL for this entry:\n http://www.exgaywatch.com/blog/mt-tb.cgi/1822\n Responses\n \n Re: \"Gay men preferred odors from gay men...\"\n \n Well sure, if it's Halston, Hugo Boss or Paco Rabone... :-)\n \n Anyway... here we go again.\n \n Posted by: Anonymous at May 10, 2005 12:03 AM\n \n Very good update, Mike.\n \n I like your sense of balance, in that you also took the time to mention that the jury is still out with regards to whether orientation is fixed. This shows intellectual honesty.\n \n What role does smell really play in sexual arousal? It seems that at least for humans, a very large component of it is visual as opposed to olfactory, given the fact that men can get off quite well on pornography (minus the smell),while finding it quite difficult to get off on smell alone (minus the visuals).\n \n \"Our findings support the contention that gender preference has a biological component that is reflected in both the production of different body odors and in the perception of and response to body odors.\"\n \n I don't doubt their findings. Sexual orientation, like everything else about us, DOES have a biological component, but I believe, as you probably do too, that we should not attempt to read anymore into this study than is warranted, in order to be intellectually sound.\n \n I would love to read the original article and evaluate the actual data, as I don't usually trust media sound bites, especially when they relate to issues like these.\n http://www.exgaywatch.com/blog/archives/2005/05/study_biology_i.html",

As I said earlier, I wouldn't know gay if gay stared me in the face. But from my point a view, I guess either could work. But with the idea that it is learned, this could also have some credit. Based upon the people that I already knew to be gay, I see people who may be gay. I say may be, because just because they seem that way doesn't mean they are. But the scent thing doesn't make sence to me. Would that suggest that a person can smell gay? I can understand a person looking or sounding (based on voice) gay, but how does gay smell?",
