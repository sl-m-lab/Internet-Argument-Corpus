   "Catholic biblical scholars and an Israeli archaeologist rejected filmmakers' claim that a tomb uncovered nearly 30 years ago in Jerusalem is the burial site of Jesus and his family.\n \n Dominican Father Jerome Murphy-O'Connor, a biblical archaeologist and expert in the New Testament at the French Biblical and Archaeological School of Jerusalem who was interviewed for the film two years ago, said he did not believe there was any truth to the claim.\n \n \"It is a commercial ploy that all the media is playing into,\" he told Catholic News Service Feb. 27.\n \n Amos Kloner, an Israeli archaeologist who wrote the original excavation report on the site for the predecessor of the Israel Antiquities Authority, called the claim \"nonsense.\"\n \n \"In their movie they are billing it as 'never before reported information,' but it is not new. I published all the details in the Antiqot journal in 1996, and I didn't say it was the tomb of Jesus' family,\" said Kloner, now a professor of archaeology at Israel's Bar-Ilan University.\n \n \"I think it is very unserious work. I do scholarly work ... based on other studies,\" he said.\n http://www.catholicexplorer.com/explore4325/nationworld/biblical-scholars-reject-.shtml",
