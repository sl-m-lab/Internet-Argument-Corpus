Lesbian and heterosexual women have not been found to differ markedly either in their overall mental health or in their approaches to child rearing (Kweskin & Cook, 1982; Lyons, 1983; Miller, Jacobsen, & Bigner, 1981; Mucklow & Phelan, 1979; Pagelow, 1980; Rand, Graham, & Rawlings, 1982; Thompson, McCandless, & Strickland, 1971), nor have lesbians' romantic and sexual relationships with other women been found to detract from their ability to care for their children (Pagelow, 1980). Recent evidence suggests that lesbian couples who are parenting together tend to divide household and family labor relatively evenly (Hand, 1991; Patterson, 1995a) and to report satisfaction with their couple relationships (Koepke, Hare, & Moran, 1992; Patterson, 1995a). Research on gay fathers has similarly found no reason to believe them unfit as parents (Barret & Robinson, 1990; Bigner and Bozett, 1990; Bozett, 1980, 1989).  \n \n American Psychiatric Association\n http://www.psych.org/news_room/press_releases/adoption_coparenting121802.pdf\n \n Research over the past 30 years has consistently demonstrated that children raised by gay or lesbian parents exhibit the same level of emotional, cognitive, social and sexual functioning as children raised by heterosexual parents. The research also indicates that optimal development for children is not based on the sexual orientation of the parents, but on stable attachments to committed and nurturing adults...\n \n The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Psychoanalytic Association, American Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists, and the American Association of Family Physicians have all adopted similar positions.",

   "Thanks for your post with some evidence. I can accept what these articles claim, that children raised in gay and lesbian households get no bad effects as a result. \n \n I do believe that homosexual sex and romantic pursuits are immoral. That is my belief based on religious convictions. I also believe that marriage should not be redefined from the way most of society views it (being for men/women couples.) Apparently, most of the country agrees with me, given the recent election results and state ballot votes.\n\n \n Apparently, most of the country is under the hypnotic spell of evil mistranslations.\n \n Try this on for size: (an apology now for my reprinting at length.)\n \n Ruth and Naomi\n Ruth 1:16-17 and 2:10-11 describe their close friendship Perhaps the best known passage from this book is Ruth 1:16-17 which is often read out during opposite-sex and same-sex marriage and union ceremonies:\n \n \"Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me.\" (NIV)\n \n Ruth 1:14, referring to the relationship between Ruth and Naomi, mentions that \"Ruth clave onto her.\" (KJV) The Hebrew word translated here as \"clave\" is identical to that used in the description of a heterosexual marriage in Genesis 2:24: \" Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.\" (KJV) \n \n This book was probably included in the Hebrew Scriptures because King David was one of the descendents of Ruth. Although this same-sex friendship appears to have been very close, there is no proof that it was a sexually active relationship. \n \n \n \n David and Jonathan\n Passages in 1 Samuel & 2 Samuel describe, among other events, a extremely close bond between David and Jonathan. Jonathan was the son of King Saul, and next in line for the throne. But Samuel anointed David to be the next king. This produced a strong conflict in the mind of Saul. \n \n Interpretation: Religious conservatives generally view the friendship of David and Jonathan as totally non-sexual. It is inconceivable that God would allow a famous king of Israel to be a homosexual. \n Some religious beleive that David and Jonathan had a consensual homosexual relationship - in many ways, a prototype of many of today's gay partnerships. 7 Some important verses which describe their relationship are: 1 Samuel 18:1\n \"...Jonathan became one in spirit with David and he loved him as himself.\" (NIV)\n \n \"...the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul\" (KJV)\n \n Most translations use the term \"soul\" rather than \"spirit\" to describe the bond. They speak of an \"immediate bond of love\", their souls being \"in unison,\" their souls being \"knit\", etc. Genesis 2:7, as written in the original Hebrew, describes how God blew the spirit into the body of Adam that God had formed from earth, so that Adam became a living soul. This means that \"soul\", in the ancient Israelite times, represents a combination of body and spirit. Thus the two men appear to have loved each other both physically and emotionally. \n \n 1 Samuel 18:2\n \"From that day, Saul kept David with him and did not let him return to his father's house.\" (NIV)\n \n David left his parent's home and moved to Saul's where he would be with Jonathan. This is a strong indication that the relationship was extremely close. \n \n 1 Samuel 18:3-4\n \"And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even his sword, his bow and his belt.\" (NIV)\n \n Since people in those days did not wear underwear, Jonathan stripped himself naked in front of David. That would be considered extremely unusual behavior (then and now) unless their relationship was physical. \n \n 1 Samuel 18:20-21\n \"Now Saul's daughter Michal was in love with David, and when they told Saul about it, he was pleased. 'I will give her to him', he thought, 'so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him'. Now you have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law\" (NIV)\n \n In the King James Version, the end of Verse 21 reads: \n \n \"Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law, in the one of the twain.\" (KJV)\n \n Saul's belief was that David would be so distracted by a wife that he would not be an effective fighter and would be killed by the Philistines. He offered first his daughter Merab, but that was rejected, presumably by her. Then he offered Michal. There is an interesting phrase used at the end of verse 21. In both the NIV and KJV, it would seem that David's first opportunity to be a son-in-law was with the older daughter Merab, and his second was with the younger daughter Michal. The KJV preserves the original text in its clearest form; it implies that David would become Saul's son-in-law through \"one of the twain.\" \"Twain\" means \"two\", so the verse seems to refer to one of Saul's two daughters. Unfortunately, this is a mistranslation. The underlined phrase \"the one of\" does not exist in the Hebrew original. The words are shown in italics in the King James Version; this is an admission by the translators that they made the words up. Thus, if the KJV translators had been truly honest, they would have written:\n \n \"Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law, in the twain.\"\n \n In modern English, this might be written: \"Today, you are son-in-law with two of my children\" That would refer to both his son Jonathan and his daughter Michal. The Hebrew original would appear to recognize David and Jonathan's homosexual relationship as equivalent to David and Michal's heterosexual marriage. Saul may have approved or disapproved of the same-sex relationship; but at least he appears to have recognized it. The KJV highlight their re-writing of the Hebrew original by placing the three words in italics; the NIV translation is clearly deceptive. \n \n 1 Samuel 20:41\n \"After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with is face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together - but David wept the most.\" (NIV)\n \n Other translations have a different ending to the verse: \"...and they kissed one another and wept with one another, until David exceeded.\" (KJV) \n \"...and they kissed one another and wept with one another until David got control of himself.\" (Amplified Bible) \n \"and they sadly shook hands, tears running down their cheeks until David could weep no more.\" (Living Bible) \n \"They kissed each other and wept together until David got control of himself.\" (Modern Language) \n \"They kissed each other and wept aloud together.\" (New American Bible) \n \"Then David and Jonathan kissed each other. They cried together, but David cried the most.\" (New Century Version) \n \"Then the kissed one another and shed tears together, until David's grief was even greater than Jonathan's.\" (Revised English Bible) \n \"...and they kissed one another and wept with one another until David recovered himself.\" (Revised Standard Version) \n \n \n The translators of the Living Bible apparently could not handle the thought of two adult men kissing, so they mistranslated the passage by saying that the two men shook hands! This is somewhat less than honest. The original Hebrew text says that they kissed each other and wept together until David became great. The word which means \"great\" in this passage is \"gadal\" in the original Hebrew. The same word is used elsewhere in the Hebrew Scriptures to refer to King Solomon being greater than all other kings. Some theologians interpret \"gadal\" in this verse as indicating that David had an erection. However, the thoughts of David becoming sexually aroused after kissing Jonathan is too threatening for Bible translators, so they either deleted the ending entirely or created one of their own. \n \n 2 Samuel 1:26\n \"I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; you were very dear to me. Your love for me was wonderful, more wonderful than that of women.\"\n \n In the society of ancient Israel, it was not considered proper for a man and woman to have a platonic relationship. Men and women rarely spoke to each other in public. Since David's only relationships with women would have been sexual in nature, then he must be referring to sexual love here. It would not make sense in this verse to compare platonic love for a man with sexual love for a woman; they are two completely different phenomenon. It would appear that David is referring to his sexual love for Jonathan. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Daniel and Ashpenaz\n Daniel 1:9 refers to Ashpenaz, the chief of the court officials of Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon. \n \n Various English translations differ greatly: \"Now God had caused the official to show favor and sympathy to Daniel\" (NIV) \n \"Now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs\" (KJV) \n \"Now God made Daniel to find favor, compassion and loving-kindness with the chief of the eunuchs\" (Amplified Bible) \n \"Now, as it happens, God had given the superintendent a special appreciation for Daniel and sympathy for his predicament\" (Living Bible) \n \"Then God granted Daniel favor and sympathy from the chief of the eunuchs\" (Modern Language) \n \"Though God had given Daniel the favor and sympathy of the chief chamberlain...\" (New American Bible) \n \"God made Ashpenaz want to be kind and merciful to Daniel\" (New Century Version) \n \"And God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs\" (Revised Standard Version) \n \"God caused the master to look on Daniel with kindness and goodwill\" (Revised English Version)\n \n \n \n Interpretation: Religious conservatives generally view the friendship of Daniel and Ashpenaz as totally non-sexual. It is inconceivable that God would allow a famous prophet of Israel to be a homosexual. \n Some religious liberals detect the possibility of a homosexual relationship here. The Hebrew words which describe the relationship between Daniel and Ashpenaz are chesed v'rachamim The most common translation of chesed is \"mercy\". V'rachamim is in a plural form which is used to emphasize its relative importance. It has multiple meanings: \"mercy\" and \"physical love\". It is unreasonable that the original Hebrew would read that Ashpenaz \"showed mercy and mercy.\" A more reasonable translation would thus be that Ashpenaz showed mercy and engaged in physical love\" with Daniel. Of course, this would be unacceptable to later translators, so they substitute more innocuous terms. The KJV reference to \"tender love\" would appear to be the closest to the truth. One might question whether Daniel and Ashpenaz could sexually consummate their relationship. They were both eunuchs. Apparently, when males are castrated after puberty, they still retain sexual drive. It is interesting to note that no other romantic interest or sexual partner of Daniel was mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. \n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bmar.htm\n \n Here's another site that might be helpful with an explaination:\n \n http://www.kencollins.com/bible-i3.htm",

Don't you think it is speculative at best to read into these stories things that are not stated?\n \n I go to Africa at least once a year. In the country that I visit, it is not uncommon at all for men to walk down the street hand in hand or with one's arm around the other. This is what friends there do. Just because there is evidence of affection it does not mean that there is something sexual going on. Such a view that affection between members of the same sex has to be sexual is probably a result of our over-sexed culture here in the U.S. The Bible has to be read in the context of the historic and geographic culture it portrayed, not through American eyes.",

We have already had that idea shot down once before in this country. \n Unless the institution is actually noticed as having already changed your idea is fairly moot. You see marriage isn't an \"institution\" but rather a precept. Just because it's believed to be one thing does not necessarily preclude it from including many other things at the same time. \n What is a marriage? \n Do marriages always result in biological offspring? \n Do marriages suddenly disolve if no offspring are created, regardless of whether this was by choice or by biological inability? \n Are the Elderly able to be married? \n Are the infertile?\n Are the divorced? \n Are rapists, murderers, pedophiles, kidnappers, tax evadors? \n \n See, marraige isn't as pristine as you would like for the populous to believe. It's dirty. It always has been. It started out dirty as a form of political and property gains. Love really didn't have much to do with it.\n Children were a bonus.\n \n Procreation in whatever form, ensures the continuation of species, not marriage.\n Kids were thought of as property. Girls with less standing than boys. \n They were right there with animals and land. Wives were thought of as even less.\n \n So, don't try to convince me that your precept of marriage has any kind of solid form.
