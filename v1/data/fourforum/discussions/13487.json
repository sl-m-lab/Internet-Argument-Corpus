   "Anyone. \n \n I once had an argument with a person who remarked about someone being \"too dumb to be allowed to carry a gun.\"\n \n I responded:\n \n \nEach individual has the right to self defense no matter what their IQ, or no matter how \"dumb\" they appear to be. There are set standards and \"guidelines\" most states have set up in order to determine whether or not a person \"qualifies\" to carry a gun. While I understand the purpose, and I understand what these state CCW qualifications are designed to do, I am NOT comfortable with the idea of having the state use any method to determine if I \"qualify\" for a right. \n \n Do you have to pass a qualification for free speech? How about a test to see if you can go to church? Do you have to fill out a questionairre to get protection from illegal search and seizure?\n \n Each and every individual, regardless of their intelligence, should have the right to defend their lives in the most efficient manner they choose.\n \n Are there some people out there who just shouldn't have a gun? Of course. There is a method used to weed these people out. When they do something illegal or truly \"dumb\", the cops arrest them and take away their legal ability to carry. Until that time EVERYONE deserves the right to carry a gun, no matter where they fall on your personal intelligence scale.\n\n \n Who would I trust with a firearm? Anyone I would trust to drive a car. Until they did something to justify why they shouldn't have one.\n \n We are all free, until we do something that justifies the removal of our freedom. We are not born as slaves who have to qualify to receive it.",

It seems odd when people advocate blind trust for Joe Civilian, but then think that the government shouldn't be allowed to be armed. I think there must be a balance in trust given both ways.\n\n \n The Federalist Papers deal with that subject in depth.\n \n Here is one of many examples of the same thought:\n The Federalist #26\n \nIt has been said that the provision which limits the appropriation of money for the support of an army to the period of two years would be unavailing, because the Executive, when once possessed of a force large enough to awe the people into submission, would find resources in that very force sufficient to enable him to dispense with supplies from the acts of the legislature. But the question again recurs, upon what pretense could he be put in possession of a force of that magnitude in time of peace? If we suppose it to have been created in consequence of some domestic insurrection or foreign war, then it becomes a case not within the principles of the objection; for this is levelled against the power of keeping up troops in time of peace. Few persons will be so visionary as seriously to contend that military forces ought not to be raised to quell a rebellion or resist an invasion; and if the defense of the community under such circumstances should make it necessary to have an army so numerous as to hazard its liberty, this is one of those calamaties for which there is neither preventative nor cure. It cannot be provided against by any possible form of government; it might even result from a simple league offensive and defensive, if it should ever be necessary for the confederates or allies to form an army for common defense.\n SNIP.\n \n A simple google search will provide plenty of thought on those keywords from debates on the Constitution, George Washington, the Federalist Papers and the powers of the legislature in Article 1,section 8.",

And it is probably not far more than I think, I am aware that there are many non-military federal agencies that include armed divisions. Most of these are used in a law enforcement capacity. Keep in mind that the state police and most local police are also government funded (by state and local government).
