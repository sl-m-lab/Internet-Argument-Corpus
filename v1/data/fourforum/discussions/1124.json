   "What ban are you talking about?\n\n \n As it applies to you I mean the ban on any gun that you cannot buy or any ban against taking or using guns in any way that you wish to do so. As it applies to my example I speak of the ban to own and bear nuclear weapons.\n \n \nI have to be able to buy them first. There is no vendor who wants to sell one to you.\n\n \n We live in a free market so trust me if it is profitable and legal (sometimes this is unnecessary) to sell then someone will want to sell it to you.\n \n \nThere is only one vendor in this country, they are quite happy to have only one customer, the Department of Defense. You can not force a vendor to sell thier private property to you.\n\n \n Nor would you have to. New companies would be able to expand into this new and growing field as the demand for nuclear weapons began to grow.\n \n \nI agree with the logic, but makes no difference. You will not find a vendor who will enter into a contract to sell one to you.\n\n \n Let us say that we will find a vendor which of course we will. There are plenty of countries out there that will drop out of the NPT in order to join this growing market and help pay for their own programs and help expand their influences in this politically and diplomatically powerful field. I think you would have no trouble finding someone to sell them to you if you could own them. So should I have this right and shouldn't I be able to buy them from other countries if I wish as well from companies or individuals in the US who should be legally allowed to make them?",

What purpose does preventing me from having a nuclear weapon serve then?\n \n I bet you could trust certain people in the US to carry around a nuclear weapon and no one would be hurt by this. But there are also certain people who would use this right to hurt people. So based on your logic we should make rights based on the first group who is trustworthy and not on the second group who we cannot trust. You are basically stating that you yourself should be the person who we look at to determine what rights EVERYONE should have. I can do the same with nuclear weapons then and you should be able to agree that EVERYONE including US citizens who are not loyal to the US should be able to carry around nuclear weapons.",
