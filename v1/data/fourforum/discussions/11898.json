Aside from that not being found anywhere in Marxist literature, McDonald's has a long history of suing the #### out of anyone who slanders or libels their products or company. McDonald's for decades utilized the libel laws of Britain against all who would defame it.\n \n By such reasoning, McDonald's is a Marxist corporation. ",

She is making truly insane arguments and refuses to defend them. Thus, I'm going to pick out specific ones and make them oh so very public. \n \n Do you agree that wanting to sue/suing for slander is Marxist? emoticon_emb",
