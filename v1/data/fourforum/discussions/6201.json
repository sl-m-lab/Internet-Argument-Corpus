   "Just for fun...\n Wizards/Sorcerors appear a couple of times in the bible (Moses duels with one at one point), however other than reactions to Harry Potter books we hear very little about them. Seeing as they appear in the Old testament and having seen on another thread here that the jewish religion does not have Satan in quite the same role as in christianity - where do they get their power from and is there an explaination where they all went?\n \n Would it not be possible to use these powers for good, or in a more general sense is there no way dark/demon granted powers can be used for good? Seems to be nothing in the 10 commandments about magic (despite being in the same section as mentions of sorcerors) so would these not trump the lesser sin (if it is one) of witchcraft?",

   "Where did they go? I believe Christians still believe witches and wizards are real, along with a multitude of other unseen entities which are evil and are to be scrupulously avoided. Interestingly, wizards are given short shrift in our society. Most loathing and fear is saved for their female counterparts, witches. \n \n It's also still apparently a considerable threat to the established churches. They would prefer to hold a monopoly on the superstition business. It's okay to worship a ghost with some marvellous degree of holiness, but all other ghosts must be shunned, they say. It's as though they are attempting to be the Wal-Mart of the superstitious business, quashing all little competitors and upstarts. It does present a quandary if you think about it. To deny that any of these fantastical creatures don't exist or don't possess magical powers is to deny their favorite ones don't either.\n \n After all, if one admits belief in one supernatural being, once that leap has been made, it's a short step to believe a whole array of winged and hoofed and horned and fire-breathing and ten-headed creatures inhabit the same real estate we mortals do.\n \n So we're left having the Christian Church select our spooks. All others are to be explicitly avoided, along with their trappings, which aren't immediately obvious to us who haven't graduated from, say, Oral Roberts University. If not for their studious learning, one would hardly know a Ouija board is inherently evil, along with all Harry Potter books and its author. And no, there is no way that dark power can be used for good. Simply by asking that question I can see you've been fraternizing with some of those unseen creatures. For all I know, you've been listening to music and dancing even.",

   "haha...billsco...man I've missed debating with everyone...but anyways...you'll find a reference to wizards or what not in the New Testament in the book of Acts...I think it was Paul who met them and they eventually converted and burned all their scrolls as a sign that they surrender their power and accept God's power...however.....anyways sure I believe that's it's possible to contact spiritual entities or whatever you wish to call it...but that's a different debate....",

   "Middle Eastern magic centres around genies as I understand it. Difficult to pin down as such and very underground since Mohammed.\n \n In the Celtic world magic flows from the old pantheon so it's an entirely different belief system to monotheism. More akin to shamanism per se.\n Of course the more extreme elements of monotheism aren't above witchhunts and demonisation, even today. Thus 'conversion' may well have been a method of saving their own necks.\n \n Voodoo is of course holding its own against monotheism and seems to have infected African Christianity with its own beliefs, though perhaps not always for the best.",
