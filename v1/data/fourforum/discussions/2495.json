   "Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles. (3 John 1:7)\n Churches today are very much in the habit of taking government benefits, but is it biblical to do so? There is a reason why the early church was in the habit of \"taking nothing of the Gentiles.\" It's because they so-well understood that it would ruin their testimony of Christ. \n \n How could they on one hand claim that \"The Lord Jesus Christ is our provider,\" and yet in the other hand take State benefits? They couldn't and they didn't.\n \n Yet today, most churches are taking State privileges and benefits. For example, most churches have applied for the IRS 501c3 tax exempt status. This is misguided both theologically and even legally. \n \n It's misguided legally because even the IRS has always stated that \"churches are exempt automatically and are automatically tax deductible\" without ever having to apply for 501c3 status. \n \n There's some very useful information available on this subject at http://501c3.hushmoney.org",
