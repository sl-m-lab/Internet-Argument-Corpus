You are a legalist so you take the bible in a legalistic interpretation to the extremes to fit a negative belief in what it is saying, when it is convenient that is.

My councilor whom I discuss every decision that effects our family with before making a decision. Her opinion, perspective and wisdom is key to US making wise decisions for our family.

But jesus is forever and can always be counted on to be perfect, Holy and Righteous. Not so with me, a flawed human being whom my daughters have seen fall short of perfection on many levels.\n \n But just as I have lovingly nurtured them through their growing pains, so have they loved me through mine.

You are attempting to blame Bush on our future problems as if he alone holds all of the economic purse strings and controls over our economic condition when we have the House and Senate who vote on the budget and create spending bills. \n \n And we haven't sold Americas infrastructure to foreign governments under Bush alone. You can thank Clinton and other Administrations for that reality also. Between China, Great Britain, Saudi Arabia and Japan, more real estate and businesses in the US are foreign owned than are American owned. We are essentially renters in our own home today as Americans. And these foreign overlords can call in their loans at any time they choose to.\n \n So don't say this situation has happened overnight as you imply because it hasn't.

I suspect he would have experienced a far more painful and long lingering death at the hands of the mob had he not done so.\n \n I'm guessing that millions of people, including a lot of Muslims all over the world find her murder repugnant...and all you can do is blame Bush.\n \n What I blame is people like you who cannot be convinced that to fight terrorism is prerequisite to the survival of free societies.",

   "US support? Can you prove that? And that is Bush's fault automatically? Can you confirm that he was even President when Musharraf came to power? Because my sources say that on oct 13th 1999 when he took power in a bloodless coup your hero hillbilly Clinton was still playing his sex games in the oval office. See a timeline: http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSB27051520071103\n\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/20/AR2007112002304_pf.html\n \n \nBush More Emphatic In Backing Musharraf\n He Says Leader 'Believes in Democracy'\n \n By Michael Abramowitz and Robin Wright\n Washington Post Staff Writers\n Wednesday, November 21, 2007; A01\n \n \n \n President Bush yesterday offered his strongest support of embattled Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, saying the general \"hasn't crossed the line\" and \"truly is somebody who believes in democracy.\"\n \n Bush spoke nearly three weeks after Musharraf declared emergency rule, sacked members of the Supreme Court and began a roundup of journalists, lawyers and human rights activists. Musharraf's government yesterday released about 3,000 political prisoners, although 2,000 remain in custody, according to the Interior Ministry.\n\n \n http://www.latimes.com/news/columnists/la-oe-brooks15nov15,1,3219564.column\n \n \nIn 1999, when Musharraf, then Pakistan's army chief of staff, seized control of the government in a military coup, it was a domestic power grab, not a change of heart about Islamic extremism or nuclear weapons. (Throughout 1999 and 2000, for instance, Pakistan's top scientists enthusiastically sold nuclear weapons technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea with, many analysts suspect, Musharraf's approval.)\n \n The Clinton administration -- and most of the rest of the world -- responded with comprehensive sanctions designed to isolate Musharraf's autocratic, extremist regime and support Pakistan's moderate democratic opposition. \n \n But not you! You had to go and make Musharraf your new best friend. Sure, after 9/11, Musharraf saw which way the wind was blowing, and he smiled a crocodile smile, denounced extremism and promised to root out Al Qaeda. So you handed him more than $4.7 billion of military funding in the three years after 9/11. Compared with the three years before 9/11, that was a 50,000% increase in U.S. military aid to Pakistan. By 2007, our handouts exceeded $10 billion. Musharraf must have thought he'd hit the jackpot.\n\n \n http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=3280296\n \n \nBush's support for Musharraf, Malinowski said, \"appears to align the United States behind one man against virtually every decent segment of Pakistani society against the very people in the country who are most likely to be America's friends and to support a moderate, modern course for Pakistan.\"\n \n Musharraf is estranged from moderates, relies politically more on Islamists and refuses \"to crack down on the Taliban elements who are killing American and NATO troops in Afghanistan,\" Malinowski said.\n\n \n I cna provide thousands more.\n \n \nThen by all means, let me repeat myself for your viewing pleasure. Because like it or not, this is a true statement.\n\n \n If this is a true satatement, why is it that we have not gotten them?\n \n \n \nHow does it feel to be able to rewrite history to satisfy your warped perspective on virtually everything in life Daewoo? If it was just Bush spending money like a wildman, why has he had to veto so many democratic bills with hidden expenditures buried deep within them in the hopes that their pork projects would get through unnoticed? \n\n \n I am trying to decide if you are a fool or a liar. The FACT is that the first time Bush EVER vetoed ANYTHING was in the 5th year of his presidency when he vetoed a stem cell bill. In the meantime he oversaw the largest expansion of government and money supply since WWII (running the printing presses full speed). At the same time he and his fellow republicans launched the biggest social program since the new deal. \n \n \nWe have been involved in a war on terror on two fronts while building confidence in the US economy after 9/11 when everyone was holding onto their money out of fear of the unknown yet to come.\n \n \n Really? What are those 2 fronts? Afghanistan obviously, but the only other country I am aware of where we are at war is Iraq, and that had nothing at all to do with the war on terror. \n \n \nI know I wasn't thinking about taking a vacation via plane or buying any luxury items at that time, and neither were any of my friends or family. And the Car, Home and Real Estate sales numbers Nation wide proved that was a National attitude based on an over all sense of insecurity over the future.\n\n \n More stupidity and lies. Archie....you knwo every time you lie it makes jesus cry, right? After the 9-11 attacks home and real estate values kept shooting right on up for another 4 years before they even started to falter. In the meantime Bush charged 3 trillion on the national credit card. \n \n \nThe only solution the Left offered at that time was their usual tax increase on the American people. This only would have slowed Corporate growth, spending and caused people to restrict spending and growing the economy even more. In addition, by not standing up to radical islam as we have, and no matter how expensive it has been, we would have been attacked again by now just as the Terrorists have attacked other liberal Socialist Countries at will in order to force their leaders to submit to their demands.\n\n \n Another lie. NOBODY was proposing tax increases at the time. Not the bush camp, not the democrats. NOBODY. In case you missed it, in 2000 we were in a recession. What Bush DID do was lower taxes while instituting MASSIVE spending increases. The inevitable outcome of that is increased debt service costs and inflation. \n \n \n \nI agree that America's days are numbered as a Superpower. I'm glad to finally hear a liberal admit it too. \n\n \n If you are referring to me, I am generally 2 steps to the right of Pat Buchanan. You are the only liberal in this conversation.\n \n \nI have been saying that for sometime now. But i haven't been speaking to the long term economy in my argument above. I have been speaking to how this President pulled America out of a potential economic collapse post 9/11/01. You are attempting to blame Bush on our future problems as if he alone holds all of the economic purse strings and controls over our economic condition when we have the House and Senate who vote on the budget and create spending bills. \n\n \n There was no potential economic collapse. Just a lot of years of badly needed recession to bring us back into balance. Yea....don;t blame bush alone....he is jsut the guy who WRITES THE BUDGETS. The republicans who were controlling congress at the time certainly deserve some blame for passing it, but at the end of the day Bush composed it, got it passed, spent the money, then did his damndest to hide it from the American people. \n \n \nAnd we haven't sold Americas infrastructure to foreign governments under Bush alone. You can thank Clinton and other Administrations for that reality also. Between China, Great Britain, Saudi Arabia and Japan, more real estate and businesses in the US are foreign owned than are American owned. We are essentially renters in our own home today as Americans. And these foreign overlords can call in their loans at any time they choose to.\n\n \n Untrue. First of all, if we were selling our infrastructure at least we would be getting something for it. In most cases we are just shutting it down and mothballing it. Second, foreign purchases of infrastructure and assets are higher under bush than any other president in history. In the 70's Saudi Arabia considered using some of their oil wealth to buy up shares in American companies and infrastructure and were told in no uncertain terms that doing so woudl be considered an act of war and would be responded to as such. That was our official policy until Bush hit office. Foreign investors were always allowed to invest in US businesses as long as they did not take a particularly large stake in any one business and did not try to take voting stake in critical industries. Last week, the chinese took a large voting stake in citibank, our largest bank. Bush allowed a reversal of our 30 yr old policy because his reckless fiscal policies have driven our economy down to the point that we are having to take desperate measures just to stay afloat...like selling our largest bank to the chinese. \n \n \nSo don't say this situation has happened overnight as you imply because it hasn't. It has taken decades and is the result of legislation written in our Congress that has allowed our National Assets to be sold off to other Countries who hold no loyalty or concern for the long standing security of the US. That is why we're in this situation and not just because we have Bush as our President.\n\n \n Again, as I said in my last post, we were in trouble when bush came to office. What Bush has done is ensure there is no possible way that we can survive the aftermath. Selling assets to foreigners is not the cause of our problems, it is an effect. The fact that such sales have ballooned under bush is the result of the fact that he has done so much irreperable damage to our economy. In any bankruptcy proceeding the last step before dissolution is liquidation.",

The next 300 it could have been called a mistake. Now it is just a lie passed on by XXXXXX who cannot get their facts straight. \n \n The sudanese offered to arrest bin laden and turn him over to the US. We had no case against him, though, so there was no possible way that we could have held them. We turned to the Saudis and tried to get the saudis to accept him (basically make him dissapear into a black hole saudi prison). Eventually they declined because despite the fact that they had deported BL and stripped him of his citizenship he still had a large support base there and they were afraid of the ramifications of trying to hold him. \n \n This was back in the good old days when lockign somebody up on suspicion with no evidence against them was a no no. The american public never would have stood for it. It was not like today when pitiful cowards are lining up around the block to hand over at the srop of a hat (or a well written sound bite) all the rights that previous generations of americans fought and died for. \n \n Then again, maybe your above statement is not exactly a lie. You ahev shown VERY clearly in the past that your view on rights is decidedly totalitarian Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini were all very vocal when it came to their views on rights, and the fact that everybody had to be willing to give up findamental rights in exchange for security from their enemies. Tossing people in prison on suspicion for the rest of their lives was the kind of thing those guys did routinely. Since that is where your views seem to run, I suppose it may seem to you that Clinton did the wrong thing by not completely trashing the constitution and jailing the guy forever based on suspicion. \n \n \nDiversion is not necessary. We're not talking about Bush's many mistakes and overspending. We're talking about Bush's role in the recent death of Bhutto. \n\n \n And I am saying that if we had not been supporting the unpopular, tyrannical dictator who seized power in a military coup and then proceeded to bolster the islamic fundamentalists in the nation, it probably would not have happened. Gee.....what do you know....once again supporting a tyrannical dictator turns out to be a bad idea....who would have thunk it?\n \n \nYou have evidently tried too many mushrooms. You misstate our goals for the sake of your argument. You present a negative of a black and white picture with the colors reversed. You are truly a sick puppy. \n\n \n Nope. Just more honest than you. Why do you think we are fighting the terrorists if not to be able to continue our meddling in the middle east? Our goal is simple. We want to wipe out the peopel who ae trying to stop our support of the tyrants in the ME. We are trying to kill those who oppose our direct support of regimes that kill and oppress millions of people. \n \n \nKill all terrorists and those who support them. That's a worthy cause. Get after it.\n\n \n It is also a childish generalization. More the masturbatory fantasy of a 12 year old boy than the thoughts of a grown man. \n \n In this case I personally approve of and support the terrorists struggle. I even admire them for it (though I dislike some of their methods that is more a cultural thing than anything else). Unlike you, I actually believe in concepts like freedom and liberty and find US support of tyrants and lunatics to be contemptible. I hope we stop. To you those are not concepts, they are just political buzz words to be rolled out when convenient (no matter how inappropriate their usage in a given situation). To somebody like you, they have no REAL meaning. They are jsut garbage tossed out to placate the masses and aid in your creation of masterbatory fantasies. \n \n In theory, those are the conerstone of our nation and you will have to excuse me if somewhere in the back of my mind there is this little voice that keeps telling me that we should not abandon those concepts just because it is convenient to do so, or because there is more profit in it, or becuase the people in question have darker skin than us, speak a different language, or wear funny looking hats. Maybe if I had been born a generation earlier, and with inbred, ignorant, redneck parents I would feel that increased profits and cheaper oil are more important than some sand niggers rights. I doubt it, but it is possible. \n \n I was not born a generation earlier and was not raised by racist inbred redneck scumbags, though, so I am stuck with the idea that all men are created equal and that they should all have the same rights even if they have darker skin than me, speak a different language, or wear a funny hat. Therefore I find it shameful that my nation would suppr tthe death and oppression of millions and find it even more shameful that the american public was not at all interested until they shoed up and killed a bunch of us. \n \n \nAsk your lovely wife if she'd like to live under either of them.\n\n \n That would be a pointless and idiotic question to ask since there is pretty much no possibility of her ever living under either of them. I will turn around right now (the Mrs is right behind me) and ask her if she feels it is her right to force other people on the other side of the word to live as she wishes them to. \n \n She says no. I also asked her if she thought it was OK to kill and oppress millions of people becuase it is convenient and she said no to that one as well. Did you have any more questions for her?",

Is she ready to commit suicide, maybe take a few others with her?\n\n \n LOL. What will my five yr old do? Hire your kids/grandkids as domestic servants at pennies a day. Unlike most americans, I actually think that economic matters are important. You would think others would as well since it is their savings account we are talking about, but most people find it boring, confusing, and simply do not care enough to learn about it. The up side to this is that it means that for people who DO take the time to learn, money is ludicrously easy to make and then protect against inflation. That one was a simple decision. When public disclosures show that guys like Dick Cheney, Warren Buffett, and George Soros are betting on not just economic decline in the US but actual economic collapse (and putting their money where their mouth is), it is time to get your money under an umbrella. Get it converted to other currencies and get it the hell out of the country. \n \n Amusingly enough, even now when the slide has started and is accelerating, most of your TV watching americans still have not figured out what is going on. To give you some kind of idea of the dollars decline rate, even when the DOW was running over 14,000 earlier this year you would have made more money buyin loonies, or euros, or pretty much any non dollar currency and stuffing it under a matress than you would have done with a dow or S&P index fund. The dollar is sliding quickly enough that it is no longer possible to stay even with low or moderate risk domestic investments. In order to stay ahead of dollar decline you would have to make high risk investments. \n \n I have been paying attention for the last 15 years and have not some kind of demented hero worship blind me as to what is going on.

Would it not be better for them if you would move them there now? Into the country whose currency that you have converted to, and have it placed? How can you be certain that country won't fall apart?\n\n \n Yep, pretty much. The US has had a good run but the party is over. Contrary to the laughable claims of the apologists, the decline of the US is not going to drag the rest of the world down the toilet and the rest of the world is not going to subsidize the US so we can live like kings while producing nothing. Just not going to happen.\n \n How do I know which countries are going down the tubes and which are not? It is called \"economic fundamentals\". You look at the basis of their economy and judge the soundness of that base. There will certainly be pain all around as the US economy fails, but that pain is not going to be equally felt, is not going to be permanent, and ultimatly when protecting assets from inflation the question is no whether the country whose currency you are holding is doing better or worse in a vacuum, but rather whether it is doing better or worse compared to your home country. For example, the Euro has actually fallen on an indexed scale (indexed against currencies of Europes trading partners) but the dollar has fallen so quickly in comparison that a Euro based investment at the beginnig of the year would have returned a handsome profit. \n \n How well nations have insulated themselves against a dollar decline is becoming its own metric when considering international investment. For example, the chinese have worked very hard to diversify away from an American centric trade economy. IF the US fell off the planet tomorrow, the chinese would certainly suffer, but not so much as to throw them into a recession. The Europeans are dumping money into asian economies at an incredible rate as a hedge against American economic failure. This is what is driving hte emerging markets investment boom (investment in emerging markets is up nearly 700% in the last 5 years). Those emergnig markets do not carry ties to the US. If we fail, it will have little or no effect on them. \n \n Why not move? That is actually a reasonable question. After all, many prominent Americans seem to be preparing to do just that, including our president whose family recently purchased 98,000 acres in S America and started construction on a fortified compound so extensive that it was mistaken for a military base in early reports. The truth of the matter is, I like it where I am at. I like my house and property, I like the people around here, and I am well liked in my area.

With the other candidates, I still think it's a wide open race if the RP support isn't as strong as I think it is.\n\n \n I tend to agree. If Paul can get some momentum up as far as the early states go I think he is a contender. I am actually optimistic about him winning New Hampshire. He seems to have massive support there and has won every straw poll in the state.\n \n If paul wins the nomination, he can give hillary a run for his money. Anybody but paul and the republicans may as well concede and save themselves the embaressment and expense of running a campaign against hillary that they are destiend to loose. Contrary to Archies somewhat paranoid view, the polling agencies are not all fronts for the rradicals in the democratic party, and they pretty much all show a hypothetical race between hillary and any of the republican front runners ending in a landslide victory for her.\n \n I really do think that if Paul can get the repulican nomination, he can beat hillary. He can take the antiwar vote from her and he can take the fiscal conservatives vote from her. In the end those are two large and important voting blocks, you cannot possibly win without at least one of them, and Paul is the only guy with the credentials to take either of those groups. \n \n That is the optimist in me talking. In reality, I expect paul to lose the primaries, the republicans will send one of the other XXXXXX they have running up against either Hillary or Obama, and they will lose in a landslide defeat which puts us in the unfortuante position of having Hillary Clinton in office. I mean, lets face it, at this point only the die hard delusionals think for even one minute that the republicans have a chance in hell of holding the white house against a clinton ticket or (nightmare scenario for the repubs) a clinton/obama ticket. \n \n A vote against Ron Paul is a vote for Hillary.",

I want to see Obama as president.\n\n \n Unfortunately the Gospel of Matthew is not in harmony with history:\n \n Wikipedia: \n \n \nCongressional opposition to lifting the ban on gay and bisexual people in the armed forces was led by Democratic Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia who organized Congressional hearings that largely buffed the armed forces position that has remained unchanged since the 1981 directive. While Congressional support for reform was led by Democratic Congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who fought for a compromise, and retired Republican Senator Barry Goldwater, who argued for a complete repeal of the ban. After a large number of people flooded the Congressional phone lines with oppositions to lifting the ban, President Clinton soon backed off on his campaign promise to lift the ban on homosexual and bisexual people in the armed forces. The final result was a Congressional compromise of \"Don't ask, don't tell\" that was later amended to include \"don't harass\". \n\n \n So you have Clinton mucking about making campaign promises he has no intention of keeping which results in a Democratic Senator rallying opposition while a REPUBLICAN sides with Barney Frank in favor of repeal! As soon as Clinton has a compromise he bails and sells you out ye sucker!!! Oh ye 43%!!!\n \n How long do you think it will take Hillary to sell you out in the name of \"consensus building\" with republicans in congress? Oh Matthew, dear simple Matthew.

And it proves that the government is not very good at central economic planning, even for retirement. The money was taken from the people with good intention. We should do our best to return it to those that have taken it. But we need to allow the young people to just flat out get out of the system.

He has chosen his side and no amount of fact is going to get in the way.\n \n Same deal when it comes to managing the poor. Look at Mugabe. He has run Zimbabwe into the ground. IT has gone from being the breadbasket of africa to a place where people starve in the street. HE gets up a couple times a month, claims solidarity with the poor, and they love him. To a poor person in Zimbabwe the fact that he has destroyed the place and enriched himself in the process is irrelvant, jsut like the fact that Bush has done possibly unrecoverable damage to the US on both foreign and economic policy fronts means nothing to Archie.

Neither is true. \n \n The truth of the matter is that I would prefer it if things were to stay the way they are now. Right now most Americans have a pretty good standard of living, and even our lower class mostly lives like kings compared to most lower class people in the world. I have been places where most of the people are destitute and they are not pleasant places. \n \n Once again you are confusing my statemets about how things are with how I think things should be. I am not sure I have ever discussed the second here since discussions about how I think things should be would be a futile waste of bandwidth. \n \n You also seem to be incorrectly assuming that I consider myself to be part of the wealthy elite.

You are precisely like that already...just change the description of the oppressed and it fits you to a tee. \n \n \n \n\n I was not born a generation earlier and was not raised by racist inbred redneck scumbags, though, so I am stuck with the idea that all men are created equal and that they should all have the same rights even if they have darker skin than me, speak a different language, or wear a funny hat. Therefore I find it shameful that my nation would support the death and oppression of millions and find it even more shameful that the american public was not at all interested until they shoed up and killed a bunch of us. \nAre you implying that those who differ with your views were raised by racist inbred redneck scumbags?\n \n You know, the more I see of what you write, the more I believe I was totally correct several years back in my conclusion that you do not live the life you would like us to believe you do. A big internet fake is all you are.\n \n \n \n\n That would be a pointless and idiotic question to ask since there is pretty much no possibility of her ever living under either of them. \nPerhaps you think she is not intelligent enough to figure out that the question actually is to discover one's opinion of such harsh treatment of women rather than to explore the possibility of something like that happening to her.\n \n ..or perhaps you don't even have a wife.\n \n \n \n I will turn around right now (the Mrs is right behind me) and ask her if she feels it is her right to force other people on the other side of the word to live as she wishes them to. \nWhat a strawman way to put it.\n \n \n\n She says no. I also asked her if she thought it was OK to kill and oppress millions of people becuase it is convenient and she said no to that one as well. Did you have any more questions for her?\nOf course she would say no to either of those questions. Neither one was the one to ask. I see you train your imaginary wife in strawman idiocy also.\n \n This is one of the most offensive posts you have made in a while. Keep it up. You're real character is coming out.",

   "Don't claim to know where I stand regarding anything. You've made so many misstatements in the past, you can't be trusted to truthfully state what I believe in.\n\n \n I have been reading your posts literally for years now, Jim. While I will be the first to agree that they are usually devoid of fact, often ignorant and typically display a grasp of the subject matter that is decidedly childlike, I think I have managed to get a pretty good grasp on your opinion an many issues. If not, you are without question the worlds worst communicator because I have literally read hundreds of your posts on these matters.\n \n While I know you do not like to be portrayed as a sultural or nationalist elitist and an unrepentent authoritarian follower, there is no question that you certainly fall under both categories. You have made that quite clear over the years. \n \n \nAre you implying that those who differ with your views were raised by racist inbred redneck scumbags?\n\n \n Nope. Just saying that if I had such an upbringing I might have views that more closely resemble yours. I certainly do not mean to make any assumptions about your own upbringing or background. I would imagine that if I was lobotomized I might share your grasp of facts. If I was raised by neo nazis I might share your authortarian streak. That certainly does not mean that averybody who fails to grasp simple facts has been lobotomized, or that all authoritarians are neo nazis or raised by neo nazis. It is just an example of occurances that might make me share your viewpoints. \n \n \nYou know, the more I see of what you write, the more I believe I was totally correct several years back in my conclusion that you do not live the life you would like us to believe you do. A big internet fake is all you are.\n\n \n That may well be. If so, I am in internet fake with incredible prophetic powers when it comes to the economy. In fact, if I started out as an internet fake and applied the economic viewpoints I have exressed just here on this board, I would be wealthy by now. \n \n That is neither here nor there. The simple fact of the matter is that this post is just more of the mudslinging that you can be counted on to when your position has not only been proven to be wrong but foolish and illogical as well. That is the primary reason I have avoided answering your psots for the last several months. As the Bush administration ahs fallen apart and been revealed as a bunch of fools and liars, you have become a little on the venemous side. I don't blame you. Your entire belief system has likely been shaken to the core. It appreas you have adopted the Missouri Mule method of beleif management. You accept that the facts prove you wrong and then nuscle ahead without changing your opinions. Good for you! It can be hard to stick to your guns when you are RIGHT. It must be doubly so when all the facts are against you and there is no question that you are dead wrong!\n \n I admire your determination and tenacity if not your intelligence or honesty!\n \n \n \nPerhaps you think she is not intelligent enough to figure out that the question actually is to discover one's opinion of such harsh treatment of women rather than to explore the possibility of something like that happening to her.\n\n \n No, I am sure she is capable of understanding the question. Apparently you fail to understand that without the other questions that one is moot. If my wife does not wish to live under the Taliban, she simply has to ensure that we keep them out of office here. Where you seem to be leading with this bit of idiocy is that if she does not want to live under them then we should make steps to ensure that others do not have to. The problem there is that, as has been amply demonstrated by the latest electiosn in IRaq, there are apparently plenty of people who WANT to live under an islamic fundamentalist government. What your arguemnt here seems to boil down to is that since she would not want to, they should not be able to.\n \n I know it may be difficult for you to understand, but there are different cultures out there that hold beliefs that are different from yours, Jim. Some people PREFER to live under a strict religous regime. I do not understand why (I do not understand why a lot of religous people do the things they do) but I don't have to understand....they apparently do and that is all that really matter. Their right to self determination trumps my desire to force them to live as I wish. \n \n Whenther they want to live under areligous regime, or be communists, or wirship jojo the freak boy is of little importance to me. What DOES matter is that regardless of any of the above options they choose, or any option we haev not even touched on here, their right to self determination trumps any desire I might have, or you might have, or George Bush might have, to shove a government down their throat. That means that supporting tyrants and dictatorships is a no-no. \n \n \nThis is one of the most offensive posts you have made in a while. Keep it up. You're real character is coming out.\n\n \n Wow. All this time and you are just now figuring out that I have little or no patience with fools? I think most people figure that out after reading just a few of my posts.",

IT has gone from being the breadbasket of africa to a place where people starve in the street. HE gets up a couple times a month, claims solidarity with the poor, and they love him. To a poor person in Zimbabwe the fact that he has destroyed the place and enriched himself in the process is irrelvant, jsut like the fact that Bush has done possibly unrecoverable damage to the US on both foreign and economic policy fronts means nothing to Archie.

I apologize for my wrong assessment. \n \n\n \n I can understand where you may have come to that conclusion since I discuss things like the power elite and the fact that the wealthy run the country without showing any particular distain for the situation. If I had enough money to be part of the power elite, I would probably like it, but I don't, so I dislike it. I just don't see a whole lot of point in railing against it since it is so deeply engrained in America now that there is no fighting it. \n \n I do have a certain amount of power locally, but that is not so much the result of whatever wealth I have managed to sock away as it is the result of some of the charitable activities I have engaged in since I retired. I formed a group of concerned citizens and so far we have opened a soup kitchen and expanded it to a distro center for food for the needy, then I bought an old day camp and we rehabbed into a big homeless shelter and turned 19 of 22 of the cabins into family living units 93 units to a cabin) and provide a safe, comfortable environment for families who have lost their homes. I actually do brag about the homeless shelter a bit because I toured a bunch of shelters before we started and most of them were either total dumps or were like cots set up in a church basement. Ours is actually a NICE PLACE. It is more reminiscent of a vacation spot than a homeless shelter (mostly due to its origins). \n \n We have day care (so parents can continue their jobs or look for work), phones in the units, activiteies for the kids, TVs in all the units. The parents there let their kids play outside. It is a nice, safe place for families in trouble. Part of the reason it has worked out that way is that pretty much all of our current residents were previously middle class who found themselves adrift and screwed as jobs left the area and home prices went through the floor. So, I am actually pretty proud of that place. I almost have it to where it will be financially self sustaining and I feel like it actually helps people. Unlike the food kitchen that is really just a band aid when people come to the shelter it gives them a chance to relax a little, takes some of the pressure off, gives them a chance to take stock. We have good financial people who help them file bankruptcies, negotiate with their lenders, and we basically try to get them a new start in life. Most of them really are good people who have worked their whole lives and really thought they were doing things \"right\". \n \n Anyway, I have digressed. Like I said, I am proud of that place and I am proud of the people there. Originally we budgeted for a 6 person maintenance staff. We have not had to hire a maintenance person yet because the guests there volunteer their time to help keep the place up and running. We originally budgeted for a half dozen day care people but only ended up having to hire one because there are always guests (usually women who are either out of work or who have never worked) who volunteer to help out in the day care center. Like I said...GOOD people.",

   "I thought you owned a business haha, you should know the power of marketing. Our government could sell shoes to a man with no legs. \n \n\n \n \n I got an interesting viewpoint on this last night. I was sitting around with an old friend who came down to go hunting over the new years holiday (and apparently drink profusely). He has run a few political campaigns and works primarily as a political advisor. His take on this is that it is not necessarily that people actually believe the outrageous lies we are expected to swallow, it is that they refuse to disbelieve them, so even though it is crystal clear to even the most retarded ape that it is a lie, it does not matter. \n \n He also said that there are certain lies that you are just kind of allowed to tell. The example he used was republican fiscal conservativism vs democrats fiscal recklessness. The truth of the matter is that for the last 20 years, the democrats have had a MUCH better record than the republicans when it comes to fiscal matters. The image of the fiscally responsible republic is just so burned into the american psyche that you can pull it out and use it even though it is clearly untrue. The funny thing about that was that I almost started to argue with him about it until I stopped and thought about it. Reagans fiscal policies were a trainwreck, Bush Srs were not terrible, but nothing great either. Shrubs have been a nightmare. The only president in the last 20 years who has shown any kind of fiscal restraint or sanity has been bubba clinton. If you look at democratic vs republican congresses the same pattern holds. \n \n He also said there is a lot of perception control that goes on. For example when they were trying to sell the prescription drug scam to the American people it was decided early on that one key to doing so would be to ensure that the word \"medicare\" was always in front of it when a supporter talked about it. It was always to be \"The MEDICARE prescription drug plan\". This is because in their minds people associate \"medicare\" with free health care for mom and dad. The fact that the bill itself was designed to screw old people and put all our taxpayer dollars in drug companies pockets was irrelevant. In focus groups he said that they found that even when given no actual information about the program itself, almost every person in the test group (the group where it was referred to ONLY as the \"medicare prescription drug program\" believed at the end of the session that the program provided free or reduced price drugs to seniors even though they were never told that. \n \n The other little trick he was telling me about was leveraging the perception that government is a complicated entity and complicated things happen there that most of us commoners woudl not understand. This helps in cases where people actually DO read things like the patriot act or the prescription drug scam and get the very distinct feeling that they are getting screwed. The perception of a vast and complex government and legal structure leaves them feeling like they must jsut not understand entirely what they are looking at.\n \n That last one is interesting because I made a similar point here a while back about economics not being as complex as many seem to thing, and that if it won't work for your checking account, it probably won;t work for our national checking account.",

Apparently it failed in Texas but they told Bush it was a major success so he believed them and made the national law. Almost every teacher objects to this act and finds it to be a burden on the schools and children. In fact, some schools are now just flat out refusing to comply with the act. I heard on the radio the other day that one school just ignored threats by the federal government and plans to do what they want regardless of the consequences (which are apparently nothing). \n \n To go along with that, apparently school vouchers are a crappy idea for many states (I concede that perhaps not all). I was reading an NJEA (new jersey education) report and apparently most private schools would refuse vouchers. Yesterday I heard Mike Huckabee speak on Hannity's radio show and he didn't support a voucher program for Arkansas because he said the majority or private schools said they would rather shut down than accept vouchers. Furthermore, he said it would literally bankrupt the state because of the rural nation in my counties. Hannity blasted him for it and asked if he would support the same thing as a governor to which Huckabee replied \"its a state issue and it may work for some states but not mine\". Needless to say, Huckabee showed up Hannity easily by using common sense and knowledge. I personally used to like the idea but after reading some data on it, it seems like a horrible idea for many areas. So perhaps the voucher thing should be \"bankrupt the schools act\".\n \n \n \nor maybe for when they buy up all the junk sub prime paper out there and monetarize them, thus bailing out the big banks and wealthy investors while totally screwing the American people.\nNo, this act will be called the \"Right to Housing Act\" or similar. \n \n Clearly we are not as creative with word choices as Congress is.

   "Speaking of this act, have you ever looked into the results in Texas and how that translated to the US Act along with the US teacher reaction? Apparently it failed in Texas but they told Bush it was a major success so he believed them and made the national law. Almost every teacher objects to this act and finds it to be a burden on the schools and children. In fact, some schools are now just flat out refusing to comply with the act. I heard on the radio the other day that one school just ignored threats by the federal government and plans to do what they want regardless of the consequences (which are apparently nothing). \n\n \n Come on, Steeeve, you and I both have seen too much of Bush to believe this is true. What really happened is that thouands of teachers, principals, education experts and consultants told him the plan sucked and was not working. Then one person with no background in education at all who wanted to kiss his butt told him \"OH YEAA...its going GREAT\". And he chose to listen to that one person who told him what he wanted to hear. \n \n \nTo go along with that, apparently school vouchers are a crappy idea for many states (I concede that perhaps not all). I was reading an NJEA (new jersey education) report and apparently most private schools would refuse vouchers. Yesterday I heard Mike Huckabee speak on Hannity's radio show and he didn't support a voucher program for Arkansas because he said the majority or private schools said they would rather shut down than accept vouchers. Furthermore, he said it would literally bankrupt the state because of the rural nation in my counties. Hannity blasted him for it and asked if he would support the same thing as a governor to which Huckabee replied \"its a state issue and it may work for some states but not mine\". Needless to say, Huckabee showed up Hannity easily by using common sense and knowledge. I personally used to like the idea but after reading some data on it, it seems like a horrible idea for many areas. So perhaps the voucher thing should be \"bankrupt the schools act\".\n\n \n I have come to similar conclusions for similar reasons. The principla of the private school my daughter atteds told me that they had discussed the issue at great length and decided that if vouchers ever became a reality they would not accept them. The problem as he explained it is that private schools sucess is not just based on improved methods and better use of money. It is, to some extent, based on the fact that their clientel typically does not include the dregs of society, while the clintel of failing schools often does. Basically they decided that they could not ensure that if they willed their halls with inner city kids and rural kids that they could provide an education to ANYBODY, much less EVERYBODY. \n \n I will be the first to agree that is a little sad, but I keep hearing over and over from multiple different sources that eh key to educational sucess is parental involvement and that the quality of the school is secondary. I have served on our local school board and that certainly seems to be the case from what I have seen. The problem is not a fiscal one, so the solution is not likely to be a fiscal one. \n \n \nClearly we are not as creative with word choices as Congress is. I guess I'll never become a senator.\n\n \n Thats not a problem...you just hire people to spin it for you. I would think that the biggest problem would be learnign to deliver that BS to the public with a straight face.",

Of course the teachers thought it sucked and said so...the dropout rate increased by an insane amount. Even the basic numbers were clearly available.\n \n \nI have come to similar conclusions for similar reasons.

Ever hear Chris Rock's joke on this? He talks about a girl at the dance club on a Wednesday night with 2 kids at home and how you can't get \"your groove on and your kid on at the same time\" and to \"teach your kid something before he robs me in 10yrs\". While it is comedy he actually makes a good point. Until you change the education at home your schools aren't gonna do much good. For all the #### the evangelicals get, at least they are right that many things start in the home. It's not even that hard. My parents would just tell me to read a book before I went and played and vacations consisted of some educational value and not just a trip to the beach. Little things like that make you use your brain and not be a complete XXXXX. \n \n Now, I am not sure how the government can help with this and perhaps can't but throwing money at it doesn't work and NCLB doesn't work and, yes, creating boring schools (no fine arts) doesn't help either. \n \n \nThats not a problem...you just hire people to spin it for you. I would think that the biggest problem would be learnign to deliver that BS to the public with a straight face.\nHmmm, but I'd have to make laws that would benefit me while looking like they benefit the middle class and poor. There is an area where I'd love to live near the James River in Virginia but there happens to be a bad neighborhood in this pretty spot. Perhaps I can create the \"Better Homes and Gardens Act\" in the VA legislature which would allow me to transport all the people who correctly live there to an area no one likes and then I can develop the land with rich homes for high class people. I may not even have to do this thanks to the Supreme Court but I think I am getting the hang of this name thing for laws. \n \n Ha, my ethics are getting in the way of such ideas I guess.",

However - I do think we need to be careful not to dismiss the need for those resources. Especially that safe environemnt - that is a big problem in a lot of urban schools. I live in rough area, but my son does not go to school here. He attends a downtown magnet school right now and I will b trucking him to the other side of the city for high school.",
