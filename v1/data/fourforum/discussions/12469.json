We sent 2 Battle groups and numerous cruisers, helicopters and transport planes to aid the tsunami victims for the ships ability to desalinize thousands of gallons of salt water a day if memory serves, and as we converted the ships into hospitals. And that was just the tip of the iceberg of America's contribution to that tragedy.\n \n Of course we got no credit for that humanitarian aid because it was a republican president. You know, Bush? So all your mockery proves is that you have no idea how to utilize the military resources we possess in a positive way.\n The U.S. military response in the region continues and grows, Bush said. \"American military assets in the region are now aiding recovery efforts,\" he said. \"Patrol and cargo aircraft have been surveying damage and delivering supplies for several days. Air Force C-130s are flying aid missions 24 hours a day.\"\n \n The U.S. Navy's Abraham Lincoln Carrier Battle Group is off the coast of Sumatra and transporting relief supplies by helicopter. \"Other naval and Marine assets will arrive shortly to generate clean water and provide further logistical help,\" Bush said.\n \n In addition to the Abraham Lincoln group, the Bonhomme Richard Expeditionary Strike Group will be arriving in the region Jan. 4, said Marine Brig. Gen. John Allen, DoD's coordinator for tsunami-relief efforts.\n \n Allen stressed that military forces are working very closely with host nations. \"These operations are operations for the countries themselves,\" Allen said during a State Department briefing today. \"We work very closely with Thailand; we're working very closely with Indonesia; we're working very closely with Sri Lanka and the Maldives, because it will be in those areas in which the relief process will occur, and it is their relief.\"\n \n When the Bonhomme Richard group reaches the area, its 24 helicopters will join the 19 of the Lincoln group delivering humanitarian supplies to isolated areas. Another organization, Maritime Prepositioning Ship Squadron 3, is also headed to the theater, Allen said.\n \n The six ships in the prepositioning squadron, from Guam and Japan, are very large container ships. They can store up to 90,000 gallons of fresh water and can produce tens of thousands of gallons of fresh water a day, and helicopters can operate from aboard these vessels.\n \n Air Force planes are providing much of the lift capacity, Allen said. \"The Air Force has delivered, at this juncture, 430,000 pounds of supplies into the region,\" he said. \"C-130s are converging on the region; there are about 17 on the ground now.\"\n \n Larger aircraft -- C-17 Globemaster IIIs and C-5 Galaxys -- also are bringing in needed supplies and other relief equipment.DefenseLink News Article: Bush, Clinton to Head Relief Fund; Tsunami Aid Continues",

A case in point is Obama's speech yesterday which promised Iran that we want to create an new and peaceful co-existence with them which includes dialogue, trade and open tourism. Iran's response was that they will continue with their nuclear program without hesitation even though Obama said nothing at all about asking them to cease in that area at all in his speech.

It had a sheet metal body wrapped around a fragmentary coil. The M67, which is what is commonly issued to troops today, actually has a hardened steel body because they found they could use a thinner (and lighter) body that way because the body actually shatters when it explodes instead of tearing, which is what non hardened grenades do when they fragment. I dont know if you caught this or not, but grenades are full of explosives...mostly composition B. The bodies do not have to be made out of sheet metal for them to fragment when the charge detonates. \n \n Interestingly enough, the reason they have switched to the M67 as the standard issue grenade for troops outside of special forces is that it is the only grenade in the US arsenal that did not have a flat bottom, and since we are not supposed to use trip wires anymore (lest we be accused of setting improvised land mines), regular troops only get grenades that roll today.",

It had a sheet metal body wrapped around a fragmentary coil. \n\n \n And here is the backpedaling I foretold earlier. You are completely contradicting what you said above. Here is the M61: M61 FRAGMENTATION HAND GRENADE It is the thin sheet metal variety but does have the flat bottom which you clearly stated was conducive for being used as a hammer. But we now see it was not designed for that purpose at all since it is made from sheet metal rather than hardened steel with a machined bottom which you implied it was constructed from above based on your claim that the flat bottom was machined specifically for the purpose of driving in a nail for purposes of booby trapping. You are completely contradicting yourself daewoo. \n \n \n The M67, which is what is commonly issued to troops today, actually has a hardened steel body because they found they could use a thinner (and lighter) body that way because the body actually shatters when it explodes instead of tearing, which is what non hardened grenades do when they fragment. I dont know if you caught this or not, but grenades are full of explosives...mostly composition B. The bodies do not have to be made out of sheet metal for them to fragment when the charge detonates. \n \n Interestingly enough, the reason they have switched to the M67 as the standard issue grenade for troops outside of special forces is that it is the only grenade in the US arsenal that did not have a flat bottom, and since we are not supposed to use trip wires anymore (lest we be accused of setting improvised land mines), regular troops only get grenades that roll today.\n\n \n Now you are just contradicting what you originally said again. Your earlier point was that grenades are designed specifically with a flat hardened steel bottom so soldiers can use them as hammers to drive in the accompanying nails in order to set booby traps. Now you completely reverse this stance and post about this grenade M67 FRAGMENTATION HAND GRENADE which is steel, but it doesn't say \"hardened\" steel in the description, since it is designed to fragment rather than tearing when exploded. It is also round and doesn't appear to be conducive to being used as a hammer at all. So which is it, or better stated, how can this round grenade be considered safe for being used as a hammer any more than the M61 above which has the correct shape but is sheet metal rather than steel? The rock I originally mentioned as my first option if a hammer isn't available is looking more and more practical by the second.\n \n It also needs to be pointed out that to hit any explosive device which has a mechanical type fuse inserted into the body of explosives is the epitome of an illogical consideration which was the basis for the original point I made above. And nothing you have said here nullifies that concern I opined having.\n \n Anyway, I have e-mailed a young friend (compared to me anyway ;) ) who is currently serving in Afghanistan, he has been through both standard and special forces training and I'm confident will know the recommended policy for handling live hand grenades. I will post his response when I get it. As it currently stands though, it appears the logic bomber's logic has been blown to kingdom come.",

It does not really matter what you do with it as long as it does not involve a blasting cap.\n\n \n Look daewoo, you have lost all credibility with me and are basically full of crapola for a number of reasons. first, here is the current hand grenade being used by the US Military. M68 impact fragmentation hand grenade (United States) - Jane's Infantry Weapons As you can see it clearly says this:\n M68 impact fragmentation hand grenade (United States), Combat grenades - Hand\n \n Description \n The M68 is essentially the M67 fitted with a different fuze. The bodies and fillings are the same, as are the lethal radii and the throwing ranges.The fuze is the M217 and is activated in exactly the same way as the fuze in the M67: by releasing a safety lever as the grenade is thrown. The M217 fuze, however, is a rarity in that it is an impact fuze with a time delay as a back-up. The impact part of the fuze acts by an electrical detonator and by a tiny thermal power supply which is started by a powder train set off by the percussion cap. This thermal power supply requires 1 or 2 seconds to generate sufficient electricity, but after that the detonator will be fired if the grenade strikes a hard surface or is sharply jolted. Should the impact action fail for some reason, the powder train continues to burn and sets off the detonator by pyrotechnic action within 7 seconds.This complicated fuze is contained within a very small space in the body and is apparently highly reliable. The only effect of the size of the fuze is that temperature alters the delay times, which are quoted as lying between 3 seconds at +52\u00b0C and 7 seconds at -40\u00b0C, with a rough mean of 4.5 seconds at normal ambient of +20\u00b0C.\n Secondly, this grenade is also round and not designed to be used as a hammer just as any type as its predecessors were which you claim was the type you were issued.\n \n Thirdly based on the bolded which points out the concussion fuse it has, it would be insane to be hitting it against hard objects for any reason other than to try to tempt fate.\n \n Fourth, my buddy Mark could be out on detail and not get back to me for day's, so I asked my brother who was a drill sergeant in the Army. When I explained your claim and after I picked him up off of the floor from also laughing so hard at the suggestion that you have used a hand grenade as a hammer dozens of times, he simply said to ask you to provide any military manual which trains men to use any explosive devices at all in any ways except for the specific reason they were originally intended to be used for. In other words daewoo, the military makes specific tools for specific jobs and doesn't suggest improvising in the way you suggest with explosives.\n \n He said the thought of using a grenade for any purpose other than safely pulling the pin once you know the enemy range is clear of friendly soldiers and then lobbing it over there, not even throwing it like a fast ball mind you, is crazy dangerous and ill advised. He said that any soldier caught doing what you describe would either be written up, court marshaled, or recommended for a section 8. \n \n And lastly, I responded to your reference to the M61 and M67 grenades in my last response to you and you reply by disregarding them. My question is, why did you even mention them in the first place if you weren't holding them up as evidence in which to make your point? With that said, I leave you with your original statement which caused this exchange to take place and ask you to consider retracting it for the sake of salvaging your credibility.\n [daewoo] \n Or that we are intelligent people capable of exhibiting meaningful logic. \n \n I happen to know for an absolute fact that you can drive a nail with a hand grenade. I have done it dozens of times. In Archie world, that apparently make a hand grenade a hammer.\n And I will stand by my original response to you and place my logic, common sense and intelligence, WITH NO MILITARY EXPERIENCE AT ALL against your logic, alleged first hand knowledge and intelligence any day of the week. Along with my original response to your suggestion about using grenades as hammers. I will still post what Mark says in his response just to be fair though. emoticon_xbye\n [Archangel] \n Thanks for making my day with the comedy relief daewoo as you prove beyond any doubt how warped your idea of logic and intelligence is for all to see. Only in your mind would you deduce that driving a nail with a hand grenade is evidence of you being an intelligent person who is capable of using logic. Just for the heck of it though, did you ever consider picking up a rock or a tire iron instead, if an actual hammer wasn't available ? I know I would have looked for a rock rather than use a grenade. Does that option seem illogical and ignorant to you? \n \n Now, as the stupidity of admitting to such an IGNORANT and ILLOGICAL move sinks in, come back with your back pedaling, justifications and the feeble attempt to explain the logic of what doing such a foolish thing is in the real world. \n Your cheering squad has gone eerily silent also, huh? emoticon_xdonno emoticon_frazzled",

First have him request a copy of TM 31-200 which is improvised munitions. Then have him get a cope of TM 31-210 which is improvised incendiaries. Surely any military drill sergeant has a copy of FM 5-31, which is Booby Traps and includes such favorites as the tin can mine trap. Odd, I was never issued tin cans for that...kind of like I was never issued a hammer. I guess they did not think we would be framing many houses out there, and the 1 lb chunk of inert steel that is a hand grenade prior to pulling the pin would do the job nicely.\n \n Now, if you are still going to argue the expertise of your imaginary brother, any SF in the entire military has seen and studied FM 12-43, which covers things like mud ball grenades, tin can mines, and cartridge traps. Every one of the 26 (if you include the navy) unconventional warfare manuals also contain instructions for doing interesting things with your ordnance and equipment that was never intended by the guy who designed it. \n \n Simply put, if you DO have brother, and he IS a DI, and he DID make the statment you made above, he is a clueless fool. \n \n \n \nYour cheering squad has gone eerily silent also, huh? emoticon_xdonno emoticon_frazzled\n\n \n Cheering squad??? Ok....\n \n People do generally back off when I get ready to tear somebody apart, Archie.

They cannot issue a trip kit that requires a hammer unless they are going to issue the hammer with the kit.

I know I would have looked for a rock rather than use a grenade. Does that option seem illogical and ignorant to you? \n \n Now, as the stupidity of admitting to such an IGNORANT and ILLOGICAL move sinks in, come back with your back pedaling, justifications and the feeble attempt to explain the logic of what doing such a foolish thing is in the real world. \n\n \n \nOr, Archie does not know a damn thing about hand grenades, which have a flat, machined bottom. You can beat on the bottom all day without any risk of the thing going off. Most hand grenades have flat bottoms. Only US hand grenades have machined bottoms, and it is so you can drive a nail with them.\n \n For years the army has issued tripwire kits that included in the instructions \"Drive pivot pin into suitable wooden surface with base of grenade\". The pivot pin was a #20 nail with a groove machined in it about 2\" from the top. \n \n Leaving rocks that look like somebody has tried to use them as a hammer laying around your booby trap is a bad idea.\n\n \n \nSince you didn't see fit to actually produce any impartial evidence of your claim, I'm withholding a response until I can verify your claim. You see daewoo, my problem is that grenades aren't made with hardened steel but are specifically designed to fragment since it's the shrapnel they produce that kills. Therefore I struggle with your assertion that the military encourages soldiers to use them as a hammer. \n \n If I'm wrong about that, I'll admit it with no problem, but no way would I participate in such an activity even if it was allowed. I don't know, I just have a problem using something that's filled with high explosives and is designed to blow up as a hammer. Call me crazy, or is it the guy that does such a thing who's really the crazy one?\n\n \n \nThe only grenade that the US has ever used that you might possibly have damaged using as a hammer was the M61. It had a sheet metal body wrapped around a fragmentary coil. The M67, which is what is commonly issued to troops today, actually has a hardened steel body because they found they could use a thinner (and lighter) body that way because the body actually shatters when it explodes instead of tearing, which is what non hardened grenades do when they fragment. I dont know if you caught this or not, but grenades are full of explosives...mostly composition B. The bodies do not have to be made out of sheet metal for them to fragment when the charge detonates. \n \n Interestingly enough, the reason they have switched to the M67 as the standard issue grenade for troops outside of special forces is that it is the only grenade in the US arsenal that did not have a flat bottom, and since we are not supposed to use trip wires anymore (lest we be accused of setting improvised land mines), regular troops only get grenades that roll today.\n\n \n \nHere's a recap of this exchange.\n \n =\n And now you completely contradict what you said earlier!\n =\n \n And here is the backpedaling I foretold earlier. You are completely contradicting what you said above. Here is the M61: M61 FRAGMENTATION HAND GRENADE It is the thin sheet metal variety but does have the flat bottom which you clearly stated was conducive for being used as a hammer. But we now see it was not designed for that purpose at all since it is made from sheet metal rather than hardened steel with a machined bottom which you implied it was constructed from above based on your claim that the flat bottom was machined specifically for the purpose of driving in a nail for purposes of booby trapping. You are completely contradicting yourself daewoo. \n \n Now you are just contradicting what you originally said again. Your earlier point was that grenades are designed specifically with a flat hardened steel bottom so soldiers can use them as hammers to drive in the accompanying nails in order to set booby traps. Now you completely reverse this stance and post about this grenade M67 FRAGMENTATION HAND GRENADE which is steel, but it doesn't say \"hardened\" steel in the description, since it is designed to fragment rather than tearing when exploded. It is also round and doesn't appear to be conducive to being used as a hammer at all. So which is it, or better stated, how can this round grenade be considered safe for being used as a hammer any more than the M61 above which has the correct shape but is sheet metal rather than steel? The rock I originally mentioned as my first option if a hammer isn't available is looking more and more practical by the second.\n \n It also needs to be pointed out that to hit any explosive device which has a mechanical type fuse inserted into the body of explosives is the epitome of an illogical consideration which was the basis for the original point I made above. And nothing you have said here nullifies that concern I opined having.\n \n Anyway, I have e-mailed a young friend (compared to me anyway ;) ) who is currently serving in Afghanistan, he has been through both standard and special forces training and I'm confident will know the recommended policy for handling live hand grenades. I will post his response when I get it. As it currently stands though, it appears the logic bomber's logic has been blown to kingdom come.\n\n \n \nI honestly dont know if you could drive a nail with the base of an M61 or not. We used the M33, which is similar to the M67 but with the flat base. They stopped issuing M33s to infantry troops in 1998. \n \n I dont know about the M61. That is mostly vietnam era garbage. I am not entirely sure I have ever actually held a live one. By the time I was throwing grenades, they pretty much all used pre scored steel casings. \n \n \n First, I did not say the flat was hardened steel. I said it was machined. Machined does not necessarily = hardened. In the M33 and M67, they are hardened. The early M33 and M67 grenades were actually cast iron, as were the old Mk1 and MkII grenades. \n \n \n Composition B, which is what we have filled most of our grenades with for the last 40 years, is not impact sensitive. You can beat on a hand grenade all day with whatever you like and there is no risk of it going off as long as the handle is in place. A grenade firing is similar to a gun firing. They have a hammer that, when the handle is released, strikes a primer, which basically lights a 4 second fuse. Unless you light that fuse, the grenade is not going to explode. \n \n It is kind of like C4. You can cut it, beat it, throw it, tear it. Lighting it on fire and cooking with it is a time honored tradition among US troops. No matter what you do with it, it will not detonate without a detonator. Comp B is the same. It does not really matter what you do with it as long as it does not involve a blasting cap.\n\n \n \nLook daewoo, you have lost all credibility with me and are basically full of crapola for a number of reasons. first, here is the current hand grenade being used by the US Military. M68 impact fragmentation hand grenade (United States) - Jane's Infantry Weapons As you can see it clearly says this:\n M68 impact fragmentation hand grenade (United States), Combat grenades - Hand\n \n Description \n The M68 is essentially the M67 fitted with a different fuze. The bodies and fillings are the same, as are the lethal radii and the throwing ranges.The fuze is the M217 and is activated in exactly the same way as the fuze in the M67: by releasing a safety lever as the grenade is thrown. The M217 fuze, however, is a rarity in that it is an impact fuze with a time delay as a back-up. The impact part of the fuze acts by an electrical detonator and by a tiny thermal power supply which is started by a powder train set off by the percussion cap. This thermal power supply requires 1 or 2 seconds to generate sufficient electricity, but after that the detonator will be fired if the grenade strikes a hard surface or is sharply jolted. Should the impact action fail for some reason, the powder train continues to burn and sets off the detonator by pyrotechnic action within 7 seconds.This complicated fuze is contained within a very small space in the body and is apparently highly reliable. The only effect of the size of the fuze is that temperature alters the delay times, which are quoted as lying between 3 seconds at +52\u00b0C and 7 seconds at -40\u00b0C, with a rough mean of 4.5 seconds at normal ambient of +20\u00b0C.\n Secondly, this grenade is also round and not designed to be used as a hammer just as any type as its predecessors were which you claim was the type you were issued.\n \n Thirdly based on the bolded which points out the concussion fuse it has, it would be insane to be hitting it against hard objects for any reason other than to try to tempt fate.\n \n Fourth, my buddy Mark could be out on detail and not get back to me for day's, so I asked my brother who was a drill sergeant in the Army. When I explained your claim and after I picked him up off of the floor from also laughing so hard at the suggestion that you have used a hand grenade as a hammer dozens of times, he simply said to ask you to provide any military manual which trains men to use any explosive devices at all in any ways except for the specific reason they were originally intended to be used for. In other words daewoo, the military makes specific tools for specific jobs and doesn't suggest improvising in the way you suggest with explosives.\n \n He said the thought of using a grenade for any purpose other than safely pulling the pin once you know the enemy range is clear of friendly soldiers and then lobbing it over there, not even throwing it like a fast ball mind you, is crazy dangerous and ill advised. He said that any soldier caught doing what you describe would either be written up, court marshaled, or recommended for a section 8. \n \n And lastly, I responded to your reference to the M61 and M67 grenades in my last response to you and you reply by disregarding them. My question is, why did you even mention them in the first place if you weren't holding them up as evidence in which to make your point? With that said, I leave you with your original statement which caused this exchange to take place and ask you to consider retracting it for the sake of salvaging your credibility.\n [daewoo] \n Or that we are intelligent people capable of exhibiting meaningful logic. \n \n I happen to know for an absolute fact that you can drive a nail with a hand grenade. I have done it dozens of times. In Archie world, that apparently make a hand grenade a hammer.\n And I will stand by my original response to you and place my logic, common sense and intelligence, WITH NO MILITARY EXPERIENCE AT ALL against your logic, alleged first hand knowledge and intelligence any day of the week. Along with my original response to your suggestion about using grenades as hammers. I will still post what Mark says in his response just to be fair though. emoticon_xbye\n [Archangel] \n Thanks for making my day with the comedy relief daewoo as you prove beyond any doubt how warped your idea of logic and intelligence is for all to see. Only in your mind would you deduce that driving a nail with a hand grenade is evidence of you being an intelligent person who is capable of using logic. Just for the heck of it though, did you ever consider picking up a rock or a tire iron instead, if an actual hammer wasn't available ? I know I would have looked for a rock rather than use a grenade. Does that option seem illogical and ignorant to you? \n \n Now, as the stupidity of admitting to such an IGNORANT and ILLOGICAL move sinks in, come back with your back pedaling, justifications and the feeble attempt to explain the logic of what doing such a foolish thing is in the real world. \n Your cheering squad has gone eerily silent also, huh? emoticon_xdonno emoticon_frazzled\n\n \n \nYour reading comprehension has not improved. Go back and read the above again. \n \n \n \n The impact fuse is activated by a powder train that is activated by the percussion cap. Until you pop the top on the grenade, no amount of beating on it is going to make any difference at all.\n \n \n Your brother is either mentally retarded (which is possible if he is indeed a drill sergeant) or you made him up. First have him request a copy of TM 31-200 which is improvised munitions. Then have him get a cope of TM 31-210 which is improvised incendiaries. Surely any military drill sergeant has a copy of FM 5-31, which is Booby Traps and includes such favorites as the tin can mine trap. Odd, I was never issued tin cans for that...kind of like I was never issued a hammer. I guess they did not think we would be framing many houses out there, and the 1 lb chunk of inert steel that is a hand grenade prior to pulling the pin would do the job nicely.\n \n Now, if you are still going to argue the expertise of your imaginary brother, any SF in the entire military has seen and studied FM 12-43, which covers things like mud ball grenades, tin can mines, and cartridge traps. Every one of the 26 (if you include the navy) unconventional warfare manuals also contain instructions for doing interesting things with your ordnance and equipment that was never intended by the guy who designed it. \n \n Simply put, if you DO have brother, and he IS a DI, and he DID make the statment you made above, he is a clueless fool. \n \n \n Cheering squad??? Ok....\n \n People do generally back off when I get ready to tear somebody apart, Archie. They enjoy the show.\n \n BTW....while your imaginary brother is perusing the above field manuals, when he gets to the part about using the components from a trip flare kit to activate a grenade that is \"Firmly lodged between two rocks, logs, or bricks\" make sure he reads the part to you that says \"Drive the pivot pin using the butt of a knife or the base of your hand grenade\".\n \n You see, archie, what your imaginary brother failed to mention to you is that in the military, when they issue a piece of equipment or a kit, EVERYTHING you need to use it has to be included or they have to have damn good reason to believe you will have it. They cannot issue a trip kit that requires a hammer unless they are going to issue the hammer with the kit. The guy who is putting that kit together has to assume that you are naked, standing in the middle of a junge, with nothing but a hand grenade and whatever comes out of the kit he is putting together. He is not even allowed to assume that you will have a rock.\n\n \n \nThe only clueless fool around here is the guy making up the stories in order to cover his original lie. Through out this entire exchange I have only taken what you have said and proven it to be completely bogus. Much like I'm doing right now. You mention the TM 31-210 as a manual which will prove your claim that using a grenade as a hammer is recommended. Well here it is, feel free to point out the section under grenades which uses a grenade in such an irresponsible way. TM 31-210 Manual I've checked and it aint there. \n \n You are famous for talking big in order to intimidate while never actually proving anything daewoo. You boast about these manuals as if you are some expert who has read them through. If that is true then I have supplied all of the ammo you need to prove that you're not full of crapola and a blustering braggart who is nothing more than an empty suit. I invite you to prove your point. emoticon_xdonno\n \n Here's FM12-43 manual, Field Manual - US ARMY - FM 12-43 Mines and Boobytraps - eSnips, share anything Since you know it inside out, show me where it says to hammer in nails with hand grenades.\n \n And here's the TM 31-200 Manual, tm 31-200-1 unconventional warfare devices and techniques - references Again, show me where it says to use the hand grenade as a hammer.\n \n Here's a PDF download of the FM5-31 Manual, Fm 5 31 .Pdf Ebook Download Rather than just talk up a storm so you feel like you're saying something real, just go ahead and prove your point. I have supplied every reference manual you have mentioned. There is no excuse for you not to prove your point.\n \n Tear me apart? Are you kidding me or just lying to yourself again. Nothing in this exchange has gone your way because nothing you have said is based in fact at all. Unless of course you're finally willing and able to actually prove it this time.\n \n That's ok big mouth, I supplied you the manuals you mentioned as evidence. You go to the proper section and link me to the page to see for myself. OK? Can you do that right here and now for all to see that you're not full of crapola and a braggart? Prove me wrong, and as long as it comes from a military published manual then you will have proven my brother wrong also. See how easy it is daewoo? I've given you all of the ammo you need to blow me right out of the water. Aint life grand? emoticon_xbouncer\n \n My brother left the service in 1980, but based on the drivel you have been spewing I'm betting he is still better informed than you are. But just go ahead and prove your point since you mentioned these manuals, surely they provide the evidence you seek to prove my suspicions wrong. So for once in your life stop making unfounded and boastful claims and just prove what you say is true.\n",

People who have screamed \"prove it\" to me like a 3 yr old usually dont come out well. I dont carry any emotional baggage. I dont care enough about what strangers on the internet think to bother to lie. I have no emotional investment in the positions I take. I am generally known as an honest poster.\n \n You, on the other hand, are generally known as a dishonest poster, though I am not sure the title actually fits...I think you are just incapable of using linear logic. This very thread is an excellent example. You made a post that was pretty much unrelated to the article, which means that either you did not bother to read it or you read it, disagreed with it, and threw up a straw man to derail the thread. \n \n You made an observation and I used the hand grenade analogy to show that your logic was not rational. Since you apparently could not refute the fact that your logic was nonsensical, you set up another straw man re: proper care and feeding of hand grenades. \n \n Most people reading this thread are going to recognize that you have set up several straw men, and still cannot apparently manage to address the original post. Many, if not most, of them are going to draw the conclusion that you have done it on purpose and thus are dishonest. Personally I dont buy that. I have noticed that often people who are deeply religious and involved in an organized religion often lose the ability to think in a linear pattern because they condition themselves to believe a bunch of nonsense that comes with any organized religion. \n \n \n \nHere's FM12-43 manual, Field Manual - US ARMY - FM 12-43 Mines and Boobytraps - eSnips, share anything Since you know it inside out, show me where it says to hammer in nails with hand grenades.\n \n And here's the TM 31-200 Manual, tm 31-200-1 unconventional warfare devices and techniques - references Again, show me where it says to use the hand grenade as a hammer.\n \n Here's a PDF download of the FM5-31 Manual, Fm 5 31 .Pdf Ebook Download Rather than just talk up a storm so you feel like you're saying something real, just go ahead and prove your point.

SO, you may have more guts than brains...or guessed I was not going to dig through 500 pages of army field manuals to find you what you want. \n \n The dishonest option comes into play when it comes to your brother. If you DO in fact have a brother who is a drill sergeant, he would have explained to you why I said for HIM to pull them. For nearly 30 years now certain field and technical manuals have been restricted distribution, including every one on the list I gave you. That is why the version of the TMs you DID find are all over 20 years old.\n \n So, either you were lying about your brother, or you are being dishonest now and hoping that nobody will take the time to actually click on your links.

We have established that grenades will NOT explode if you beat on them, and we have established that the US military DOES encourage soldiers to use their explosives and munitions in ways that are not in keeping with the instructions provided with the device.\n \n In the end, though, this is a \"missing link\" argument, and I am ashamed to say that it took me this long to recognize it because no matter what is or is not proven regarding general grenade usage, the simple fact of the matter is that in the end I can not prove that I have personally used a grenade as a hammer. I do not have any photographic evidence that I have personally used a grenade for a hammer, and while it would not be impossible to get a grenade so I could take some pictures, it would be highly illegal and I am not willing to take the risk, but that is where we were headed, isnt it? Once we established that grenades will not explode if you beat on them, we narrow the range a little further and have to see if beating on them is common practice. And frankly, even that is a straw man because even if I am the only person on the planet that has ever used a grenade as a hammer, my point is still valid.\n \n So, I will change the example.\n \n Just because I can remove a screw with a knife, that does not make it a screw driver.\n \n Now, prior to saying that, I went out to the garage, got a screw, and I have a knife and a digital camera on standby. So, if you would like to see pictures of a screw being removed with a knife, I can post them.\n \n It does not change the fact that just because the military can be used from time to time for humanitarian missions, that does not make it the ideal tool for distributing humanitarian aid, just like the fact that I can remove a screw with a knife does not make it the ideal tool for the job. Knives are for cutting. Militaries are for killing. \n \n Of course, even that was a straw man...sheesh...we are 3 deep in them here...and all to cover for the fact that you either did not read the article, or you did, you disagree with it, but you cannot come up with a meaningful rebuttal.",

   "Congrats all. You once again let Archie derail a topic by arguing a stupid, irrelevant detail that has no bearing on the topic.\n \n Well done Archie! emoticon_xagree\n\n \n It was impressively done, though. \n \n One thing I have always liked about 4 forums is that there have always been a number of folks here who have taken formal debate and understand things like rules of logic. I took debate for 7 years, and thought I was good at it, but until Archangel did his little recap for OC I did not realize that we were 3 rather obvious straw men deep in this and chasing logic that was starting to look like a pretzel. \n \n I am not kidding. Assuming that was done intentionally and as part of a wider plan, it was IMPRESSIVELY done. This is especially true since the side argument he chose to build his straw man with was unwinnable. It was an off hand comment...nothing I would ever expect I would have to prove, because it has NOTHING AT ALL to do with the argument at hand. To twist that into the straw man that he did was absolutely masterful. \n \n If this had been a formal debate, the judges would be rolling around on the floor laughing and I would have ended up with negative points.",

   "So what you're saying is that you can't produce any evidence from the very manuals you referred to which you claimed would prove your assertion that they teach that using a hand grenade as a hammer is ok.

You mentioned various types of grenades first and I showed that your claims were inconsistent and incorrect. Then you posted these manual types rather than posting the evidence you allege they hold which would have proved you're telling the truth. \n \n The fact is that you were lying like hell when you said you know for a fact that a hand grenade can be used as a hammer and that you've done it dozens of times.

   "The article does make some good points, but it misses some very obvious ones like when he says:\n \n There were no al Qaeda in Iraq until the Americans brought them there by invading and overthrowing Saddam Hussein, who kept al Qaeda out of Iraq. The Taliban is not a terrorist organization, but a movement attempting to unify Afghanistan under Muslim law. The only Americans threatened by the Taliban are the Americans Bush sent to Afghanistan to kill Taliban and to impose a puppet state on the Afghan people. \n \n What is this guy smoking? They helped and supported OBL and yet they are not terrorists? I'm not going to say terrorists are not a threat, I certainly think they are, but we are just doing it all wrong. Why are helping the Saudis? They support OBL, who we are trying to capture, why are we helping out Israel, they can take care of themselves and they are mostly responsible for the drastic actions taken by Hamas and Hezbollah. I'm sure if your house and family got killed by Israel mortar fire just because they believe terrorists in there you'd take some drastic measures as well. I have said it many times, Israel and Saudi Arabia are not our friends. I think we can still keep an watchful eye and at the same time maintain our natural rights.

Then you posted the names to these manuals which obviously was another bluff job since they also do nothing in reality to support your cause.\n \n So here is what you learned in debate class daewoo. You learned to bluff with confidence and boldness. To even reference sources to bolster your position but never actually have to produce that specific info which means all you do is bluff your opponent, intimidate through bold assurance that you are right and lie like the dickens since nothing you are actually claiming is true.\n \n So I'll tell you what.

Remember, all I did was respond to everything you posted by posting documented info on what you claimed and in every case you were twisting facts.\n\n \n No, Archie, either you are as ignorant as your brother or you are just a LIAR. I posted the manuals I did because YOU DEMANDED IT. Specifically, you said:\n \n \nFourth, my buddy Mark could be out on detail and not get back to me for day's, so I asked my brother who was a drill sergeant in the Army. When I explained your claim and after I picked him up off of the floor from also laughing so hard at the suggestion that you have used a hand grenade as a hammer dozens of times, he simply said to ask you to provide any military manual which trains men to use any explosive devices at all in any ways except for the specific reason they were originally intended to be used for. In other words daewoo, the military makes specific tools for specific jobs and doesn't suggest improvising in the way you suggest with explosives.\n\n \n Now you are claiming that I tossed those out to prove my claim, when in fact it was AT YOUR DEMAND to rebut the foolish statement above. I will promise you that if you get your hands on the 4 manuals I mentioned and the 26 unconventional warfare manuals, you will find it in one of them because I remember very specifically reading it in an army field manual/ I even remember the diagram on the page (the diagram was for a booby trap built with a tank round...and jsut for the record, driving a nail with the base of a tank round WOULD be a foolish thing to do because there is a primer there). \n \n In fact, I did not at any point try to provide anything as \"proof\" for my claim.\n \n \n\n I also know that not all field manuals would be online because of the sensitivity of the info they carry.

The issue is that in your response to my prior post, you condescendingly held these manuals up as evidence which would support your claim that a hand grenade can properly be used as a hammer in the field.\n\n \n No, I did not, and you are lying. I held them up as the proof that you demanded by proxy to your imaginary friend. Also, the reason you found TM 31-210 online is that the version you found is 40 years old. \n \n \n \nOf course you were arguing an unwinnable point daewoo, because you are full of crapola in saying that using a hand grenade as a hammer is a good idea.

Then you posted the names to these manuals which obviously was another bluff job since they also do nothing in reality to support your cause.\n\n \n No, archie, YOU are the liar. I posted above in this very reply EXACTLY what your brother asked for, in your own words, including your moronic little smug editorial that CLARIFIES exactly what he meant. I posted the information he demanded and suggest that he get his hands on those 30 manuals and read them with you, and then you dishonestly suggested that I claimed I could show you the information in the 4 manuals that I listed by name, when in fact I did not post those as proof of my claim AT ALL, but rather in response to a direct demand by you. \n \n \n\n So here is what you learned in debate class daewoo. You learned to bluff with confidence and boldness. To even reference sources to bolster your position but never actually have to produce that specific info which means all you do is bluff your opponent, intimidate through bold assurance that you are right and lie like the dickens since nothing you are actually claiming is true.\n\n \n And what you should have just learned is that you need to shut up when you are ahead because if you keep going, you get slapped. \n \n \nSo I'll tell you what. Quote every straw man I posted and I will respond by posting the straw man arguments you were throwing around in every response to me.\n\n \n Name even ONE straw man I put up. \n \n \n \n \nOnly in the mind of a lunatic is it my burden of proof to disprove something you never posted one iota of evidence for in the first place.

Which explains why I challenged you on it in the first place when you used such a ridiculous example as a vehicle to mock me and my intelligence in your usual condescending and sanctimonious way.\n\n \n WRONG. I posted that your comparison was like claiming that since you can drive a nail with a hand grenade, that makes it a hammer. You came back and claimed that was a foolish and dangerous activity. It is up to YOU to prove that claim, Archie. The entire conversation about whether or not it is generally practiced was essentially your attempt to do so....an attempt that you failed at because whether I have done it or not, or whether it is a generally accepted practice or not, it largely irrelevant and one thing we HAVE established here is that you can beat on a grenade all day and it will not detonate unless the primer is struck. Gee...it is almost like they expect guys who are going to get shot at to carry the things around with them and they dont want them exploding and taking out the entire unit if a bullet hits one. \n \n So, here is your problem, not only were mocked in my usual manner, but now here we are a couple pages, and a few thousand words later, and it turns out that you still look like a fool because beating on a live hand grenade is a surprisingly safe activity. \n \n Further, you have exposed your brother, if indeed one does exist, as either a fool or a liar. You have further exposed YOURSELF as a liar by continually misrepresenting the argument as it exists.\n \n So, you still have not read the article, you dont know when to shut your mouth, it turns out that you were WRONG about the dangers of beating on something with a hand grenade, and you can throw up a straw man like it is nobodies business. \n \n \n\n So you caused this beat down yourself, and now, just as I said you would do, you have wasted extensive bandwidth attempting to cover for your stupidity, making excuses and justifications, projecting blame onto me for daring to oppose such an ignorant claim which you have failed to prove, and now finally, claiming it is my responsibility to disprove something you have never proved even slightly by any standard of measure in the first place. \n\n \n Archie, that only worked BEFORE the straw man was exposed. You are arguing in the affirmative that using a hand grenade as a nail is a dangerous activity, and YES, the burden of proof is on you there. \n \n \n\n So tell me, since when is your moronic claim accepted as true without any evidence, and that seems proper to you, but I must disprove it even though there is no evidence that using a hand grenade as a hammer is recommended in any army/military training at all? Is that another example of daewoo logic? \n \n \n No, you must prove that it is a dangerous activity, or that it is prohibited, not just badger me to prove something when you yourself acknowledges that the information required to prove it is unavailable. \n \n \nOh, and btw, my so called imaginary drill sergeant brother wasn't speaking about improvised explosives when he spoke about the proper handling of a grenade. He was speaking about the proper handling of a grenade in the field of battle.

Once again, you are a LIAR. \n Then you threw in this little gem:\n \n \nIn other words daewoo, the military makes specific tools for specific jobs and doesn't suggest improvising in the way you suggest with explosives.\n\n \n Except that even the 40 yr old field manuals that you can find online show they they DO, and they have for a VERY LONG TIME. \n \n But then that is just you trying to re-frame the argument yet again, isnt it archie? \n \n You need to change your user name to \"Morning Star\".

Specifically, you said:\n\n \n OK big mouth, I must assume based on your alleged handling of grenades that you were actually in the army, as much as I personally doubt that claim based on what you have said. But if that's true, then you have gone through basic training and have had a Drill Sergeant at one time. You should know that a drill sergeant trained soldiers in the basics of army maneuvers, not specialized training such as IEDs. So for you to have made that leap when he was speaking to standard training methodology, in which the thought of using a hand grenade as a hammer is considered insane, is to widen the parameters of the debate where none was called for or implied by him.\n \n Beside that, the fact remains that in the manuals you referenced no examples of using a hand grenade as a hammer can be found. Rather than all of the minutia which you have wasted time posting, all I want to see is the evidence that your original lie is in fact true. \n \n \nNow you are claiming that I tossed those out to prove my claim, when in fact it was AT YOUR DEMAND to rebut the foolish statement above. I will promise you that if you get your hands on the 4 manuals I mentioned and the 26 unconventional warfare manuals, you will find it in one of them because I remember very specifically reading it in an army field manual/ I even remember the diagram on the page (the diagram was for a booby trap built with a tank round...and jsut for the record, driving a nail with the base of a tank round WOULD be a foolish thing to do because there is a primer there). \n \n \n But here's the rub, you know darn well that my statement was based on using a grenade or any explosive device as a hammer, not using a tin can to set a booby trap with a grenade. Unless they said to use the grenade to nail the trip nail into a tree. That would have proved your point. But interestingly enough, it said to tie the string off, not to use a nail at all. \n \n \nIn fact, I did not at any point try to provide anything as \"proof\" for my claim.\n\n \n NO KIDDING SHERLOCK, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH YOUR CLAIM.\n \n \nNo, I did not, and you are lying. I held them up as the proof that you demanded by proxy to your imaginary friend. Also, the reason you found TM 31-210 online is that the version you found is 40 years old.\n \n \n So what? are you suggesting that vietnam era soldiers wouldn't have been more likely to use the grenade in the fashion you claim then than now? And knowing how the military numbers every new manual they come out with, why should I believe that the current equivalent manual has the same numbers as the 40 year old manuals which you referred to? Why did you refer to 40 year old manuals if they don't have the info you were defending?\n \n \n \nNo, archie, YOU are the liar. I posted above in this very reply EXACTLY what your brother asked for, in your own words, including your moronic little smug editorial that CLARIFIES exactly what he meant. I posted the information he demanded and suggest that he get his hands on those 30 manuals and read them with you, and then you dishonestly suggested that I claimed I could show you the information in the 4 manuals that I listed by name, when in fact I did not post those as proof of my claim AT ALL, but rather in response to a direct demand by you.\n \n \n As I said, my brother was speaking to standard training usage, and suggested you show in any manuals that any training teaches men to use grenades as hammers. YOU HAVE POSTED REFERENCES TO MANUALS, BUT AS EXPECTED, NONE OF THEM SUPPORTED YOUR CLAIM AT ALL. \n \n \nAnd what you should have just learned is that you need to shut up when you are ahead because if you keep going, you get slapped. \n \n \n You're a joke daewoo; a bad joke but a joke none the less. It is you who has been slapped down and you're not even smart enough to realize it.\n \n \nName even ONE straw man I put up. \n \n \n Didn't I ask you to name mine? Is this what you call debating? Ignore the challenge to follow through on proving your claim that I created 5 of them while asking me to produce yours first? Just go back to your references to the different grenades which completely contradicted your claims of the materials they were made with and the machined bottoms which are designed to be used as a hammer. I pummeled you with that section and everything you claimed to be true came back as false.\n \n \nSo, here is your problem, not only were mocked in my usual manner, but now here we are a couple pages, and a few thousand words later, and it turns out that you still look like a fool because beating on a live hand grenade is a surprisingly safe activity. \n \n \n The problem is yours since you are evasive at all times. You referred to the M 61 grenade as evidence of a device with a flat bottom, yet when I posted a picture of it being round you said you doubt you ever used one and claimed it was a lousy grenade. Just more back pedaling.\n \n So tell me, are you currently serving in the military? What branch? Or what decade did you serve? Or are you afraid that such details would allow me to focus in on specific details which will destroy your lies. You condemn the posting of 40 year old manuals, yet you post the specific ID numbers to those manuals. So what's up? Where do you fit in this field of operations? \n \n \nFurther, you have exposed your brother, if indeed one does exist, as either a fool or a liar. You have further exposed YOURSELF as a liar by continually misrepresenting the argument as it exists.\n\n \n Not at all. Only in your mind does a Drill Instructor teach the intricacies of IEDs for advanced military booby traps. But one thing he was sure of is that he was never trained to treat a hand grenade in any way other than as if it is as delicate as an egg, to put it in his words.\n \n \nSo, you still have not read the article, you dont know when to shut your mouth, it turns out that you were WRONG about the dangers of beating on something with a hand grenade, and you can throw up a straw man like it is nobodies business.\n \n \n I know very well that the explosives within the grenade are safe to beat on or mold you schmuck. It's the fuze/ignition device within it which one would be afraid of setting off with the jarring impact of using it as a hammer. That you are ignorant of this reality speaks volumes of your insight, common sense and intelligence. \n \n \nArchie, that only worked BEFORE the straw man was exposed. You are arguing in the affirmative that using a hand grenade as a nail is a dangerous activity, and YES, the burden of proof is on you there. \n \n \n I just did in my answer directly above, now refute it by showing that the fuze is completely immune from igniting from the abuse you describe. \n \n \nNo, you must prove that it is a dangerous activity, or that it is prohibited, not just badger me to prove something when you yourself acknowledges that the information required to prove it is unavailable. \n\n \n I have above, now refute it!\n \n \n \nBut then that is just you trying to re-frame the argument yet again, isnt it archie?\n \n \n Not at all. I have repeatedly attempted to get you to answer only one question throughout this entire exchange. And that is to prove by any means possible that it is right and proper to use a hand grenade as a hammer. Something you claim to have done dozens of times and know for an absolute certainty that it is a right and proper use of american hand grenades. \n \n Tell me this genius, why do they teach soldiers to ONLY lob hand grenades and not throw them over hand like a fast ball? Is it because they know that once activated it is very susceptible to shock? If that is true, wouldn't it be inadvisable to use an inactive grenade as a hammer for the same reason? Does it seem logical to the \"logic bomber\" that you ignore this mechanical fuze/ignition device which has only a 4 second delay if used properly with a secondary concussion feature? Does that make sense to you?\n \n Just answer this question and concern I have had since the outset with that aspect of your claim. This isn't about the plastic explosives within the grenade, it's about the ignition system which in a perfect world is ultra sensitive to shock.\n \n \nYou need to change your user name to \"Morning Star\". It is more fitting for somebody with your rather obvious problem with honesty\n\n \n Feel free to show where I have been the least bit dishonest as I have attempted to keep you focussed on just proving that your original claim is not only true but a sane and rational practice when we are discussing live explosives. If anyone here needs to either repent or get psychiatric help, it is you. And some introspection regarding making outrageous and evidently unprovable claims might be helpful also while you're at it. Remember, it was you who used this incredibly illogical and ignorant tact in order to attack my capacity for logic and intelligent deduction. If anything has been absolutely proven here, it's that you aren't smart enough or logical enough to prove something you said is an absolute fact. See? Here is your original statement.\n [daewoo] \n Or that we are intelligent people capable of exhibiting meaningful logic. \n \n I happen to know for an absolute fact that you can drive a nail with a hand grenade. I have done it dozens of times. In Archie world, that apparently make a hand grenade a hammer.\n I still marvel that anyone who claims to be intelligent can be dumb enough to think that using a hand grenade as a hammer is a logical or intelligent use for such a deadly device which is designed for one use only, and that is to explode and kill anyone in the vicinity. emoticon_xdonno",

   "It still is a victory for me since you have never supported your original lie, here:\n [daewoo] \n Or that we are intelligent people capable of exhibiting meaningful logic. \n \n \"I happen to know for an absolute fact that you can drive a nail with a hand grenade.\" I have done it dozens of times.\n You stated this as an absolute fact. That requires evidence if you expect such a ludicrous claim to be accepted. And it ought to be easy to prove if it is true.\n\n \n No, it does not, Morning Star, because it is not a material claim. The material claim there is that it is possible to use a hand grenade as a hammer, which is undoubtedly true (even if it were to explode half way through, which we have established will not happen) and that the use of a hand grenade as a hammer does not, in fact, make it a hammer. Would you like me to link definitions of \"Hand grenade\" and \"Hammer\" for you? \n \n \nDid you expect me to google 30 manuals which you never specifically named? Is this more example of your twisted logic? Or just grasping at straws for another angle to ignorantly and dishonestly attack me from. You are bouncing off of walls in your attempt to come out of this looking rational as you only dig a deeper hole for yourself.\n\n \n No, as I specifically stated, I expected that if it actually mattered you could possibly have your brother get them for you. \n \n \n \nOK big mouth, I must assume based on your alleged handling of grenades that you were actually in the army, as much as I personally doubt that claim based on what you have said. But if that's true, then you have gone through basic training and have had a Drill Sergeant at one time. You should know that a drill sergeant trained soldiers in the basics of army maneuvers, not specialized training such as IEDs. So for you to have made that leap when he was speaking to standard training methodology, in which the thought of using a hand grenade as a hammer is considered insane, is to widen the parameters of the debate where none was called for or implied by him.\n\n \n No, you introduced him as an expert. I merely pointed out that he is apparently an expert with no knowledge at all of the subject matter. I would certainly argue that given the fact that IEDs have been common in every engagement the US has fought in the last 100 years that it would be a poor drill sergeant indeed who was not intimately familiar with even the basic US military material on them. \n \n \n \nBut here's the rub, you know darn well that my statement was based on using a grenade or any explosive device as a hammer, not using a tin can to set a booby trap with a grenade.

Why did you refer to 40 year old manuals if they don't have the info you were defending?\n\n \n Army technical manuals and Field manuals are regularly updated or declared obsolete. If you put a modern version next to the 40 yr old version, there is a better than average chance you would not recognize them as the same book...except for the # on the cover. This is like arguing that you do not need a modern set of encyclopedias because you have the 2 volume set from 1908. \n \n \n \nAs I said, my brother was speaking to standard training usage, and suggested you show in any manuals that any training teaches men to use grenades as hammers. YOU HAVE POSTED REFERENCES TO MANUALS, BUT AS EXPECTED, NONE OF THEM SUPPORTED YOUR CLAIM AT ALL. \n\n \n We know what you said. I have re-quoted you at least 4 times.

I pummeled you with that section and everything you claimed to be true came back as false.\n\n \n Morning Star, this ENTIRE discussion about hand grenades is a straw man that you set up to cover the fact that your implication that since the military could be used for humanitarian purposes it was well suited for that. And THAT was a straw man that you set up to cover up for the fact that you had ignorantly posted a nonsensical reply to an article that you had not read. OR, you had read it, and your reply was a straw man set up to divert attention from the article completely.\n \n \n \n\n The problem is yours since you are evasive at all times.

You condemn the posting of 40 year old manuals, yet you post the specific ID numbers to those manuals. So what's up? Where do you fit in this field of operations? \n \n \n I have been out of the miltary for quite a while. Army TM and FM numbers do not change. The boobytrap manual will always be FM 5-31. IT may be revised 200 times. It may start out as a 10 page leaflet and end up the size of a phone book, but it will ALWAYS BE FM 5-31. TM 31-200 will always be the Unconventional Warfare Devices and Techniques manual. The last time I saw one it was about 300 pages long, but it is still TM 31-200.\n \n \n \n \nI know very well that the explosives within the grenade are safe to beat on or mold you schmuck. It's the fuze/ignition device within it which one would be afraid of setting off with the jarring impact of using it as a hammer. That you are ignorant of this reality speaks volumes of your insight, common sense and intelligence. \n\n \n Morning Star, the fuze is 100% safe. It can only be activated by FIRE...namely the powder train ignited when the primer is struck. Your own links and posts explain that. \n \n \n \n\n Not at all. I have repeatedly attempted to get you to answer only one question throughout this entire exchange. And that is to prove by any means possible that it is right and proper to use a hand grenade as a hammer. Something you claim to have done dozens of times and know for an absolute certainty that it is a right and proper use of american hand grenades. \n\n \n See, MS, this is where things go to hell. My example relied on the fact that a hand grenade is NOT a hammer. Now you are asking me to disprove my example by showing that a hand grenade is, in fact, a defacto hammer. \n \n \nTell me this genius, why do they teach soldiers to ONLY lob hand grenades and not throw them over hand like a fast ball? Is it because they know that once activated it is very susceptible to shock? If that is true, wouldn't it be inadvisable to use an inactive grenade as a hammer for the same reason? Does it seem logical to the \"logic bomber\" that you ignore this mechanical fuze/ignition device which has only a 4 second delay if used properly with a secondary concussion feature? Does that make sense to you?\n\n \n Lets see \"ACTIVATED\" \"INACTIVE\". Hmmmmmm.......do you really not see the difference there? Do you REALLY want to argue this from an \"I am mentally retarded\" standpoint?? I dont recall advocating the use of an ACTIVATED grenade as a hammer. For you, though, I will make an exception. If you would like to try it, locate a grenade and I will pay for it. pull the pin, pop the top, and beat a nail in with it. \n \n Another bit of dishonesty from MS.\n \n \n \nFeel free to show where I have been the least bit dishonest as I have attempted to keep you focussed on just proving that your original claim is not only true but a sane and rational practice when we are discussing live explosives. If anyone here needs to either repent or get psychiatric help, it is you. And some introspection regarding making outrageous and evidently unprovable claims might be helpful also while you're at it.

If anything has been absolutely proven here, it's that you aren't smart enough or logical enough to prove something you said is an absolute fact. See? Here is your original statement.\n\n \n Every time I said LIAR or YOU ARE LYING. There. Now you have about 30 confirmed examples of you telling outright LIES. Now go back and search the thread for the term \"dishonest\". Several more examples of you being dishonest, while not necessarily outright lying. \n \n In truth, if there WAS possibility that the grenade would explode when used in such a manner, it would make my original example even MORE effective. \n \n And I stand by my original statement in the quoted text that you should change your user name to morning star. After all, lies and misdirection seem to be your primary tactic, and we all know who the father of lies is. When you come around and continually post lies and misdirection and repeatedly make the same discredited and proven false arguments, you know who you serve. Embrace it. You can always tell yourself that it is better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven. You are probably going there anyway. \n \n \nI still marvel that anyone who claims to be intelligent can be dumb enough to think that using a hand grenade as a hammer is a logical or intelligent use for such a deadly device which is designed for one use only, and that is to explode and kill anyone in the vicinity. emoticon_xdonno\n\n \n It is like using a rifle butt to drive a tent stake, and before you ask, NO, I am unaware of any military manual that specifically instructs soldiers to use their rifle butt to drive a tent stake. I also know that the army does not issue hammers with their tents, and hundreds, if not thousands, of US soldiers have over the years used the butt of their rifles to drive their tent pegs. You would argue that is a stupid and foolish thing to do since the SOLE purpose of a rifle is to kill people. You would be correct that a rifle is not the correct tool for that job, just liek the military is not really the correct vehicle for delivering humanitarian aid, but that does not change the fact that you can use a rifle to drive a tent stake, and it is not particularly dangerous to do so. \n \n Frankly, Mornign star, I was right when I said you were only concerned about it because you do not know a damn thing about hand grenades. You now know a LITTLE more, but still apparently not enough to make an intelligent comment on the safety of beating on them. Do you know WHY grenades can detonate early if you throw them like a fast ball? I is NOT because of the shock, it is because the delay powder train can become dislodged AFTER the grenade has been activated and part of the powder train has burned if it hits with too much impact. If the powder train is dislodged, unburned portions end up in the void created by the burned portions, and you have free burning powder loose in your delay tube that can hit the detonator, which is not shock sensitive but IS heat sensitive. \n \n That is what makes grenades so safe. The only way to detonate them is to introduce FIRE to the detonator, which is inside a steel case and surrounded by comb B, so the only possible way to introduce fire to the detonator is through the delay tube, which is safely sealed under a primer, under the cap. \n \n Wonderful design.",

Would you like me to link definitions of \"Hand grenade\" and \"Hammer\" for you?\n\n \n Your logic is as twisted as your reasoning my ignorant friend. You are now admitting that it's possible that that the grenade could explode while using it as a hammer but that because it's possible to use it as a hammer, your initial point is true. That is ridiculous since you stated it as an absolute fact that it can be \"safely\" done. And WE haven't established in any way that it would not explode since you haven't proven that at all. All you have done is continued to insist it wouldn't, but no evidence has been forwarded at all which you admitted in your last post. Why do you continue to claim that things have been established or proven when in your last post you admitted that you haven't proven your claim at all?\n \n \n No, as I specifically stated, I expected that if it actually mattered you could possibly have your brother get them for you.\n\n \n This is another example of your nonexistent logic for you to assume that anyone will refer to 30 manuals which remain unnamed. Especially since I directly posted links to the manuals you did refer to. I have done everything I can based on info you yourself posted in order to verify what you posted as fact. In every case it showed you are full of crapola. Deal with it, own it because you mentioned the types of grenades and the manuals as if they were proof of your claim. First that the grenades were designed with machined bottoms and next that the manuals would support your claim based on my brother suggesting that you produce manuals which will support your claim. Own it daewoo. You said these things, not me.\n \n \nNo, you introduced him as an expert. I merely pointed out that he is apparently an expert with no knowledge at all of the subject matter. I would certainly argue that given the fact that IEDs have been common in every engagement the US has fought in the last 100 years that it would be a poor drill sergeant indeed who was not intimately familiar with even the basic US military material on them.\n\n \n I introduced him as a DRILL SERGEANT, and as a Drill Instructor he is very aware of military rules for the proper use of hand grenades. That you, who have been through basics and understand that would question his level of training experience speaks volumes to your honestly and unwillingness to admit the foolishness of using a grenade as a hammer which you are suggesting is right and proper. \n \n \nI have no idea what you are talking about here. Which manual??? \n \n Never mind. Forget I asked. This is just another one of your attempts to derail.\n\n \n You would love me to forget it wouldn't you! But no, here is the link to your post: http://www.4forums.com/political/current-events-debates/12469-war-terror-hoax-post347715.html#post347715 And here is your quote which is written as if it was copy and pasted directly from a manual. [Daewoo the fiction writer] For years the army has issued tripwire kits that included in the instructions \"Drive pivot pin into suitable wooden surface with base of grenade\". The pivot pin was a #20 nail with a groove machined in it about 2\" from the top.\n \n Now, if you can quote that source which you made appear at the time was a direct quote, then why can't you supply the specific source? You know why? Because that was an attempt to bluff your way through as if you were quoting known and confirmed info without ever actually supplying the source of that info. YOU ARE AND WERE BEING TOTALLY DECEPTIVE IN YOUR ATTEMPT TO SOUND CORRECT WITHOUT ACTUALLY PROVING IT. \n \n \nWe know what you said. I have re-quoted you at least 4 times. You are lying. \n\n \n The only person lying, back pedaling, obfuscating and attempting to justify and insane practice around here is you daewoo.\n \n \n Morning Star, this ENTIRE discussion about hand grenades is a straw man that you set up to cover the fact that your implication that since the military could be used for humanitarian purposes it was well suited for that. And THAT was a straw man that you set up to cover up for the fact that you had ignorantly posted a nonsensical reply to an article that you had not read. OR, you had read it, and your reply was a straw man set up to divert attention from the article completely.\n\n \n Wrong on both counts. My post which showed that the military had been used for humanitarian aid, with a link with the details refuted the mocking post it responded to. Here is the link with the exchange and it shows the intent clearly. http://www.4forums.com/political/current-events-debates/12469-war-terror-hoax.html#post347605 \n \n As for my response to the OP, only in the minds of dishonest lunatics who are in denial of historical facts could it be surmised that posting links to thousands of terrorist attacks over the past 8 years all over the planet, in response to a thread titled \"The War on Terror is a Hoax\" is in any way a straw man, nonsensical or ignorant.\n \n \nNo. I didnt. You are lying AGAIN. The M61 is the vulcan (a gatling gun). I brought up the M67 and pointed out that it does not have a flat bottom. \n\n \n Really? Are you incapable of honesty daewoo, as you call me Morningstar? You said this, and I quote you directly: [daewoo] \n The only grenade that the US has ever used that you might possibly have damaged using as a hammer was the M61. It had a sheet metal body wrapped around a fragmentary coil. The M67, which is what is commonly issued to troops today,\n \n It also needs to be noted that you were wrong about the M67 being the current grenade in use today which I proved later on in this debate. It is the M 68. So you are spewing incorrect info at every turn around here. But hey, you do it with such confidence, assurance and gusto that you effectively intimidate the less informed that you are right when all you are is full of crapola.\n \n In addition to that, in your very first response to my criticism of making such an outlandish claim, you spoke very confidently in the PRESENT TENSE and said this: http://www.4forums.com/political/current-events-debates/12469-war-terror-hoax.html#post347715\n Or, Archie does not know a damn thing about hand grenades, which have a flat, machined bottom. You can beat on the bottom all day without any risk of the thing going off. Most hand grenades have flat bottoms. Only US hand grenades have machined bottoms, and it is so you can drive a nail with them.\n Funny, you weren't speaking in past tense when the very grenade you were incorrectly claiming was currently in use was actually round and had no machined bottom at all. I say \"incorrectly claiming\" because the M 68 is the current hand grenade model in use by the Military today. Every response you have offered has been a back pedaling excuse in order to justify incorrect information which you have boldly and confidently offered as absolutely correct and right based on alleged personal first hand knowledge. \n \n Translation: You have done nothing but bluff and blow hard your way through this exchange in the hope of perpetrating a scam in order to appear more informed than you actually are. I guess that is what you took from debating class, huh? It doesn't really matter if what you are saying is right and true as long as you can intimidate your opposition into thinking you are so well informed that you must be right. Well that gig is up daewoo, because now all anyone need do is check your facts and they can prove that you're a fraud and a liar. \n \n \n Morning Star, the fuze is 100% safe. It can only be activated by FIRE...namely the powder train ignited when the primer is struck. Your own links and posts explain that. \n\n \n Really? Can you prove that? If you at least posted evidence from any manual which stated that inactivated grenades were totally immune from exploding to such a degree that they can be banged on, that would go far in defending your position. But alas, all you continue to do is make unsubstantiated claims.\n \n \n See, MS, this is where things go to hell. My example relied on the fact that a hand grenade is NOT a hammer. Now you are asking me to disprove my example by showing that a hand grenade is, in fact, a defacto hammer.\n\n \n No my dishonest twister of facts. You claimed that a grenade can be safely used as a hammer but that doesn't make it one. Any comparison to a hammer is irrelevant to me. My issue is that you claim a grenade can even be used as a device to drive nails into something. That doesn't mean I want proof that a grenade is a hammer, it means I want proof that your lie is based in any fact at all.\n \n \n Lets see \"ACTIVATED\" \"INACTIVE\". Hmmmmmm.......do you really not see the difference there? Do you REALLY want to argue this from an \"I am mentally retarded\" standpoint?? I dont recall advocating the use of an ACTIVATED grenade as a hammer. For you, though, I will make an exception. If you would like to try it, locate a grenade and I will pay for it. pull the pin, pop the top, and beat a nail in with it. \n\n \n When you can't rationally answer the valid point I make, you must respond with sarcasm. You evidently aren't intelligent enough to appreciate the technical minute details and fine precision with which the inner workings of the fuze is constructed. If you did appreciate that although they are built to take the normal rigors and joggling which comes with an active soldier on the run, to use them as an impact concussion device such as a hammer is a total abuse of their designers intent. That's why you can't post anything from any manual which says to do it. \n \n \n \n Every time I said LIAR or YOU ARE LYING. There. Now you have about 30 confirmed examples of you telling outright LIES. Now go back and search the thread for the term \"dishonest\". Several more examples of you being dishonest, while not necessarily outright lying.\n\n \n The only liar in this discussion is the guy who's asserting that it's totally safe to use a hand grenade as a hammer and that he has done it dozens of times. The only liar is that same guy who must continue to insist that is true while producing no evidence from any angle to prove his claim is true. And the only liar here is that is so deluded that he has the audacity to say that because he has accused me of lying without ever once proving it, that we have 30 CONFIRMED examples of me lying. With every post you write you expose how irrationally full of yourself you are while once again never proving anything you say. You are a legend only in your own mind daewoo, but I'm not impressed at all.\n \n \n In truth, if there WAS possibility that the grenade would explode when used in such a manner, it would make my original example even MORE effective.\n\n \n How is this statement true or even rational at all since you said you have personally done it dozens of times yourself? You see daewoo, the problem with lying is that you must keep your lies straight which always ends up exposing the liar for what he is. You said this!\n daewoo \n Or that we are intelligent people capable of exhibiting meaningful logic. \n \n I happen to know for an absolute fact that you can drive a nail with a hand grenade. I have done it dozens of times. In Archie world, that apparently make a hand grenade a hammer.\n This is an unequivicable statement of fact on your part. But when one is back pedaling and attempting to justify his ignorant stance he will approach it from any angle at all and hope he can slip it through.\n \n \n It is like using a rifle butt to drive a tent stake, and before you ask, NO, I am unaware of any military manual that specifically instructs soldiers to use their rifle butt to drive a tent stake. I also know that the army does not issue hammers with their tents, and hundreds, if not thousands, of US soldiers have over the years used the butt of their rifles to drive their tent pegs. You would argue that is a stupid and foolish thing to do since the SOLE purpose of a rifle is to kill people. You would be correct that a rifle is not the correct tool for that job, just liek the military is not really the correct vehicle for delivering humanitarian aid, but that does not change the fact that you can use a rifle to drive a tent stake, and it is not particularly dangerous to do so. \n[QUOTE] \n \n WOW, you constantly prove by the irrational comparisons, the lengths you will go to to justify your original ridiculous claim, and how you must justify the incredible. Are you unaware that you can de-chamber all shells from the firing system of a rifle in order to render it harmless? Yet knowing this, you readily admit that no manual instructs using a rifle butt for such a purpose while insisting that manuals DO instruct using a hand grenade as a hammer to drive in nails. Does that seem like a rational distinction to you? Or a comparable capability to an armed grenade which tampering with is strictly restricted and frowned upon? But then again, you are just grasping at straws so you are beyond rational considerations or equal comparisons, right?",

   "It has occurred to me that no matter what I post claiming it is the opinion of another person who is a member of the Armed Services in America will be met with the same insults and disregarded by daewoo as he responded to what I posted that my brother had said about the insane act of using a hand grenade as a hammer which daewoo claims to have done dozens of times.\n \n So to avoid this conflict, I searched out a military forum frequented by service men with many years experience. I'm going to post a link to a thread where I put this question out as objectively as possible in search of any confirmation that anything daewoo said is factual at all. Needless to say daewoo, you have been invited over there to debate your claims with them directly as you have been referred to as either an ##### or a liar in the very first response to my query. Here's the link, enjoy the read. Daewoo should find it very enlightening.\n \n A Question for as many soldiers as possible: - All Military",

Ok....\n \n People do generally back off when I get ready to tear somebody apart, Archie. They enjoy the show.\n\n \n \nTear me apart? Are you kidding me or just lying to yourself again. Nothing in this exchange has gone your way because nothing you have said is based in fact at all. Unless of course you're finally willing and able to actually prove it this time.\n\n \n I mean, maybe if you posted the ID numbers to the manuals for the people on the forum I linked to, maybe they would agree with you. Or would they ask you to post the evidence within those manuals which supports your claim just as I did? Here's the link again, if you wish to debate them. A standing invitation has been given daewoo. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n You also made this statement daewoo:\n \n \nIt is kind of like C4. You can cut it, beat it, throw it, tear it. Lighting it on fire and cooking with it is a time honored tradition among US troops. No matter what you do with it, it will not detonate without a detonator. Comp B is the same. It does not really matter what you do with it as long as it does not involve a blasting cap.\n\n \n And they responded to it without even knowing you made that statement.\n \n \nCapt Kirk, back from vacation and my first post response is in agreement with you. I did 20 years in the USAR Comabt Engineers and let me tell you this guy who is telling this story is deffinately plan stupid. Thats like saying I can stomp on C4 all day long and nothing will happen...KA-BOOM\n\n \n \nWe were taught to use a K-bar or entrenching tool as a hammer, not a grenade. \n \n We had a guy who always used C-4 to heat the C-rats, so I suppose there's someone who makes s*^t up as he goes in every outfit.\n\n Incredibly, in the process of defending his claim that one can use a hand grenade as a hammer, he also made this blanket claim.\n \n \n Oh, and regarding the nail which is issued with the trip wire kit you referred to as evidence of your claim? Here's the real reason why a nail came with that kit. You said this:\n \n [daewoo said]BTW....while your imaginary brother is perusing the above field manuals, when he gets to the part about using the components from a trip flare kit to activate a grenade that is \"Firmly lodged between two rocks, logs, or bricks\" make sure he reads the part to you that says \"Drive the pivot pin using the butt of a knife or the base of your hand grenade\".\n And here is your original reference to this bogus and inaccurate claim.\n \n \n \n Or, Archie does not know a damn thing about hand grenades, which have a flat, machined bottom. You can beat on the bottom all day without any risk of the thing going off. Most hand grenades have flat bottoms. Only US hand grenades have machined bottoms, and it is so you can drive a nail with them.\n \n For years the army has issued tripwire kits that included in the instructions \"Drive pivot pin into suitable wooden surface with base of grenade\". The pivot pin was a #20 nail with a groove machined in it about 2\" from the top. \n\n \n \nThis guy said that the service used to issue a trip wire kit with a nail included with instructions on how to make a tripwire device with a grenade and that they were trained to use the butt end of the grenade as a hammer which was machined for that purpose.\n\n \n \nArchangel, there was a kit issued that had a tripwire and a nail, but now I know that this guy is blowing smoke. \n \n The nail was never meant to be \"hammered\" it was in fact a \"replacement\" for the grenade pin. You simply tied one end of the trip wire to the nail and then the other end across the path.\n \n You could do this to any grenade but most guys replaced the standard grenade fuse (which was a timed fuse) with a smoke grenade fuse (they weren't timed fuses) so as soon as the \"nail\" was pulled out, the grenade exploded.\n \n He probably \"heard\" about it and got the procedure confused. Trust me, if you ever set up a booby trap like that, . . you will never forget how to do it.\n\n \n \n \n A Question for as many soldiers as possible: - All Military",

   "No comment on anything in the post above daewoo? No defense at all? You aren't going to rail against these soldiers who seem to be voicing the same opinion as my imaginary drill instructor brother? How about this response then to your claims regarding C4.\n \n \n \nIt is kind of like C4. You can cut it, beat it, throw it, tear it. Lighting it on fire and cooking with it is a time honored tradition among US troops. No matter what you do with it, it will not detonate without a detonator. Comp B is the same. It does not really matter what you do with it as long as it does not involve a blasting cap.\n\n wrong! There are unfortunately many guys who only have one foot, today because of cooking with these plastic explosives.\n \n It's true that many guys cooked with it because we didn't have to carry Sterno and explosives. We chose instead, to carry explosives and a little more ammo.\n \n The problem with cooking with plastics is when your done cooking. Some guys tried to put out the fire with their foot and surprise no foot. \n \n You had to let it burn out on its own. Any impact + fire, would set it off. \n \n As Dai Wi said, When I instructed at Engineer school we would take a small amount of C-4 and put it on a backstop and fire an M-16 round into it at a safe distance. We did this for demonstration purposes only.\" \n \n just don't shoot it when it's burning.\n \n The military never would condone the use of plastic explosives to replace Sterno and they definitely didn't train anyone to use a Grenade as a Hammer. \n \n When the Baseball Grenades began to replace the Pineapple Grenade around 1969-70, the Baseball grenades were packed with plastics, They also had a much thinner skin with tiny BB's lining the interior. Using those grenades for a hammer could have perforated the skin or at least dented them, dislodging the BB's. That said the BB's could easily break the detonator (which is contained in a glass tube). \n \n If the broken detonator didn't set it off it could affect the fuse timing and allow a premature detonation or no detonation when used in combat.\n \n http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-23-30/fig1-2.gif\n \n http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-23-30/fig1-6.gif\n \n This idea is just wrong in so many ways.\n \n There are many things that troops might do that would not be considered safe to the Military, but are done to make the guys more comfortable or even safe.\n \n For instance, we used to use gasoline to cool our beers! Cooler (never really got cold) beer was worth it even though the cans tasted like gas and you didn't want to smoke around it.\n \n Another was the boots! I was a Seabee so I was issued steel toed boots to prevent me from breaking my toes. What I wore however was a Marine Jungle Boot because Punji sticks were a more likely threat to my feet than dropping something on them. \n \n Had I broken my toes however, I could have been up for Courts Martial or at the very least Captains Mast (Captains Mast would have been better though because the Skipper wore Jungle Boots too.)\n\n \n A Question for as many soldiers as possible: - All Military See post #21",

The myth was actually about COOKING with C4 and getting your foot blown off when you try to stop out the fire. This was a popular enough urban legend that they actually reference it on the wikipedia page re: C4:\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-4_(explosive)\n \n \nBecause C-4 burns slowly when it is ignited with a flame rather than detonated with a primary explosive, soldiers during the Vietnam War era would sometimes use small amounts of C-4 as fuel for heating rations while on long patrols. While many soldiers used C-4 safely in this manner, there are several anecdotes about soldiers attempting to put out the fire by stomping on it - causing it to detonate. While C-4 will not actually detonate in these circumstances, burning C-4 produces poisonous fumes and should be avoided (see below).\n\n \n The second guy I am willing to cut some slack for since, if he was actually issued C rations, he is an old man by now. The military stopped issuing C rations in 1958:\n \n C-ration - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \nIn 1958, C-rations were phased out and replaced by the nearly identical canned Meal, Combat, Individual ration.\n\n \n Interestingly enough, C-4 was not even invented until the mid 60's....several years after C rations were phased out. \n \n I have no idea what they did, did not, or might have done with C rations. They were gone decades before I was even born. I do know that nobody heated their C rations with C4, since it was not invented yet.\n \n So, so far you have either 2 posers or one poser and one guy who should be in a nursing home because he is demonstratively talking nonsense. \n \n \nArchangel, there was a kit issued that had a tripwire and a nail, but now I know that this guy is blowing smoke.\n \n The nail was never meant to be \"hammered\" it was in fact a \"replacement\" for the grenade pin.

Trust me, if you ever set up a booby trap like that, . . you will never forget how to do it.\n\n \n \n I am going to preface this with saying that I have no idea what kind of idiotic things they do in the navy. I can tell you that in the army, pretty much everything you do has a reason. taking the pin out of a grenade and replacing it with a nail would be absolutely nonsensical. Why would you EVER, EVER do that since you can just bend the pin on the grenade back and forth about 3 times and break the bent side off, then you have basically the same thing, but with a handy pull ring instead of trying to tie a string aroung the head of a nail. I mean, this is absolutely retarded. You would have to be an absolute m0r0n to believe this. It defies logic and common sense. \n \n It is the part about replacing the fuse from a regular grenade with the fuse from a smoke grenade that proves beyond any shadow of a doubt that this guy has NO idea what he is talking about.\n \n First, you NEVER, EVER take the fuze out of a grenade. If you get even a small amount of filler on the threads, the force of tightening it back down WILL set it off and kill you. \n \n There is another reason beyond safety rules that I know this guy is talking out his back side. \n \n Hand Grenades\n \n \nDetonating Fuze. Detonating fuzes explode within the grenade body to initiate the main explosion of the filler substance. Detonating fuzes include the M204A1, M204A2, M206A2, M213, M228, and the C12 integral fuze. \n\n \n \nIgniting Fuze. Igniting fuzes are designed for use with chemical hand grenades. They burn at high temperatures and ignite the chemical filler. \n \n M201A1 pyrotechnic delay-igniting fuze.\n FM 23-30: M201A1\n The M201A1 is designed for use with the AN-M83HC white smoke grenade, the AN-M14 TH3 incendiary grenade, and the M18 colored smoke grenade. This fuze is interchangeable with any standard firing device. The time delay element is a powder train requiring 1.2 to 2 seconds to burn to the igniter. The igniter ignites the filler or a pyrotechnic starter with a violent burning action and expels the filler from the grenade body.\n \n\n \n Grenades that explode use detonating fuzes. THEY HAVE A DETONATOR. Without the detonator, the grenade WILL NOT EXPLODE. Fuzes for SMOKE grenades have incendiary fuses. They BURN, but do not DETONATE. If you put the fuze from a smoke grenade in a fragmentation grenade, THE GRENADE WOULD NOT EXPLODE. \n \n The guy is either full of it or retarded. Frankly, at this point I am leaning toward \"full of ####\" because then you are dumb enough to post his ENTIRE post where he says this:\n \n \nAnother was the boots!

I doubt he was ever issued one. \n \n Course, I finally actually clicked on the link and went through the thread itself real quickly and got even more proof of what a pathetic liar you are, morning star. You try to make an issue of my statement about guys cooking with C4, but even one of the guys in the thread that you are trying to use as proof stated:\n \n \nWhile it was a common practice to use it to cook with in Nam I would never advise someone to light it on fire and then strike it with a sharp blow or shoot it or hit it with a hammer.\n\n \n So, other people were supporting what I had said, but you opted not to quote those portions. I also note that you opted not to quote posts where they argued that it would blow up in your hand if you tried. Is that because you recalled that we have already established beyond any doubt that it will NOT, so you knew those guys were talking out their butts...just like it turned out the guy you kept quoting was?\n \n In fact, now that we have cut down the urban legend about C4 exploding if you light it on fire and then try to stomp it out, your entire kick here looks pretty dumb. \n \n What I want to know is how many forums you had to post that in before you got the answers you wanted. In the real world, if you ask a navy guy about what they do in the army, an honest one is going to give you the same answer I did about the navy. He is going to say \"I dont know how they do things in the army\". An honest marine will give you the same answer. In fact, if you ask a guy in the ARMY about something like that in the army, they are likely to ask \"What unit\", \"what MOS\", or \"Where was he stationed\" because as your brother proved, what they do or do not do in the army depends on where you are and who you are doing it with. \n \n So, to wrap this up....more ignorant trolling from morning star. Illogical, non factual, and absolutely dishonest.\n \n Final tip- If you are going to try to \"prove\" a point by pointing to an anonymous post on the internet, dont pick somebody who admits they were not in a position to have any idea what they are talking about. You dont ask a seabee what is or is not proper grenade usage. He has no idea. He has probably never actually held a live one. You do not ask a combat engineer (the other guys who answered the thread) because while it is slightly more likely that they may have handled a live grenade, there is almost no chance they have USED one. \n \n Dont get me wrong, those guys do an important job, but the use of hand grenades just really isn't part of it.",

Captain Kirk said:\n Top Gun Member\n \n Archangel,\n \n I was a Combat engineer (demolitions expert) in Vietnam, While what your friend said is in principal has some merit in practice it is foolish.\n The detonator and firing device in a hand grenade are contained in the center of the grenade body. if it detonates the explosive surrounding it detonates. \n \n The new grenades use an explosive that is very stable until the detonator is triggered. If one removed the firing device from a grenade it would be reasonably safe, however it he were using it as a hammer while the firing mechanism was in place they don't respond favorably to continued sharp blows. It could detonate.\n \n Your friend is either an ##### or a liar.\n \n I welcome him to come to this site and dispute it with me. \n Feel free to accept his challenge daewoo, or would you rather just stand back at a safe distance and hope to control the debate by focussing on anything but the actual issues at hand?\n daewoo said:\n \n Or, Archie does not know a damn thing about hand grenades, which have a flat, machined bottom. You can beat on the bottom all day without any risk of the thing going off. Most hand grenades have flat bottoms. Only US hand grenades have machined bottoms, and it is so you can drive a nail with them.\n \n For years the army has issued tripwire kits that included in the instructions \"Drive pivot pin into suitable wooden surface with base of grenade\". The pivot pin was a #20 nail with a groove machined in it about 2\" from the top.\n Originally Posted by USN-G-Man\n Archangel, there was a kit issued that had a tripwire and a nail, but now I know that this guy is blowing smoke. \n \n The nail was never meant to be \"hammered\" it was in fact a \"replacement\" for the grenade pin. You simply tied one end of the trip wire to the nail and then the other end across the path.\n \n You could do this to any grenade but most guys replaced the standard grenade fuse (which was a timed fuse) with a smoke grenade fuse (they weren't timed fuses) so as soon as the \"nail\" was pulled out, the grenade exploded.\n \n He probably \"heard\" about it and got the procedure confused. Trust me, if you ever set up a booby trap like that, . . you will never forget how to do it.\n A Question for as many soldiers as possible: - All Military\n \n Oh how I have been spanked by daewoo. He is the king of spankings, in his own mind anyway. emoticon_smileemoticon_xgoodemoticon_rolleyes",

I have told you at least 50 times that there is a page at Google where you can type things into a search box and it will bring up web pages based on your search terms.

THEY HAVE A DETONATOR. Without the detonator, the grenade WILL NOT EXPLODE. Fuzes for SMOKE grenades have incendiary fuses. They BURN, but do not DETONATE.

You don't get it that you lost all credibility as a truthful person since you have lied and attempted to justify your claim that you have used a hand grenade as a hammer dozens of times as if it's a common practice in the military.\n \n All your diatribe says is that since you can break off the end of the pin, it is, and I quote: taking the pin out of a grenade and replacing it with a nail would be absolutely nonsensical.

Changing fuses in grenades for specific purposes in the field. You see daewoo, it is you who should be referred to as Morning Star since you can't even keep your own lies straight.\n \n And you still haven't actually proven anything. I challenge you to prove this statement with one of the many manuals you referred to above in this debate which you claimed would prove your point. Rather than mention a manual, go ahead and link to the evidence. You said this: BTW....while your imaginary brother is perusing the above field manuals, when he gets to the part about using the components from a trip flare kit to activate a grenade that is \"Firmly lodged between two rocks, logs, or bricks\" make sure he reads the part to you that says \"Drive the pivot pin using the butt of a knife or the base of your hand grenade\".\n \n \nNow you have fallen back into your standard method of debate....bringing things back that your opponent has already debunked and trying to claim that they did not answer it.\n\n \n Screaming and claiming you are right while proving nothing is just evidence of posturing in order to avoid admitting that you are a poser and a liar.

No dice. You are a dishonorable liar, a coward, a fool, and you have bee PWNED.\n\n \n Really? Yet I am not making any incredible claims at all regarding hand grenades of tripwire kits. It is you who is attempting to dismiss and diss so called fellow soldiers as you rant and rave that everyone is wrong but you. For someone who is standing all alone, you do a good job of convincing yourself that you're right. Now convince me WITH ACTUAL EVIDENCE. Because your word is worth nothing with me.

I even doubt that he's ever been in the service. You can search this site and I'll bet you won't find 1 Veteran who would call another the Names that he uses. Veterans can argue and even make fun, but would never show such disrespect to each other.\n \n I'm not going to argue with him. It would be like arguing with a rock. No, Thats wrong.

It was not a term of respect or endearment. To put it bluntly, it was verbal shorthand for \"rear echelon mutha f_ _ _ers.\" For many of those who were out there \"in the ####\", facing the enemy on a daily basis, must have felt it was terribly unfair that there were so many others who did not have to face the same danger which they, the relative few did. While those feelings are understandable, the broad brush application of \"Rear Echelon Mutha F_ _ _er\" to all who served in the rear is, in itself, unfair.\n\n \n So, yea....one veteran would NEVER call another that emoticon_rolleyesemoticon_rolleyesemoticon_rolleyesemoticon_rolleyesemoticon_rolleyesemoticon_rolleyes\n \n Sorry, morning star, your pet source is a PUD. \n \n \nOnly a poser would act as you do and say the ridiculous and insulting things you say about fellow soldiers, and not a good poser at that. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n Wrong. Again, read the above. REMFs sometimess refer to THEMSELVES as REMFs. \n \n The Day of the REMF\n \n I learned a new word shortly after arriving at my assigned camp A-502, Camp Trung Dung: REMF (Rear Echelon MF, and the MF doesn't stand for Mighty Fine).\n \n\n REMFs were a viciously maligned group whose numbers were legion. Technically, a REMF was a support person who lived and worked in the relative safety of rear areas behind barbed wire, ate hot meals, took hot showers, and slept in a bed, usually in air conditioned comfort.\n\n \n REMF@Everything2.com\n \n \nThey called us Rear Echelon Mother####ers.\n \n To the guys in the bush--the 11 Bravo 10's who did all of the killing and most of the dying--we were lower than dogshit.

You said this: You do not ask a combat engineer (the other guys who answered the thread) because while it is slightly more likely that they may have handled a live grenade, there is almost no chance they have USED one.  Here's how Capt Kirk put it.\n Captain Kirk\n Top Gun Member\n \n Registered: 2007-10-05\n Posts: 7073\n Archangel,\n \n I was a Combat engineer (demolitions expert) in Vietnam, While what your friend said is in principal has some merit in practice it is foolish.\n The detonator and firing device in a hand grenade are contained in the center of the grenade body. if it detonates the explosive surrounding it detonates. \n \n The new grenades use an explosive that is very stable until the detonator is triggered. If one removed the firing device from a grenade it would be reasonably safe, however it he were using it as a hammer while the firing mechanism was in place they don't respond favorably to continued sharp blows. It could detonate.\n \n Your friend is either an ##### or a liar.\n \n I welcome him to come to this site and dispute it with me. \n \n This guy is an explosives expert so I would expect him to agree with you if there was anything true or accurate in what you claim. Yet you don't even know that a combat engineer is an explosives expert apparently. With every post you write you expose more of your ignorance regarding what is true compared to what you claim is true. Remember, my opening posts wasn't a leading question but was seeking to find if anyone agreed with the claim that a hand grenade is commonly used as a hammer.\n \n Then you come back with this statement: I have already conceded that I cannot produce the material in question, and you have admitted that even if it does exist, I probably still cannot produce it because it is not available to the public.\n \n This is the very reason I went to an objective military site in order to get the opinions of actual soldiers who have gone through the same or similar training which you CLAIM to have had. And lo and behold they say you're most likely a liar, a poser or a candidate for a section 8 which I think is the most accurate description of you because only a lunatic would suggest using a live hand grenade as a hammer. emoticon_xdonno\n \n So I'll tell you what you lying fraud, rather than continue to discuss anything BUT the issue at hand, go ahead and find your own Military forum with soldiers you can respect as authentic and pose the question to them. Or give me the link and I'll pose it objectively and without directing them either way. Then we'll post their answers here and you will have won this debate hands down and redeemed yourself from being exposed as a lier and a wannabe soldier poser. Because at this point you have been spanked into absolute submission as I have attempted to keep you on track yet like a drowning man, all you do is flail around attempting to muddy the waters and change the subject to any issue which you think you can control.\n \n PROVE YOUR CLAIM IF YOU CAN FRAUD. GO TO ANY MILITARY FORUM OF YOUR CHOICE AND GET ACTUAL SOLDIERS OF YOUR SELECTION TO AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT USING HAND GRENADES AS HAMMERS. GO ON LIAR, MAKE MY DAY AND PROVE ME WRONG. I MUST WARN YOU THOUGH, IF VIETNAM ERA SOLDIERS WHO WERE MUCH MORE FREE WHEELING THAN TODAYS DISCIPLINED SOLDIERS THINK YOUR NUTS, THEN I WOULDN'T HOLD OUT MUCH HOPE FOR TODAYS SOLDIERS AGREEING WITH YOU.",

   "Well, I'll try to get the thread back on track. I admit I only read a few paragraphs. When the author began repeatedly using the word \"neoconservative,\" he started losing credibility in my mind. I understand it's an editorial and is largely based on opinion, but when somebody's opinion is so obviously biased, it's hard to take seriously.\n \n The title of this thread, \"The War on Terror is a Hoax,\" is somewhat confusing to me. I don't believe terrorism is a hoax, and we are fighting a war. However, terrorism is not something you can fight conventionally with soldiers and tanks. I don't think we needed to invade Afghanistan OR Iraq. I find it interesting that right wingers defend the war in Iraq while left wingers defend the war in Afghanistan. \n \n The author of the editorial says he disagrees with assassination. I don't. In fact, I think assassinations of key terrorist leaders would be the best way to fight terrorism. In a conventional war there is always going to be collateral damage. It's possible that people who previously held no grudge against the US would be compelled to join the terrorists as a result of our invasion.\n \n I don't see how invading 2 countries has made us more secure. If anything, it has brought us dangerously close to the edge of total financial collapse, which I still don't think we have averted completely. Fighting terror groups in other countries has left us exposed to threats which I consider to be more serious, such a nuclear equipped Iran and North Korea.\n \n Again, the author continues to blame \"neoconservatives\" for this problem and suggests that these people are the target of hatred for the terrorists. However, reports are coming out now of repeated attacks by US predator drone attacks in Pakistan. So we're fighting in Pakistan now, and that seems to be okay with the Obama administration. I really doubt the terrorists stop to consider their targets political affiliation before they launch an attack. Their goal, obviously, is to incite fear and terror.\n \n In conclusion, I believe the threat of terrorist attacks is real. I think a lot of the hatred against us is for religious reasons. These reasons have existed for a long time, even before America existed. We are just the latest enemy in a long list of enemies for these people. The problem is the Bush administration did not respond in an effective way, the war itself was mismanaged, and Obama is continuing down the same path, even expanding into new territories. And now our economy is tanking, and I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination to assume more of our freedoms will be taken away in the name of security. Civil unrest seems like it's right around the corner. In short, the war on terror has made us weaker.",

   "Shucks guys, don't you want to see daewoo, the master of self aggrandizement and bluster, not to mention a blatant liar and poser prove that using a live hand grenade as a hammer is a logical and intelligent use of a lethal explosive weapon? I mean, he says he has done it dozens of times and that the directions that came with a tripwire kit said to use a hand grenade to drive the nail into a tree. \n \n Shouldn't he at least go to a military forum of his choice and produce other soldiers who agree with him that this is a rational, logical and intelligent use of live hand grenades? Here's the mockery he and tq directed toward me which led to this challenge, just so you have a proper context for why I'm not letting this pompous jerk off the hook until he either proves his lie or retracts his lie.\n \n \n \nYeah, radical islam's attacks are just a figment of our imaginations. Here are links to attacks going back to 2001. TheReligionofPeace.com - Islam: Making a True Difference in the World It is extensive as there are tens of thousands of victims. Mostly all civilians and all at the hands of radical islamic terrorists.\n \n \n \nNot surprisingly, Archie didn't understand the editorial.\n\n \n \nYou mean your propaganda hit piece which condemns the neocons rather than the terrorists? I obviously understood it better than you did since I can see through the leftist drivel it spews and you apparently can't. I have posted an itemized account of every terrorist attack which has occurred since 2001. Those links represent hundreds of thousands of dead innocents at the hands of cold blooded murderers, all of them ISLAMIC BASED RADICALS. \n \n Then you post this thread titled \"The War on Terror is a Hoax\" And you have the audacity to say that Archie didn't understand the editorial? It is you who didn't understand the editorial if you can't recognize the blind prejudice and leftist slant which it represents, not to mention the denial of reality it represents which my single post proves with undeniable FACTS which proves if we are guilty of anything at all, it's of not doing enough to squelch this cancer of world wide terrorism.\n\n \n \nI don't know...I DO know that you cant go to war with an adjective with your military. Can you imaging trying to fight the war on poverty with an aircraft carrier???\n\n \n \nThat's just silly. How many homeless people can you realistically expect to find in the ocean?\n \n emoticon_xbouncer\n\n \n \nOh I don't know about that. We sent 2 Battle groups and numerous cruisers, helicopters and transport planes to aid the tsunami victims for the ships ability to desalinize thousands of gallons of salt water a day if memory serves, and as we converted the ships into hospitals. And that was just the tip of the iceberg of America's contribution to that tragedy.\n \n Of course we got no credit for that humanitarian aid because it was a republican president. You know, Bush? So all your mockery proves is that you have no idea how to utilize the military resources we possess in a positive way.\n The U.S. military response in the region continues and grows, Bush said. \"American military assets in the region are now aiding recovery efforts,\" he said. \"Patrol and cargo aircraft have been surveying damage and delivering supplies for several days. Air Force C-130s are flying aid missions 24 hours a day.\"\n \n The U.S. Navy's Abraham Lincoln Carrier Battle Group is off the coast of Sumatra and transporting relief supplies by helicopter. \"Other naval and Marine assets will arrive shortly to generate clean water and provide further logistical help,\" Bush said.\n \n In addition to the Abraham Lincoln group, the Bonhomme Richard Expeditionary Strike Group will be arriving in the region Jan. 4, said Marine Brig. Gen. John Allen, DoD's coordinator for tsunami-relief efforts.\n \n Allen stressed that military forces are working very closely with host nations. \"These operations are operations for the countries themselves,\" Allen said during a State Department briefing today. \"We work very closely with Thailand; we're working very closely with Indonesia; we're working very closely with Sri Lanka and the Maldives, because it will be in those areas in which the relief process will occur, and it is their relief.\"\n \n When the Bonhomme Richard group reaches the area, its 24 helicopters will join the 19 of the Lincoln group delivering humanitarian supplies to isolated areas. Another organization, Maritime Prepositioning Ship Squadron 3, is also headed to the theater, Allen said.\n \n The six ships in the prepositioning squadron, from Guam and Japan, are very large container ships. They can store up to 90,000 gallons of fresh water and can produce tens of thousands of gallons of fresh water a day, and helicopters can operate from aboard these vessels.\n \n Air Force planes are providing much of the lift capacity, Allen said. \"The Air Force has delivered, at this juncture, 430,000 pounds of supplies into the region,\" he said. \"C-130s are converging on the region; there are about 17 on the ground now.\"\n \n Larger aircraft -- C-17 Globemaster IIIs and C-5 Galaxys -- also are bringing in needed supplies and other relief equipment.DefenseLink News Article: Bush, Clinton to Head Relief Fund; Tsunami Aid Continues\n\n \n \nWe take our \"war on poverty\" aircraft carrier, stick it out in the middle of the ocean, and the poor people will swim to it. That way we can fight the war on poverty THERE instead of HERE.\n\n \n \nOr that we are intelligent people capable of exhibiting meaningful logic. \n \n I happen to know for an absolute fact that you can drive a nail with a hand grenade. I have done it dozens of times. In Archie world, that apparently make a hand grenade a hammer.\n\n \n \nNo Daewoo, you still don't get Archie-logic. \n \n In Archie world, that makes a hammer a hand grenade.\n\n \n \nemoticon_smile Thanks for making my day with the comedy relief daewoo as you prove beyond any doubt how warped your idea of logic and intelligence is for all to see. Only in your mind would you deduce that driving a nail with a hand grenade is evidence of you being an intelligent person who is capable of using logic. :xbanghead Just for the heck of it though, did you ever consider picking up a rock or a tire iron instead, if an actual hammer wasn't available ? I know I would have looked for a rock rather than use a grenade. Does that option seem illogical and ignorant to you? emoticon_xhoho emoticon_xbye\n \n Now, as the stupidity of admitting to such an IGNORANT and ILLOGICAL move sinks in, come back with your back pedaling, justifications and the feeble attempt to explain the logic of what doing such a foolish thing is in the real world.emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n \nOr, Archie does not know a damn thing about hand grenades, which have a flat, machined bottom. You can beat on the bottom all day without any risk of the thing going off. Most hand grenades have flat bottoms. Only US hand grenades have machined bottoms, and it is so you can drive a nail with them.\n \n For years the army has issued tripwire kits that included in the instructions \"Drive pivot pin into suitable wooden surface with base of grenade\". The pivot pin was a #20 nail with a groove machined in it about 2\" from the top. \n \n Leaving rocks that look like somebody has tried to use them as a hammer laying around your booby trap is a bad idea.\n\n \n \nSince you didn't see fit to actually produce any impartial evidence of your claim, I'm withholding a response until I can verify your claim. You see daewoo, my problem is that grenades aren't made with hardened steel but are specifically designed to fragment since it's the shrapnel they produce that kills. Therefore I struggle with your assertion that the military encourages soldiers to use them as a hammer. \n \n If I'm wrong about that, I'll admit it with no problem, but no way would I participate in such an activity even if it was allowed. I don't know, I just have a problem using something that's filled with high explosives and is designed to blow up as a hammer. Call me crazy, or is it the guy that does such a thing who's really the crazy one?\n\n \n If you have followed this exchange, you can plainly see that the large red bolded prediction I made before this ever got started has played out exactly as predicted. And remember, after 50 posts he still hasn't proven the two claims he made at the very outset of his pompous blustering as the forum know it all. So join me in demanding that he prove his lie is in fact true. ;) ",

But you are so shallow that you actually feel superior to someone you don't even personally know. How consistently sanctimonious of you...\n \n And in case it's beyond you to recognize it, the subject under discussion is daewoos/the great deceivers claim that hand grenades make good hammers also. Here is the second post on this thread. I wrote it in direct response to your baiting, biased, Leftist link: http://www.4forums.com/political/current-events-debates/12469-war-terror-hoax.html#post347581 The responses offered by you and the great deceiver were attempts to mock me rather than actually respond to my posts.\n \n Then the great deceiver stated that using a hand grenade as a hammer was an example of his logic and intelligence. Till now he hasn't supported that contention, and even now he is back pedaling and attempting to justify it without admitting he is a liar. And you are such a philosophical coward, you don't have the courage to answer a simple question either. Go on tq, would you use a live hand grenade as a hammer? Are you afraid to answer? Or like a good lap dog you don't want to stand against your master by admitting how utterly stupid and insane his statement of fact was as he claimed he has done it dozens of times and knows for a FACT that it's done?\n \n \ndaewoo said: \n Or that we are intelligent people capable of exhibiting meaningful logic. \n \n I happen to know for an absolute fact that you can drive a nail with a hand grenade. I have done it dozens of times.

In this case I did not really think about it because it was just an example that was absolutely and completely immaterial to the debate. \n\n \n To be fair, it is ALL your fault, and tq's since you made the stupid statement that you have used a hand grenade as a hammer dozens of times as an example of your intelligence and logic, and in your attempt to mock me for posting direct responses to YOUR condescending insults which were directed at me for my on point responses to your posts. \n \n And you're usually careful about sticking to things which can be proven? Really!!! Then why did you post this self aggrandizing post just recently which I almost called you on to prove, but decided you just aren't worth the effort. http://www.4forums.com/political/349148-post9.html But since you raised the issue by making another false claim, tell us Father of Lies, why, in your self important and delusional mind have you had to have dealings with the ATF? And can you prove that lie?\n \n \n Then, instead of putting mornign star on ignore like I should have to begin with (I knew the guy was a troll and still followed the argument) I got involved in this insane back and forth about something that can not be proven either way. I also can not prove that I got up this morning. In fact, I can not factually prove that I have ever gone to the bathroom. Shocking, I know.\n\n \n You responded right in character. As a cocky blowhard who is so arrogant that you could bluff your way through with lies and by controlling the debate by directing it away from areas which you can't control. You believed you could use your smoke and mirrors along with enough bluster to sound so confident in your claims that you could pass off that you are right without ever proving it. \n \n Why else would you list numerous manuals by name as evidence rather than just quote the direct evidence from those manuals to prove your claim? You're a liar and a poser and I have proven it beyond any doubt even though you have continued to lie and insist how badly you have spanked me. Here's an example of your most recent delusion: See, Marc, that is how it is done. \n Mess with Daewoo and he will pull your pants down and spank your bare butt until you cry like a little girl. waaaaa waaaaa waaaaa\n \n So now I beg you oh \"Father of LIES\", why does the guy who spanked Archangel so severely put the guy he spanked on ignore? Usually the guy who gets spanked does the running for cover and puts the guy scoring the points on ignore. So can we assume that your reasoning is again dishonest and the reason you put me on ignore is because you want to lick your wounds without being reminded how pathetic you are?\n \n And don't forget that this gives you an excuse for not responding to me since you can't with any rational, logical or intelligent comeback which will redeem your character. And that's because YOU DID LIE, AND YOU CAN'T FIND ANY SOLDIERS ON THE WHOLE OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB TO SUPPORT YOUR INSANE AND IRRATIONAL CLAIM THAT USING A HAND GRENADE AS A HAMMER IS AN INTELLIGENT AND LOGICAL USE FOR A LETHAL EXPLOSIVE DEVICE.\n \n \n I did admit that I could not prove the statement, retracted it, and used another example, but somehow we still went on for like another 4 pages and managed to drag some poor seabee from another forum into it.\n\n \n Sure you could prove it!!! If it was a true statement, that is. And you never retracted it at all. I marvel at how you are attempting to actually make yourself sound rational here when it was you who made the ridiculous claim, and then proceeded to defend it for 50 posts or more. emoticon_xdonno\n \n Also, you could take my suggestion and find a military forum of your choice and ask the soldiers there to back you, an alleged fellow soldier up in your claim that using a hand grenade as a hammer is an accepted practice in the field, by soldiers. That would prove it is a real world practice by real world soldiers. So don't lie again and say that it can't be proven unless your admitting that the reason for that is because it's a lie and you realize that you can't get anyone to support it. That was my motivation for going to the military forum, your alleged brothers in Arms whom you have proceeded to attack and insult as posers and wannabe's, being the good and loyal vet that you are. \n \n If you weren't so pathetic in your dishonesty as you attempt to insult me by referring to me as morning star, you would be laughable. But sadly, there is nothing funny about the arrogance, hubris, sanctimony and ignorance which people like you and tq represent around here on such a regular basis. So thanks for the spanking daewoo, it felt good. Now you be sure to run away into a deep hole and lick your wounds. But feel free to come back and spank me anytime you can garner the courage to face me again.\n \n I have no doubt that even though you claim you have me on IGNORE (another lie) as an excuse to run away, that you will pounce the first time you think an opportunity presents itself. So come back anytime my dishonest friend. I look forward to the next beat down you direct my way. emoticon_xgood",

Because there's people in other countries that hold the same beliefs as the hijackers?\n\n \n Simple, because the dead hijackers were soldiers of radical islam who were acting under orders of the so called generals in Al-Quada who have signed Fatwas/declarations of war long before that attack took place. It just took that terrorist act to finally motivate the Government to face this enemy head on after more than 35 years of similar attacks around the world. \n \n \nThere's other people in America that think the same way as McVeigh.

I challenge you to simply take the time to just scroll through the lists for each year, you don't even have to read the individual attacks and the number of dead civilians they represent. And see how long it takes you to just scroll through the deaths that this ideology represents in the real world. How you can disagree with confronting them once and for all boggles my mind.\n \n Especially since these attacks have been going on since the 60s. This is nothing new Dr. And why you think that they will go away if we just ignore them makes absolutely no sense at all, and has proven to just empower them to become more bold in their attacks as 9/11 is very real evidence of.\n \n And no comment on whether you would use a live hand grenade as a hammer as daewoo claims is evidence of his intelligence and logic? It's really a very simple question.",

Do you have any idea how many military forums full of REMFs and posers you would have to go through to find a good one??? I have no desire.\n\n \n Before going any further into this response, let me quote my own prediction in the very first post I wrote in response to your inane claim that using a hand grenade as a hammer is an intelligent and logical activity. [Archangel said:] Now, as the stupidity of admitting to such an IGNORANT and ILLOGICAL move sinks in, come back with your back pedaling, justifications and the feeble attempt to explain the logic of what doing such a foolish thing is in the real world. And all we have gotten from you in this thread, and continue to get in this post is exactly that.\n \n Also, so you don't even trust the opinions of your own alleged brothers in arms to verify that what you say is true, huh poser? Even REMFs whom you insult on one hand and then attempt to show respect to when soldiers take offense at being referred to as such went through the same training as you allegedly did and are qualified to comment on whether or not it's advisable to use a hand grenade as a hammer. But first and foremost you must excuse and justify your blatant ignorance at all cost while never admitting you're a puffed up liar and a deceiver.\n \n \nSecond, I would embarrassed to use a bandwagon argument based on testimony from anonymous internet sources as \"proof\" of anything. That is the kind of pathetic tactic that ignorant trolls who are incapable of even recognizing a logical argument would use. Yes, that IS exactly the tactic morning star tried to use.\n\n \n What I find humorous is that you are simple enough to actually think that anyone is buying this attempt to blow off what every reasonable person must consider is the most rational way for you to verify your claim with the support of like minded soldiers who have experienced the same real time training and activities that you have experienced. \n \n We are talking about the opportunity for you to reach out to fellow soldiers whom you could ask specific and targeted questions to that pin point experiences and training so you could know that you had like minded soldiers with comparable expertise, and you scoff at that opportunity by claiming that all you will find are REMFs or posers. All that coming from the king of posers. \n \n \n Finally, I dont actually care of he shuts up or not. If you go to usercp there is an ignore feature there and it makes the annoying people go away.\n\n \n Not go away liar, that feature just means you must click on the post to read it rather than having to face the object of your defeat and humiliation every time you click on a thread. It's also an interesting tact for the ego-maniacal schmuck who said this: daewoo said: \n See, Marc, that is how it is done. \n Mess with Daewoo and he will pull your pants down and spank your bare butt until you cry like a little girl. waaaaa waaaaa waaaaa \n \n Big bad daewoo spanked Archangel so badly, he called him morningstar and then placed him on ignore. Or so he says. But everyone knows daewoo is a liar so nobody knows what to believe anymore. He would have us believe that he has even had contact with the ATF. \n \n \n I have no emotional investment here. I dont care if he believes me or not. We are talking about strangers on an internet forum here...not people who matter. Even if I knew morning star in the real world I would not care what he thinks or go out of my way to improve his opinion of me. He is a nobody...human trash...he does not matter. A lot of people hate me. As long as they are not people who matter, I do not care.\n\n \n Finally the father of lies actually says something I can wrap my brain around and actually accept as an absolutely true statement. I believe that a lot of people who know you in person hate you based on your superior and condescending know it all attitude here. As for which of us is human trash, I will leave it up to God to determine that at the judgement. \n \n \n What morning star misses is that I dont actually CARE about most of this stuff. Debate is a game I like to play. It is about logic and knowledge. It is like Sudoku with words. If you lie it invalidates the game, and what fun is that?\n\n \n Sure you care. Can't you say anything without lying and attempting to cover your true feelings? Don't you see daewoo, if you weren't so pathetic and sad a human being, you wouldn't have to lie and build yourself up to appear to be something you're not, here. Your excuses betray the truth about how important it is to you to be respected around here, even if you must bully, lie and intimidate people in order to control your perceived status here. You have fallen victim to the same self deception which corrupts and ultimately destroys all weak and insecure bullies.\n \n \nThat is also why I generally avoid people like morning star on debate forums. I have noticed that very religious people actually lose the ability to maintain a logical train of thought. I think it is because to really be a true believer...a hard core fundamentalist, you have to unquestionably accept so much illogical nonsense that they train themselves to disregard logic completely. I am not talking about people who believe in religion in generally, just the VERY religious. \n\n \n Here again is more of your irrational, so called logic. On the one hand you say you generally avoid people like me. Yet it was you who precipitated this whole exchange by responding to my on topic posts with condescending personal insults, after I responded directly to things you and tq posted. All anyone need do is go back to the first 10 or 15 posts of this thread to confirm that. \n \n You also claim it is we fundamentalists who, to quote you: accept so much illogical nonsense that they train themselves to disregard logic completely. Yet beside the fact that I can read your insecurities so accurately, it is you who says that using a hand grenade as a hammer is evidence of your intelligence and logic, oh bomber of logic. You obviously don't have a logical brain cell to your credit and that has been amply proven in this exchange for every observer to witness first hand. Not to mention the expected and predicted back pedaling, justifications and excuses which was so accurately predicted by me.\n \n \n Even after it backfired on him completely and made him look like a total m0r0n I doubt morning star recognized how illogical it was to try to use a bandwagon argument based on anonymous internet sources.\n\n \n I'm sorry, what is it precisely that back fired on me again? Oh, you mean relying on true soldiers to comment on the intelligence and logic of using a hand grenade as a hammer? Only you would have the gaul to claim that back fired on me when it was your insane proposition which was lambasted as worthy of either a liar, a poser or someone in need of a section 8. But in your mind it must be the other guy who is losing, even when it is you who is running away and placing the alleged loser on ignore, so call a m0r0n if you like, but that issue has been settled already and it's you who is permanently tagged with that label. And on you, it's a perfect fit.\n \n All you have the where with all to do is to PM other new members and recommend they ignore me. That is the tactic of philosophical cowards who can't defeat an opponent with the truth in the arena of ideas. They must attempt to divide and segregate the opponent they can't beat or intimidate. The true act of cowards and bullies which you define so perfectly. \n \n To finish up, I will only demand that you do place me on ignore, and don't you dare respond to this post at all. You can then go into hiding like a good coward in defeat and humiliation with the knowledge that everyone knows you are a liar, who although you claim to have served in the military, don't even trust your fellow soldiers to back up your claims that using a hand grenade as a hammer is an intelligent and logical use for a deadly explosive ordinance. Now go away daewoo, I can't handle any more of your spankings. emoticon_smile emoticon_rolleyes emoticon_xbye \n \n PS Marc started with this link so let me finish with it since you ran away from it also. http://www.4forums.com/political/349991-post79.html",

Among President Bush's last words as he left office was the warning that America would soon be struck again by Muslim terrorists. \n \n If America were infected with terrorists, we would not need the government to tell us. We would know it from events. As there are no events, the US government substitutes warnings in order to keep alive the fear that causes the public to accept pointless wars, the infringement of civil liberty, national ID cards, and inconveniences and harassments when they fly.\n [ARCHANGEL]Regarding the first paragraph, show me the US Government propaganda which states that terrorist cells are spread throughout America. I want to see News reports which are regular and persistent which state this as an absolute fact according to the government.\n \n [ARTICLE]The most obvious indication that there are no terrorist cells is that not a single neocon has been assassinated.\n [ARCHANGEL]This biased jerk is asking for the assassination of conservatives as evidence that terrorist cells exist in America, and if that did happen, he would then declare that they got what they deserved and it is evidence that the Left is right in their desire to appease the terrorists.\n \n Modern Terrorism which will hit America will be a mass holocaust, not attacks on individuals. You would think that these mooks would have at least learned that from 9/11.\n I do not approve of assassinations, and am ashamed of my country's government for engaging in political assassination. The US and Israel have set a very bad example for al Qaeda to follow.\n Please list the foreign leaders our Government has assassinated. \n The US deals with al Qaeda and Taliban by assassinating their leaders, and Israel deals with Hamas by assassinating its leaders. It is reasonable to assume that al Qaeda would deal with the instigators and leaders of America's wars in the Middle East in the same way. \n This is a blatant lie on every level of honest rationale. Neither we nor Israel just targets leaders. We target terrorist cells in their hideouts and fire a missile up their butts if possible. That their leaders are there is evidence that they are also terrorists in those hideouts. They deserve no special privileges as active participants in mass murder.\n Today every al Qaeda member is aware of the complicity of neoconservatives in the death and devastation inflicted on Muslims in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and Gaza. Moreover, neocons are highly visible and are soft targets compared to Hamas and Hezbollah leaders. Neocons have been identified in the media for years, and as everyone knows, multiple listings of their names are available online.\n Again with blaming neoconservatives. I thought we were all Americans. Is this jerk what you consider an unbiased and objective journalist? If so, then you are no better than he is.\n  Neocons do not have Secret Service protection. Dreadful to contemplate, but it would be child's play for al Qaeda to assassinate any and every neocon. Yet, neocons move around freely, a good indication that the US does not have a terrorist problem.\n \n If, as neocons constantly allege, terrorists can smuggle nuclear weapons or dirty bombs into the US with which to wreak havoc upon our cities, terrorists can acquire weapons with which to assassinate any neocon or former government official.\n \n Yet, the neocons, who are the Americans most hated by Muslims, remain unscathed.\n Can you believe this schmuck? He is actually saying that because conservatives aren't being picked off like clay pigeons then terrorism is obviously a non existent issue in this world. In case it's beyond you and this twit to realize it, I posted a list of the terrorist attacks which have taken place over the first two months of 2009 here: http://www.4forums.com/political/current-events-debates/12469-war-terror-hoax.html#post347581 which directly speaks to the idiocy of this line of reasoning. Not to mention the extensive list of all of the documented terrorist attacks which have all been committed by radical islam since 2001 here: TheReligionofPeace.com - Islam: Making a True Difference in the World\n The \"war on terror\" is a hoax that fronts for American control of oil pipelines, the profits of the military-security complex, the assault on civil liberty by fomenters of a police state, and Israel's territorial expansion.\n Really? Then show, and I mean prove that Iraqi oil is even coming to this country as any type of repayment or reimbursement for ridding that Country of a mass murdering dictator. And prove that Israel is a terrorist state rather than a victim of terrorism. This anti-semite is nothing but a hater in the guise of a typical elitist leftist who prefers to coddle terrorists rather than stand up for the uncountable numbers of civilians who have died at the hand of islamic terrorism.\n  There were no al Qaeda in Iraq until the Americans brought them there by invading and overthrowing Saddam Hussein, who kept al Qaeda out of Iraq. The Taliban is not a terrorist organization, but a movement attempting to unify Afghanistan under Muslim law. The only Americans threatened by the Taliban are the Americans Bush sent to Afghanistan to kill Taliban and to impose a puppet state on the Afghan people.\n This is a lie which has been exposed within days of the invasion, yet the leftist hatemongers still make the claim because truth means nothing to them, but propaganda means everything. The records have been documented that prove the 9/11 terrorists trained on a grounded jet liner in Iraq in the months prior to the attack as guests of Saddam Hussein. Here, educate yourself regarding some of the proven areas which Hussein was involved in: http://www.nationalreview.com/murdock/murdock200310210934.asp\n Hamas is the democratically elected government of Palestine, or what little remains of Palestine after Israel's illegal annexations. Hamas is a terrorist organization in the same sense that the Israeli government and the US government are terrorist organizations. In an effort to bring Hamas under Israeli hegemony, Israel employs terror bombing and assassinations against Palestinians. Hamas replies to the Israeli terror with homemade and ineffectual rockets.\n More lies! Hamas is a dedicated terrorist group whos credo states that they exist to destroy Israel and drive every Jew into the sea or kill them. And the reality as to Israels response to Hamas attacks is exactly the opposite of what this liar states it is. Radical Islam is dedicated to destroying christianity and free thought everywhere on EARTH, and their mosques are the podium through which they preach their gospel of hatred. Want PROOF? Here ya go!!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0n85JVqXQQ&feature=related \n Hezbollah represents the Shi'ites of southern Lebanon, another area in the Middle East that Israel seeks for its territorial expansion.\n Then why has Israel aided Lebenon in driving Syrian forces out of that Country on 2 occasions, only to leave and ask for nothing in return after succeeding in that task? Does the truth mean nothing to these haters and fear mongers against the good guys? And don't you leftist schmucks have any more sense than to check these claims to see if they are true before swallowing them hook line and sinker? Here, educate yourself regarding the truth in one of those instances: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/lebanese-christian-leader-demands-syrian-withdrawal-685898.html\n The US brands Hamas and Hezbollah \"terrorist organizations\" for no other reason than the US is on Israel's side of the conflict. There is no objective basis for the US Department of State's \"finding\" that Hamas and Hezbollah are terrorist organizations. It is merely a propagandistic declaration.\n That's because they are terrorist organizations!!!!!!!! And if you are too blind to recognize that reality then I pity your blindness and your ignorance. See the history and depth of the hatred radical islamics have for Jews in general. This has been going on since before the State of Israel has even existed. But appeasers and deniers of history rewrite it in order to inoculate themselves of responsibility for the atrocities they endorse by supporting the mass murderers rather than the victims. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hFywMAn5k4&feature=related I dare you to watch this whole video and see what this ideology which you defend truly represents.\n Americans and Israelis do not call their bombings of civilians terror. What Americans and Israelis call terror is the response of oppressed people who are stateless because their countries are ruled by puppets loyal to the oppressors. These people, dispossessed of their own countries, have no State Departments, Defense Departments, seats in the United Nations, or voices in the mainstream media. They can submit to foreign hegemony or resist by the limited means available to them.\n Lies and misinformation, yet you buy it whole cloth because it makes you feel warm and fuzzy about how big and bad we are. But it's all lies since we attack them in self defense. Their attacks are documented above. Please click on the links and see what these mass murderers represent in reality. Radicalism is a generational hatred which their children are indoctrinated into from childhood. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5jfmEhUHk&feature=related But you remain willfully blind and ignorant to this reality. @ around 9:40 into this video at a rally in NY City you hear the islamic speaker declare as he stomped on an American flag, don't be afraid to speak out against America, the freedom of expression is one of the LOOPHOLES in their laws. They don't speak for justice but for our destruction as a people. Yet you condemn us and our ally Israel. You don't even deserve the Liberty and freedom so many Americans died to protect and insure that you have. And for that reason, you will surely lose them in your lifetime.\n The fact that Israel and the United States carry on endless propaganda to prevent this fundamental truth from being realized indicates that it is Israel and the US that are in the wrong and the Palestinians, Lebanese, Iraqis, and Afghans who are being wronged.\n The true propagandists which you ignore is hamas and hezballah who place civilians in positions where they attack Israel from, then when the human shields get killed in the response, Israel is blamed for their deaths. But it's the terrorists who placed the innocents in harms way, not Israel.\n The retired American generals who serve as war propagandists for Fox \"News\" are forever claiming that Iran arms the Iraqi and Afghan insurgents and Hamas. But where are the arms? To deal with American tanks, insurgents have to construct homemade explosive devices out of artillery shells. After six years of conflict the insurgents still have no weapon against the American helicopter gunships. Contrast this \"arming\" with the weaponry the US supplied to the Afghans three decades ago when they were fighting to drive out the Soviets.\n More lies and misinformation. The weapons have been found with Iranian markings on them and the shells and directions for making the IEDs are of Iranian manufacture. \n The films of Israel's murderous assault on Gaza show large numbers of Gazans fleeing from Israeli bombs or digging out the dead and maimed, and none of these people is armed. A person would think that by now every Palestinian would be armed, every man, woman, and child. Yet, all the films of the Israeli attack show an unarmed population. Hamas has to construct homemade rockets that are little more than a sign of defiance. If Hamas were armed by Iran, Israel's assault on Gaza would have cost Israel its helicopter gunships, its tanks, and hundreds of lives of its soldiers.\n Really? Is this liar blind to the videos of Palestinians/hamas protesting in the streets of Israel firing their kalishnikovs into the air? Do these people look unarmed to you? And do you endorse using children to fight rather than attempt to make peace? YouTube - Palestinian Children and GAZA Terrorism\n Hamas is a small organization armed with small caliber rifles incapable of penetrating body armor. Hamas is unable to stop small bands of Israeli settlers from descending on West Bank Palestinian villages, driving out the Palestinians, and appropriating their land.\n But no comment on Israel making themselves more vulnerable to these rocket attacks by giving back Gaza, the Golan Heights and returning the land they took from Jordan and Egypt, all land they gained through foreign invasions which attempted to destroy her. None of that TRUTH matters to you does it?\n  The great mystery is: why after 60 years of oppression are the Palestinians still an unarmed people? Clearly, the Muslim countries are complicit with Israel and the US in keeping the Palestinians unarmed.\n They aren't, which the above video clearly shows. All Lies which you sop up like a starving man at a thanksgiving dinner.\n The unsupported assertion that Iran supplies sophisticated arms to the Palestinians is like the unsupported assertion that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. These assertions are propagandistic justifications for killing Arab civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure in order to secure US and Israeli hegemony in the Middle East. \n Prove it. Cheap lip service is easy, how about some actual evidence to support any of this drivel which is all lies and leftist anti-jewish propaganda and hate speech. \n \n So there you have it. I have shown why this is a bunch of biased subjective propaganda with no basis in fact at all. Now go for once and prove the claims this bigot is making. My first response to this OP stands and is right on the money as far as I'm concerned.\n \n But tell me this foundit, would you use a hand grenade as a hammer as daewoo says is evidence of his intelligence and logic?",

   "Simple, because the dead hijackers were soldiers of radical islam who were acting under orders of the so called generals in Al-Quada who have signed Fatwas/declarations of war long before that attack took place. It just took that terrorist act to finally motivate the Government to face this enemy head on after more than 35 years of similar attacks around the world.\n\n \n \"Face the enemy head on\"? So you're saying that a conventional war and an invasion of a country is the best way to fight terrorism, even though a majority of the population are most likely NOT \"soldiers of radical Islam?\" \n \n \nBecause that would be overkill in a civilized society which is ruled by Laws. Believe me, our Government has moles in every single subversive and militant group they know of. Including mosques and churches. To target all citizens like the Gestapo would be a waste of resources and force the real threats underground.\n\n \n Are you implying Iraq was not a nation ruled by laws? The case you are making here is the exact same case I am making about Iraq. You are agreeing with me whether you realize it or not. I believe, in regards to our war in Iraq, \"to target all citizens like the Gestapo would be a waste of resources and force the real threats underground.\"\n \n \nFrance is a Nation State and is responsible for policing her own subversives. We have no authority to intervene unless the Government overtly adopts the radical islamic philosophy and becomes a true threat which seeks to destroy us as radical islam has vowed to do, unless we convert of course.\n\n \n Iraq was also a sovereign nation, the same as France. Saddam was \"responsible for policing his own subversives.\" You may not agree with their laws, their religion, or their culture, but that doesn't change this fact. We have no authority to intervene unless Iraq, as a country, presents a clear and present danger to the US. I'm not sure if you're aware of this or not, but Saddam actually kept radical members of the Taliban OUT of Iraq. Saddam Hussein posed less of a threat than Iran and North Korea. Why don't we invade those countries as well?\n \n \nReally? Are you suggesting that Oklahoma represented this degree and level of threat to our way of life, and survival as a Nation and a People? http://www.4forums.com/political/347581-post2.html The copy and paste reflects just the first 2 months of 2009 worth of terrorist attacks world wide. The other links within the site reflect JUST attacks going back to 2001. I challenge you to simply take the time to just scroll through the lists for each year, you don't even have to read the individual attacks and the number of dead civilians they represent. And see how long it takes you to just scroll through the deaths that this ideology represents in the real world. How you can disagree with confronting them once and for all boggles my mind.\n\n \n How you can believe invading a country is confronting terrorism once and for all boggles my mind. You are misrepresenting my point. I never said terrorism isn't a real threat. I never claimed the Oklahoma City bombing represented an ideology more dangerous than radical Islam.\n \n This is what a posted earlier, and I will repeat it: My point is that the response to 9/11 was as illogical as declaring martial law after the Oklahoma bombings. You agree that declaring martial law is illogical to fight domestic terrorists, yet we've done the equivalent of martial law in Iraq. How can you reconcile this contradiction? You seem to be saying that, because Islam represents more of a threat, this strategy will somehow become a winning one when used in another country.\n \n \nEspecially since these attacks have been going on since the 60s. This is nothing new Dr. And why you think that they will go away if we just ignore them makes absolutely no sense at all, and has proven to just empower them to become more bold in their attacks as 9/11 is very real evidence of.\n\n \n Again, you've completely misrepresented my point. I never said they will go away if we ignore them, and this is nothing but an illogical conclusion of yours based on what I've written so far. I've said that invading a country is not the proper response to fight terrorism, and you've basically agreed with me, you just haven't realized it yet.\n \n \nAnd no comment on whether you would use a live hand grenade as a hammer as daewoo claims is evidence of his intelligence and logic? It's really a very simple question.\n\n \n I am not responding to this question because I know nothing about hand grenades and I feel I am not qualified to discuss the topic. It's also completely irrelevant to the main topic, not to mention rather annoying that you continue to harp on this one silly point.",

   "\"Face the enemy head on\"? So you're saying that a conventional war and an invasion of a country is the best way to fight terrorism, even though a majority of the population are most likely NOT \"soldiers of radical Islam?\n\n \n In case you don't know it, most of the population in Iraq appreciates what the coalition forces have done in ridding them of the despot, Saddam Hussein who is only remembered for the number of mass graves he left in his wake. This man was dedicated to aiding and abetting terrorism on a mass scale and had no right leading a country as he did. We did the world a favor whether you realize it or not.\n \n Also, if you honestly added up the number of civilian dead due to this war, you would find that most all of them were killed by fellow moslem terrorists over the past 5 years through suicide bombings and mass murders. Our delay in leaving has been due to the need to restrain the terrorists from these acts of terror. How can you not be aware of that reality?\n \n \n\" Are you implying Iraq was not a nation ruled by laws? The case you are making here is the exact same case I am making about Iraq. You are agreeing with me whether you realize it or not. I believe, in regards to our war in Iraq, \"to target all citizens like the Gestapo would be a waste of resources and force the real threats underground.\"\n\n \n See the bolded? That is exactly what I'm saying. Iraq's laws were defined by a dictator who protected his own and screw the rest. They ended up in mass graves if they dared to question personal sense of justice and right and wrong.\n \n \nIraq was also a sovereign nation, the same as France. Saddam was \"responsible for policing his own subversives.\" You may not agree with their laws, their religion, or their culture, but that doesn't change this fact. \n\n The problem you are forgetting is that Saddam was one of the subversives. How can you be either ignorant of or in denial of that FACT? And having been raised into Islam, I have nothing against the culture at all. Although the laws and religion are another story, I would never condone going to war over that. This man was an evil despot who paid the families of dead suicide bombers a 25,000 dollar bounty anywhere in the world for committing a terrorist act. Does that sound like a man of peace to you? Also, here are other points to his resume for you to ponder. Deroy Murdock on Iraq on National Review Online\n \n \n We have no authority to intervene unless Iraq, as a country, presents a clear and present danger to the US. I'm not sure if you're aware of this or not, but Saddam actually kept radical members of the Taliban OUT of Iraq. Saddam Hussein posed less of a threat than Iran and North Korea. Why don't we invade those countries as well?\n\n \n Saddam dealt with every radical islamic group from a distance due to his paranoia and fear that they would turn on him. He was the boldest and most overtly violent National leader in the Middle East at the time. Dealing with him was the right thing to do since he was also expanding his power base by invading a friendly and non aggressive neighbor like Kuwait.\n \n \nThis is what a posted earlier, and I will repeat it: My point is that the response to 9/11 was as illogical as declaring martial law after the Oklahoma bombings. You agree that declaring martial law is illogical to fight domestic terrorists, yet we've done the equivalent of martial law in Iraq. How can you reconcile this contradiction? You seem to be saying that, because Islam represents more of a threat, this strategy will somehow become a winning one when used in another country.\n\n \n We haven't declared Martial Law in Iraq. We have created an independent democratic government which even has women serving in elected positions now. Something that is anathema in most every other islamic country today. \n \n \nAgain, you've completely misrepresented my point. I never said they will go away if we ignore them, and this is nothing but an illogical conclusion of yours based on what I've written so far. I've said that invading a country is not the proper response to fight terrorism, and you've basically agreed with me, you just haven't realized it yet.\n\n \n Then what is the proper solution? And I haven't misrepresented your position at all. All I have done is responded to you with real world facts which blow holes in your shallow insights. Tell us how to deal with these mass murderers without confronting them where they live and hide? Negotiations don't work because they wont negotiate. They are dedicated only to using terrorism to send their political messages and demands. So share an actual solution rather than just condemning confronting them with military force.\n \n \nI am not responding to this question because I know nothing about hand grenades and I feel I am not qualified to discuss the topic. It's also completely irrelevant to the main topic, not to mention rather annoying that you continue to harp on this one silly point.\n\n \n Presumably you have common sense though, and this exchange has dominated this thread more so than the ignorant, hateful and biased OP which has tq posted in the OP. The question wasn't even if you felt it would blow up if you banged it like a hammer as that would be asking for an informed opinion. My question is simply, \"would you use a hand grenade as a hammer as daewoo claims it is evidence of his intelligence and logic\"? The question is, do you agree with daewoos statement of fact? That isn't a difficult question for any intellectually honest person with a brain and the willingness to give their own personal honest opinion.

   "Obviously you were lying when you said you wanted to actually discuss the article foundit. Defending tq's OP which is founded in lies and misinformation is more important than the truth to you. \n \n \nAnybody who reads the opening article which opened this thread, and compares it to your current rants, can easily see T.Q is 100% correct.\n\n \n TQ hasn't been right since he learned that 1+1=2, and neither have you. But leave it to you to make unsupported claims while proving nothing at all and then assert how right you are. emoticon_xdonno\n \n \nIf you truly want to prove T.Q wrong, then\n a) Explain what the ORIGINAL article actually means (yeah right emoticon_rolleyes )\n b) DISCUSS the original article.\n\n \n Done and done, but in typical fashion the silence is deafening from the defenders of the mass murderers who seek every opportunity to condemn the country which allows you to spew your hate with no fear of repercussions. Now run away like daewoo has and be proud that you too, like him are unable to support your claims.\n \n \nPaul Craig Roberts: The War on Terror is a Hoax\n\n \n OK foundit, let's analyze this biased trash together shall we? \n \n Febuary 4, 2009\n \nThe War on Terror is a Hoax\n \n By PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS\n \n [ARTICLE]According to US government propaganda, terrorist cells are spread throughout America, making it necessary for the government to spy on all Americans and violate most other constitutional protections. Among President Bush&#8217;s last words as he left office was the warning that America would soon be struck again by Muslim terrorists. \n \n If America were infected with terrorists, we would not need the government to tell us. We would know it from events. As there are no events, the US government substitutes warnings in order to keep alive the fear that causes the public to accept pointless wars, the infringement of civil liberty, national ID cards, and inconveniences and harassments when they fly.\n\n \n [ARCHANGEL]Regarding the first paragraph, show me the US Government propaganda which states that terrorist cells are spread throughout America. I want to see News reports which are regular and persistent which state this as an absolute fact according to the government.\n \n \n[ARTICLE]The most obvious indication that there are no terrorist cells is that not a single neocon has been assassinated.\n\n \n [ARCHANGEL]This biased jerk is asking for the assassination of conservatives as evidence that terrorist cells exist in America, and if that did happen, he would then declare that they got what they deserved and it is evidence that the Left is right in their desire to appease the terrorists.\n \n Modern Terrorism which will hit America will be a mass holocaust, not attacks on individuals. You would think that these mooks would have at least learned that from 9/11.\n \n \nI do not approve of assassinations, and am ashamed of my country&#8217;s government for engaging in political assassination. The US and Israel have set a very bad example for al Qaeda to follow.\n\n \n Please list the foreign leaders our Government has assassinated. \n \n \nThe US deals with al Qaeda and Taliban by assassinating their leaders, and Israel deals with Hamas by assassinating its leaders. It is reasonable to assume that al Qaeda would deal with the instigators and leaders of America&#8217;s wars in the Middle East in the same way. \n\n \n This is a blatant lie on every level of honest rationale. Neither we nor Israel just targets leaders. We target terrorist cells in their hideouts and fire a missile up their butts if possible. That their leaders are there is evidence that they are also terrorists in those hideouts. They deserve no special privileges as active participants in mass murder.\n \n \nToday every al Qaeda member is aware of the complicity of neoconservatives in the death and devastation inflicted on Muslims in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and Gaza. Moreover, neocons are highly visible and are soft targets compared to Hamas and Hezbollah leaders. Neocons have been identified in the media for years, and as everyone knows, multiple listings of their names are available online.\n\n \n Again with blaming neoconservatives. I thought we were all Americans. Is this jerk what you consider an unbiased and objective journalist? If so, then you are no better than he is.\n \n \n Neocons do not have Secret Service protection. Dreadful to contemplate, but it would be child&#8217;s play for al Qaeda to assassinate any and every neocon. Yet, neocons move around freely, a good indication that the US does not have a terrorist problem.\n \n If, as neocons constantly allege, terrorists can smuggle nuclear weapons or dirty bombs into the US with which to wreak havoc upon our cities, terrorists can acquire weapons with which to assassinate any neocon or former government official.\n \n Yet, the neocons, who are the Americans most hated by Muslims, remain unscathed.\n\n \n Can you believe this schmuck? He is actually saying that because conservatives aren't being picked off like clay pigeons then terrorism is obviously a non existent issue in this world. In case it's beyond you and this twit to realize it, I posted a list of the terrorist attacks which have taken place over the first two months of 2009 here: http://www.4forums.com/political/current-events-debates/12469-war-terror-hoax.html#post347581 which directly speaks to the idiocy of this line of reasoning. Not to mention the extensive list of all of the documented terrorist attacks which have all been committed by radical islam since 2001 here: TheReligionofPeace.com - Islam: Making a True Difference in the World\n \n \nThe &#8220;war on terror&#8221; is a hoax that fronts for American control of oil pipelines, the profits of the military-security complex, the assault on civil liberty by fomenters of a police state, and Israel&#8217;s territorial expansion.\n\n \n Really? Then show, and I mean prove that Iraqi oil is even coming to this country as any type of repayment or reimbursement for ridding that Country of a mass murdering dictator. And prove that Israel is a terrorist state rather than a victim of terrorism. This anti-semite is nothing but a hater in the guise of a typical elitist leftist who prefers to coddle terrorists rather than stand up for the uncountable numbers of civilians who have died at the hand of islamic terrorism.\n \n \n There were no al Qaeda in Iraq until the Americans brought them there by invading and overthrowing Saddam Hussein, who kept al Qaeda out of Iraq. The Taliban is not a terrorist organization, but a movement attempting to unify Afghanistan under Muslim law. The only Americans threatened by the Taliban are the Americans Bush sent to Afghanistan to kill Taliban and to impose a puppet state on the Afghan people.\n\n \n This is a lie which has been exposed within days of the invasion, yet the leftist hatemongers still make the claim because truth means nothing to them, but propaganda means everything. The records have been documented that prove the 9/11 terrorists trained on a grounded jet liner in Iraq in the months prior to the attack as guests of Saddam Hussein. Here, educate yourself regarding some of the proven areas which Hussein was involved in: Deroy Murdock on Iraq on National Review Online\n \n \nHamas is the democratically elected government of Palestine, or what little remains of Palestine after Israel&#8217;s illegal annexations. Hamas is a terrorist organization in the same sense that the Israeli government and the US government are terrorist organizations. In an effort to bring Hamas under Israeli hegemony, Israel employs terror bombing and assassinations against Palestinians. Hamas replies to the Israeli terror with homemade and ineffectual rockets.\n\n \n More lies! Hamas is a dedicated terrorist group whos credo states that they exist to destroy Israel and drive every Jew into the sea or kill them. And the reality as to Israels response to Hamas attacks is exactly the opposite of what this liar states it is. Radical Islam is dedicated to destroying christianity and free thought everywhere on EARTH, and their mosques are the podium through which they preach their gospel of hatred. Want PROOF? Here ya go!!! YouTube - IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO THE WORLD FROM HAMAS \n \n \nHezbollah represents the Shi&#8217;ites of southern Lebanon, another area in the Middle East that Israel seeks for its territorial expansion.\n\n \n Then why has Israel aided Lebenon in driving Syrian forces out of that Country on 2 occasions, only to leave and ask for nothing in return after succeeding in that task? Does the truth mean nothing to these haters and fear mongers against the good guys? And don't you leftist schmucks have any more sense than to check these claims to see if they are true before swallowing them hook line and sinker? Here, educate yourself regarding the truth in one of those instances: Lebanese Christian leader demands Syrian withdrawal - Middle East, World - The Independent\n \n \nThe US brands Hamas and Hezbollah &#8220;terrorist organizations&#8221; for no other reason than the US is on Israel&#8217;s side of the conflict. There is no objective basis for the US Department of State&#8217;s &#8220;finding&#8221; that Hamas and Hezbollah are terrorist organizations. It is merely a propagandistic declaration.\n\n \n That's because they are terrorist organizations!!!!!!!! And if you are too blind to recognize that reality then I pity your blindness and your ignorance. See the history and depth of the hatred radical islamics have for Jews in general. This has been going on since before the State of Israel has even existed. But appeasers and deniers of history rewrite it in order to inoculate themselves of responsibility for the atrocities they endorse by supporting the mass murderers rather than the victims. YouTube - Obsession parte 4 I dare you to watch this whole video and see what this ideology which you defend truly represents.\n \n \nAmericans and Israelis do not call their bombings of civilians terror. What Americans and Israelis call terror is the response of oppressed people who are stateless because their countries are ruled by puppets loyal to the oppressors. These people, dispossessed of their own countries, have no State Departments, Defense Departments, seats in the United Nations, or voices in the mainstream media. They can submit to foreign hegemony or resist by the limited means available to them.\n\n \n Lies and misinformation, yet you buy it whole cloth because it makes you feel warm and fuzzy about how big and bad we are. But it's all lies since we attack them in self defense. Their attacks are documented above. Please click on the links and see what these mass murderers represent in reality. Radicalism is a generational hatred which their children are indoctrinated into from childhood. YouTube - Obsession parte 2 But you remain willfully blind and ignorant to this reality. @ around 9:40 into this video at a rally in NY City you hear the islamic speaker declare as he stomped on an American flag, don't be afraid to speak out against America, the freedom of expression is one of the LOOPHOLES in their laws. They don't speak for justice but for our destruction as a people. Yet you condemn us and our ally Israel. You don't even deserve the Liberty and freedom so many Americans died to protect and insure that you have. And for that reason, you will surely lose them in your lifetime.\n \n \nThe fact that Israel and the United States carry on endless propaganda to prevent this fundamental truth from being realized indicates that it is Israel and the US that are in the wrong and the Palestinians, Lebanese, Iraqis, and Afghans who are being wronged.\n\n \n The true propagandists which you ignore is hamas and hezballah who place civilians in positions where they attack Israel from, then when the human shields get killed in the response, Israel is blamed for their deaths. But it's the terrorists who placed the innocents in harms way, not Israel.\n \n \nThe retired American generals who serve as war propagandists for Fox &#8220;News&#8221; are forever claiming that Iran arms the Iraqi and Afghan insurgents and Hamas. But where are the arms? To deal with American tanks, insurgents have to construct homemade explosive devices out of artillery shells. After six years of conflict the insurgents still have no weapon against the American helicopter gunships. Contrast this &#8220;arming&#8221; with the weaponry the US supplied to the Afghans three decades ago when they were fighting to drive out the Soviets.\n\n \n More lies and misinformation. The weapons have been found with Iranian markings on them and the shells and directions for making the IEDs are of Iranian manufacture. \n \n \nThe films of Israel&#8217;s murderous assault on Gaza show large numbers of Gazans fleeing from Israeli bombs or digging out the dead and maimed, and none of these people is armed. A person would think that by now every Palestinian would be armed, every man, woman, and child. Yet, all the films of the Israeli attack show an unarmed population. Hamas has to construct homemade rockets that are little more than a sign of defiance. If Hamas were armed by Iran, Israel&#8217;s assault on Gaza would have cost Israel its helicopter gunships, its tanks, and hundreds of lives of its soldiers.\n\n \n Really? Is this liar blind to the videos of Palestinians/hamas protesting in the streets of Israel firing their kalishnikovs into the air? Do these people look unarmed to you? And do you endorse using children to fight rather than attempt to make peace? YouTube - Palestinian Children and GAZA Terrorism\n \n \nHamas is a small organization armed with small caliber rifles incapable of penetrating body armor. Hamas is unable to stop small bands of Israeli settlers from descending on West Bank Palestinian villages, driving out the Palestinians, and appropriating their land.\n\n \n But no comment on Israel making themselves more vulnerable to these rocket attacks by giving back Gaza, the Golan Heights and returning the land they took from Jordan and Egypt, all land they gained through foreign invasions which attempted to destroy her. None of that TRUTH matters to you does it?\n \n \n The great mystery is: why after 60 years of oppression are the Palestinians still an unarmed people? Clearly, the Muslim countries are complicit with Israel and the US in keeping the Palestinians unarmed.\n\n \n They aren't, which the above video clearly shows. All Lies which you sop up like a starving man at a thanksgiving dinner.\n \n \nThe unsupported assertion that Iran supplies sophisticated arms to the Palestinians is like the unsupported assertion that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. These assertions are propagandistic justifications for killing Arab civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure in order to secure US and Israeli hegemony in the Middle East. \n\n \n Prove it. Cheap lip service is easy, how about some actual evidence to support any of this drivel which is all lies and leftist anti-jewish propaganda and hate speech. \n \n So there you have it. I have shown why this is a bunch of biased subjective propaganda with no basis in fact at all. Now go for once and prove the claims this bigot is making. My first response to this OP stands and is right on the money as far as I'm concerned.\n \n But tell me this foundit, would you use a hand grenade as a hammer as daewoo says is evidence of his intelligence and logic?",

What a crock. The only poser here is daewoo and he has been effectively tagged as such.",

You see tq, like any good three year old, if you could actually point out any gaping holes in my logic which would be obvious to everyone, then you wouldn't miss the opportunity to pummel me for all to see. But like daewoo you don't do that at all.

I mean, once again, if that were actually true, you wouldn't just make the accusation, you would outline it in detail. \n \n So when all is said and done tq, all you have posted above is a truly idiotic and irrational rant which has no basis in fact at all which is so typical of the level of communication I get from your side of the aisle around here. Insults, attacks and hatred with no supporting evidence to show it is justified at all. That's why you hate me so much tq, because I actually document what you represent by quoting your own words and spoon feeding them back to you.

Now run away like daewoo has and be proud that you too, like him are unable to support your claims.\n \n \nPaul Craig Roberts: The War on Terror is a Hoax\n\n \n OK foundit, let's analyze this biased trash together shall we? \n \n Febuary 4, 2009\n \nThe War on Terror is a Hoax\n \n By PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS\n \n [ARTICLE]According to US government propaganda, terrorist cells are spread throughout America, making it necessary for the government to spy on all Americans and violate most other constitutional protections. Among President Bush's last words as he left office was the warning that America would soon be struck again by Muslim terrorists. \n \n If America were infected with terrorists, we would not need the government to tell us. We would know it from events. As there are no events, the US government substitutes warnings in order to keep alive the fear that causes the public to accept pointless wars, the infringement of civil liberty, national ID cards, and inconveniences and harassments when they fly.\n\n \n [ARCHANGEL]Regarding the first paragraph, show me the US Government propaganda which states that terrorist cells are spread throughout America. I want to see News reports which are regular and persistent which state this as an absolute fact according to the government.\n \n \n[ARTICLE]The most obvious indication that there are no terrorist cells is that not a single neocon has been assassinated.\n\n \n [ARCHANGEL]This biased jerk is asking for the assassination of conservatives as evidence that terrorist cells exist in America, and if that did happen, he would then declare that they got what they deserved and it is evidence that the Left is right in their desire to appease the terrorists.\n \n Modern Terrorism which will hit America will be a mass holocaust, not attacks on individuals. You would think that these mooks would have at least learned that from 9/11.\n \n \nI do not approve of assassinations, and am ashamed of my country's government for engaging in political assassination. The US and Israel have set a very bad example for al Qaeda to follow.\n\n \n Please list the foreign leaders our Government has assassinated. \n \n \nThe US deals with al Qaeda and Taliban by assassinating their leaders, and Israel deals with Hamas by assassinating its leaders. It is reasonable to assume that al Qaeda would deal with the instigators and leaders of America's wars in the Middle East in the same way. \n\n \n This is a blatant lie on every level of honest rationale. Neither we nor Israel just targets leaders. We target terrorist cells in their hideouts and fire a missile up their butts if possible. That their leaders are there is evidence that they are also terrorists in those hideouts. They deserve no special privileges as active participants in mass murder.\n \n \nToday every al Qaeda member is aware of the complicity of neoconservatives in the death and devastation inflicted on Muslims in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and Gaza. Moreover, neocons are highly visible and are soft targets compared to Hamas and Hezbollah leaders. Neocons have been identified in the media for years, and as everyone knows, multiple listings of their names are available online.\n\n \n Again with blaming neoconservatives. I thought we were all Americans. Is this jerk what you consider an unbiased and objective journalist? If so, then you are no better than he is.\n \n \n Neocons do not have Secret Service protection. Dreadful to contemplate, but it would be child's play for al Qaeda to assassinate any and every neocon. Yet, neocons move around freely, a good indication that the US does not have a terrorist problem.\n \n If, as neocons constantly allege, terrorists can smuggle nuclear weapons or dirty bombs into the US with which to wreak havoc upon our cities, terrorists can acquire weapons with which to assassinate any neocon or former government official.\n \n Yet, the neocons, who are the Americans most hated by Muslims, remain unscathed.\n\n \n Can you believe this schmuck? He is actually saying that because conservatives aren't being picked off like clay pigeons then terrorism is obviously a non existent issue in this world. In case it's beyond you and this twit to realize it, I posted a list of the terrorist attacks which have taken place over the first two months of 2009 here: http://www.4forums.com/political/current-events-debates/12469-war-terror-hoax.html#post347581 which directly speaks to the idiocy of this line of reasoning. Not to mention the extensive list of all of the documented terrorist attacks which have all been committed by radical islam since 2001 here: TheReligionofPeace.com - Islam: Making a True Difference in the World\n \n \nThe \"war on terror\" is a hoax that fronts for American control of oil pipelines, the profits of the military-security complex, the assault on civil liberty by fomenters of a police state, and Israel's territorial expansion.\n\n \n Really? Then show, and I mean prove that Iraqi oil is even coming to this country as any type of repayment or reimbursement for ridding that Country of a mass murdering dictator. And prove that Israel is a terrorist state rather than a victim of terrorism. This anti-semite is nothing but a hater in the guise of a typical elitist leftist who prefers to coddle terrorists rather than stand up for the uncountable numbers of civilians who have died at the hand of islamic terrorism.\n \n \n There were no al Qaeda in Iraq until the Americans brought them there by invading and overthrowing Saddam Hussein, who kept al Qaeda out of Iraq. The Taliban is not a terrorist organization, but a movement attempting to unify Afghanistan under Muslim law. The only Americans threatened by the Taliban are the Americans Bush sent to Afghanistan to kill Taliban and to impose a puppet state on the Afghan people.\n\n \n This is a lie which has been exposed within days of the invasion, yet the leftist hatemongers still make the claim because truth means nothing to them, but propaganda means everything. The records have been documented that prove the 9/11 terrorists trained on a grounded jet liner in Iraq in the months prior to the attack as guests of Saddam Hussein. Here, educate yourself regarding some of the proven areas which Hussein was involved in: Deroy Murdock on Iraq on National Review Online\n \n \nHamas is the democratically elected government of Palestine, or what little remains of Palestine after Israel's illegal annexations. Hamas is a terrorist organization in the same sense that the Israeli government and the US government are terrorist organizations. In an effort to bring Hamas under Israeli hegemony, Israel employs terror bombing and assassinations against Palestinians. Hamas replies to the Israeli terror with homemade and ineffectual rockets.\n\n \n More lies! Hamas is a dedicated terrorist group whos credo states that they exist to destroy Israel and drive every Jew into the sea or kill them. And the reality as to Israels response to Hamas attacks is exactly the opposite of what this liar states it is. Radical Islam is dedicated to destroying christianity and free thought everywhere on EARTH, and their mosques are the podium through which they preach their gospel of hatred. Want PROOF? Here ya go!!! YouTube - IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO THE WORLD FROM HAMAS \n \n \nHezbollah represents the Shi'ites of southern Lebanon, another area in the Middle East that Israel seeks for its territorial expansion.\n\n \n Then why has Israel aided Lebenon in driving Syrian forces out of that Country on 2 occasions, only to leave and ask for nothing in return after succeeding in that task? Does the truth mean nothing to these haters and fear mongers against the good guys? And don't you leftist schmucks have any more sense than to check these claims to see if they are true before swallowing them hook line and sinker? Here, educate yourself regarding the truth in one of those instances: Lebanese Christian leader demands Syrian withdrawal - Middle East, World - The Independent\n \n \nThe US brands Hamas and Hezbollah \"terrorist organizations\" for no other reason than the US is on Israel's side of the conflict. There is no objective basis for the US Department of State's \"finding\" that Hamas and Hezbollah are terrorist organizations. It is merely a propagandistic declaration.\n\n \n That's because they are terrorist organizations!!!!!!!! And if you are too blind to recognize that reality then I pity your blindness and your ignorance. See the history and depth of the hatred radical islamics have for Jews in general. This has been going on since before the State of Israel has even existed. But appeasers and deniers of history rewrite it in order to inoculate themselves of responsibility for the atrocities they endorse by supporting the mass murderers rather than the victims. YouTube - Obsession parte 4 I dare you to watch this whole video and see what this ideology which you defend truly represents.\n \n \nAmericans and Israelis do not call their bombings of civilians terror. What Americans and Israelis call terror is the response of oppressed people who are stateless because their countries are ruled by puppets loyal to the oppressors. These people, dispossessed of their own countries, have no State Departments, Defense Departments, seats in the United Nations, or voices in the mainstream media. They can submit to foreign hegemony or resist by the limited means available to them.\n\n \n Lies and misinformation, yet you buy it whole cloth because it makes you feel warm and fuzzy about how big and bad we are. But it's all lies since we attack them in self defense. Their attacks are documented above. Please click on the links and see what these mass murderers represent in reality. Radicalism is a generational hatred which their children are indoctrinated into from childhood. YouTube - Obsession parte 2 But you remain willfully blind and ignorant to this reality. @ around 9:40 into this video at a rally in NY City you hear the islamic speaker declare as he stomped on an American flag, don't be afraid to speak out against America, the freedom of expression is one of the LOOPHOLES in their laws. They don't speak for justice but for our destruction as a people. Yet you condemn us and our ally Israel. You don't even deserve the Liberty and freedom so many Americans died to protect and insure that you have. And for that reason, you will surely lose them in your lifetime.\n \n \nThe fact that Israel and the United States carry on endless propaganda to prevent this fundamental truth from being realized indicates that it is Israel and the US that are in the wrong and the Palestinians, Lebanese, Iraqis, and Afghans who are being wronged.\n\n \n The true propagandists which you ignore is hamas and hezballah who place civilians in positions where they attack Israel from, then when the human shields get killed in the response, Israel is blamed for their deaths. But it's the terrorists who placed the innocents in harms way, not Israel.\n \n \nThe retired American generals who serve as war propagandists for Fox \"News\" are forever claiming that Iran arms the Iraqi and Afghan insurgents and Hamas. But where are the arms? To deal with American tanks, insurgents have to construct homemade explosive devices out of artillery shells. After six years of conflict the insurgents still have no weapon against the American helicopter gunships. Contrast this \"arming\" with the weaponry the US supplied to the Afghans three decades ago when they were fighting to drive out the Soviets.\n\n \n More lies and misinformation. The weapons have been found with Iranian markings on them and the shells and directions for making the IEDs are of Iranian manufacture. \n \n \nThe films of Israel's murderous assault on Gaza show large numbers of Gazans fleeing from Israeli bombs or digging out the dead and maimed, and none of these people is armed. A person would think that by now every Palestinian would be armed, every man, woman, and child. Yet, all the films of the Israeli attack show an unarmed population. Hamas has to construct homemade rockets that are little more than a sign of defiance. If Hamas were armed by Iran, Israel's assault on Gaza would have cost Israel its helicopter gunships, its tanks, and hundreds of lives of its soldiers.\n\n \n Really? Is this liar blind to the videos of Palestinians/hamas protesting in the streets of Israel firing their kalishnikovs into the air? Do these people look unarmed to you? And do you endorse using children to fight rather than attempt to make peace? YouTube - Palestinian Children and GAZA Terrorism\n \n \nHamas is a small organization armed with small caliber rifles incapable of penetrating body armor. Hamas is unable to stop small bands of Israeli settlers from descending on West Bank Palestinian villages, driving out the Palestinians, and appropriating their land.\n\n \n But no comment on Israel making themselves more vulnerable to these rocket attacks by giving back Gaza, the Golan Heights and returning the land they took from Jordan and Egypt, all land they gained through foreign invasions which attempted to destroy her. None of that TRUTH matters to you does it?\n \n \n The great mystery is: why after 60 years of oppression are the Palestinians still an unarmed people? Clearly, the Muslim countries are complicit with Israel and the US in keeping the Palestinians unarmed.\n\n \n They aren't, which the above video clearly shows. All Lies which you sop up like a starving man at a thanksgiving dinner.\n \n \nThe unsupported assertion that Iran supplies sophisticated arms to the Palestinians is like the unsupported assertion that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. These assertions are propagandistic justifications for killing Arab civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure in order to secure US and Israeli hegemony in the Middle East. \n\n \n Prove it. Cheap lip service is easy, how about some actual evidence to support any of this drivel which is all lies and leftist anti-jewish propaganda and hate speech. \n \n So there you have it. I have shown why this is a bunch of biased subjective propaganda with no basis in fact at all. Now go for once and prove the claims this bigot is making. My first response to this OP stands and is right on the money as far as I'm concerned.\n \n But tell me this foundit, would you use a hand grenade as a hammer as daewoo says is evidence of his intelligence and logic?",

   "As for your \"discussion\" with Daewoo, start another thread. No one cares. It was an offhand remark that, as usual, you focused on because you are completely incapable of actually addressing a situation that requires complex thought and insight.\n\n \n Daewoo was the one who made the \"offhand remark\". The fact that it was thoroughly explored is all Archangel's fault, and not Daewoo's fault at all? \n \n Suppose you started a thread, and a few posts into discussion about it, Archangel declared that he regularly breaks into his local zoo, into the lions cage, locks the door behind him, and throws rocks at the lions, and Daewoo questions him about it. Daewoo seeks out zookeepers and lion tamers that describe the dispositions of lions, while Archangel maintains that he has done it dozens of times, and describes zookeepers as ###### who should have better jobs. Would you completely blame Daewoo for that discussion, and give Archangel a free pass, as you have done for Daewoo here? \n \n You've shown the classic example of supporting someone because of who they are from past perceptions (liberal ones) rather than what they are saying at the present. \n \n Given the choice of the above vs using a live grenade to drive nails, I believe I'd rather take my chances with the lions. emoticon_frazzled\n \n On discussion boards such as these, it is one thing to be shown the weakness of a philosophical/political opinion.

   "\n \n \nOriginally Posted by DrNo:\n \"Face the enemy head on\"? So you're saying that a conventional war and an invasion of a country is the best way to fight terrorism, even though a majority of the population are most likely NOT \"soldiers of radical Islam?\n\n \n In case you don't know it, most of the population in Iraq appreciates what the coalition forces have done in ridding them of the despot, Saddam Hussein who is only remembered for the number of mass graves he left in his wake. This man was dedicated to aiding and abetting terrorism on a mass scale and had no right leading a country as he did. We did the world a favor whether you realize it or not.\n \n Also, if you honestly added up the number of civilian dead due to this war, you would find that most all of them were killed by fellow moslem terrorists over the past 5 years through suicide bombings and mass murders. Our delay in leaving has been due to the need to restrain the terrorists from these acts of terror. How can you not be aware of that reality?\n\n \n Do you have a problem with answering direct questions?\n \n I asked you a very simple question - Do you believe a conventional war and an invasion of a country is the best way to fight terrorism, even though a majority of the population are most likely NOT \"soldiers of radical Islam?\"\n \n You have completely failed to answer this question. Instead, you go on about how Saddam had no \"right\" to lead the country the way he did, and how the majority of Iraqis are glad we are there (which is questionable). Then you proceed to tell me that civilian deaths in Iraq were due to Islamic terrorists, which is a point I never argued. Then you further argue the justification for not leaving Iraq, another point I never argued.\n \n When you spend half this thread attacking Daewoo because he won't answer your (off-topic) question, I's think you would at least have the ability to refrain from doing the same. Can you answer the question as asked?\n \n \n\n \nOriginally posted by DrNo:\n Are you implying Iraq was not a nation ruled by laws? The case you are making here is the exact same case I am making about Iraq. You are agreeing with me whether you realize it or not. I believe, in regards to our war in Iraq, \"to target all citizens like the Gestapo would be a waste of resources and force the real threats underground.\"\n\n \n See the bolded? That is exactly what I'm saying. Iraq's laws were defined by a dictator who protected his own and screw the rest. They ended up in mass graves if they dared to question personal sense of justice and right and wrong.\n\n \n You just completely contradicted yourself. I asked \"Are you implying Iraq was not a nation ruled by laws?\" And you responded with, \"That is exactly what I'm saying. Iraq's laws were defined by a dictator who protected his own and screw the rest.\"\n \n So, wait? Iraq DID have laws? I'm confused. You just said Iraq was not a nation ruled by laws. \n \n My point is, you may not like the laws made by the dictator Saddam Hussein, but Iraq was a nation of laws. It's not our job to tell other countries how they should rule their people. Should we invade China? North Korea? Venezuela? Cuba? These countries represent nations with laws much different than our own, and downright oppressive in most cases. That doesn't mean it's our responsibility to invade their country, overthrow their government, and impose our own ideas.\n \n \n\n \nOriginally posted by DrNo:\n Iraq was also a sovereign nation, the same as France. Saddam was \"responsible for policing his own subversives.\" You may not agree with their laws, their religion, or their culture, but that doesn't change this fact.\n\n \n The problem you are forgetting is that Saddam was one of the subversives. How can you be either ignorant of or in denial of that FACT? And having been raised into Islam, I have nothing against the culture at all. Although the laws and religion are another story, I would never condone going to war over that. This man was an evil despot who paid the families of dead suicide bombers a 25,000 dollar bounty anywhere in the world for committing a terrorist act. Does that sound like a man of peace to you? Also, here are other points to his resume for you to ponder. Deroy Murdock on Iraq on National Review Online\n\n \n The problem you are forgetting is that Saddam was in charge. He is the one who determines who are the subversives. I never said Saddam was a man of peace, and you are continuing to use strawman arguments. The point I'm making is that, if we have a right to remove Saddam from power because we don't like the way he runs his country, where does that reasoning end? \n \n \n\n \nOriginally posted by DrNo:\n We have no authority to intervene unless Iraq, as a country, presents a clear and present danger to the US. I'm not sure if you're aware of this or not, but Saddam actually kept radical members of the Taliban OUT of Iraq. Saddam Hussein posed less of a threat than Iran and North Korea. Why don't we invade those countries as well?\n\n \n Saddam dealt with every radical islamic group from a distance due to his paranoia and fear that they would turn on him. He was the boldest and most overtly violent National leader in the Middle East at the time. Dealing with him was the right thing to do since he was also expanding his power base by invading a friendly and non aggressive neighbor like Kuwait.\n\n \n Invading Kuwait? Gee, I thought we took care of that already. Silly me. You still haven't answered my question - Iran and North Korea posed a bigger threat than Saddam Hussein. Now that Saddam is gone, there is no doubt of that fact. So, do you advocate invading those countries? Why or why not?\n \n \n\n \nOriginally posted by DrNo:\n This is what a posted earlier, and I will repeat it: My point is that the response to 9/11 was as illogical as declaring martial law after the Oklahoma bombings. You agree that declaring martial law is illogical to fight domestic terrorists, yet we've done the equivalent of martial law in Iraq. How can you reconcile this contradiction? You seem to be saying that, because Islam represents more of a threat, this strategy will somehow become a winning one when used in another country.\n\n \n We haven't declared Martial Law in Iraq. We have created an independent democratic government which even has women serving in elected positions now. Something that is anathema in most every other islamic country today.\n\n \n martial law\n &#8194;\n -noun\n 1. the law temporarily imposed upon an area by state or national military forces when civil authority has broken down or during wartime military operations.\n 2. the law imposed upon a defeated country or occupied territory by the military forces of the occupying power.\n \n You really believe we haven't imposed martial law in Iraq? You are drifting away from reality here. If the Iraqi government is so \"independent,\" why do we need our military there?\n \n \n\n \nOriginally posted by DrNo:\n Again, you've completely misrepresented my point. I never said they will go away if we ignore them, and this is nothing but an illogical conclusion of yours based on what I've written so far. I've said that invading a country is not the proper response to fight terrorism, and you've basically agreed with me, you just haven't realized it yet.\n\n \n Then what is the proper solution? And I haven't misrepresented your position at all. All I have done is responded to you with real world facts which blow holes in your shallow insights. Tell us how to deal with these mass murderers without confronting them where they live and hide? Negotiations don't work because they wont negotiate. They are dedicated only to using terrorism to send their political messages and demands. So share an actual solution rather than just condemning confronting them with military force.\n\n \n If you actually read what I wrote earlier, I already explained my solution. Espionage and assassination. It's really quite simple, and wouldn't hurt us at home as much as the current policies. \n \n You admitted yourself that declaring martial law in the US wouldn't make sense because it would drive the terrorists underground. Why don't you believe the same is true in Iraq? If our occupation has been so successful, how come there are still civilians dying of terrorist attacks in Iraq, which you yourself admitted is happening on a massive scale.\n \n \n\n \nOriginally posted by DrNo:\n I am not responding to this question because I know nothing about hand grenades and I feel I am not qualified to discuss the topic. It's also completely irrelevant to the main topic, not to mention rather annoying that you continue to harp on this one silly point.\n\n \n Presumably you have common sense though, and this exchange has dominated this thread more so than the ignorant, hateful and biased OP which has tq posted in the OP. The question wasn't even if you felt it would blow up if you banged it like a hammer as that would be asking for an informed opinion. My question is simply, \"would you use a hand grenade as a hammer as daewoo claims it is evidence of his intelligence and logic\"? The question is, do you agree with daewoos statement of fact? That isn't a difficult question for any intellectually honest person with a brain and the willingness to give their own personal honest opinion. Your reason for not wanting to answer it is disingenuous and shallow.\n\n \n Your continuous dedication to this pointless topic is what's disingenuous and shallow. I am a civilian in the US. I wouldn't even know where to get a hand grenade if I wanted to. There are literally hundreds of different implements I could use much more readily for a hammer, including a hammer itself. Therefore, no, I would not use a hand grenade instead of a hammer.",

   "Daewoo was the one who made the \"offhand remark\". The fact that it was thoroughly explored is all Archangel's fault, and not Daewoo's fault at all? \n \n Suppose you started a thread, and a few posts into discussion about it, Archangel declared that he regularly breaks into his local zoo, into the lions cage, locks the door behind him, and throws rocks at the lions, and Daewoo questions him about it. Daewoo seeks out zookeepers and lion tamers that describe the dispositions of lions, while Archangel maintains that he has done it dozens of times, and describes zookeepers as ###### who should have better jobs. Would you completely blame Daewoo for that discussion, and give Archangel a free pass, as you have done for Daewoo here? \n \n You've shown the classic example of supporting someone because of who they are from past perceptions (liberal ones) rather than what they are saying at the present. \n \n Given the choice of the above vs using a live grenade to drive nails, I believe I'd rather take my chances with the lions. emoticon_frazzled\n \n On discussion boards such as these, it is one thing to be shown the weakness of a philosophical/political opinion. It is quite another to be exposed in a lie. To see Daewoo get three or four unwavering supporters in this thread is yet more evidence of the reality of closed-mindedness in two way political conflict.\n\n \n Daewoo readily admitted his part in the derailing of the thread. Both parties are at fault. The difference is, Daewoo dropped the off-topic discussion after admitting fault, whereas Archie continued to harp on the ridiculous point.",

   "Do you have a problem with answering direct questions?\n \n I asked you a very simple question - Do you believe a conventional war and an invasion of a country is the best way to fight terrorism, even though a majority of the population are most likely NOT \"soldiers of radical Islam?\"\n \n You have completely failed to answer this question. Instead, you go on about how Saddam had no \"right\" to lead the country the way he did, and how the majority of Iraqis are glad we are there (which is questionable). Then you proceed to tell me that civilian deaths in Iraq were due to Islamic terrorists, which is a point I never argued. Then you further argue the justification for not leaving Iraq, another point I never argued.\n \n When you spend half this thread attacking Daewoo because he won't answer your (off-topic) question, I's think you would at least have the ability to refrain from doing the same. Can you answer the question as asked?\n\n \n I did answer your question, and very directly. I explained why it was necessary to unseat Hussein because he represented a direct threat to peace in the middle east, his own people and the world at large. That is much more a complete answer than just a yes or no as it explains why I believe the invasion was justified. \n \n \nYou just completely contradicted yourself. I asked \"Are you implying Iraq was not a nation ruled by laws?\" And you responded with, \"That is exactly what I'm saying. Iraq's laws were defined by a dictator who protected his own and screw the rest.\"\n \n So, wait? Iraq DID have laws? I'm confused. You just said Iraq was not a nation ruled by laws. \n \n My point is, you may not like the laws made by the dictator Saddam Hussein, but Iraq was a nation of laws. It's not our job to tell other countries how they should rule their people. Should we invade China? North Korea? Venezuela? Cuba? These countries represent nations with laws much different than our own, and downright oppressive in most cases. That doesn't mean it's our responsibility to invade their country, overthrow their government, and impose our own ideas.\n\n \n No I didn't contradict myself DrNo. When the result of his so called laws protect only his political self interests and deny the population any freedom of thought or free speech, and are designed to intimidate and threaten his neighbors who are also sovereign Nations, then he is a threat to regional peace which is why none of the other moderate Governments in the region objected to his removal.\n \n To deny that we fought the most compassionate war in the history of the world there, and that the mass majority of civilian dead were caused by either saddams own troops during the invasion and by the terrorist factions since then is to deny the reality of the situation. \n \n You are attempting to force me to accept your suppositions while insisting that I ignore my perspective on the facts which also apply to the overall situation which existed under his regime. You have completely ignored the reality of the numerous mass graves which represent hundreds of thousands of dead sheites who were killed under saddams orders just for being the wrong sect of islam. That fact seems not to bother you at all and seems not worthy of consideration in our decision to remove him from power.\n \n You seem to have this belief that because he was the self designated leader of Iraq that that somehow gives him the privilege to rule with impunity no matter what he does. And I disagree with that assumption. He was just a man, and he was executed 30 years later than he deserved based on the untol numbers of people he murdered in cold blood during his reign.\n \n \nThe problem you are forgetting is that Saddam was in charge. He is the one who determines who are the subversives. I never said Saddam was a man of peace, and you are continuing to use strawman arguments. The point I'm making is that, if we have a right to remove Saddam from power because we don't like the way he runs his country, where does that reasoning end? \n\n \n A) Saddam wasn't a god, and neither is any man the law unto himself. This guy was evil incarnate which is why his people destroyed and pulled down his statue in celebration of his removal from power rather than mourn it. And I notice you conveniently redacted this link: Deroy Murdock on Iraq on National Review Online which outlined the crimes against humanity which saddam was involved in. I guess facts like that only derail your rationalization of the situation, huh?\n \n \nInvading Kuwait? Gee, I thought we took care of that already. Silly me. You still haven't answered my question - Iran and North Korea posed a bigger threat than Saddam Hussein. Now that Saddam is gone, there is no doubt of that fact. So, do you advocate invading those countries? Why or why not?\n\n \n Not at that time they didn't. And even now N Korea isn't directly involved in exporting terrorism that we can prove. Those countries represent dangerous philosophies but are being watched as closely as is humanly possible. If they attempt to launch Nuclear Weapons, we will respond accordingly as will Israel in regard to Iran. \n \n \nmartial law\n &#8194;\n -noun\n 1. the law temporarily imposed upon an area by state or national military forces when civil authority has broken down or during wartime military operations.\n 2. the law imposed upon a defeated country or occupied territory by the military forces of the occupying power.\n \n You really believe we haven't imposed martial law in Iraq? You are drifting away from reality here. If the Iraqi government is so \"independent,\" why do we need our military there?\n\n \n Not we, but the Democratically elected Government which has declared it during occasions of high level terrorist threats. And we are still there because the terrorists are still more of a threat than the government can handle alone.\n \n \nIf you actually read what I wrote earlier, I already explained my solution. Espionage and assassination. It's really quite simple, and wouldn't hurt us at home as much as the current policies.\n\n \n This is the first thing you have said that I completely agree with. I wish that was an option since even now on this forum you can go look at the OP in tqs thread \"The War on Terror is a hoax\" and see that the leftist author is accusing us of, and condemning us for assassinating world leaders as if it's SOP for us. It's a lie of course, but I wish it wasn't as we have long range sniper rifles which could have taken saddam out from a mile away without ever having to invade that Country. But had that occurred, it would have been considered a greater crime than invading her, by your lunatic lefties who revolt no matter what a republican president does. It's called a no win situation.\n \n The fact is I would totally endorse cutting the head off of the snake by taking out these radical leaders. But there is a law which forbids it so other countries wont attempt to assassinate our Presidents.\n \n \n You admitted yourself that declaring martial law in the US wouldn't make sense because it would drive the terrorists underground. Why don't you believe the same is true in Iraq? If our occupation has been so successful, how come there are still civilians dying of terrorist attacks in Iraq, which you yourself admitted is happening on a massive scale.\n\n \n The difference is that terrorists in these other countries are already underground and represent a serious a threat to their own homelands as they do to us. Hiding in plain sight is SOP for them. They don't wear uniforms like a real army but blend in and use that against the civilians they victimize. That is why weeding them out is difficult and must be done with feet on the ground in close quarters. The only way to neutralize terrorists is to kill them when they show themselves. That is the sad reality of this enemy we face. \n \n \nYour continuous dedication to this pointless topic is what's disingenuous and shallow. I am a civilian in the US. I wouldn't even know where to get a hand grenade if I wanted to. There are literally hundreds of different implements I could use much more readily for a hammer, including a hammer itself. Therefore, no, I would not use a hand grenade instead of a hammer.\n\n \n Thanks for answering the question at least. Like me, you would pick up a rock and use it rather than pull your hand grenade from your flack jacket and use it as a hammer. Can you believe that not one other opposition poster on this thread has either the common sense or the will to honestly answer that question? I mean, it doesn't take basic training to know that it's insane. And since daewoo claims to have served in the military and made such an ignorant statement, it is a totally valid question to ask others if they would also do such a thing. And him to prove it's an intelligent thing to do. Here's what a guy with 21 years experience said about doing such a foolish thing. http://www.army.com/forum/showpost.php?p=79845&postcount=17",

I simply used all of the terrorist attacks which have taken place around the world in March of 2009. Feel free to go back to that link and seek out any given month going back to 2001 to check if my random choice was picked because it reflects a higher number of events than usual for this murderous ideology.\n \n Now, count up the 83 attacks in that one months tally and subtract the 30 attacks which took place in both Iraq and Afghanistan in that single month, and you will see that in the countries where the USA doesn't have a military presence, that 53 attacks, almost double the amount in the 2 countries we are fighting in, occurred in those other countries. So, if you have even half of a rational brain in your head you can plainly see that to blame the US for the actions of these terrorists is a complete denial of reality. They are fulfilling their destinies by serving their radicalized form of islam whether we are there or not. \n \n To even infer that we are the cause of their violent acts is the epitome of ignorance and denial. Must I once again post a list for all of the terrorist attacks which have taken place around the world starting back in the 60s to show you that our eventual response to these thugs didn't cause any increase in their violence, it only kept them from being able to reproduce another 9/11 here.

No comment or rebuttal about that reality either, huh!!! emoticon_xgood\n \n [QUOTE=Archangel;350876]Since you numbskulls are in complete denial of reality and totally committed to blaming us for the actions of these radicals as if we are the cause of their extremism, let me just repost part of the list I posted in my very first response on this thread. I simply used all of the terrorist attacks which have taken place around the world in March of 2009. Feel free to go back to that link and seek out any given month going back to 2001 to check if my random choice was picked because it reflects a higher number of events than usual for this murderous ideology.\n \n Now, count up the 83 attacks in that one months tally and subtract the 30 attacks which took place in both Iraq and Afghanistan in that single month, and you will see that in the countries where the USA doesn't have a military presence, that 53 attacks, almost double the amount in the 2 countries we are fighting in, occurred in those other countries. So, if you have even half of a rational brain in your head you can plainly see that to blame the US for the actions of these terrorists is a complete denial of reality. They are fulfilling their destinies by serving their radicalized form of islam whether we are there or not. \n \n To even infer that we are the cause of their violent acts is the epitome of ignorance and denial. Must I once again post a list for all of the terrorist attacks which have taken place around the world starting back in the 60s to show you that our eventual response to these thugs didn't cause any increase in their violence, it only kept them from being able to reproduce another 9/11 here.

   "It could be argued that the first shots unleashed in the cold war were as a show of force toward the Russians which killed thousands of civilians in two nuclear holocausts.\n\n \n This is ridiculous on every level of rationale. At the time that we dropped the atomic bombs, not nukes, we were allied with the Soviets against the Axis Governments who were aligned against the allied forces. The USSR was aware of the decision to avoid extending the war through a land invasion on Japan by using the Atomic Bomb. This did NOT take place in a vacuum. \n \n If you remember, we forewarned the Japanese and gave them a timetable to surrender or face the consequences. They refused to surrender so we hit Hiroshima. We gave them another timetable to surrender or else another city would be attacked. They still refused to surrender which resulted in Nagasaki being hit. Only then did they finally surrender and agree to the terms of a cease fire.\n \n \nI think that is probably true of Nagasaki, less true about Hiroshima.\n\n \n This also is ridiculous since if it was true of one, it would have been true of both. The fact is that it saved lives on both sides of the war because less Japanese were killed as a result of the 2 bombs than would have died during an extended land invasion which was estimated to have caused millions of victims combined.\n \n And both of you continue to refuse to answer a simple question regarding whether or not you also would use a hand grenade as a hammer as daewoo has insisted that he has done dozens of times and that it's evidence of his intelligence and power of logic? If the question is so scary for you philosophical cowards, then I guess the answer of whether or not you would do such a gutsy thing is out of the question. emoticon_xchicken",

   "Oh wow. \n \n You just said that the National Archives is wrong not to mention a bunch of other globally recognized museums and archives. \n \n\n The National Archives Learning Curve | Cold War\n \n Actually, no I didn't. Here is my original statement which you reinterpreted in order to attack. QUOTE: You are so ignorant that you attempt to equate and connect what were wars between independent Countries which we were involved in, ala North and South Vietnam and North and South Korea, and the cold war with the Soviet Union which was over the the supremacy and survival of the Communist and Capitalist political systems. \n \n And before that, I originally was responding to Charlie, here. He said this:\n \n \n Hmm...not sure this will have relevance but..\n \n How many times has America declared wars on something that can never be won?\n \n Communism, war on drugs, war on prostitution, etc etc it's all the same thing and it never works to declare war on such things like this. You simply can't declare war on an ideal. It makes it impossible to win and quite frankly it's stupid.\n\n \n And I responded with this statement. And what is painfully obvious is that we are discussing radical islam, not communism specifically at all. The reference to it is just an insignificant side issue toward a larger issue. So I had no reason to delve into the intricacies and ALL OF THE various dimensions surrounding the cold war. But rather than deal with the larger issue which I commented on, once again like a philosophical coward you will take one sentence and attempt to imply that I am making an affirmative argument about something I never even attempted to defend or support. \n \n \nThe cold war wasn't a shooting war charlie, it was a philosophical battle over differing political ideologies. And the war on drugs and prostitution etc. are terms of intent but also not shooting wars.\n \n The reason why mutually assured destruction worked was because the USSR wasn't a suicidal ideology which looked toward paradise existing in another plain of consciousness as radical islam does. When all was said and done, they wanted to survive to enjoy the fruits of their victory over the west.\n \n Islam has no such hang ups and would gladly nuke their own countries if they believed doing so would destroy us also. After all, to their way of thinking they are just sending faithful moslems they kill to paradise as martyrs.\n \n\n \n The National archive link says this, QUOTE:\n \n \nWhen the Japanese pulled out of Indochina in 1945 Ho declared Vietnam to be an independent republic. However, the French did not accept this and tried to re-establish their control. Ho Chi Minh's forces (Viet Minh) then used the same tactics against the French, eventually defeating them in 1954. Peace talks followed, and in 1954 the country was divided into \n North Vietnam ruled by Ho Chi Minh\n South Vietnam, hostile to Ho and supported by the USA.\n The USA and Vietnam\n Ho Chi Minh defeated the French even though the USA had provided massive support in money and equipment.\n They did this because Ho Chi Minh was a Communist. America saw this as another example of Communism trying to spread its influence. Ho Chi Minh saw the conflict as a struggle to get foreigners out of his country, but the USA did not accept his viewpoint.\n Throughout the 1950s American thinking was based on the Domino Theory. This meant that if one Asian state fell to Communism the rest would follow. So, the USA had to stop the process. In 1954 the USA and numerous allies formed SEATO - an Asian equivalent of NATO. From 1954 onwards they poured money and resources into South Vietnam, determined that it would not become a Communist state.\n \n South Vietnam was not an easy state to support. The South Vietnam government was corrupt and unpopular. As a result, anti-government forces called the National Liberation Front (also called Viet Cong) gained support among ordinary Vietnamese. Ho Chi Minh supported these rebels and soon South Vietnam was a state under siege.\n \n In the early 1960s President Kennedy sent increasing numbers of US military 'advisers' to help South Vietnam to fight the Viet Cong. US forces in the region grew steadily, but the South Vietnamese were unable to defeat the Viet Cong. The Viet Cong attacked government targets and officials, and soon began to attack US targets and personnel as well.\n \n In 1964 North Vietnamese boats attacked US warships in the Gulf of Tonkin. President Johnson got the approval of the US Congress to take any necessary action. It was the first step to war. In 1965 Johnson ordered US Marines ashore at Da Nang and the Vietnam War officially began.\n \n Your Task\n With hindsight, we know that America's decision to get involved in Vietnam was disastrous. Critics of the US government's actions in Vietnam raised a number of points:\n \n US policy was based on the Domino Theory, and there was no proof that the Domino Theory was actually correct. \n US policies were not clear - Johnson and Kennedy were not sure what they were trying to achieve in Vietnam\n South Vietnam was not a good ally. It was a corrupt state which did not have the support of its own people. \n The US forces were overconfident that their manpower and firepower would defeat the Viet Cong. \n America's allies and even her own people had doubts about US policy.\n\n \n It clearly says that our involvement was based on stopping communism, that is obvious and goes without saying. But show me where this link even mentions the USSR once, if you can. Our battle with them was ideological and yes, small countries did get used as pawns in that larger conflict. But In order for you to not find some corner in which to attack any statement I make from some obscure angle which wasn't the focus of my post, I would have to write a 5 page dissertation covering every single aspect of whatever it is being discussed.\n \n So you go ahead and start another baiting and mocking thread based on your games of semantics. I'll let my answer here stand and speak for me.\n \n But like the philosophical yet consistent coward that you are Patrick, you refuse to answer a simple question regarding whether or not you would use a hand grenade as a hammer as daewoo has insisted that he has done it dozens of times and that it's evidence of his intelligence and power of logic. A simple answer of yes or no would clarify if you agree with that reasoning or not, yet you are such a loyal lap dog to a proven liar who has run away after boasting that he did and will do this to me, and I quote: See, Marc, that is how it is done. \n Mess with Daewoo and he will pull your pants down and spank your bare butt until you cry like a little girl. waaaaa waaaaa waaaaa \n \n \n So go ahead and prove you are ignorant enough to either agree with daewoos insane and irrational lie, or the courage to admit that he lied and is a wannabe poser as he implies that he actually served in the military, but doesn't trust fellow soldiers to support his incredible claim.
