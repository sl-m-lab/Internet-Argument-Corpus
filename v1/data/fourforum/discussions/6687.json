   "Ok, I`ve been thinking about doing this for some time now. This is an attempt to start a debate on labour unions. I`m a bit uncertain how exactly I should start this off, but I think that in order to understand the economic impact of labour unions, one needs to understand the basic theories regarding the wage setting process and how labour unions affect this process. This is because the wage setting process covers the two most important issues regarding union activity; real wage and employment.\n \n  First off, a micro-economic approach to the wage setting process.\n \n In order to describe this theory, I must first make one unrealistic assumption; that is perfect competition between firms. Both in respect of goods and services and in respect of labour demand. This model is also a gross simplification but it will have to suffice at the moment. Later on, I will challenge my assumption regarding a labour market operating under perfect competition as well as go into more details regarding the forces on the labour market.\n \n I also want to explain a few terms before I proceed with the rest of the theory:\n \n Supply of labour = The amount of units of labour offered on the labour market at a certain wage rate\n \n Demand of labour = The amount of units of labour \"wanted\" by employers at a certain wage rate\n \n Marginal Product of Labour (MPL) = The value of the additional production that comes from hiring another unit of labour. \n \n Wage rate = The compensation a worker receive from one aditional unit of labour \"sold\" on the labour market. And correspondingly the cost for a firm to hire one additonal unit of labour. \n \n As allready been hinted by the explanation of supply and demand, these two forces have an intimate relationship with the wage rate. But they work in opposite directions. On one hand, labour demand has a negative relationship with the wage rate. That is; the higher the wage rate, the lower the labour demand. The reason for this is explained below. On the other hand labour supply tends to have a positive relationship with the wage rate. That is, the higher the real wage, the higher the labour supply. This is however not always true due to two contrary effects of the wage rate on labour supply. But it`s farily safe to say that it applies to most situations in most modern market-economies. (If you want a more thurough explanation about this, feel free to ask and I`ll send you a PM)\n \n This implies that the market will clear at the real wage where the labour supply and labour demand is in equilibrium (where the demand and supply curves intersect). If the wage rate is higher than the equilibrium rate, individual workers will be willing to offer more units of labour to a lower price. With time the wage rate will decrease and equilibrium will be reached. If the wage rate is lower than the equilibrium rate, individual firms will be willing to hire more units of labour at a higher wage rate. With time the wage rate will increase and equilibrium will be reached.\n \n Now, how does labour unions fit in to all of this?\n \n Well, labour unions disrupt the assumption of perfect competition as workers no-longer compete with each-other and firms are forced to accept higher wages. The obvious result for this is a higher wage rate and lower employment (higher employment). This follows from the assumption that there is a negative relationship between demand for labour and wage rate. When the wage rate increases, demand for labour decreases. Another way to ook at it is that the wage rate must equal the marginal product of labour. Due to diminishing returns on labour, the only way to offset the wage rate increase is to hire less labour. \n \n According to this model, under the assumptions outlined above, unionisation would give rise to a higher wage rate and a lower employment rate. It would also give rise to significant economic innefficiencies as it would mean a lower rate of resource utilization and the socio-economic results of unionisation would be negative. The higher the unionisation rate, the higher the real wage, the lower the employement rate and the more negative socio-economic results\n \n This is most often the strongest argument of anti-union advocates. But as you will soon see, this is perhaps not so realistic and it is very doubtful wether empirical observations really support this conclusion of unionisation rates. \n \n To be continued....\n \n (feel free to post questions or objections while I compose a few challanges to this view of the labour market and labour unions... it may take a day or two)",

   "Well, the obvious problem with the model, which you are no doubt about to highlight, is that it assumes that margins are completely tight, that incomes of the bosses or profits cannot be squeezed to pay workers more, which is rarely true.

   "Well, the obvious problem with the model, which you are no doubt about to highlight, is that it assumes that margins are completely tight, that incomes of the bosses or profits cannot be squeezed to pay workers more, which is rarely true. \n\n \n I think you have an important point here. I have assumed away profits as there is no such thing as profits on a perfectly competative market. This derives from the fact that individual firms will always be willing to lower the price or raise wages in order to sell one more additional unit as long as the cost for doing so is equal or lower than the additional yield. And capital returns are assumed to be fixed by competition on the capital market. But perfect competition is not so realistic. And there are significant lags on virtually any market.\n \n \nAlso it requires that the jobs can be done by fewer people working for higher pay which, particularly with the service sector boom we have now, is rarely possible. You can't staff 500 phone lines with 300 people if you pay them 50% more. \n\n \n True. Less work is being done by higher pay. And this is where the negative socio-economic effect of a higher wage rate comes from. If a firm is \"forced\" to pay a higher wage at the expense of less employment (due to a shift in the demand or supply of labour), this will result in less production. \n \n But I think I included that in the model. Perhaps I was a bit vague though.\n \n \nWYou do then have an issue with outsourcing but not all jobs can be outsourced, and it will remain cheaper to outsource whatever workers are paid, simply because the cost of living in the west is so much higher.\n\n \n Yes, international competition is an important aspect. And this is one of the reasons why the labour market(s) doesn`t work under perfect competition. Capital is simply much more fluid than labour, ecpessially when we talk about movement across borders.",

Alternatively you can go down the approximation route, and say under normal circumstances they are a \"good\" approximation, and under these circumstances a \"bad\" approximation, but that's a very subjective assessment of the quality of the modelling. If it is inaccurate along a scale, surely it's more correct to say it is somewhat inaccurate under normal circumstances, and somewhat more inaccurate under circumstances which even less closely approximate the model.\n \n Friedman et al. agree that the assumptions of their economics do not hold in reality, but say hey, who cares, our simplifying assumptions lead to the right conclusions, even if they do so for the wrong reasons.

If a nation has a fixed minimum wage for all workers, and some group of industries is unionised, the unemployment rate will be greatest when union membership is most exclusive. Although it is the unions in combination with minimum wage legislation resulting in unemployment, the unemployment should in fact be negatively correlated with the unionisation rate. The unions are at any time able to decrease unemployment by allowing in more members.\n \n The fact that the fewer the members the higher the wages they are able to obtain is the major reason unions have historically been highly racist and sexist, often allowing only white males to join their exclusive club. This is balanced by political considerations, whereby a larger union workforce is less likely to have its legal privileges rescinded.\n \n Finally, any empirical testing of economic theories is inherently flawed, we have correlations and then we guess the rest. Welfare payments are correlated with GDP, so does welfare cause economic growth, or does economic growth cause welfare payments, or does some third factor cause both, or are they simply related statistically because it is only possible for wealthy nations to have high levels of welfare?\n \n Suppose unionation is correlated with unemployment - does this prove unions cause unemployment? Absolutely not, unionisation may be a response to unemployment by workers seeking to protect their own jobs, or a response by politicians to unemployment. Or there may be conditions which lead to both unionisation and unemployment.\n \n It is for this reason Friedman's idea that theory doesn't matter, it is the predictions that matter, does not hold, and economic problems must be confronted with sound theory.",

Even though, as you point out yourself, informal collective bargaining groups would have similar effects on the labour market (skewing competition between individual workers). But I`m not assuming some form of legislated collective bargaining treaty. These will probably enter the picture later. \n \n \n If we accept that the assumptions of perfect competition not holding is reason to reject the conclusions of neoclassical modelling, it is reason to do away with them not only under conditions of unionism, but under all conditions.

The reason I`m doing this is to show what the effects of a labour union are. I could just as well have done it the other way around, beginning with a model where unionised monopoly power influence labour supply and pushes the wage rate. Allthough I do agree that the use of the approxiation route would be more accurate. I do however suspect that it would make the model even more complicated. I tried to make it as simple as possible and I have certainly sacrificed some accuracy on the way.\n \n The biggest question is perhaps, how would the use of the approxiation route change the results of the model? I still think the conclusions hold.\n \n \n Friedman et al. agree that the assumptions of their economics do not hold in reality, but say hey, who cares, our simplifying assumptions lead to the right conclusions, even if they do so for the wrong reasons.

But I do think that it is fruitful to construct an idealised and simplified model and I don`t see why one must accept or reject assumption consistently. The modell I presented offers an ideal state of perfect competition and then shows what happens when this state is altered by the introduction of labour unions.\n \n \n Ignoring the whole \"perfect competition\" thing and working with say, just supply and demand, the predictions of the impact of unionism are not as simple as relating the unemployment rate to the unionisation rate. \n \n\n \n this is true. Allthough, I`m not going to do away with competition. Just perfect competition. I will also show how potential monopsomy power of employers can be off-set by labour unions and I will show how wage setting process can be described when perfect competition doesn`t eliminate all \"wiggle room\" for wage negotiation.\n \n \n Unions can only raise the wages of their members by reducing the wages of other members of the workforce, ie by driving them out of the industry where they are best suited to one where they are less suited, resulting in permanent unemployment only if they are unable to find work elsewhere, generally because the remainder of the economy also has fixed floors on wage rates, either because there exists a legal minimum wage across the whole economy, or widespread union activity in other industries. \n\n \n The fixed floors on wage rates are very important when deriving the supply of labour. As are legal minimum wages, the existance of two-person households and unpaid work (household chores). But I don`t agree that the only way of raising wages is through reducing the wages for other members of the workforce. This is perhaps the most commonly accepted result of a higher wage rate (without corresponding productivity increase), but I will show some alternatives to this.\n \n \n \n So a nation very well could have a high union participation rate, and the ununionised workers simply be driven into poor paying jobs.\n\n \n Sure. This is a possibility, but far from a certainty.\n \n \n Finally, any empirical testing of economic theories is inherently flawed, we have correlations and then we guess the rest.

However, it does not need to be 100% accurate. After all, we are dealing with the actions of individual humans. It is impossible to predict without making rather large generalisations and simplifications.",

   "Okay, in this post I will challenge the assumption of perfect competition and introduce one situation when unionisation of labour can counteract the negative effects of a monospomy firm.\n \n \u00a8First off, I want to further explain the rammifications of perfect competition. Perfect competition ensures that individual firms and individual workers are price takers. They cannot affect the price in any way. This is because perfect competition ensures that there are always new entrants on the market willing to undercut the price charged by its competitors as long as they can make a profit by doing so.\n \n But this is not always the case. If there are significant costs of entering a market (for example large capital investements) allready existing players may be able to dissuade new entrants. This is just one example of how competition can be disuaded (another important ecample is government intervention and monopolies protected by legislation/force). If you are interested in finding out more about how individual firms may achieve monopoly power through disuading new entrants I would suggest reading up on various game theories. I`m not very well versed in this subject so I wouldn`t suggest asking me a load of questions about it ;)\n \n When firms have monopoly power, they are able to influence the price through reducing supply (or vice versa). A related term is monopsomy power. That is when the buyer of a good or service has the ability to reduce the demand in order to affect the price (ie, by purchasing less, being able to press the price downwards). \n \n As been mentioned in my opening post, labour unions give their members monopoly power as it can reduce supply in order to achieve a higher wage rate. But firms can also wield monopsomy power on the labour markets. In fact, this is perhaps even the norm in smaller communities where there is one big employer. I don`t know how common this is elsewhere, but in Sweden many communities are centered around a single plant or industry. In these commnities, it is perhaps not so hard to imagine that the employer wields significant monopsomy power.\n \n When individual firms have monopsomy power this means that they have the ability (and will be willing) to employ fewer units of labour in order to lower the wage rate. This will lead to lower employment levels than in \"equilibrium\" as well as a lower wage rate. Production will be lower but the employer will earn extra-ordinary profits\n \n In a situation where firms wield monopsomy power, labour union monopoly power may push the wage rate towards equilibrium. However, it is quite impossible to realisticly quantify monopoly and monopsomy power. But it`s safe to say that these are two very real forces on many labour markets. If it is impossible to strip the firms of their monopsomy power throgh legaslation (or by removing legislation) union monopoly power may be the second best alternative economicly speaking. But it is impossible to say, as union monopoly power could very well \"overshoot\" and give rise to more inefficiencies than what the monopsomy power of the firms did. Needless to say, this is more of a theoretic exercise than something very useful for polycy makers. But it does cast a shadow of doubt on the proponents on anti-union legislation unless they also advocate some way of getting rid of economic dominance of individual firms (I avoid using the term \"anti-trust legislation\" as there are those who would claim that further legislation is not the sollution to this problem but rather getting rid of the allready existing legislation and intervention in the economy)\n \n To be continued....",
