   "Under Bush, there was quite a push to insist that ONLY abstinence prevention was taught in schools.\n Unfortunately, as a variety of polls proved, abstinence only WORSENS the actual school's performance on pregnancy prevention. STD rates are comparable.\n \n Here are some factors that ACTUALLY have been shown to statistically delay a child's involvement in sex.\n \n \nThis might surprise parents: A study of 1,000 low-income families in Chicago and two other big cities found that one in four kids between the ages of 11 and 16 said they'd already had sex.\n \n Perhaps most shockingly, the average age at which low-income kids became sexually active was 12, according to the survey of families in Chicago, Boston and San Antonio reported online in the Children and Youth Services \n \n Nationally, experts have estimated that 13 percent of girls and 15 percent of boys have had sex by the time they're 16.\n \n \"Those people who say that kids don't have sex at that young of age should think again,\" said study co-author Brenda Lohman, an associate professor of human development and family studies at Iowa State University.\n \n The research also found that children of more highly educated mothers and more involved fathers were less likely to have sex at a young age. Adolescents whose mothers had a technical degree or higher were half as likely to be sexually active compared to those whose mothers had a high school education or less.\n\n Poor Chicago kids have sex at young age :: CHICAGO SUN-TIMES :: Metro & Tri-State\n \n Wow.\n PARENTAL factors.\n Who could have thought THAT would be an impact... emoticon_xgood",

   "Assuming Kids don't have sex is pure stupidity, one way or another kids learn about sex either from tv, video games, magizines, books or their peers. If parents want a say in what their kids are going to lean about sex they best be the ones doing the teaching and creating an open atmosphere for ongoing discussion",

   "And what does Fox News focus on???\n Study: Teens Who Skip Breakfast Lose Virginity Earlier\n \n And the funny thing is that the article even includes a morsel of a larger truth, which Fox News buries in order to lead with something else...\n \n \nOddly enough, that's what a new study finds.\n \n Japanese researchers studied 3,000 people and said that teens who skip breakfast lose their virginity earlier than those who start their days off with some food, Agence France-Presse reported Friday.\n \n Specifically, researchers found that people in their early teens who regularly skipped breakfast lost their virginity at an average age of 17.5 years old, versus an average age of 19 for breakfast eaters.\n \n The study, funded by Japan's health ministry, looked for ways to curb unwanted pregnancies. Researchers concluded that a stable home life - one that encourages breakfast eating - discourages early sex.\n\n \n A stable home life... emoticon_xgood\n But the article is primarily about eating breakfast... emoticon_ic\n \n There was a study a while back showing that Fox News viewers were most likely to believe false statements about the Iraq war.\n With examples like the above, can anybody be surprised Fox News viewers come in last?",
