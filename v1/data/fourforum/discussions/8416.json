   "Yeah, did you see the one where he had a woman lay down on a picnic table and then he sawed her in half ? He laid this woman down, then had another woman pull on her arms, while another woman pulled on her legs, then he cut the woman in half by just sawing on her midsection with his fingers. She went screaming across the yard with only her two arms pulling her upper torso and her waist and legs were left behind still kicking, on the picnic table. He also performed the act on himself using a huge rotating circular saw blade that cut him in half . No blood and guts were shown though from those events .. \n \n And that ole' \"making the elephant disappear behind the walls of cloth \" he does in the middle of the parking lot is a good one too. The hispanics after seeing his tricks performed right in front of them, call Chriss the \"diablo\". I know these tricks we are seeing this guy do is not really what  we are seeing  , but it would be neat to know how he creates those illusions. It is interesting to watch the reactions on the faces of those standing around this guy , when he does his trickery. :)",

Watching this stuff on TV -- even some of the card tricks -- cant convince me of his talent. It doesnt matter how real it looks, because I'm alwasy making the assumption that it must be trick photography and, of course, staged actors. If I could at least be one of those up close observers, THEN I'd be WOWed!!!",
