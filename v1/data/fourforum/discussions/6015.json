He left his friends and his home, and went to Gray Haven, which is like heaven on earth. so ofcourse i dun consider LOTR a 'children's fairy tale type book', because the main character sacrafised himself to save the world. If Harry remains to survive the final battle with voldemort, he's gonna go back to his normal life and that's that. Nywaz, i just hope harry dies.",
