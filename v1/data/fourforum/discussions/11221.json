   "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In a much-anticipated ruling issued Thursday, the California Supreme Court struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriage as unconstitutional.\n \n \n California's Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the state's ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional.\n \n Several gay and lesbian couples, along with the city of San Francisco and gay rights groups, sued to overturn state laws allowing only marriages between a man and a woman.\n \n With the ruling, California becomes the second state to allow same-sex couples to legally wed. Massachusetts adopted the practice in 2004, and couples don't need to be state residents to wed there.\n \n Vermont, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Connecticut permit civil unions, while California has a domestic-partner registration law. More than a dozen other states give gay couples some legal rights.\n \n Seven other jurisdictions around the world have legalized same-sex marriage: Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, South Africa and the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec.\n \n San Francisco officials in 2004 allowed same-sex couples in the city to wed, prompting a flood of applicants crowding the city hall clerk's office. The first couple to wed then was 80-year-old Phyllis Lyon and 83-year-old Dorothy Martin, lovers for 50 years.\n \n \"We have a right just like anyone else to get married to the person we want to get married to,\" Lyon said at the time.\n \n One issue before the justices was whether San Francisco's laws carried legal weight when the rest of the state banned same-sex marriages. Gay rights advocates argued the state was violating their civil rights by limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples. The state law in question is the Defense of Marriage Act, Proposition 22.\n \n Oral arguments in the case in March lasted more than three hours, a sign of the political and legal issues at stake. Six cases were consolidated.\n \n Same-sex marriages that were nullified by the law remain nullified, CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin said.\n \n Groups saying they were promoting a pro-family agenda had vowed to fight a statewide law allowing same-sex marriage.\n \n \"The government should promote and encourage strong families,\" said Glen Lavy of the Alliance Defense Fund. \"The voters realize that defining marriage as one man and one woman is important because the government should not, by design, deny a child both a mother and father.\"\n \n An appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is likely. The federal high court has never addressed the question of same-sex marriage.\n http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/15/same.sex.marriage/index.html?iref=newssearch\n emoticon_xagree emoticon_xagree emoticon_xagree",

Let me post the entire passage in Romans so you can see that it is speaking directly to, and about you.\n \n Rom 1:20 Ever since the creation of the world his invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse;\n Rom 1:21 for although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking and their senseless minds were darkened.\n Rom 1:22 Claiming to be wise, they became fools,\n Rom 1:23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man or birds or animals or reptiles.\n Rom 1:24 Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,\n Rom 1:25 because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever! Amen.\n Rom 1:26 For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. Their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural,\n Rom 1:27 and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in their own persons the due penalty for their error.\n Rom 1:28 And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a base mind and to improper conduct.\n Rom 1:29 They were filled with all manner of wickedness, evil, covetousness, malice. Full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity, they are gossips,\n Rom 1:30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,\n Rom 1:31 foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.\n Rom 1:32 Though they know God's decree that those who do such things deserve to die, they not only do them but approve those who practice them.\n So you see? In the last verse it even speaks to TQ who approves of your unnatural practices. And then there are these passages.\n 1Cr 15:39 For not all flesh is alike, but there is one kind for men, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.\n \n Hbr 13:11 For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp.\n \n Does the God of Israel condone burning any humans on the alter as sacrifices to Him? And didn't He condemn the practice of Pagan sacrifices of babies to the false god Molech? So there is a huge difference between how God see's animals and human beings whom He created in His image and likeness.\n \n 2Pe 2:12 But \"these\", like irrational animals, creatures of instinct, born to be caught and killed, reviling in matters of which they are ignorant, will be destroyed in the same destruction with them,\n \n He is speaking to the Natural Man here... ^^^\n \n Jud 1:10 But \"these men\" revile whatever they do not understand, and by those things that they know by instinct \"as irrational animals do\", they are destroyed.\n So the bible isn't wrong at all foundit, but it saw you and your rebellious ilk coming long ago. You know why? Because He is God and you are rebelling against His truths rather than humbling yourself before Him. It's not too late though foundit. Where there is life, there is hope.",

The first mention of the nature of homosexuality was in post #35.\n \n \nSimple, the further degradation and destruction of the morality of America by accepting as normal, sexual practices and lifestyles which are completely abnormal, unnatural and which lead to the further breaking down of our moral fiber as a Nation. Of course, since this is a moral consequence of our actions as a Nation, I would never expect \"you or your ilk\" to appreciate the seriousness of that consequence, or even see it coming. But America will pay as one for the idolatry and moral sins of some of its citizens; and for the acceptance of the rest for standing by and allowing it to happen. We rise or fall together as a people and a Nation, and the normalization and acceptance of homosexuality \"is just one\" of the National sins that will lead to our destruction.\n\n We realise that you are not discussing homosexuality in animals (despite the fact that humans are animals), however you have repeatedly stated that homosexuality is unnatural, and you have repeatedly been wrong.\n \n Smiley",

   "In your every response foundit, you prove how RIGHT THE BIBLE IS. Let me post the entire passage in Romans so you can see that it is speaking directly to, and about you.\n\n Archie, archie, archi...\n \n The funny thing in all this is how you can't seem to separate one thing from another.\n You get things SOOOO convoluted in your head that you refuse to separate things, and acknowledge what is REALLY going on around here. You start believing your own lies about things.\n \n Here are a couple of things you can't seem to keep straight.\n 1) Homosexuality IS natural. That isn't a question that can be definitively claimed by your bible any more than it could claim the earth was flat and have to take it's word on things....\n You CANNOT compete on the issue of debate of whether or not homosexuality is natural, so now you're running down this road of twisting things into some absurd semblance of what they aren't...\n 2) We are not defending \"homosexuality\" because it is natural.\n Let me repeat that. We are NOT defending homosexuality because it is natural.\n It's more the case that YOU tried to condemn gay on a false premise, and we have proven the claim false.\n And now you have taken YOUR OWN STANDARD which was applied to the situation, and illogically pretended to exist that WE are the ones who have adopted it.\n \n But let's go on about this ridiculous way you're trying to apply things...\n \n Rom 1:22 Claiming to be wise, they became fools,\n Rom 1:23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man or birds or animals or reptiles.Nobody is going for \"images\" of animals here.\n You're taking an arcane passage that reeks of some archaic limited understanding of other religions, and trying to make a square peg fit in the round hole.\n \n YOU were the one who brought \"natural\" into this.\n Not us.\n We REFUTED your claim of \"unnatural\" by pointing to nature.\n And now, you can't seem to recognize the fact that YOU were the one who brought this up, and instead try to apply this bible passage in a way that is clearly false.\n \n \n \nRom 1:24 Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,\n Rom 1:25 because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever! Amen.\n\n \"served the creature\"?\n Archie, TRY to wrap your head around the fact that NOBODY here was talking about animals until YOU brought up \"unnatural\".\n \n To exemplify the insanity that is going on here.\n Reggie: Mothers nursing their young is unnatural!\n foundit66: That's a ridiculous claim. Of course it's natural. Many animal species nurse their young.\n Reggie: See! You want to be like the animals and serve the animals! The Bible predicted this.\n \n If only you had the common sense to be embarrassed by your own actions.\n \n \n \nSo you see? In the last verse it even speaks to TQ who approves of your unnatural practices.\n\n All you did was quote a bible verse that MENTIONS animals in it, and insist it applied.\n You lack the intelligence to see that it does NOT apply, cause we don't believe as you claim.\n \n That's one of the reasons you will probably never \"convert\" anybody around here, cause you DO NOT KNOW the truth about other people.\n \n Suppose Reggie believes in worshipping water.\n Some other people think Reggie's beliefs are odd, and don't share his belief.\n Reggie pronounces vehemently that others should \"stop worshipping fire\" and start worshipping water instead.\n The \"other people\" are automatically rebuffed by Reggie's attempts because Reggie lacks the insight to realize that they do NOT \"worship fire\".\n \n And then throw in a LOT of insults by Reggie towards other people, make him generally abrasive, show him lying quite a few times, and Reggie just comes off as a quack.\n \n \n \nAnd then there are these passages.\n\n Let me guess.\n What you ACTUALLY did was google your bible for every mention of \"animal\", and then just cut and paste it here?\n \n Cause in looking at your follow-on quotes, NONE of them apply.\n Like this one:\n \n 1Cr 15:39 For not all flesh is alike, but there is one kind for men, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.\n \n Nobody is saying that there aren't different types of \"flesh\".\n Moreover, this section of the bible is ACTUALLY talking about a discussion on RESURRECTION and the form that will be taken in resurrection.\n 4. He illustrates this by a comparison of the first and second Adam: There is an animal body, says he, and there is a spiritual body; and then goes into the comparison in several instances. (1.) As we have our natural body, the animal body we have in this world, from the first Adam, we expect our spiritual body from the second. This is implied in the whole comparison.http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/comm_read.pl?book=1Cr&chapter=15&verse=39&Comm=Comm%2Fmhc%2F1Cr%2F1Cr015.html%2351%26Matthew%26Henry&Select.x=21&Select.y=2\n \n And the rest of your quotes equally inapplicable.\n There is a verse which ACTUALLY talks about the ritual of animal sacrifice. And then you try to compare that to HUMAN sacrifice, and pretend it has a point to our discussion???\n emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Quite frankly, you don't have any credibility left to lose.\n But if you DID have any credibility with anybody, this tactic of googling your bible and then cutting and pasting the results you find and just pretending they prove your point, when they have NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR DISCUSSION, just destroys any pretense you could have had.",

   "Does the God of Israel condone burning any humans on the alter as sacrifices to Him? And didn't He condemn the practice of Pagan sacrifices of babies to the false god Molech? So there is a huge difference between how God see's animals and human beings whom He created in His image and likeness.\nThat's the second time Genesis 22 has been useful to me this week. Yay bible! \n\"Take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about.\" (Genesis 22)\n \"Consecrate to me every firstborn male. The first offspring of every womb among the Israelites belongs to me, whether man or animal.\" (Exodus 13)\n\n Isn't this human sacrifice, as condoned by God? Abraham was let off the hook, and the firstborn males were redeemed, but this goes against another bible bit - \"Note also that any one of his possessions which a man vows as doomed to the Lord, whether it is a human being or an animal, or a hereditary field, shall be neither sold nor ransomed; everything that is thus doomed becomes most sacred to the Lord. All human beings that are doomed lose the right to be redeemed; they must be put to death.\" (Leviticus 27). Either way, God asks for human sacrifice.\n \n \nIn your every response foundit, you prove how RIGHT THE BIBLE IS. Let me post the entire passage in Romans so you can see that it is speaking directly to, and about you.\n\n One of these day's, I'm going to write a book. Here's an excerpt of how part will go:\n \"I declare that the sky is green. Now, there will be those who will use this declaration to try and sow doubt about the truth of my words, for they are impure sinners who will suffer for eternity. However, I declare to you that I shall never lie.\"\n Ron Hubbard couldn't have done better himself.\n \n Let's ignore your semantics for a bit, and concentrate on your main point here. I see no point in proving that you miss-spoke when the way you corrected yourself is also fallacious.\n \n Firstly, you mention Sodom and Gomorrah. It's interesting (though slightly off-topic) to note that the only people saved from Sodom's destruction were Lot and his daughters. Lot is saved because he protects two angels from being raped by the inhabitants - however, Lot offers the inhabitants his daughters instead - \"Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.\" (genesis 19). Apparently this is still OK with the Lord. After escaping to a safe cave, Lots daughters proceed to get him drunk and lie with him (in the Biblical sense) - \"So both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father.\" (genesis 19 again). Their punishment for this incestuous date-rape? Their sons become the heads of two peoples - the Moabites and the Ammonites - and Moabs blood ultimately gives birth to King David (see the book of Ruth) and eventually Jesus.\n My point? You seem to be awfully picky about which bits of the bible you chose to support. Could it be that you are merely cherry-picking the bits that support your views?\n \n I also would like to take this opportunity to quote another Bible blooper, thusly: \"13 \" These are the birds you are to detest and not eat because they are detestable: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture, 14 the red kite, any kind of black kite, 15 any kind of raven, 16 the horned owl, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk, 17 the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl, 18 the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey, 19 the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe and the bat.\" (leviticus 11). Why aren't you out campaigning for a change in mammalian reclassification?\n \n \nHomosexuality is an unnatural, and thus immoral act when practiced between people.\n\n 1. Without the Bible, how do you prove that homosexuality is unnatural - and by what standards do you define 'natural'?\n \n 2. With the bible, how do you explain that humans - who as you have claimed before are entirely natural - can exhibit unnatural behaviour? With regards to proving you've claimed this - \"it is YOU and ONLY YOU who is saying that humans are unnatural.\" (Archangel). Given that humans are exhibiting what is (to you) unnatural behaviour, does that still make them 'natural'?\n \n 3. How do you differentiate 'human' natural from 'animal' natural? This, I suspect (because of Archies first quote in my post), leads to an entirely different argument, that of \"how can an omnipotent being have an 'image' in which man can be made\" - somewhat ironic, given that it is a relatively common fundamentalist claim that atheism states that 'men are gods'. I ask it, nonetheless, for the purpose of clarity.\n \n 4. How do you link 'unnatural' to 'immoral'? Houses are 'unnatural', I really doubt that they are particularly immoral. Should we be eating our meat raw and sleeping in trees? If you want to take 'unnatural' to mean 'anything which the bible prohibits', I remind you that Jesus overturned much of the prohibitions established in the Old Testament, otherwise we would still be living in 'an eye for an eye' and not being allowed to eat shrimp or pork (see Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14).\n \n I think that's about it...\n \n EDIT: Archie posted! That he posted more Bible was irrelevant (see my point in this post), but a part of it caught my eye...\n \n Full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity, they are gossips,\n Rom 1:30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,\n Rom 1:31 foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.\n Rom 1:32 Though they know God's decree that those who do such things deserve to die,\n\n Do you truly believe that those who envy, those that disobey their parents, those that are foolish deserve to die? If not them, why homosexuals? If truly them, you should go and join Fred Phelps.\n \n I'd forgotten about the 'disobeyed their parents' one, too. If you ever get bored with homophobia, are you going to argue for the introduction of the lethal injection to those who disobey their parents? Would you say that disobedience to your parents was 'unnatural'? If not (to either question), you are guilty of picking which parts of the bible to believe.",

   "The following paragraphs dissect the argument surrounding gay marriage in America with purely logical and reasonable explanations, stressing civil rights. \n \n When a man and a woman marry in America today, their marriage is sanctioned by the government. A marriage license is issued and by the law of the land, the two are married. Here, the government is allowing two heterosexual people to marry. However, if two homosexual people wish to marry, under the law, it is against the law. Why not allow homosexuals to marry? The most logical reasoning for gay marriage is civil rights and the basic principle of equality. \n Most Americans would agree that a marriage is a religious tradition, and has for centuries been just that, defined by churches and religious doctrine. This is true, but I am not arguing why it is wrong for a religion to discriminate. I am arguing why it is wrong that the American government does. If two people wish to marry in a religious ceremony fine, but the moment they wish that ceremony be codified and sanctioned by the government, then the marriage must conform to the will of the people being governed, more precisely their secular constitution. The marriage must be stripped of any bias or discrimination towards citizens, and therefore must be available to all citizens. The law knows not whether you are a Christian, a Muslim, blind, deaf, black, white, heterosexual or homosexual. For the government to accept the unjust definition of marriage by a religion is the same as the government granting approval and legalizing such injustice. Just because a religion proclaims a marriage is to be defined a certain way does not mean the government must conform to the wishes of the religious definition, quite the contrary. In a secular government, laws must be applied equally to all, as justice is blind. \n Do not like the fact that government has the obligation to ensure equal rights for all its citizens and therefore manipulate the definition of marriage created by religious groups? Then by all means continue the unjust institution, but do not ask the government to sanction such injustice. Do not assume the government has the obligation to protect the bias and discrimination that opponents of same sex marriage subscribe to. The government has the obligation to protect all citizens, affording them equal rights under the law. The logic here is quite clear: the moment a religious groups seeks its ceremony of marriage to be fortified by law, it must comply with the law, i.e. be stripped of restrictions that disqualify certain citizens from partaking in such an institution. Otherwise, the government itself is discriminating. \n Maybe you think it is okay for the government to discriminate. Perhaps it serves some sort of good for society. This kind of thinking is dangerous and downright illogical, used to hide the real reasons for discrimination, such as maintaining the status quo, racism, sexism, homophobia, and any other where the majority seeks to oppress the minority. To prove this argument of possible negative social consequences false, let me go back to the basic American principle of equality. I would presume that all Americans feel equal to every other American, maybe not realistically, but in the eyes of the law. This fundamental aspect defines America and our constitution and laws. So if we agree that equality is paramount, then why settle for inequality? Even if negative consequences come about, is it okay to have inequality for the perceived positive social outcomes? If so, then we have not an equal society, and all are not created equal. Either all have equal rights or none, for if I have not the right to marry but you do, then we are unequal. \n Some might say this is perfectly acceptable, inequality is necessary. I would argue that this person is in the majority and has never been in the minority, been oppressed, and is ignorant of the intentions of our founding fathers to create a society where all are equal under the eyes of the law. As Americans, equality should triumph above all, even if negative consequences come about, which history shows has never came into fruition. Historical examples include slavery, where equality was willfully ignored to preserve the status quo; Japanese internment camps during world war II, where national security was used as a reason to suspend equality; and today a ban on same sex marriage, where again the status quo is being preserved.\n I find it hard to believe that in 2008 my country finds it so difficult to realize we are all equal and equally deserving of equal rights by our government. As an American citizen, I may be discriminated against by a religious group, but not by my government. To do so would be inherently un-American.",

   "The following paragraphs dissect the argument surrounding gay marriage in America with purely logical and reasonable explanations, stressing civil rights. \n\n \n There are a couple of problems with your post brown, or should I say that it makes some assumptions that just aren't true. For one, you say through out it, or imply that the Governments reason for standing against gay marriage is because of religious pressure or considerations exclusively. That just isn't true at all. Going back to our founding, and to the foundations of other Countries, marriage was a Government sanctioned unity that was endorsed by the Government for one purpose. To strengthen the fiber of the Nation with child producing families that increased the population with traditional family units and generations of extended families through intermarriages which created extended and interconnected communities. \n \n This created a social structure that glued a community together, encouraged business growth, the tax earnings of the local and State Government and promoted community cohesiveness. This is why the Government had and has certain criteria defining marriage that goes back so many hundreds of years.\n \n Also, you said in your post, and I quote: If two people wish to marry in a religious ceremony fine, but the moment they wish that ceremony be codified and sanctioned by the government, then the marriage must conform to the will of the people being governed, more precisely their secular constitution. The marriage must be stripped of any bias or discrimination towards citizens, and therefore must be available to all citizens. The law knows not whether you are a Christian, a Muslim, blind, deaf, black, white, heterosexual or homosexual.\n \n No where in America does the Government tell gay people they can't marry. I agree that would be discriminatory as gays deserve all of the rights that everyone else enjoys. And the right to marry is one of them. What Society, not only in America, but in Governments around the World have determined over many centuries of social experimentation is that same gender marriage contributes nothing to the social considerations outlined in paragraph 1 of this post. So gay marriage isn't opposed by Governments out of any bigotry, homophobia or desire to discriminate against a minority. It is to protect the social structure of the community and the core of the family unit which is under attack today by those who wish to remake it in their image. \n \n As evidence of the negative long term effects of gay marriage we can look at statistics that show that birth rates are approaching 0 growth throughout Europe where gay marriage has been legalized for some time now. Is that the only reason for this trend? Of course not. But it is a contributing factor.\n European Pension Systems Set to Collapse/Low Fertility Blamed\n * The president of the European Commission recently warned governments that by 2025 nearly one-third of the European population will be collecting pensions. Italian Romano Prodi also warned that nearly all pensions will be covered at government expense, paid by European tax payers. Prodi's warning is another in an increasing line of dire predictions relating to the results of population control.\n \n * After decades of over-population scares and government supported programs for \"zero population growth,\" most European countries are no longer replacing themselves. The average woman in an advanced industrial society must have 2.1 children in her lifetime in order for the country's population to remain stable. The United Nations reports that 61 countries, and all of Europe, are experiencing \"below replacement fertility.\" Experts expect this number to grow to as many as 80 countries in the coming year.\n \n * Experts predict that Italy's population will shrink 28 percent to 41 million by 2050. It is also predicted that the European Union as a whole will shrink to 18 million people fewer than the United States which continues to grow. At this time the European population is larger than the US.\n \n * Population problems are not just vexing western Europe. The former Communist countries in the east are having even greater problems. In a report just released by the UN Economic Commission for Europe, it is predicted that population levels are expected to drop by a third in former communist countries by 2050. The report states that the countries of eastern Europe have the lowest fertility rates in the world. The latest figures, from 1998, reveal that women are having on average 1.3 children in eastern Europe, compared to 1.6 in western Europe.\n \n * The immediate result of \"below replacement fertility\" is population aging. As the older population grows to retirement age, they must rely on rapidly expanding social security and medical systems. The bind doubles as this growing need cannot be met by a shrinking number of younger and more productive workers.\n \n * The problem in Europe is exacerbated even further by very young retirement ages. Italy allows workers to retire as young as 50 years old. Although the legal retirement age in most of Europe is 65, the financial penalty for early retirement is so small many opt for it anyway. According to a report in the International Herald Tribune the average age of retirement for men is 61 and 58 for women.\n \n * A recent UN report made the case for dramatically increased immigration to cover the shortfall of workers. This seems politically unfeasible since the relatively small numbers of immigrant workers in Europe are causing severe political difficulties and have given rise to political parties aggressively opposed to immigration.\n \n * Pro-lifers are concerned that the European scenario of rapidly aging populations increasing the strain on social services will lead inevitably to increased reliance on euthanasia. Euthanasia is already practiced in the Netherlands.\n http://www.overpopulation.org/older.html\n \n Without at least replacement growth in any given population, then the Countries ability to sustain a work force from one generation to the next is threatened. And many Countries through out the World are seriously grappling with this reality, most of them having legalized gay unions.",

   "Here's an interesting piece that gives numerous reasons why same sex marriage is bad for America. If my opinion has sent you over the edge, this oughta make you apoplectic. \n Why Allowing Same-Sex Marriage Would Be Disastrous For America. Numerous Scientific Studies Cited.\n November 9, 2004 \n Posted on November 9, 2004 10:17:10 PM EST by Laissez-faire capitalist\n \n Within the next 4-5 years almost every state within America will have their Constitution changed to ban same-sex marriage. This is the right path to take. Alas though, federal courts, being driven forward by radical homosexual organizations, most certainly will seek to overturn the overwhelming will of the people.\n \n We, as a society, must not allow this to happen. The foundation of American society is built upon the fact that marriage is indissoluably the union of one man and one woman. To change this to suit the whims of radical gays will most certainly undermine this nation in which we live, and the following facts support this premise.\n \n 1.) Few homosexual relationships last longer than two years, but in a study of 156 males in homosexual relationships lasting from 1-37 years, \"all couples with a relationship lasting more than five years have incorporated some provision for sexual activity outside of their relationships.\" (David P. McWhirter and Andrew M. Mattison, The Male Couple: How Relationships Develop, Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 1984, pp. 252, 253\n \n 2.) Clinicians Mattison and Mcwhirter studied 156 long-term homosexual relationships, but found that not one couple was able to maintain sexual fidelity for more than five years. most maintained a monogamous relationship for less than one year. (The Male Couple: How Relationships Develop)\n \n 3.)In a study of 2,583 older homosexuals, \"the model range for number of sexual partners was 101-500 (Paul Van de Ven \"A Comparative Demographic and Sexual Profile of Older Hoimosexually Active Men,\" Journal of Sex Research 34 (1997): 354)\n \n 4. According to the Centers For Disease Control, 50% of male homosexuals had over 500 sexual partners (Rotello, G. (1997). Sexual Ecology: AIDS and the Destiny of Gay Men. NY: Dutton)\n \n 5.)For homosexual men, the term \"monogamy\" doesn't necessarily mean sexual exclusivity. The term \"open relationship\" has for a great many homosexual men come to have one specific definition: A relationship in which the partners have sex on the outside often, put away their resentment and jealously, and discuss their outside sex with each other, or share sex partners. (Michelangelo Signorile, Life Outside (New York: Harper Collins, 1997), p. 213)\n \n 6.) \"Even 'committed' homosexual relationships display a fundamental incapacity for the faithfulness and committment that is axiomatic to the institution of marriage\" (Timothy J. Dailey, Homosexual Parenting: Placing Children at Risk, ) http://www.frc.org/get/is01j3.cfm\n \n 7.) \"Homosexuals model a poor view of marriage to children by teaching that marital relationships are transitory and mostly sexual in nature, sexual relationships are primarilly for pleasure rather than for procreation, and monogamy in marriage is not the norm and should be discoiuraged if one wasnts a good 'marital' relationship.\" (Bradley P. Hayton, \"To Marry or Not: The Legalization of Marriage and Adoption of Homosexual Couples,\" Newport Beach: The Pacific Policy Institute, 1993, p.9)\n \n 8.) Among heterosexual couples, 75% of husbands and 90% of wives claim never to have had extramarital sex. (Robert T. Michael, Sex in America: A Definitive Survey, Boston, Brown & Company, 1994) Other studies confirm the percentage of faithful spouses between 75-81% for husbands and 85-88% for wives. (Michael W. Widerman, \"Extramarital Sex: Prevelance and Correlated in a National Survey,\" Journal of Sex Research 34 [1977], p.2)\n \n 9.) Studies of previous civilizations reveal that when a society strays from the sexual ethic of marriage (a union between a male and a female), it deteriorates and eventually disintegrates. (J.D. Unwin, Sexual Regulatiuons and Human Behavior (London: Williams & Norgate, 1933)\n \n 10.) Paula Ettelbrick, former leagl director of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, has stated \"Being XXXXX is more than setting up house, sleeping with a person of the same gender, and seeking state approval for doing so...Being XXXXX means pushing the parameters of sex, sexuality and family, and in the process transforming the very fabric of society.\" (Paula Ettelbrick, quoted in William B. Rubenstein, \"Since When Is Marriage a Path to Liberation?\" Lesbains, Gay Men, and the Law, (New York: The New Press, 1993), pp. 398, 400)\n \n 11.) According to homosexual writer and activist Michelangelo Signorile, the goal of homosexuals is : \"To fight for same-sex marriage and its benefits, and then, once granted, redefine the institution of marriage completely, to demad the right to marry not as a way of adhering to society's moral codes but rather to debunk a myth and rdaically alter an archaic institution...the most subversive action lesbian and gay men can underatke...is to transform the notion of 'family' entirely.\" (Michelangelo Signorile, \"Bridal wave,\" Out, Dec 1994) \n \n [Archangel]Why should the hetero community agree for one minute to allow the militant gay community to redefine the institution of marriage when their agenda has nothing at all to do with protecting or preserving it but only to remake it in their image. Why should we invite a cancer into this ancient tradition, only to have it eat it from within and destroy it?\n \n Taking all of these studies into account, it is relatively clear that homosexuals will certainly ballon the incidence of divorce in America as the study of the high rate of divorce found already in Norway and Sweden among homosexuals shows. This will further weaken the institution of marriage in America. http://www.imapp.org\n \n As well, homosexuals do not show the faithfulness that is axiomatic to the institution of marriage. Homosexuals have a strange and twisted notion of what a committed relationship truly is.\n \n Finally, as Dr. Unwin noted in his studies of numerous past civilization, to stray from the true concept of marraige, one man and one woman, will certainly deteriorate and disintegrate our society as well...sooner or later.\n \n When someone saks you how two gays getting married could possibly affect you, show them these facts.\n http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1275961/posts",

   "And here is the slippery slope we will go down once gay marriage is legalized. Here's the basis of the report below. http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/301\n  (EXCERPT FROM ARTICLE,node/585) As Stanley Kurtz convincingly argues, however, the slippery slope following gay marriage will lead to polyamory rather than traditional polygamy, because \"what gay marriage is to homosexuality, group marriage is to bisexuality:\"\n Polyamorists would call the De Bruijn union a 'triad.' In a polyamorous triad, all three partners are sexually connected. This contrasts with a three-person 'V,' in which only one of the partners (called the 'hinge' or 'pivot') has a sexual relationship with the other two. So the bisexuality of Bianca and Mirjam classifies the De Bruijn union as a polyamorous bisexual triad. In another sense, the De Bruijn marriage is also a gay marriage. The Bianca-Mirjam component of the union is gay, and legalized gay marriage in Holland has clearly helped make the idea of a legally recognized bisexual triad thinkable.\n It is notable, Kurtz observes, that apart from the conservative blogosphere, which picked up the BJ article about the Dutch trio marriage en masse, the American media devoted no attention to this story. This is significant, he explains, as \"of course, the mainstream American press understands that the triple Dutch wedding cannot be spun in a way that helps the cause of same-sex marriage with the American public.\" What also strikes him is the fact that in the Netherlands the triple marriage barely caused a ripple. Apart from the conservative religious fringe, the secular Dutch did not protest. On the contrary, Victor and his wives were welcomed by their neighbours, while Piet Hein Donner, the Dutch minister of Justice and a Christian-Democrat, not only refused to dissolve the contract between the polyamorous triad, but even \"articulated the rudiments of a 'conservative case for group marriage.'\"\n http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/585\n \n And of course the unspoken result of gay marriage will be the demand that all forms of perversions of traditional marriages must now be allowed because the precedent has been set with same sex marriages. It will forever be reality that the concept of traditional marriages between one man and one woman is an extinct and lost tradition of the past, and with it, the demise of the nuclear/traditional family.",

   "Here, strangely enough is an objective lesbian who agrees with me in regard to Judicial activism and the problems hetero marriage has experienced over the past few decades.\n \n A Lesbian Explains What&#8217;s Wrong With the California Gay Marriage Ruling\n \n Men's News Daily ^ | May 17, 2008 at 8:41 am | Brunette Republican Sex Kitten \n Posted on May 18, 2008 10:36:17 AM EDT by Excuse_My_Bellicosity\n \n Sorry to rain on everybody&#8217;s parade, but this isn&#8217;t a good thing.\n \n Of course, I have already explained why I believe that civil unions would be better for us than gay marriage. I have also explained why at this point I don&#8217;t want gay marriage at all. (For those of you who don&#8217;t want to click, I can sum it up: 1) no-fault divorce, 2) alimony and 3) Terri Schiavo.)\n \n Had California&#8217;s state legislature passed a law, I wouldn&#8217;t be complaining. I still wouldn&#8217;t be getting married, for the reasons I referred to above, but I&#8217;d have no objection to the ruling. Yes, I think we&#8217;d be better off with civil unions instead of gay marriage, but after what&#8217;s been done to heterosexual marriage for the last several decades, that wouldn&#8217;t really make that much difference. With no-fault divorce, an abandonment of all traditional obligations of husbands and wives to each other, and outrageously unfair alimony settlements, XXXXXX getting hitched in a couple of states is the least of the problems marriage has.\n \n But this is a case of judicial activism, which, in case you don&#8217;t know, is bad. The courts are not supposed to decide what the laws will be, they are supposed to apply the laws that have been made by the people who were chosen by the voters to make them. When judges start taking it upon themselves to decide what the laws will be, they might decide anything, like that corporations have the right to force individuals to sell their homes to them, or that sluts have the right to murder the children who result from their irresponsible behavior if they don&#8217;t feel like looking after them.\n \n If we&#8217;re going to have gay marriage, let&#8217;s do it through the proper channels, please.\n http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2017655/posts\n \n And here's more of her opinion on this subject:\n \n http://mensnewsdaily.com/2008/04/03/gay-marriage-what-for/",

   "Gotta link proving that? Especially since Leviticus was written around 4000 years before the 19th century.\n Lev 21:14 A widow or a divorced woman or a defiled woman [or] a harlot--these he shall not marry; but he shall take a virgin of his own people as wife.\n\n \n Obviously, what Penfold was referring to was the FULL nature of marriage.\n Back then, women were little better than property of the husband. If the husband found out his wife was not a virgin on the wedding night, serious punishment could result. (Stoning if I am not mistaken...)\n \n A man could force his servant into \"marriage\".\n A man could SELL his daughter into \"marriage\".\n A RAPIST could BUY the VICTIM of his rape in marriage by paying shekels to the father.\n \n And as far as women's rights in the marriage? Forget about it...\n \n THESE are obviously HUGE changes inbetween \"4000 years ago\" and today.\n Forms of \"marriage\" that existed \"4000 years ago\"...\n 2) Polygynous marriage: A man would leave his family of origin and join with his first wife. Then, as finances allowed, he would marry as many additional women as he desired. The new wives would join the man and his other wives in an already established household. Polygyny was practiced by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Mormons, until the practice was suspended, a least temporarily, in the late 19th century. It is still practiced by separated fundamentalist Mormon groups which have left and been excommunicated from the main church.\n \n 3) Levirate Marriage: The name of this type of marriage is derived from the Latin word \"levir,\" which means \"brother-in-law.\" This involved a woman who was widowed without having borne a son. She would be required to leave her home, marry her brother-in-law, live with him, and engage in sexual relations. If there were feelings of attraction and love between the woman and her new husband, this arrangement could be quite agreeable to both. Otherwise, the woman would have to endure what was essentially serial rapes with her former brother-in-law as perpetrator. Their first-born son was considered to be sired by the deceased husband. In Genesis 38:6-10, Tamar's husband Er was killed by God for unspecified sinful behavior. Er's brother, Onan, was then required by custom to marry Tamar. Not wanting to have a child who would not be considered his, he engaged in an elementary (and quite unreliable) method of birth control: coitus interruptus. God appears to have given a very high priority to the levirate marriage obligation. Being very displeased with Onan's behavior, God killed him as well. Ruth 4 reveals that a man would be required to enter into a levirate marriage not only with his late brother's widow, but with a widow to whom he was the closest living relative. \n 4) A man, a woman and her property -- a female slave: As described in Genesis 16, Sarah and Abram were infertile. Sarah owned Hagar, a female slave who apparently had been purchased earlier in Egypt. Because Hagar was Sarah's property, she could dispose of her as she wished. Sarah gave Hagar to Abram as a type of wife, so that Abram would have an heir. Presumably, the arrangement to marry and engage in sexual activity was done without the consent of Hagar, who had such a low status in the society of the day that she was required to submit to what she probably felt were serial rapes by Abram. Hagar conceived and bore a son, Ishmael. This type of marriage had some points of similarity to polygamous marriage, as described above. However, Hagar's status as a human slave in a plural marriage with two free individuals makes it sufficiently different to warrant separate treatment here. \n 5) A man, one or more wives, and some concubines: A man could keep numerous concubines, in addition to one or more wives. These women held an even lower status than a wife. As implied in Genesis 21:10, a concubine could be dismissed when no longer wanted. According to Smith's Bible Dictionary, \"A concubine would generally be either (1) a Hebrew girl bought...[from] her father; (2) a Gentile captive taken in war; (3) a foreign slave bought; or (4) a Canaanitish woman, bond or free.\" 1 They would probably be brought into an already-established household. Abraham had two concubines; Gideon: at least 1; Nahor: 1; Jacob: 1; Eliphaz: 1; Gideon: 1; Caleb: 2; Manassah: 1; Saul: 1; David: at least 10; Rehoboam: 60; Solomon: 300!; an unidentified Levite: 1; Belshazzar: more than 1. \n 6) A male soldier and a female prisoner of war: Numbers 31:1-18 describes how the army of the ancient Israelites killed every adult Midianite male in battle. Moses then ordered the slaughter in cold blood of most of the captives, including all of the male children who numbered about 32,000. Only the lives of 32,000 women - all virgins -- were spared. Some of the latter were given to the priests as slaves. Most were taken by the Israeli soldiers as captives of war. Deuteronomy 21:11-14 describes how each captive woman would shave her head, pare her nails, be left alone to mourn the loss of her families, friends, and freedom. After a full month had passed, they would be required to submit to their owners sexually, as a wife. It is conceivable that in a few cases, a love bond might have formed between the soldier and his captive(s). However, in most cases we can assume that the woman had to submit sexually against her will; that is, she was raped. \n 7) A male rapist and his victim: Deuteronomy 22:28-29 requires that a female virgin who is not engaged to be married and who has been raped must marry her attacker, no matter what her feelings were towards the rapist. A man could become married by simply sexually attacking a woman that appealed to him, and paying his father-in-law 50 shekels of silver. There is one disadvantage of this approach: he was not allowed to subsequently divorce her. \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/mar_bibl0.htm",

   "Why must you guys always change the subject at all cost rather than actually deal with the points I make? These are the reasons why homosexuality destroys civilizations. I posted them back on post 103 but you guys ignored them. What you fail to appreciate is that morality is as powerful an energy as:\n 1) Poor Leadership\n 2) Internal fighting\n 3) Failure to keep up militarily with the regional powerhouse (read: Rome)\n And here is another link that defines how morality plays a part in a collapsing civilization, but It may as well be written in a foreign language for all the chance that you will comprehend it. But here it is for the second time. http://www.ldolphin.org/collapsing.html\n 1.) Few homosexual relationships last longer than two years, but in a study of 156 males in homosexual relationships lasting from 1-37 years, \"all couples with a relationship lasting more than five years have incorporated some provision for sexual activity outside of their relationships.\" (David P. McWhirter and Andrew M. Mattison, The Male Couple: How Relationships Develop, Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 1984, pp. 252, 253\n \n 2.) Clinicians Mattison and Mcwhirter studied 156 long-term homosexual relationships, but found that not one couple was able to maintain sexual fidelity for more than five years. most maintained a monogamous relationship for less than one year. (The Male Couple: How Relationships Develop)\n \n 3.)In a study of 2,583 older homosexuals, \"the model range for number of sexual partners was 101-500 (Paul Van de Ven \"A Comparative Demographic and Sexual Profile of Older Hoimosexually Active Men,\" Journal of Sex Research 34 (1997): 354)\n \n 4. According to the Centers For Disease Control, 50% of male homosexuals had over 500 sexual partners (Rotello, G. (1997). Sexual Ecology: AIDS and the Destiny of Gay Men. NY: Dutton)\n \n 5.)For homosexual men, the term \"monogamy\" doesn't necessarily mean sexual exclusivity. The term \"open relationship\" has for a great many homosexual men come to have one specific definition: A relationship in which the partners have sex on the outside often, put away their resentment and jealously, and discuss their outside sex with each other, or share sex partners. (Michelangelo Signorile, Life Outside (New York: Harper Collins, 1997), p. 213)\n \n 6.) \"Even 'committed' homosexual relationships display a fundamental incapacity for the faithfulness and committment that is axiomatic to the institution of marriage\" (Timothy J. Dailey, Homosexual Parenting: Placing Children at Risk, ) http://www.frc.org/get/is01j3.cfm\n \n 7.) \"Homosexuals model a poor view of marriage to children by teaching that marital relationships are transitory and mostly sexual in nature, sexual relationships are primarilly for pleasure rather than for procreation, and monogamy in marriage is not the norm and should be discoiuraged if one wasnts a good 'marital' relationship.\" (Bradley P. Hayton, \"To Marry or Not: The Legalization of Marriage and Adoption of Homosexual Couples,\" Newport Beach: The Pacific Policy Institute, 1993, p.9)\n \n 8.) Among heterosexual couples, 75% of husbands and 90% of wives claim never to have had extramarital sex. (Robert T.

Widerman, \"Extramarital Sex: Prevelance and Correlated in a National Survey,\" Journal of Sex Research 34 [1977], p.2)\n \n 9.) Studies of previous civilizations reveal that when a society strays from the sexual ethic of marriage (a union between a male and a female), it deteriorates and eventually disintegrates. (J.D. Unwin, Sexual Regulatiuons and Human Behavior (London: Williams & Norgate, 1933)\n \n 10.) Paula Ettelbrick, former leagl director of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, has stated \"Being XXXXX is more than setting up house, sleeping with a person of the same gender, and seeking state approval for doing so...Being XXXXX means pushing the parameters of sex, sexuality and family, and in the process transforming the very fabric of society.\" (Paula Ettelbrick, quoted in William B. Rubenstein, \"Since When Is Marriage a Path to Liberation?\" Lesbains, Gay Men, and the Law, (New York: The New Press, 1993), pp. 398, 400)\n \n 11.) According to homosexual writer and activist Michelangelo Signorile, the goal of homosexuals is : \"To fight for same-sex marriage and its benefits, and then, once granted, redefine the institution of marriage completely, to demad the right to marry not as a way of adhering to society's moral codes but rather to debunk a myth and rdaically alter an archaic institution...the most subversive action lesbian and gay men can underatke...is to transform the notion of 'family' entirely.\" (Michelangelo Signorile, \"Bridal wave,\" Out, Dec 1994) \n \n [Archangel]\n Why should the hetero community agree for one minute to allow the militant gay community to redefine the institution of marriage when their agenda has nothing at all to do with protecting or preserving it but only to remake it in their image.

This will further weaken the institution of marriage in America. http://www.imapp.org\n \n As well, homosexuals do not show the faithfulness that is axiomatic to the institution of marriage.

   "I would like to take this opportunity to address the criticisms of my earlier post by Archangel. In doing so, let me remind all who are reading and wish to reply that we are engaged in a rational discussion about gay marriage in America. I stress rational to point that, as in any argument, we adhere to logic and stray not into the many fallacies that hinder comprehension and blind the true issue at hand. The following is a dissection of both mine and archangel&#8217;s arguements:\n \n Let me first begin by addressing the issue of the government&#8217;s motive for not allowing same sex marriage. \n \n Archangel: \"There are a couple of problems with your post brown, or should I say that it makes some assumptions that just aren't true. For one, you say through out it, or imply that the Governments reason for standing against gay marriage is because of religious pressure or considerations exclusively. That just isn't true at all. Going back to our founding, and to the foundations of other Countries, marriage was a Government sanctioned unity that was endorsed by the Government for one purpose. To strengthen the fiber of the Nation with child producing families that increased the population with traditional family units and generations of extended families through intermarriages which created extended and interconnected communities.\" \n \n \"This created a social structure that glued a community together, encouraged business growth, the tax earnings of the local and State Government and promoted community cohesiveness. This is why the Government had and has certain criteria defining marriage that goes back so many hundreds of years.\"\n \n \n \n I may be inclined to agree with your main premise here, that the government sanctions marriage for the perceived overall benefit of society. This of course assumes that marriage allows for &#8220;strengthening the fiber of the nation, increase in population, interconnected communities, business growth, tax earnings, etc.&#8221; I would like to know exactly how the hetero definition of marriage allows for such positive outcomes, and how exactly same sex marriages will alter such outcomes in a negative way. To attribute all these outcomes to marriage is in my opinion arrogant and not well thought out.\n \n For example, replace marriage in your argument with slavery in the context of earlier American history, and see if the outcomes still ring true- strengthens fiber of nation CHECK. Increase in population CHECK. Interconnected communities CHECK. Business growth. BIG CHECK. Etc. To hold marriage responsible for such perceived social positives is foolish. A more correct cause would be a secular government, religious freedom, equality, industrialization, capitalism, Etc. To act as if marriage is the key for a good society is overlooking all the other aspects that truly made America what it is today. \n \n The government&#8217;s motive for not allowing same sex marriage is quite clear: adhering to the will of the majority at the expense of an oppressed minority. Can you name any other group of Americans that are more openly discriminated against in American society today than homosexuals? American Indians &#8211; NO. African Americans &#8211; NO. Women- NO. Asians &#8211; NO. Jews &#8211; NO. (and others as well) What do all of these groups have in common? They were at one time or another an oppressed minority, excluding women, who had to change the status quo to create a more just society. The majority, however, is interested in preserving the status quo, meaning no change and keeping things the way they are. Why? Changing society and laws for minorities creates more equality, and equality brings competition (whites must compete with blacks for the same job, pay, and benefits) and brings the recognition of equality (women, men, different ethnic groups and sexual orientations are all the same&#8230;none better or less than the other.) \n \n Archangel has deflected the argument at hand by addressing other aspects that have nothing to do with the argument I was making of EQUALITY.\n \n However, you have succeeded in drawing attention away from my main argument in support of gay marriage, equality, by bringing up perceived negatives of such an outcome. These negatives, though, have no bearing in the argument of allowing equal rights for all. As my main thesis in my first post states, equality is the crucial factor. People debating same sex marriage can pull statistics from anywhere to help bolster their argument. I would aruge that if you are truly for equality, you cannot let negatives or positives enter the equation. Imiagine someone saying, \" Oh, of course i'm for equality, as long as it dosent harm society or change the status quo!\" How could someone put stipulations on equality? Either you are for equality regardless of the outcome, or you subcome to inequality to maintain a status quo. If allowing equality creates a worse off society, then please admit that you hold not the American ideal of equality at heart, but rather your opinion of what a \"good\" society ought to be. \n \n I cannot stress enough the central issue surrounding why same sex marriage should be legalized- equality. A hypothetical question may stress my point. Today Americans agree that all Americans are equal, none better or more deserving of rights than the other, and that equality is at the bedrock of American principles and ideals. In doing so, we recognize that we have overlooked equality in the past. We all know that slavery was wrong and unjust, treating African Americans as unequal, even though the institution had positives that helped America grow at the expense of the minority of blacks. Today we all despise slavery and see it as a black spot in America&#8217;s history. Now imagine yourself in South Carolina in 1790. You recognize that the black people around you are not treated equal. Do you raise your voice in objection to slavery? Or do you say nothing because it is the status quo, you don&#8217;t want to &#8220;rock the boat&#8221; and make people mad, you are not sure of the outcome if blacks were treated as equals, and you might be seen as a &#8220;radical&#8221; if you stress equality for all? \n \n Although slavery and same sex marriage are completely different topics, they share the strong similarity of equality. We realize that slavery is wrong because it creates inequality. Opposing same sex marriage does just the same, except it is in the context of today instead of two centuries ago. Will you stand up and let your voice be heard for equality or set idly by, waiting for a new generation to take charge and demand a more just society? Would not you stand up in 1790 and demand an end to slavery? If you answer yes then you must stand up now and demand an end to opposition to same sex marriage. \n \n The correlation is so strong that one might say:\n \n A= C If you support (A) slavery you support (C) unequal rights. \n \n \n B= C If you support (B) a ban on same sex marriage you support (C)unequal rights.\n \n \n B= A If you support (B) a ban on same sex marriage you support (A) slavery. \n \n This logic is infallible, and therefore no rational person who believes in equal rights for all would ever oppose gay marriage. I have noticed that most critics of gay marriage do not address the critical issue of equality, instead deflecting attention to perceived negative outcomes that have nothing at all to do with the argument. As Americans, have we not learned from our mistakes in the past? Or are we destined to repeat them? \n \n In short, it is true to say that if you support a ban on gay marriage, you are living in the eighteenth century. ",

   "Archangel has deflected the argument at hand by addressing other aspects that have nothing to do with the argument I was making of EQUALITY.\n\n \n No brown, you are wrong, I clearly said this. No where in America does the Government tell gay people they can't marry. I agree that would be discriminatory as gays deserve all of the rights that everyone else enjoys. And the right to marry is one of them. It is only same sex marriage that is banned, not the right for gays to marry at all. If the Government said gay people can't marry under any circumstances, that would be discriminatory and would treat them unequally.\n \n But just because gays are demanding a special right, it doesn't represent unequal treatment at all. Especially since that special right would lead to the destruction of the nuclear family for reasons given above which have gone unanswered and ignored thus far. Here's one perversion of the institution of marriage that will have to be allowed once gay marriage is accepted as normal. http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/301 , and here is an extended critique that deals with the negative aspects of it. http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/585\n As Stanley Kurtz convincingly argues, however, the slippery slope following gay marriage will lead to polyamory rather than traditional polygamy, because \"what gay marriage is to homosexuality, group marriage is to bisexuality:\"\n Polyamorists would call the De Bruijn union a 'triad.' In a polyamorous triad, all three partners are sexually connected. This contrasts with a three-person 'V,' in which only one of the partners (called the 'hinge' or 'pivot') has a sexual relationship with the other two. So the bisexuality of Bianca and Mirjam classifies the De Bruijn union as a polyamorous bisexual triad. In another sense, the De Bruijn marriage is also a gay marriage. The Bianca-Mirjam component of the union is gay, and legalized gay marriage in Holland has clearly helped make the idea of a legally recognized bisexual triad thinkable.[snip]\n \n In this specific relationship, where two married lesbians each have a baby girl by the same donor, the two daughters could later also \"marry\" each other and each have a daughter through artificial insemination. What they are doing is establishing an all female nuclear family that does not need any male presence or influence. They are living according to a longstanding feminist ideal which envisages the total destruction of every male influence in society - the dream which radical feminists such as Bella Abzug worked to establish. According to Abzug and her followers the two sexes - male and female - do not exist. Instead there are five genders - male, female, homosexual, lesbian and bisexual. People can move from one gender to another, according to choice or at will, which liberates them from the sexual constraints of nature.\n So those who oppose gay marriage are more concerned with the destruction of traditional marriages and the end of the nuclear family than denying equality to gays. Especially since gays are equal in that they have the same rights to marry as straight people do. It is special rights gays seek, and those special rights will destroy traditional marriage which they don't have the right to do. \n \n None of you gay apologists can deny that this real world example as posted, represents the natural progression of what will occur if gay marriage is legalized. Marriage between one man/one woman must be protected for these reasons. So stop with the equality argument until you can prove that America tells gay people that they don't enjoy the same exact right to marry as straight people.",

But it would further lead to the appearance that homosexuality is a right and normal lifestyle which could lead the next generation of young people to accept it as a natural sexual expression. And it is an unnatural form of sexual expression, and shouldn't be encouraged by legalizing gay marriage. \n \n I realize that my perspective stands in stark opposition to what your side wants to accomplish with your agenda, but just as you have no interest, respect or concern in my traditional values in carrying out your agenda, so must I speak in direct opposition to what you hope to accomplish. So if my perspective is perceived as spreading hate, then so is yours as you are attempting to destroy traditional nuclear families forever.emoticon_xgood",

   "If I was asked, I would say that the 'sanctity' of the traditional family is being threatened the most by (in order, most to least):\n \n 1) Increased pressure to work and earn - both for men and women. Longer/more obscure hours result in children growing up missing one or both of their 'essential role models', and so turn to other influences (see below). Longer hours are knock-ons from Thatcher and Conservatism in general ('work/earn for yourselves, expect your children to do the same'), whereas obscure hours are due to globalism (if there is a UK/Australia business meeting then someone is going to have antisocial hours) and increased opening hours for most businesses.\n \n 2) Increased media coverage and 'celebrity culture' - in a world where you can become famous by doing outlandish things (such as breaking 'traditional values'), people are doing just that - and the media seize upon it. The first example that springs to mind would be that of Brittany Spears' 55-hour-long wedding in early 2004, but there are many, many others. People don't get publicised for living in long and happy relationships, instead they get publicised for divorce, feud and scandal. All of these influences are seized upon by children (and adults) lacking role models and who desire to be like their favourite celebrity, and the cycle continues into the next generation.\n \n 3) Generaly increased divorce rates. As the current and previous generations of kids from single parents grow up and get married on their own, the 'sanctity' of marriage matters less and less. They weren't brought up that way, why should they be any different from their parents? The spread of this (I would say most people today personally know at least one, if not many more, divorce cases) is not just limited to families, but to friends also. \"She's doing so much better now she's got rid of him'...\n \n 4) Broader possibilities for sex and birth. Over the last few decades, if not the last few centuries, there have been increases in pregnancies for both teenagers and the more elderly. As this gap broadens, people have a much larger range over which they might want to start a family - this results in people unwisely getting married too early in life, or putting off marriage for too long.\n \n 5) Growth in gay marriage. This is at the bottom for a very good reason, because I'm not entirely sure that it exists. Gay individuals before gay marriage was introduced would either remain unmarried or 'suppress' their sexuality and live in an unhappy/unfulfilled marriage - not really the best role models in the world. Even were most gay couples to break up (which I distrust purely from personal observation of couples forming and changing at my university), the couples who went as far as to get married are less likely to split up than those that don't, and those that go so far as to adopt a child even less likely. Should the couple then still split up - how is this different from a divorced couple, leaving a single parent looking after the child - especially if the child is biologically related to said parent?\n \n I see nothing wrong with legitimate 'polyamory'. The feminist ideal of absolutely minimal sex-identity is a good one, if unacceptable in today's moral climate. Should it become widespread enough to change society, this ideal would first have to be accepted - I see this as no bad thing. \\/See also Chesters post, below.\\/\n \n As regards to 'legalising gay marriage will only indoctrinate our young' - this is only a bad thing if you believe that homosexuality (or, at least, the act thereof) is evil. Clearly you do, from your bible quotes earlier - but I'm still waiting on your answers to persuade the rest of us.\n \n Finally (phew!), reducing population growth, even reversing it, is no bad thing. Check out the much more extreme measures China implements - limiting its populace to one child per couple. This is not an 'accident', it is State policy. The US still has a high percentage growth because it has massive areas of land to expand into - this is something Europe is starting to lack. It is this which I would guess is the biggest reason for the decline in pop. growth.",

Granted, there are some homosexuals that do engage in such behavior. But there are heterosexuals that do the same thing. What is important to recognize is the substantial heterosexist bias that causes people to ignore heterosexual flaws while highlighting homosexual flaws.\n a) One study which appears to support the idea that homosexuals are highly promiscuous was published by Bell and Weinberg, and is often cited by the Christian Right, and even some secular sources. However, their data is highly suspicious, and cannot be generalized to the entire homosexual population. Because of their methodology, their data is valuable only as a case study for the sample they studied, but it is not by any means representative of the general gay population. See Appendix A for my specific critique of this study, and why their statistics on gay promiscuity are so bizarrely high. \n \n b) In a study of sexual behavior in homosexuals and heterosexuals, the researchers found that of gay and bisexual men, 24% had one male partner in their lifetime, 45% had 2-4 male partners, 13% had 5-9 male partners, and 18% had 10 or more sexual partners, which produces a mean of less than 6 partners. (The statistics I did by myself using the data presented, which is presented as a percentage of total males interviewed, both gay and straight (p. 345)--they can be verified yourself by looking at the numbers given in the paper)(Fay; n=97 gay males of 1450 males total). In a parallel study, a random sample of primarily straight men (n=3111 males who had had vaginal intercourse; of the total sample of n=3224 males, only 2.3% had indicated having had sex with both men and women), the mean number of sexual partners was 7.3, with 28.2% having 1-3 partners, and 23.3% having greater than 19 partners (Billy). This data indicates that gay men may have fewer number of sexual partners than heterosexuals. \n \n J Billy-1993: Family Planning Perspectives 25:52-60 \n R Fay-1989, Science 243:338-348\n \n In another set of studies, the first (n=2664) showed that gay men had an average of 6.5 sexual partners in the past 5 years. In fact, the authors of this paper report that \"homosexual and bisexual men are much more likely than heterosexual men to be celibate\" given the data in the table below, which compares their data to a second, parallel study of only heterosexual men (n=1235, age=18-49 yrs). The table indicates the percentage of men having the given number of sexual partners in the previous year [top row: Binson; bottom row: Dolcini]: \n \n orientation no partners 1 partner 2+ partners \n gay 24 % 41 % 35 % \n straight 8 % 80 % 12 % \n \n \n D Binson-1995: Journal of Sex Research 32: 245-54.\n M Dolcini-1993: Family Planning Perspectives 25: 208-14.\n \n A third major study, by Laumann, appears on the surface to indicate that gay men do have many more sexual partners than heterosexual men. However, a more extensive analysis of the data gives a more balanced perspective. Laumann fails to explore the radically skewed nature of the data. Typically this indicates that the mean, the statistic presented by Laumann, may not be the best measure to report. A further analysis of the GSS data (on which Laumann based his results) indicates that the median (50th percentile) number of sexual partners for heterosexuals is five and for homosexuals is six (http://www.jeramyt.org/gss/partners.html). The discrepancy between the mean and median is indicative of a small sub-population of gay males who tend towards high rates of sexual partners, skewing the mean, while the majority of gay men tend to have rates about the same as heterosexual males. \n \n Laumann, Edward, et al.

It seems far more unnatural to me to tell gays \"well, you can get married, just not to each other\".\n \n \n \nI realize that my perspective stands in stark opposition to what your side wants to accomplish with your agenda, but just as you have no interest, respect or concern in my traditional values in carrying out your agenda, so must I speak in direct opposition to what you hope to accomplish. So if my perspective is perceived as spreading hate, then so is yours as you are attempting to destroy traditional nuclear families forever\n\n Yes...my side. Would that be white, middle class, heterosexual married males who support equal rights for all Americans, not just those like myself? That side? So again I ask...how does allowing gays to marry destroy your nuclear family? Giving gays the right to marry does not affect who you are or what you are allowed to do...does it? \n \n I don't in any way want to destroy \"traditional nuclear families\", especially since I have one. I guess I am mature enough to realize that two men or women getting married to each other does not affect me in the least.",

   "But as history has shown us, when people \"define\" it by vote in a way that is unconstitutional, it is the COURT'S responsibility to make the government act in a CONSTITUTIONAL way.\n We don't live in a strict democracy.\n If we did, stem cell research would be allowed.\n Our \"Iraq\" situation would be radically different.\n \n And judging from history, miscegenation laws would have continued until at least the late 80's / early 90's if the courts hadn't stopped them in the late 60's.\n \n It's the RESPONSIBILITY of the court to stop unconstitutional legislation.\n Claiming that it is up to the democracy to ensure equal rights is like having two wolves and a lamb vote on what is for dinner.\n\n \n Maybe not in the case of ballot initiatives on issues, but ultimately it has to be a govt. by the people and for the people. We have to allow for amendments to their constitutions if states want to, otherwise constitutions would be limited to being followed from the way they were written hundreds of years ago (in some cases). There has to be an allowance for the people to have a voice, and the price we all pay is that such may not go the way we want it to sometimes.\n \n I think people sometimes take the phrase \"constitutional republic\" and fixate ONLY on the first word of the phrase (\"constitutional\") and don't seem to realize the second word of the phrase (\"republic\"). There's an involvement of the people as well. From Webster's Dictionary: \"a government in which supreme power resides in a body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by elected officers and representatives responsible to them and governing according to law.\" Given how our system is set up, that is how the concept of a republic applies in the case of the U.S. The constitution was made for the people, not people for the constitution. That's the problem when people who are for gay marriage invoke the idea of \"oh, I just want them to go with what's constitutional!\" Well, guess what ... more and more state constitutions aren't allowing gay marriage. So if a state court under such an amendment constitution wants to be constitutional, they would then have to make a ruling that DOESN'T favor gay marriage. Personally, I think these amendments are a waste of time, and to me it's not worth it to amend state constitutions like that. I'd rather them focus on fixing what I consider real problems. But such a process has to be in place for the people to amend constitutions. And in THAT sense, people over-ride their state document. So if you're going to really be a constitutionalist here, then you have to be consistent even when a constitution isn't the way you want. We don't get to cherry pick from constitutions.",

   "But Kurtz's smoking gun is really just smoke and mirrors. Reports of the death of marriage in Scandinavia are greatly exaggerated; giving gay couples the right to wed did not lead to massive matrimonial flight by heterosexuals. \n \n Currently there are nine European countries that give marital rights to gay couples. In Scandinavia, Denmark (1989), Norway (1993), Sweden (1994), and Iceland (1996) pioneered a separate-and-not-quite-equal status for same-sex couples called \"registered partnership.\" (When they register, same-sex couples receive most of the financial and legal rights of marriage, other than the right to marry in a state church and the right to adopt children.) Since 2001, the Netherlands and Belgium have opened marriage to same-sex couples. \n \n Despite what Kurtz might say, the apocalypse has not yet arrived. In fact, the numbers show that heterosexual marriage looks pretty healthy in Scandinavia, where same-sex couples have had rights the longest. In Denmark, for example, the marriage rate had been declining for a half-century but turned around in the early 1980s. After the 1989 passage of the registered-partner law, the marriage rate continued to climb; Danish heterosexual marriage rates are now the highest they've been since the early 1970's. And the most recent marriage rates in Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are all higher than the rates for the years before the partner laws were passed. Furthermore, in the 1990s, divorce rates in Scandinavia remained basically unchanged. \n \n Of course, the good news about marriage rates is bad news for Kurtz's sky-is-falling argument. So, Kurtz instead focuses on the increasing tendency in Europe for couples to have children out of wedlock. Gay marriage, he argues, is a wedge that is prying marriage and parenthood apart. \n \n The main evidence Kurtz points to is the increase in cohabitation rates among unmarried heterosexual couples and the increase in births to unmarried mothers. Roughly half of all children in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark are now born to unmarried parents. In Denmark, the number of cohabiting couples with children rose by 25 percent in the 1990s. From these statistics Kurtz concludes that \" ... married parenthood has become a minority phenomenon,\" and-surprise-he blames gay marriage. \n \n But Kurtz's interpretation of the statistics is incorrect. Parenthood within marriage is still the norm-most cohabitating couples marry after they start having children. In Sweden, for instance, 70 percent of cohabiters wed after their first child is born. Indeed, in Scandinavia the majority of families with children are headed by married parents. In Denmark and Norway, roughly four out of five couples with children were married in 2003. In the Netherlands, a bit south of Scandinavia, 90 percent of heterosexual couples with kids are married. \n \n Kurtz is also mistaken in maintaining that gay unions are to blame for changes in heterosexual marriage patterns. In truth, the shift occurred in the opposite direction: Changes in heterosexual marriage made the recognition of gay couples more likely. In my own recent study conducted in the Netherlands, I found that the nine countries with partnership laws had higher rates of unmarried cohabitation than other European and North American countries before passage of the partner-registration laws. In other words, high cohabitation rates came first, gay partnership laws followed.\n \n A subtler version of Kurtz's argument states that the advent of registered partnership caused an increase in cohabitation rates and children born outside of marriage (nonmarital births). If that were true, then we would expect to see two patterns: Cohabitation rates and the nonmarital birth rate would rise more quickly within a country after it passed partner registration laws; and the rise in the nonmarital birth rate would be greater in countries that had such laws than in countries that do not recognize same-sex partnerships.\n \n Kurtz's argument fails both tests. From 1970 to 1980, the Danish nonmarital birth rate tripled, from 11 percent to 33 percent. Over the next 10 years, it rose again to 46 percent and then stopped rising in 1990s after the passage of the 1989 partnership law. Norway's big surge occurred in the 1980's, with an increase from 16 percent to 39 percent. In the decade after Norway recognized same-sex couples (in 1993), the nonmarital birth rate first rose slightly, then, after a couple of years, leveled off at 50 percent. \n \n Cohabitation rates tell a similar story. In Denmark, from 1980 to 1989, the number of unmarried, cohabiting couples with children rose by 70 percent, but the same figure rose by only 28 percent from 1989 to 2000-the decade after Denmark introduced its partner-registration laws-and then stopped rising. From 2000 to 2004, the number has increased by a barely perceptible 0.3 percent. The fact that rates of cohabitation and nonmarital births either slowed down or completely stopped rising after the passage of partnership laws shows that the laws had no effect on heterosexual behavior.\n \n Furthermore, the change in nonmarital births was exactly the same in countries with partnership laws as it was in countries without. The eight countries that recognized registered partners at some point in the decade from 1989 to 2000 saw an increase in the average nonmarital birth rate from 36 percent in 1991 to 44 percent in 2000, an eight percentage point increase. Among the EU countries that didn't recognize partners (plus Switzerland), the average rate of nonmarital births rose from 15 percent to 23 percent-also an eight-point increase. \n \n No matter how you slice the demographic data, rates of nonmarital births and cohabitation do not increase as a result of the passage of laws that give same-sex partners the right to registered partnership. To put it simply: Giving gay couples rights does not inexplicably cause heterosexuals to flee marriage, as Kurtz would have us believe. Looking at the long-term statistical trends, it seems clear that the changes in heterosexuals' marriage and parenting decisions would have occurred anyway, even in the absence of gay marriage.\n \n And all the conservative hand-wringing seems especially unnecessary when you consider the various incentives that encourage American heterosexual couples to marry. By marrying, U.S. couples obtain health-insurance coverage, pensions, and Social Security survivor benefits. Plus, in the United States we are required by law to be financially responsible for our spouses in bad times, since we don't have Scandinavian-style welfare programs to fall back on. \n \n In addition, American society already wrestles with the social tensions that Kurtz claims have occurred as a result of gay marriage in Scandinavia: deepening divisions over gay issues in churches, the increasing acceptance of lesbian and gay relationships in the media, and the occasional radical voice arguing for the abolition of marriage. Yet heterosexual couples keep getting married-more than 2 million of them every year.\n \n Concerns about the impact of gay marriage on heterosexual behavior are not unique to the United States, of course. European countries that recognize same-sex couples initially had their worriers, too. Over time, however, it became clear that civilization and family life would survive the recognition of gay couples' rights. Even the conservative governments that came into power have not tried to repeal rights for gay couples in France and the Netherlands. \n \n Both demographic data and common sense show that the dire predictions of Dobson and Kurtz are just cultural prenuptial jitters. Now that gay and lesbian couples are marrying in Massachusetts, we'll have a home-grown social experiment that will undoubtedly compare to that of Europe: Letting gay couples say \"I do\" does not lead to heterosexuals saying \"I don't.\"\n http://www.slate.com/id/2100884/I've read Kurtz's junk before. I know the games he tries to play.\n *See gay marriage? See this other thing over here which is scary? They MUST be related, and you MUST assume it so cause it's just So-o-o-o-o scary!\" emoticon_rolleyes \n Lee Badgett provides an excellent rebuttal to Kurtz's nonsense.\n \n It's amusing to watch Archie be asked REPEATEDLY for what EXACTLY the link is, but he can't put it into words.\n \n All he can do is sputter and say \"read this\", when he won't even admit that the \"this\" that he offers doesn't even explain WHAT the link supposedly is.\n \n HOW will the existence of gay marriage cause:\n a) straight couples to divorce,\n b) straight couples not to marry,\n c) make the wife a lesbian, \n d) make the husband gay, or\n e) ANY of the above?\n \n Archie, in YOUR own words without telling us to read something else that you obviously can't explain yourself, can you JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION?",

I also said that promiscuity itself is a diversion to the issue of the right to marry. \n \n \nNow do me a favor and look at just one web site that offers a National Network of gay bath houses and gay sex clubs, and tell me that all of their customers are single gays looking for a good time with other singles; I dare you. http://www.bathhouseguide.com/ Here's a listing of sex clubs in various cities and states from just one web site. I can post pages of similar ads.\n\n \n Who knows if they are single, married to men or to women. It has nothing to do with the issue of the right to marry(and I mean someone of one's choice). I can find all sorts of sex clubs and internet sites that cater to straight people, some in relationships or married, others not. So what?\n \n \nThe gay culture is a culture of promiscuity, yet you will all come here and dare to blatantly lie as you attempt to paint your community as no different than the straight community at all, when random sexual encounters not only occurs as they do in the straight community, but are considered a normal part of gay interaction.\n\n \n What a stupid, facile generalization. What makes you an expert on gay culture? You are not. \n \n \nHere's one ad for a sex club in San-Francisco:\n \n \n \n And another: And notice the variety of the clientele.\n\n \n You spend a lot of time looking at these gay sex sites, eh? I'm not going to go into a war of attrition, posting sex venues and websites of gay or straight variety, looking at their clientelle and what people do there. But knock yourself out. Whatever floats your boat. \n \n \nNow I understand there is sexual promiscuity in the straight community also, and that the straight community has swingers clubs and prostitution to contend with. But when you consider the national demographics of approximately 96% straight and 4% gay population break down, if the straight community had sex clubs and bath houses in proportion to the gay community, there would be similar clubs for straights available on every 3rd street corner in every city in America.\n\n \n Promiscuity is what the straight community is all about. Heterosexual escort ads are in every newspaper. Promiscuity and cheating of heterosexuals is on TV dramas, reality shows, music videos. Dirty books, and sleazy straight sex magazines barely kept on a shelf high enough for the kids not to see at every convenience store. Prostitution and escorts catering to straight people. The Playboy Mansion, porn, sex shops. You don't have to look far to see how dirty heterosexuals, especially heterosexual men, are.\n \n Can you prove to me all of these heterosexuals don't have girlfriends and are not in church on Sundays?",

Note the bolded and I think you must admit that something was lost in translation as the bolded say's what I translated in the International translator.\n First Trio \"Married\" in The Netherlands\n From the desk of Paul Belien on Tue, 2005-09-27 00:08\n \n The Netherlands and Belgium were the first countries to give full marriage rights to homosexuals. In the United States some politicians propose \"civil unions\" that give homosexual couples the full benefits and responsibilities of marriage. These civil unions differ from marriage only in name.\n \n Meanwhile in the Netherlands polygamy has been legalised in all but name. Last Friday the first civil union of three partners was registered. Victor de Bruijn (46) from Roosendaal \"married\" both Bianca (31) and Mirjam (35) in a ceremony before a notary who duly registered their civil union.\n \n \"I love both Bianca and Mirjam, so I am marrying them both,\" Victor said. He had previously been married to Bianca. Two and a half years ago they met Mirjam Geven through an internet chatbox. Eight weeks later Mirjam deserted her husband and came to live with Victor and Bianca. After Mirjam's divorce the threesome decided to marry.\n \n Victor: \"A marriage between three persons is not possible in the Netherlands, but a civil union is. We went to the notary in our marriage costume and exchanged rings. We consider this to be just an ordinary marriage.\"\n \n Asked by journalists to tell the secret of their peculiar relationship, Victor explained that there is no jealousy between them. \"But this is because Mirjam and Bianca are bisexual. I think that with two heterosexual women it would be more difficult.\" Victor stressed, however, that he is \"a one hundred per cent heterosexual\" and that a fourth person will not be allowed into the \"marriage.\" They want to take their marriage obligations seriously: \"to be honest and open with each other and not philander.\"",

In a polyamorous triad, all three partners are sexually connected. This contrasts with a three-person 'V,' in which only one of the partners (called the 'hinge' or 'pivot') has a sexual relationship with the other two. So the bisexuality of Bianca and Mirjam classifies the De Bruijn union as a polyamorous bisexual triad. In another sense, the De Bruijn marriage is also a gay marriage. The Bianca-Mirjam component of the union is gay, and legalized gay marriage in Holland has clearly helped make the idea of a legally recognized bisexual triad thinkable.[snip]\n http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/585",

Jo just explained, quite correctly, that bi-sexuals can easily be in love with only one person of either sex.\n \n \nPolyamorists would call the De Bruijn union a &#8216;triad.&#8217; In a polyamorous triad, all three partners are sexually connected. This contrasts with a three-person &#8216;V,&#8217; in which only one of the partners (called the &#8216;hinge&#8217; or &#8216;pivot&#8217;) has a sexual relationship with the other two. So the bisexuality of Bianca and Mirjam classifies the De Bruijn union as a polyamorous bisexual triad. In another sense, the De Bruijn marriage is also a gay marriage. The Bianca-Mirjam component of the union is gay, and legalized gay marriage in Holland has clearly helped make the idea of a legally recognized bisexual triad thinkable.[snip]\n http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/585\n\n \n Yes, forget the fact that they are not married. I like that line: it makes an \"idea\", \"thinkable\". Lol, well that settles the argument then! So since, the other component of the relationship is different-sex and different-sex marriage is legal in Holland, this idea is also thinkable.",

   "Maybe not in the case of ballot initiatives on issues, but ultimately it has to be a govt. by the people and for the people. We have to allow for amendments to their constitutions if states want to, otherwise constitutions would be limited to being followed from the way they were written hundreds of years ago (in some cases). There has to be an allowance for the people to have a voice, and the price we all pay is that such may not go the way we want it to sometimes.\n \n I think people sometimes take the phrase \"constitutional republic\" and fixate ONLY on the first word of the phrase (\"constitutional\") and don't seem to realize the second word of the phrase (\"republic\"). There's an involvement of the people as well. From Webster's Dictionary: \"a government in which supreme power resides in a body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by elected officers and representatives responsible to them and governing according to law.\" Given how our system is set up, that is how the concept of a republic applies in the case of the U.S. The constitution was made for the people, not people for the constitution. That's the problem when people who are for gay marriage invoke the idea of \"oh, I just want them to go with what's constitutional!\" Well, guess what ... more and more state constitutions aren't allowing gay marriage. So if a state court under such an amendment constitution wants to be constitutional, they would then have to make a ruling that DOESN'T favor gay marriage. Personally, I think these amendments are a waste of time, and to me it's not worth it to amend state constitutions like that. I'd rather them focus on fixing what I consider real problems. But such a process has to be in place for the people to amend constitutions. And in THAT sense, people over-ride their state document. So if you're going to really be a constitutionalist here, then you have to be consistent even when a constitution isn't the way you want. We don't get to cherry pick from constitutions.\n\n \n This is a good post. Your points are certainly true. The problem, of course, is which people get to decide what is in the constitution. Is it a simple majority of the people? Is the elected representatives of the people? Different state constitutions differ on the amendment process. The U.S. constitution is very difficult to amend, for good reasons. A simple majority of voters cannot amend it. The Massachusetts constitution is difficult to amend. The California constitution is less difficult to amend. \n \n An interesting historical tidbit from Massachusetts has to do with how and when states in the North banned slavery. During and after the American Revolution, all of the northern states came to outlaw slavery. Massachusetts had passed a new state constitution. It did not mention slavery, but it had a provision guaranteeing equal rights for all. A case involving slavery came before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The court ruled that the constitution, with this language guaranteeing equal rights, made slavery illegal, and it was thus the state supreme court that struck slavery down, in a manner similar to the state supreme court upholding a right of same-sex couples to marry. \n \n On an earlier point that someone made about young people coming to accept same-sex relationships and marriage, this certainly does appear to be happening. This is anecdotal, but on the campus where I teach, most students appear to accept same-sex relationships completely, and they don't understand why older people view same-sex marriage as a threat. Constitutions and laws reflect popular opinion to a degree, though not completely. The biggest problem, I think, for the opponents of same-sex marriage is the shifting of popular opinion towards favoring same-sex marriage. Laws may lag that shift, but as more and more people come to accept same-sex marriage, the laws banning it will gradually fall. And in California, we can see changes in the polls, movement toward support of same-sex marriage, as the years go by. Popular opinion in California is certainly different now than it was 8 years ago. And as the subject is discussed more, and people come to have experience with gay couples living ordinary lives together, the attitudes continue to change.",

But the generational schism is pronounced. Those under 45 were less likely to favor a constitutional amendment than their elders and were more supportive of the court's decision to overturn the state's current ban on gay marriage. They also disagreed more strongly than their elders with the notion that gay relationships threatened traditional marriage.\n \n The results of the survey set up an intriguing question for the fall campaign: Will the younger, more live-and-let-live voters mobilized by likely Democratic nominee Barack Obama doom the gay marriage ban? Or will conservatives drawn to the polls by the amendment boost the odds for the presumptive Republican nominee, John McCain?\n \n Either way, the poll suggests the outcome of the proposed amendment is far from certain. Overall, it was leading 54% to 35% among registered voters. But because ballot measures on controversial topics often lose support during the course of a campaign, strategists typically want to start out well above the 50% support level.\n \n \"Although the amendment to reinstate the ban on same-sex marriage is winning by a small majority, this may not bode well for the measure,\" said Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus.\n \n The politically volatile issue leaped into the forefront last week after the court made its judgment in a case that stemmed from San Francisco's unsuccessful effort in 2004 to allow gay marriage in the city. The court's decision, on a 4-3 vote by judges largely appointed by Republican governors, came eight years after Californians overwhelmingly banned gay marriage through a ballot measure, Proposition 22.\n \n The court's verdict threw the issue forward until November, when Californians are expected to be asked to amend the state Constitution to prohibit gay marriage. An affirmative vote on the amendment would reinstate the ban and lead to more litigation over the issue.\n \n Before the court took action, opponents of same-sex marriage already had submitted more than 1 million signatures to the secretary of state's office to put the matter on the November ballot. Secretary of State Debra Bowen has said she will determine its fate by mid-June, but the backers are believed to have collected enough signatures to qualify.\n \n Asking for a delay\n \n Thursday, supporters of the proposed amendment asked the court to place its decision on hold until after the election. Failure to do so \"risks legal havoc and uncertainty,\" lawyers for the Proposition 22 Legal Defense and Education Fund argued, noting that same-sex marriages entered into between now and November would be under a legal cloud if voters approved the ban. Court experts, however, say it is unlikely the justices would agree to such a lengthy delay in implementing their ruling.\n \n Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has vetoed two bills sanctioning gay marriage, has said that he respects the court's decision and that he will not support a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. Californians were split on his stance, with 45% agreeing and 46% disagreeing.\n \n The governor, who in his nearly five years in office has often butted heads with his GOP colleagues, was once again on the opposite side of most in his party: Nearly 7 in 10 Republicans disagreed with his views on the court decision and the amendment.\n \n Becky Espinoza of Kerman, an agricultural town west of Fresno, said that if the amendment made the ballot, she would vote for it. But she acknowledged some ambivalence about the matter coming before voters at all.\n \n \"I just don't believe a man and a man should be married,\" said the 57-year-old Republican. \"How can I put this -- it's just not right. I was brought up very old-fashioned.\"\n \n Even within her own family, however, there are differences of opinion. A younger daughter, she said, feels \"there's nothing wrong with that.\"\n \n \"To kids nowadays, it's like 'Oh well.' Maybe it is 'Oh well.' They see it. We didn't see it. It was one of those in-the-closet things.\"\n \n On the opposite side is Lena Neal of Perris, who said she supported the court's decision and would vote against an amendment. Neal, a Democrat, based her views on the experiences of an elderly family member, who she said was part of a decades-long same-sex partnership. When one of them entered the hospital, she said, the other was not allowed to visit -- that benefit was restricted to family members.\n \n \"It's their right,\" she said of gay marriage. \"They're humans.\"\n \n Indeed, the poll found that views on gay marriage were greatly influenced by personal connections. Of those who said they knew a friend, a family member or a co-worker who was gay, nearly half approved of the court's ruling -- more than twice the proportion among those who said they were not acquainted with a gay person.\n \n The divide was as stark when it came to the proposed constitutional amendment: 70% of voters who said they did not know a gay person would vote for it, a position taken by just 49% of voters who said they knew a gay person.\n \n \n \n * Graphic: Times/KTLA Poll on same-sex marriage\n Graphic: Times/KTLA Poll on same-sex marriage\n * California chief justice says same-sex marriage ruling was one of his toughest\n California chief justice says same-sex marriage ruling was one of his toughest\n \n * May 22, 2008 - Los Angeles Times/KTLA California Supreme Court Decision Survey - Release 1 -Court Decision and Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Relationships\n * L.A. city attorney presses board on gay marriage ceremonies\n * California Supreme Court overturns gay marriage ban\n \n The poll, under Pinkus' direction, interviewed 834 Californians, including 705 registered voters, on Tuesday and Wednesday. The margin of sampling error is 3 percentage points in either direction overall and 4 points for registered voters. Margins were larger for demographic subgroups.\n \n The poll found the state polarized when it came to gay marriage. In most surveys, majority views are somewhat ambivalent -- but on this issue they were sharply drawn. More than 4 in 10 Californians said they strongly disapproved of the court's decision, while almost 3 in 10 strongly approved. Smaller groups described their views as lukewarm.\n \n Generally, the poll found consistency between views on the court decision and the proposed amendment. Overall, Californians opposed the court's view by a 52%-41% gap. The strongest opposition came from Republicans and self-described conservatives. Married respondents, those without college degrees, senior citizens, white evangelical Christians and those in suburban Southern California were also strongly opposed.\n \n Those same groups were also among the strongest backers of the proposed amendment.\n \n Most supportive of the court decision were liberals -- more than 7 in 10 of whom favored the ruling -- Democratic men and Democratic women, whites with college degrees and Bay Area residents.\n \n Majority support -- if barely -- came from the two political groups whose backing generally spells success in California: The state's largest party, Democrats, backed it by a 55%-39% margin, and the fastest-growing political group, independents, supported it 51% to 40%.\n \n Yet support for the ruling did not necessarily lead to opposition to the proposed constitutional amendment, and vice versa. Democrats and independents narrowly backed the amendment despite their support for the court action. Democratic men favored the ruling but were split on the amendment. Democratic women, meanwhile, approved of both the court decision and the amendment.\n \n Effect on the election?\n \n The interaction between the amendment and the presidential election is difficult to divine six months from election day. Among the reasons is that the court put itself at odds with the candidates -- neither Democratic Sens. Hillary Clinton of New York and Obama of Illinois, nor Republican McCain, a senator from Arizona, has backed gay marriage. All have sided instead with civil unions that would ensure benefits for same-sex partners.\n \n For the candidates, the confluence of the gay marriage issue and the presidential election represents risk. For the Democratic nominee, the party's traditional allegiance with the gay community could lead to pressure on the candidate to embrace gay marriage -- perhaps alienating more moderate voters here and elsewhere.\n \n McCain, meanwhile, will be pinched between the party's religious base, which is strongly in favor of the amendment, and the independent voters who generally recoil from social issue battles but whom McCain needs in order to win.\n \n Some leeway\n \n The poll suggested that the candidates may have a little leeway: Only 1 in 4 registered voters said they would vote only for a candidate who agreed with their own position on marriage. Almost 6 in 10 said they could vote for a candidate with whom they disagreed -- suggesting that the issue was far from the top of most voters' agendas.\n \n Responding to a separate question, only 10% of registered voters said that gay marriage was the most important issue facing the state, although more than 5 in 10 voters characterized it as important, just not the most important. Another third of voters said it was not important at all.\n \n Among those who felt it was the most important, more than 6 in 10 were conservatives or those who consider themselves part of the Republican religious base. They were overwhelmingly voting for McCain, the poll found.\n \n But those who felt it was either not important, or not the most important issue facing California, were siding with a Democratic candidate over McCain.\n \n",

   "http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN2740828920080528\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A majority of registered Californian voters oppose changing the constitution of the most populous U.S. state to bar gays from marrying, according to poll released on Wednesday.\n \n The Field Poll survey found 51 percent against approving a possible November ballot measure to prohibit gay marriage, with 43 percent in favor. A slightly differently worded question on the same issue found 54 percent opposed and 40 percent in favor.\n \n The poll follows a state Supreme Court decision this month that barring homosexuals from marrying violated the California Constitution. Opponents of same-sex marriage have intensified efforts to put a state constitutional amendment on the ballot in November.\n \n The poll found a strong generational gap on the issue, with those aged 18-29 approving of gay marriage by 68 percent and those 65 or older disapproving by 55 percent.\n \n The poll found that in recent decades a growing number of Californians have approved allowing same-sex couples to marry, with 51 percent of those polled now approving, up from 44 percent in 2006 and 30 percent in 1985.\n \n The poll of 1,052 registered Californian voters was taken from May 17-26, in the days after California Supreme Court decision, and had a sampling error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points to 5 percentage points, depending on the question.\n",

To hear from a majority of voters you would have to ask everyone in the state and then it would be called \n \n an election. \n \n Not a poll.\n \n It was not specifically mentioned that it was a random sample but that can reliably be inferred in that a sampling error was discussed. Most people know this stuff. If they don't, they refrain from shooting their mouth off. That was pretty dumb, even for you.\n \n The poll was done by The Field Poll, which is independent and non-partisan. The statistical detail are here.  However that website has numbers and stuff and is not written in Elizabethan English so it may be hard for you. \n \n \n For everyone else, it is pretty interesting. For example: \nFor the first time in over three decades of polling on the issue of same-sex marriage laws, The Field Poll finds more California voters approving than disapproving of allowing same-sex couples the right to marry and having regular marriage laws apply to them.\n",

Only a situation where we have \"rights\" that the majority allows.\n True protection of equal rights occurs when the government recognizes a right, EVEN WHEN the majority doesn't.\n Otherwise, the \"protection\" is at the whim of the masses. The \"protection\" comes at a time when \"protection\" IS NOT NEEDED.\n It would be like saying that John \"protects\" a house when others feel the house should be protected, but when a majority want to pillage the house, John lets them walk in and do what they please.\n \n I realize all that was wasted on you Archie.\n You can now continue ranting about things you IMAGINE could be the case, and you spend ABSOLUTELY NO EFFORT in trying to figure out if what you're talking about is really the truth.",

Here's more...\n \n Activist California court overrules voters on gay marriage ban\n  by MICKEY MCLEAN \n May 15, 2008 303 Comments\n In a 4-3 decision today, the California Supreme Court decided to ignore the wishes of the state&#8217;s voters by overturning a ban on gay marriage in the biggest state in the country. According to the Associated Press, one of the three dissenting justices, Marvin Baxter, wrote that he agreed with many arguments of the majority but that the court had overstepped its authority, adding that changes to marriage laws should be decided by the voters. And voters in California may have another chance in November, when a measure that would enshrine laws banning gay marriage in the state constitution could possibly appear on the ballot. The state&#8217;s secretary of state still needs to rule whether the measure&#8217;s sponsors have enough signatures to place the marriage amendment on the ballot. If the amendment comes to a vote and passes, today&#8217;s decision would be voided.http://www.worldontheweb.com/2008/05/15/activist-california-court-overrules-voters-on-gay-marriage-ban/",

   "Absolutely; nevertheless ballot initiatives are indeed an accepted part of our system. And what you point out is exactly one reason they're not so awful a thing as opponents of ballot initiatives seem to think--it's not like their effects are outside the realm of checks and balances.\n\n \n Ballot initiatives are simply a more direct form of democracy. Sometimes they produce excellent legislation, sometimes terrible legislation. That is true of the laws passed by legislatures also.\n \n Here in Ohio we raised the state minimum wage with a ballot initiative, and we banned smoking in restaurants and bars throughout the state with a ballot initiative.\n \n Problems arise when the voters pass a law that denies equal treatment under the law to some citizens. That is what happened in Colorado back in the 1990s with Amendment 2 to the state constitution. This amendment prohibited the state or any local community in the state from passing any non-discrimination legislation based on sexual orientation.

The Supreme Court in Massachusetts has ruled that their state constitution does require that people who seek to marry a partner of the same sex be treated as fully equal under the law. Now California's Supreme Court has said the same thing about their state constitution. \n \n For gay people, equal protection means equal treatment, nothing more and nothing less. Giving gay people equal treatment under the law is really not that hard. All we have to do is eliminate the laws that discriminate against gay people. Doing so harms no one, though it goes against some people's religious beliefs. But discriminating against gay people goes against some other people's religious beliefs.

In a major Canadian center, life expectancy at age twenty for gay and bisexual men is eight to twenty years less than for all men...

To me that is the most important agenda item.\" Debilitating illness, chronic disease, psychological problems, and early death suffered by homosexuals is the legacy of this tragically misguided activism, which puts the furthering of an \"agenda\" above saving the lives of those whose interests they purport to represent.\n \n Those who advocate full acceptance of homosexual behavior choose to downplay the growing and incontrovertible evidence regarding the serious, life-threatening health effects associated with the homosexual lifestyle. Homosexual advocacy groups have a moral duty to disseminate medical information that might dissuade individuals from entering or continuing in an inherently unhealthy and dangerous lifestyle. Education officials in particular have a duty to provide information regarding the negative health effects of homosexuality to students in their charge, whose very lives are put at risk by engaging in such behavior. Above all, civil society itself has an obligation to institute policies that promote the health and well-being of its citizens.\n http://www.endeavourforum.org.au/nov05-10.htm\n \n My position is neither bigoted nor homophobic as I personally have no problem with homosexuals at all. My concerns are based on the larger social issues, as this unnatural practice affects both the individual and the larger community in general.

But they are valid concerns which you wont answer directly but will respond to by attacking both me and my sources, but not the issue being raised.",

That kinda implies that, judging by your moral standards, what they are doing (and who they are) is inferior.\n \n Would you say that you are superior to a murderer?\n \n \n\n And secondly, and more importantly, you do the standard natural approach to the Worldly solution by looking for a way to continue the harmful and destructive sexually promiscuous and dangerous activity while seeking a way to avoid the \"consequences\" of what is destroying us, rather than recognizing that the only way to truly guarantee that these consequences are avoided is by stopping them.\n \n Your lack of an absolute moral compass is the reason that the NATURAL WORLD talks about sex education, safe sex practices, monogamy and birth control to mention just some of your failed solution, in order to avoid the pit falls of sexual promiscuity in all segments of Society. But you know all too well that all of these techniques fail miserably when hormone peaking people are in the throes of sexual ecstasy. And yet you not only continue to lie to yourself, but you're arguing and defending these lies as you try to convince me yet again that they have a prayer of ever working.\n\n Many, many studies have shown that abstinence-based education is faaar less successful at preventing the 'consequences'. I thought you wanted to deal with 'the real world'?\n \n When you say NATURAL WORLD, which definition of 'nature' are you using? Just curious.\n \n \nIf your solutions had a prayer of working, they would have worked decades ago and the very real problems would no longer exist because that's how long your side has been making the same arguments and the problem only gets worse as time goes by.\n\n The problem is getting better, especially when you consider the boom in the size of the gay community. See my link in the post above regarding declining mental health issues in homosexuals.\n \n \nI care about how God will judge America\n\n This is valid, but daft. Is your God so blind that He will doom good people to Hell on the basis that they were (from your point of view) ignorant and swayed by a strong argument? If the people are not ignorant, or the argument is not strong, I would ask you why it is succeeding.\n \n \nWhat I marvel at is that you're all so dishonest that you would dare to even deny what your true agenda is.\nI like that agenda. I don't think anyone else has denied it, either...\n \n \nto the post by Lesz which I responded to that was an attack on ALL christians\n\n \nOdd, isn't it, how the noisiest, most hysterical opposition to equal rights for gay people always comes from the religious extremists, or those who would pander to religious extremism. You rarely, if ever, find rational atheists or religious moderates demanding that anyone should be treated as second class citizens on account of their beliefs.\n\n The post is only an attack on 'ALL christians' if you use your particular definition of 'christian' - ie 'The Fundamentalist Christian Bible Literalist'. Beyond that subgroup, it doesn't attack christianity.\n \n \nWhat's that old saying again, about people who continue to do the same thing, even when it continues to fail?\n\n Like prayer, abstinance-only education or belief in a Young Earth? Whereas treatment and prevention of STDs is constantly increacing...\n \n EDIT: archie posted.\n \n \nThe question I must ask is why do you find sources that approach this issue from the moral and values perspective so offensive and irrelevant? If we abandon morality for the sake of social convenience and sexual promiscuity then what will we be left with? I submit the result will be moral and social chaos.\n\n I don't find it particularly offensive, but I find it irrelevent because you are claiming it as a scientific source. Moral issues have no relevance to science.\n \n \n So I stand by my sources and insist that they don't represent a personal bias against homosexuals, but do represent a definite bias against what the act of homosexuality contributes to Society or the practitioners of it as I have shown above, and which you haven't responded to at all.\n\n \nRegarding the contents of the source:\n Mental health disorders are caused less by homosexuality, and more by mental stress from public disapproval of homosexuality. The increasingly liberal viewpoint of homosexuality has reduced, and is still reducing, cases of mental disorders. source\n \n This takes care of the rest. It's from a website hosted by a gay couple, but note that this is my biased source responding to your biased source.\n \n EDIT: In addition... what foundit said. That any minority (or majority, come to that) is different from any other is not grounds for banning the 'inferior' group. It is grounds for attempting to improve that group.\n\n I'm fairly sure that's responding to the content of the source... it explains mental health issues, casts doubt on the validity and date-relevance of your study, and states something which you yourself are so keen to point out - \"that the consequences are not the main issue\"\n \n \nAll you people can do is attempt to attack my motivation for standing against homosexuality, but you never directly disprove my arguments with anything more than your own shallow opinions.\nYour motivation for standing against homosexuality is purely in the literal interpretation of the bible, just as your motivation for arguing the case of YEC is in the same. \n While these are arguably 'shallow opinions' of your own, you also appear to be ignoring the second half of my post above, which directly adresses the non-opinion-based part of your argument.",

   "False.\n\n \n Prove it!\n \n \nIn your opinion. In the opinion of the scientific community (and anyone with a basic understanding of biology), false.\n\n \n Again, prove it. Talks cheap and that is all you offer. If it's so biologically ridiculous and disproved then prove it with actual evidence.\n \n \nThis is an assault on the homosexual community, not on homosexuality. One happens to have grown up around the other, but that doesn't mean that one is the necessary consequence of the other.\n\n \n How is describing the reality of what happens within the homosexual community an attack on the victims of the lifestyle? And I have already proven what I am claiming and the other gay members know that which is why they aren't asking me to prove it. Being new here, you have a lot of factual catching up to do.\n \n \nFurthermore, most heterosexuals have had more than one partner. There's a difference between 'statistically swopping partners' and being in a 'monogamous relationship'. With regards to 'swopping out of so called exclusive relationships' - this is not a monogamous relationship. Even so, it's lack of safe sex that is the problem, not the presence of sex in the first place.\n\n \n http://media.www.thedmonline.com/media/storage/paper876/news/2008/04/24/Opinion/The-Homosexual.Lifestyle.Is.An.Unhealthy.One-3346523.shtml\n Fact is, I support what I claim, how about you do the same for a change.Views presented on homosexuality are one-sided, and its portrayal as a completely healthy alternative lifestyle is inaccurate. Fact is, being gay is very hazardous to one's health. The movement has an increasingly bad influence upon children. Gay advocacy groups such as the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network blatantly teach sexual practices in their seminars set up for high school teenagers. Teenagers, as in 13 to 19! Groups also distribute questionnaires graphically asking about perceived sexual orientation to children as young as 6 and 7 years old. Don't take my word for it; look it up for yourself.\n \n An Internet search will provide a gracious plenty of scientific articles that find homosexual activity harmful to mind and body. The International Journal of Epidemiology published a report stating that due to the rampant spreading of AIDS within the gay community, a homosexual male's life expectancy is 20 years shorter than that of the average heterosexual.\n \n The Public Health Agency of Canada reported nearly 70 percent of their new HIV cases in males over the age of 15 as of June 2004 to be in homosexuals. These AIDS cases not only shorten lives, but also place a large and avoidable burden on medical services.\n \n A study by the Centers for Disease Control in 2002 found that not only were syphilis cases in Los Angeles, San Francisco and London on the rise, but the majority of these new cases were among homosexual men. As Matt Foreman, Executive Director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, admitted \"HIV is a gay disease.\"\n \n You may ask why these diseases are so prevalent among a group that is 1 to 3 percent of the U.S. population. Polls conducted among gays, published by Bell and Weinberg in 1978, found that a vast majority of longtime homosexuals had many more than 100 lifetime sexual partners. Of that majority, more than 20 percent reported having 1,000 or more sexual partners in their lifetimes.\n So tell me, am I attacking gay people or the gay lifestyle?\n \n \n \nWell, you've repeatedly stated that they are choosing to indulge in an 'unnatural and immoral practice'. That kinda implies that, judging by your moral standards, what they are doing (and who they are) is inferior.\n\n No iangb, that implies they are immoral, and even reprobate in their personal value system, but in no way does it imply they are inferior human beings. How old are you again, that you can't tell the difference?\n \n \n \nWould you say that you are superior to a murderer?\n\n \n Not at all, because according to the bible which I live by, if one even thinks ill of someone, they have murdered them in Gods eyes, so are in need of salvation. So according to my Gods perfect holiness, I too am a murder and in need of the salvation that only comes through Jesus shed blood. Do you see now why we all are in need of salvation no matter how good we think we are?\n \n \nMany, many studies have shown that abstinence-based education is faaar less successful at preventing the 'consequences'. I thought you wanted to deal with 'the real world'?\n\n \n Again you speak complete foolishness. Show me one link that say's that even one person who PRACTICED ABSTINENCE, either contracted ANY STD or ever got PREGNANT. Show me \"JUST ONE TIME \"this method of avoiding STDs or getting pregnant failed!!! I challenge you to produce that evidence.\n \n \nWhen you say NATURAL WORLD, which definition of 'nature' are you using? Just curious.\n\n \n I'm referring to the atheistic/secular humanist Natural Man with no spiritual insight at all. I'm referring to \"you\"\n \n \nThe problem is getting better, especially when you consider the boom in the size of the gay community. See my link in the post above regarding declining mental health issues in homosexuals.\n\n \n Your link above is cr*p. It isn't dealing with anything we are discussing here. Here is the focus of that study, I quote: According to a study conducted at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health among lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations, blacks and Latinos do not have more mental disorders than whites. Based on the theory that stress related to prejudice would increase risk for mental disorders, That has nothing to do with this discussion and does nothing to disprove the obvious negative PHYSICAL HEALTH EFFECTS OF HOMOSEXUALITY.\n \n \nThis is valid, but daft. Is your God so blind that He will doom good people to Hell on the basis that they were (from your point of view) ignorant and swayed by a strong argument? If the people are not ignorant, or the argument is not strong, I would ask you why it is succeeding.\n\n \n First question is, how can it be both valid and daft? Secondly, my God is perfect and holy and the author of life. Are you so blind as to expect Him to bend to your immorality, and accept it as right and good just because you, the creature say's so?\n \n \nThe post is only an attack on 'ALL christians' if you use your particular definition of 'christian' - ie 'The Fundamentalist Christian Bible Literalist'. Beyond that subgroup, it doesn't attack christianity.\n\n \n Sure, you get to make that distinction, but when I attack homosexuality as immoral, you insist I'm attacking all homosexuals.

Cause a homophobic liar like you enjoys the company of other homophobic liars.\n \n \n \nFirst of all, quote where I \"ever\" referred to homosexuals as inferior in any way to anyone else? \n\n Don't get stupid.\n Here's another simple question you'll avoid...\n Are homosexuals superior to, equal to, or inferior to heterosexuals?\n Is gay sex the same as, superior to, or inferior to straight sex?\n Is a gay person just as good of a parent as a straight person?\n \n I don't know why you insist on such obfuscation when I don't think there is anybody on this board who has any doubts about YOUR PERSONAL position on the matter.\n \n \n \nAnd secondly, and more importantly, you do the standard natural approach to the Worldly solution by looking for a way to continue the harmful and destructive sexually promiscuous and dangerous activity while seeking a way to avoid the \"consequences\" of what is destroying us, rather than recognizing that the only way to truly guarantee that these consequences are avoided is by stopping them. \n\n emoticon_rolleyes \n Archie, first of all take the word \"promiscuous\" out of there. Cause if you actually gave a damn about the truth, you would know I don't support promiscuity.\n \n Secondly, gay sex is not \"harmful and destructive\". The only way it is \"dangerous\" is when the people involved are promiscuous, unprotected, and/or infected.\n Sex between two gay monogamous men is NOT \"harmful\", \"destructive\", or \"dangerous\".\n \n We could also talk about why you would think it is, but again I know only one of us (not you) would be having an honest discussion.\n \n \n \nYour lack of an absolute moral compass is the reason that the NATURAL WORLD talks about sex education, safe sex practices, monogamy and birth control to mention just some of your failed solution, in order to avoid the pit falls of sexual promiscuity in all segments of Society.\n\n 1) Don't use the word \"natural\".\n You don't know what it means.\n When you tried to give a definition for \"natural\", you proved your OWN CLAIMS as to the meaning of the word wrong.\n 2) Those solutions are not \"failed\".\n What IS failed is ABSTINENCE when the studies PROVE that \"abstinent\" people are just as likely to get an STD.\n And MORE likely to engage in \"oral\" or \"anal\" sex.\n \n As is often the case, you proclaim \"fact\" off of your OPINION.\n You declare things to be a certain way, just because that is the way they have to be in order for your opinion to make logical sense.\n \n \n \nBut you know all too well that all of these techniques fail miserably when hormone peaking people are in the throes of sexual ecstasy.\n\n Keeping them ignorant and telling them to just say \"no\" is such a marvelously superior option, isn't it... emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \nNO foundit, I have no personal stake at all in homosexuality or how you live within your community.\n\n So you're starting to obfuscate.\n A KKK member has no real \"personal stake at all in race, or how they live\", but he is a bigot nonetheless.\n Likewise, despite all your complaints, it seems that EVERYBODY, including the people who don't support gay equality, recognizes you as a bigot.\n \n \n \nMy interest is in protecting how your very small minority forces itself on my larger community.\n\n This is proven a lie by this very thread.\n Suppose gays were to die out 10 years younger.\n How is that anything \"forced\" upon you, or a larger community?\n How is OUR sex, in the privacy of our own homes, \"forced\" upon you or a larger community?\n \n I can understand how you could TRY to make that claim about the government recognizing gay marriage, but you routinely go WELL BEYOND that into UNDOUBTABLE actions and prejudice against gay.\n \n \n \nI care about how God will judge America as your community eventually forces yourself into being accepted as right and normal just as I showed that your own activist let slip; here it is again: homosexual author Urvashi Vaid expressed one of the goals of her fellow activists: \"We have an agenda to create a society in which homosexuality is regarded as healthy, natural, and normal.

Being new here, you have a lot of factual catching up to do.\nIt's amazing how people are already disagreeing with you on this point. The 'lifestyle' you are so keen to link to homosexuality is, for the main point, a myth. And even if this was not the case, condemning the lifestyle does not in any way affect the validity of the sexuality.\n \n \nFact is, I support what I claim, how about you do the same for a change.\nLook at the page title for your link, archie. \"The homosexual lifestyle is an unhealthy one - opinion\". The surveys cited in your article have been destroyed by the other forumers, I won't repeat their words.\n \n \nNo iangb, that implies they are immoral, and even reprobate in their personal value system, but in no way does it imply they are inferior human beings. How old are you again, that you can't tell the difference?\n\n Does morality not matter to superiority? I wouldn't say so, but I deny the existence of moral absolutes. It's amazing how many times you've used moral grounds to reason that Christianity is superior to atheism....\n \n \nNot at all, because according to the bible which I live by, if one even thinks ill of someone, they have murdered them in Gods eyes, so are in need of salvation. So according to my Gods perfect holiness, I too am a murder and in need of the salvation that only comes through Jesus shed blood. Do you see now why we all are in need of salvation no matter how good we think we are?\nWhat is creepy is having to feel like I need a shower after having spent a few hours on this forum with you. But it happens every time.\n\n ...but you have no issues with declaring how you think ill of other debaters? Not much more to say, here.\n \n \nAgain you speak complete foolishness. Show me one link that say's that even one person who PRACTICED ABSTINENCE, either contracted ANY STD or ever got PREGNANT. Show me \"JUST ONE TIME \"this method of avoiding STDs or getting pregnant failed!!! I challenge you to produce that evidence.\n\n The Virgin Mary? [/badjoke]\n In all seriousness, you are deliberately misinterpreting what I say. I'm talking about the successfulness of abstinence-only sex education, not abstinence in itself. Nonetheless, this shows that an increase in abstinence pledges led to an increase in oral sex (where STDs can be spread). The link also shows that in some places abstinence education led to a rise in pregnancy.\n See also here.\n \n \nYour link above is cr*p. It isn't dealing with anything we are discussing here. Here is the focus of that study, I quote: According to a study conducted at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health among lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations, blacks and Latinos do not have more mental disorders than whites. Based on the theory that stress related to prejudice would increase risk for mental disorders, That has nothing to do with this discussion and does nothing to disprove the obvious negative PHYSICAL HEALTH EFFECTS OF HOMOSEXUALITY.\n\n Your reading skills are cr*p. It is dealing with subjects we are dealing with here: specifically mental health issues, as I stated (and you quoted). The relevant passage is this, as you can't seem to find it yourself: \"The study also found that, across all race/ethnic groups, younger cohorts of lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals (those in age groups 18 - 29 and 30 - 44 as compared with 45 - 59 years old) had lower prevalence of almost all mental disorders categories, and the difference was statistically significant for mood disorders. Younger cohorts also had fewer serious suicide attempts than did older cohorts (but this was statistically significant only for the middle cohort).\n \n \"The finding regarding younger cohorts of lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals is consistent with social stress theories that predicted that the liberalization of social attitudes toward homosexuality over the past few decades can lead to a decline in stress and related mental disorders and suicide among lesbians, gay men, and bisexual individuals\" said Dr. Meyer..\n \n I addressed the physical effec... sorry, PHYSICAL EFFECTS OF HOMOSEXUALITY in the link directly below that one. You have ignored it entirely, however.\n \n \nFirst question is, how can it be both valid and daft? Secondly, my God is perfect and holy and the author of life. Are you so blind as to expect Him to bend to your immorality, and accept it as right and good just because you, the creature say's so?\nIt's valid to worry about how God will judge America. It's daft for reasons I outlined in the post.\n Secondly, are you so blind that you believe your 'all-loving' God will condemn people to hell simply for the crime of not knowing any better? This is more of a separate issue, but I may go into it elsewhere.\n \n \nSure, you get to make that distinction, but when I attack homosexuality as immoral, you insist I'm attacking all homosexuals. Nice double standard...\nWell, if you were attacking 'only those homosexuals who lead promiscuous lifestyles with many partners' then the double standard would be valid, but you aren't. You are attacking all (practicing) homosexuals. The other post was not attacking all (practicing) Christians, just the right-wing extremists. No double standards.\n \n \nSo it isn't that gay men have different fluids than straight men, it's just that straight men don't mix them.\n\n Straight-up false\n \"in absolute numbers, it is hypothesized that more heterosexual couples have anal sex than homosexual couples\"",

   "This whole argument about the alleged \"promiscuity\" of some gay men is irrelevant to the issue of equal marriage rights. It's just slander against gay men, generalized broadly to include all gay people, roughly half of whom are women. \n \n People used to make similar arguments about the alleged \"promiscuity\" of African Americans and immigrants who were widely regarded by native-born white Americans as undesirable. Using slander to argue against equal treatment under the law is nothing new. Americans 100 years ago commonly argued that immigrants should not receive equal treatment under the law because they were allegedly morally inferior to native-born white Americans.\n\n \n Of course Op, I'm just making all this stuff up in order to demonize homosexuals. I secretly created all of those web sites just to use them as ammo against you. Anyone who speaks against homosexuality and actually has the nerve to point to the blatant promiscuity within the culture must be motivated by homophobia and bigotry. It's all just a big conspiracy against the most persecuted class of people since the Jews. [END SARCASM:]\n \n \nYou are attacking gay people. There is no such thing as \"the gay lifestyle.\" I am gay. What \"lifestyle\" do you imagine I live? You don't know anything about my \"lifestyle,\" do you? \n \n You are attacking gay people, while pretending to attack an imaginary \"lifestyle.\" But an attack on people is just an attack on people. The emperor has no clothes. You are naked. Your prejudice is showing.\n\n \n The lifestyle I'm talking about is the same lifestyle I have pointed out to you in every debate I've ever participated in here. And that is your justification and defense of same gender sex which is an unnatural use of the human body. \n \n And only gay people could be so blind to the obvious; that they will deny how harmful same gender sex is to their spiritual and physical well being. You all choose to believe that I debate against homosexuality because of some imaginary hatred you perceive me to have for gays. But I didn't create the mortality statistics for gay men, neither did I make up the links that showed the promiscuity that takes place in that community, or the articles that say how gays refuse to use protection against disease no matter what warnings they receive?\n \n But like ostriches, you so called self confessed \"normal lifestyle gays\" will bury your heads in the sand as you attack me as a hater for stating the obvious. Can you see why I reject your defense when you claim to be just like me? I don't deny the sins that take place in my community, nor do I excuse them. Nudist colonies, swingers clubs, straight porn; now, even adolescent sex parties where girls wear colored bracelets describing the sex acts they performed on boys without using protection against pregnancy or STDs in many cases. Adultery and fornication is rampant today. Straight men and women experiment with homosexuality which perpetuates the spread of STD cross contamination from one community to the other. I understand all of this is a reality in today's America. \n \n Great, now let's talk about how to fix the problems. And while we're at it, let's put the cards on the table regarding your community too. So stop trying to crucify the messenger and thank me for openly discussing issues that your community is all too quick to ignore, bury and remain in denial over. Just as I'm all too willing to discuss the sins within my community.\n \n And since we're on a roll here, tell me why we should change the complete tradition of marriage for straight people and protecting the Traditional Nuclear Family when all of the statistics I have been seeing for the number of gays is between 1 and 4% of the population?",

You're in such denial, that 28 years of medical understanding of this disease is wasted on you. \n [PAGE 13] How is HIV transmitted? \n HIV is primarily transmitted through unprotected sex, including vaginal, anal and oral sex. Certain bodily \n fluids including blood, semen, vaginal secretions and breast milk spread HIV. The virus can also be \n transmitted through contaminated needles, which can happen when infected drug users share needles. \n An HIV-infected woman can pass the virus to her baby during pregnancy or breast-feeding. HIV is also \n transmitted through contaminated, unscreened blood supplies. \n Did you notice foundit, that nowhere does it say one must have multiple partners in order to contract the disease?\n How is HIV not transmitted? \n HIV is not an easy virus to pass from one person to another. The virus does not survive well outside the body. \n So, it cannot be transmitted through casual or everyday contact such as shaking hands or hugging. Sweat, \n tears, vomit, feces and urine do contain small amounts of HIV, but they have not been reported to transmit \n the disease. Mosquitoes and other insects do not transmit HIV.\n \n How can HIV transmission be prevented? \n The surest way to avoid transmission is to avoid identified high-risk behaviors. If that is not done, various \n health organizations have determined that; latex condoms can significantly reduce the risk of transmission; \n that pregnant women who are HIV-positive can reduce transmission to their children through HIV/AIDS \n antiretroviral treatment; and that intravenous drug users should not share needles, but may turn in used \n needles for new ones at established needle exchange programs. \n \n Now, regarding the first paragraph about how it's transmitted. That right there proves I'm right about my assertion that bodily fluids are the carriers of the virus and the vehicles by which it is passed from one person to another. But if you look at the next paragraph at the highlited sentence, it admits that feces also has been shown to carry the virus but that it hasn't been shown to transmit the disease. Now I ask you as a reasonable person, how can someone bet their life on that statement when it is admitted that the virus is found in urine and feces? \n \n The fact that this organization would even make such a claim seems to be the most irresponsible statement they could make considering that they know that anal sex is a very real practice in the gay and straight community, and that the virus has been found in human feces. It's like saying we want to warn you, but don't stop having the most dangerous kind of sex you can possibly have. \n \n Also, click on the link to this site, go to page 10 and read point 63, and page 11 to point 72. Also, go to page 14 and read \"What is the link between HIV and STDs\". It's the second paragraph down.\n \n http://www.kff.org/hivaids/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/getfile.cfm&PageID=41786\n \n As to the rest of your tirade that was just so much more hate speech; it wasn't even worth responding to, or defending against. \n \n And I just noticed moose piped in. So I stand by the evidence I'm submitting to foundit moose, you can deny reality all you like. But the first paragraph clearly states that anal sex is a contributing factor. To also admit that the virus is found in feces but then claim it has never been REPORTED to transmit, just shows how big a word reported is, in that it means nothing in reality. And what do you mean by non intact tissue in your statement in the post above this one? What non intact tissue are you referring to?\n \n I mean, what is it about anal sex that contributes to HIV? Is it the simple sex act? Or the mixing of the biological fluids! Obviously it's the fluids in combination with open sores or lesions. It doesn't take a genius to deduce the obvious connection.",

Both of us STD free.\n What are our chances of dying from AIDS?\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=312315&postcount=256\n \n Now Archie is trying to defend his idiotic pretense that AIDS can be sexually transmitted in this relationship by LYING about what was previously said.\n \n He is about to do this on multiple fronts.\n 1) He is going to ignore the fact that I explicitly pointed out both were STD free.\n 2) He is going to LIE and pretend that the point has been a pretense that the disease cannot be transmitted by bodily fluids.\n \n So let's move on, and actually see how WHAT HE QUOTES proves me right...\n \n \n \nDid you notice foundit, that nowhere does it say one must have multiple partners in order to contract the disease?\n\n There he goes...\n He ignores the fact that I specified BOTH monogamy AND STD free.\n I have never even hinted that a monogamous couple, with one of the partners infected, cannot transmit the virus.\n The point has ALWAYS been BOTH monogamous AND STD free.\n \n HIV is not an easy virus to pass from one person to another. The virus does not survive well outside the body. You'll note here that the article EXPLICITLY specifies virus PASSING FROM ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER.\n To point out the obvious to Archie, ONE of the people has to have ALREADY BEEN INFECTED.\n \n \n \nNow, regarding the first paragraph about how it's transmitted. That right there proves I'm right about my assertion that bodily fluids are the carriers of the virus and the vehicles by which it is passed from one person to another.\n\n And here is the second part of the lie.\n NOBODY WAS EVER REFUTING this.\n The part that you idiotically made up, Archie, was that a MONOGAMOUS and STD FREE couple was at risk for contracting HIV in their gay sexual encounters.\n \n THAT was the part you made up.\n \n \n \nThe fact that this organization would even make such a claim seems to be the most irresponsible statement they could make considering that they know that anal sex is a very real practice in the gay and straight community, and that the virus has been found in human feces.\n\n And does this equate to a THIRD lie on Archie's part?\n WHAT organization was supposedly making an \"irresponsible statement\"????\n \n Of course, that's another question Archie will probably never HONESTLY answer...\n \n \n \nIt's like saying we want to warn you, but don't stop having the most dangerous kind of sex you can possibly have. \n\n Archie, as it has been pointed out REPEATEDLY, the key is sex with an INFECTED person.\n Two gay men, monogamous and STD free, can have ALL the gay sex they want and they will NEVER CONTRACT THE DISEASE.\n \n So it is incredibly DISHONEST of you to label the gay sex as \"risky\" when that is NOT the risk aspect.\n \n To demonstrate his stupidity even further, take a heterosexual couple.\n By the description Archie quotes, using HIS logic and HIS article, isn't STRAIGHT sex \"risky\"?\n \n In fact, if you look at the GLOBAL picture, the vast majority of per capita STD transmissions occur HETEROSEXUALLY.\n \n \n \nAs to the rest of your tirade that was just so much more hate speech; it wasn't even worth responding to, or defending against. \n\n In other words, the questions I have asked are going to be ignored by the village LIAR...\n In his response, I see he is not even trying to pretend that he is not just against the \"lifestyle\".\n Probably cause he realized he had no HONEST answer to this challenge: HOW is the \"lifestyle\" different from BEING gay?????\n \n \n \nAnd I just noticed moose piped in. So I stand by the evidence I'm submitting to foundit moose, you can deny reality all you like. But the first paragraph clearly states that anal sex is a contributing factor.\n\n Archie, SEX PERIOD is a contributing factor.\n The virus is also found in the SPERM that a man deposits in a woman during sexual intercourse.\n If you REALLY wanted to get into the methods of \"transmitting\" the disease, the disease is usually transmitted from the person LEAVING the semen in another person.\n The person \"inserting\" actually has a LOWER chance of catching it, and that includes \"rectally\".\n \n \n \nTo also admit that the virus is found in feces but then claim it has never been REPORTED to transmit, just shows how big a word reported is, in that it means nothing in reality. And what do you mean by non intact tissue in your statement in the post above this one? What non intact tissue are you referring to?\n\n Probably referring to the fact that the virus is not easily transmittable \"through\" the skin.\n That includes the skin of the penise.\n \n \n \nI mean, what is it about anal sex that contributes to HIV? Is it the simple sex act? Or the mixing of the biological fluids! Obviously it's the fluids in combination with open sores or lesions. It doesn't take a genius to deduce the obvious connection.\n\n The real point of this (as I reminded above) was that I initially pointed out that two people, monogamous and STD free, CANNOT transmit the disease between them.\n Archie demurred. And when it was pointed out that his pretense was making stupid stuff up, he has LIED about what the real point of all this is.\n \n If only this weren't typical, daily behavior for him...",

   "Sure I am making it up in your opinion foundit, but only because you refuse to accept the obvious. You're in such denial, that 28 years of medical understanding of this disease is wasted on you. \n \n [PAGE 13] How is HIV transmitted? \n HIV is primarily transmitted through unprotected sex, including vaginal, anal and oral sex. Certain bodily \n fluids including blood, semen, vaginal secretions and breast milk spread HIV. The virus can also be \n transmitted through contaminated needles, which can happen when infected drug users share needles. \n An HIV-infected woman can pass the virus to her baby during pregnancy or breast-feeding. HIV is also \n transmitted through contaminated, unscreened blood supplies.\n \n Did you notice foundit, that nowhere does it say one must have multiple partners in order to contract the disease?\n \n How is HIV not transmitted? \n HIV is not an easy virus to pass from one person to another. The virus does not survive well outside the body. \n So, it cannot be transmitted through casual or everyday contact such as shaking hands or hugging. Sweat, \n tears, vomit, feces and urine do contain small amounts of HIV, but they have not been reported to transmit \n the disease. Mosquitoes and other insects do not transmit HIV.\n \n How can HIV transmission be prevented? \n The surest way to avoid transmission is to avoid identified high-risk behaviors. If that is not done, various \n health organizations have determined that; latex condoms can significantly reduce the risk of transmission; \n that pregnant women who are HIV-positive can reduce transmission to their children through HIV/AIDS \n antiretroviral treatment; and that intravenous drug users should not share needles, but may turn in used \n needles for new ones at established needle exchange programs. \n\n Archie, please take careful note of the words I have enboldened in your quote.\n \n Can you see that to transmit or pass on the virus a person must already have said virus? It is not propogated if two (or even several) naughty, but uninfected people, do the wild thing.\n \n Can you please stop this nonsense about HIV being 'created' if homosexuals sleep together? It just doesn't happen, plain and simple.\n \n Smiley",

   "Archangel, you are completely ignoring both my (and others') posts and the most basic principles of biology - that 'nothing can come from nothing'. To quote myself from a post which you have completely ignored:\n \nNothing can come from nothing. The only thing that can harm you in anal sex, just as with any other form of sex, is that which is already there. AIDS is caused by the HIV virus, and to expect that virus to spontaneously appear because someone is having sex is a ridiculous statement to make.\n \n There is a slight chance of bacterial infection around the urethra or (for specifically male-to-female anal sex, which is also quite common) vagina. This is simply avoided, however, by basic hygiene. Beyond that, the only thing you have to worry about is transmission of bacterial infections or other STDs that are already present. Source Source \n\n Foundit66 takes care of the rest.\n \n \n To summarise:\n The link between anal sex and the spread of HIV and other STDs is a relevant one. However...\n 1) Anal sex is not exclusive to homosexuals. Lesbians do not participate in anal sex, and straight couples do participate in anal sex - in absolute numbers, it is hypothesized that more heterosexual couples have anal sex than homosexual couples\n \n 2) Anal sex only spreads STDs if one of the couple participating is infected with the relevant STD. Without the presence of the virus, it cannot be spread. Mild bacterial infections can be caused by fecal matter interacting with inappropriate orifices, but this can be nullified by basic hygiene - without such hygiene you are going to have a bunch of problems anyway.\n \n 3) Use of condoms greatly reduces the chance of spreading STDs\n \n 4) Oral or vaginal sex can equally cause a STD to be spread\n \n To summarise the summary: anal sex is only bad (with respect to spread of STDs) if it is unprotected and with an infected partner. The heterosexual community is equally as 'bad' as the homosexual community in participating in anal sex, and both communities equally participate in other forms of sex which can spread STDs.\n \n *********\n \n So, your aim is to prevent the spread of STDs. Do you \n \n a) condemn homosexuality? \n b) condemn anal sex?\n c) condemn unprotected promiscuity?\n \n You're doing a). Doing c) is the best course of action, and even then only if you do something about it. With regards to doing something about it: Abstinence-only sex education has been shown not to work. Comprehensive sex education stands a much better chance of preventing both the spread of STDs and of unwanted pregnancies.",

And what is so disturbing is that the opposition will ignore the fact that this command was first spoken of in Genesis, then repeated by Jesus in the New Testament. It is a spiritual law that God takes very seriously in that He repeated it as valid for both Ages.\n \n Gen 2:24 Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.\n \n Mat 19:5 and said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'?\n \n Mar 10:8 and the two shall become one flesh'; so then they are no longer two, but one flesh.\n \n2) I can't help but think I am not the only one disturbed by some people's objection to the ideals of \"equal treatment\".\n It should be accepted as an American ideal.\n Yet some people describe it's first use as a \"sad day\".\n \n\n \n No one on the Right that I know of opposes the principles of equal rights for all people, Me included. Are you suggesting that gays are owned by other people as slaves were? Are they classified as subhuman for the legal sake of forcing them into forced servitude? Are they required to eat, bathe, drink water, live and get educated in segregated conditions? I think not. In fact, are they even prevented from marrying in the same manner that straight people are allowed? Not at all. So how can you claim gays are treated unequally by comparing your agenda to that of the black race? Of all the distinctions in nature from which morality can be inferred, nothing is more profound than the differences between male and female, which runs not only for human nature but through all nature.\n \n The word nature in Greek, refers to living things. The principle of life, in virtue of which a species perpetuates itself, is the distinction between male and female. If we look at this distinction as it occurs in the human species, we can see the principle of self-preservation at work. So when all is said and done, your claim that you don't have equal rights is in fact specious as it is \"special rights\" that you are seeking. Homosexuals are not treated unequally when compared to any other class of human being, at least in the USA. The one word and concept that your side attempts to erase from the debate as you refocus it on equality, is morality. That issue must never be considered or even breached in order for your side to prevail.\n \n \n \nAnd if we had left racism up to the Southern state courts, we would still have Jim Crow laws, blacks at the back of the bus, segregation, ... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n Again, it is a perversion of equal rights to compare your situation with that of blacks who were treated as subhuman animals who held no rights at all as equals, even though they are human beings just as whites are. You insult the cause of human equality by comparing your cause to what the blacks suffered under slavery.

   "The bible doesn't speak in the negative regarding gay marriage...\n\n Archie, my ACTUAL point went whizzing way over your head...\n I was saying that I found the two arguments comparably poor.\n \n \n \nNo one on the Right that I know of opposes the principles of equal rights for all people, Me included.\n\n Go back and re-read what Steeeeve is saying regarding \"equal treatment\"...\n Then get back to me.\n \n \n \nAre you suggesting that ...\n\n And thus begins an onslaught of mindless drivel I never even hinted at...\n \n \n \nSo how can you claim gays are treated unequally by comparing your agenda to that of the black race?\n\n Archie, do you REALLY think that the reasons blacks got equality is because they went through all that junk?\n No.\n The fundamental reason for their equality is not that they suffered so much, but rather that there is no intelligent reason to deny them equality.\n \n Furthermore, gays ARE treated unequally.\n If you think otherwise, explicitly say so and I'll be happy to point out how YOU ENDORSE gays being treated unequally.\n \n \n \nOf all the distinctions in nature from which morality can be inferred, nothing is more profound than the differences between male and female, which runs not only for human nature but through all nature.\n\n And yet we treat the genders EQUALLY under the law.\n Kind of puts a big hole in your argument...\n \n \n \nThe word nature in Greek, refers to living things.\n\n Yadda, yadda, yadda.\n And homosexuality is observed through NUMEROUS species of \"living things\".\n Homosexuality IS natural.\n Get over it.\n \n \n \nSo when all is said and done, your claim that you don't have equal rights is in fact specious as it is \"special rights\" that you are seeking.\n\n I am eternally amused at the propensity to pretend that \"rephrasing\" it somehow proves the original claim false.\n Like Jack saying \"The house is red\", and John saying \"The house is maroon\".\n Using a different word doesn't mean that gays are treated \"equally\". The fact that you have to TRY to resort to simply using a different word, INCAPABLE of proving us \"equal\", demonstrates something...\n \n Can gays serve in the military? Answer is no. (And before you reference DADT, you should know that does not prevent a gay person who does not \"tell\" from being booted.)\n Can gays adopt in all 50 states? Answer is no.\n Can gays marry their partner like straights can? Answer is no.\n \n You call these \"special rights\", and that is a propagandic tool.\n But the TRUTH of the matter is that we do NOT have equality, and if we DID have equality you could take those issues and claim that there was NO DIFFERENCE.\n But we both know the truth, even if you can't speak it...\n \n \n \nHomosexuals are not treated unequally when compared to any other class of human being, at least in the USA.\n\n How you can say something so obviously false is beyond me.\n So gays and straights have IDENTICAL adoption capabilities in all 50 states?\n Gays can serve in the military EXACTLY like straights can?\n \n You deceive only yourself.\n \n \n \nThe one word and concept that your side attempts to erase from the debate as you refocus it on equality, is morality. That issue must never be considered or even breached in order for your side to prevail.\n\n I have no problem discussing \"morality\" with most people.\n With somebody like you who can't be troubled with the \"morality\" of TRUTH, it's a wasted effort.\n \n Tell me Archie. If I opened another thread to explore how two gay, monogamous, STD-free men can pass the disease between them, would you be able to address the issue?\n Or could I count on cowardice or lies?\n \n \n \nAgain, it is a perversion of equal rights to compare your situation with that of blacks who were treated as subhuman animals who held no rights at all as equals, even though they are human beings just as whites are.\n\n It is preposterous to pretend that the extremes of bigotry placed on blacks somehow means the comparison is invalid.\n The UNDERLYING REASONS WHY the prejudice was stopped are still there.\n Those REASONS are not affected by the depths of injustice blacks faced.\n \n \n \nYou insult the cause of human equality by comparing your cause to what the blacks suffered under slavery.\n\n Archie lie # ....\n (I lost track...)\n I never mentioned slavery.\n I never made the comparison he claims.\n \n \n \nAnd even after slavery ended, whites in the South had a culture of oppression against blacks as they still looked at them as inferior. That was a culture of inequality which doesn't even compare to what the modern homosexual claims is their burden as it led to the oppressive living conditions mentioned above. None of which the gay community faces in America today.\n\n \"today\" is an interesting distinction.\n Cause truth be told, GAYS face MORE legalized discrimination \"today\" than blacks do.\n \n The reason you specify \"today\" is because gays HAVE made huge strides in oppression.\n In a lot of states it is \"today\" illegal to fire a gay person just because they are gay, but \"before\" being outed as gay was almost a guarantee of losing your job.\n \"Today\" homosexuality is viewed as not a mental illness according to the consensus of health professionals. In decades before, LOBOTOMIES and ELECTRO-SHOCK treatment were accepted treatments of homosexuality.\n \n In previous years, it was \"illegal\" to serve a homosexual a drink in some areas. An effort explicitly used to try and prevent \"gay bars\" from existing.\n \"Today\", those laws have been revoked.\n \n The reason you focus on \"today\" is because you know that gays HAVE come a long way. We have more items on the \"win\" column than we have on the \"loss\" column.\n But that doesn't mean there wasn't a day when the only thing we had was the \"loss\" column...\n \n \n \nYou are absolutely right that the younger generation is being dumbed down so as not to recognize the true reasons why your demands are distortions of the truth and not valid arguments for what you're seeking.

You often readily reveal yourself as a raving lunatic.\n \n There is NOTHING keeping this discussion from \"morality\", other than the fact that you can't figure out \"morality\" unless you're told it by a book thousands of years old that JUSTIFIED slavery, genocide, and misogyny.\n The younger generation is not \"dumbed down\" on this issue.\n They are just smart enough to see through you...",

   "I don't now, nor have I ever opposed equal rights. I oppose special rights of an unnatural lifestyle that is both destructive for Society and its practitioners.\n \n Reduced Life Span\n A study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology on the mortality rates of homosexuals concluded that they have a significantly reduced life expectancy. In a major Canadian center, life expectancy at age twenty for gay and bisexual men is eight to twenty years less than for all men... Under even the most liberal assumptions, gay and bisexual men in this urban center are now experiencing a life expectancy similar to that experienced by all men in Canada in the year 1871.\n \n In 1995, long after the deadly effects of AIDS and other STDs became widely known, homosexual author Urvashi Vaid expressed one of the goals of her fellow activists: \"We have an agenda to create a society in which homosexuality is regarded as healthy, natural, and normal. To me that is the most important agenda item.\" Debilitating illness, chronic disease, psychological problems, and early death suffered by homosexuals is the legacy of this tragically misguided activism, which puts the furthering of an \"agenda\" above saving the lives of those whose interests they purport to represent.\n \n Those who advocate full acceptance of homosexual behavior choose to downplay the growing and incontrovertible evidence regarding the serious, life-threatening health effects associated with the homosexual lifestyle. Homosexual advocacy groups have a moral duty to disseminate medical information that might dissuade individuals from entering or continuing in an inherently unhealthy and dangerous lifestyle. Education officials in particular have a duty to provide information regarding the negative health effects of homosexuality to students in their charge, whose very lives are put at risk by engaging in such behavior. Above all, civil society itself has an obligation to institute policies that promote the health and well-being of its citizens.\n http://www.endeavourforum.org.au/nov05-10.htm\n \n My position is neither bigoted nor homophobic as I personally have no problem with homosexuals at all. My concerns are based on the larger social issues, as this unnatural practice affects both the individual and the larger community in general. This link describes many valid concerns that your side doesn't want us to even look at. But they are valid concerns which you wont answer directly but will respond to by attacking both me and my sources, but not the issue being raised.\n\n \n Yeah, more right-wing anti-gay misrepresentations of studies. Hardly surprising.\n \n The authors here, point out their sample was limited, and not meant to be applied to gay men in general(caps are mine):\n \n \"If estimates of an individual gay and bisexual man's risk of death is truly needed for legal or other purposes, then people making these estimates should use the same ACTUARIAL tables that are used for all other males in that population.\"\n http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/6/1499\n \n Oh yes, of course more ignorance about how AIDS, being a virus must know if you are gay or straight.

   "It seems that this issue is moot until decided at the November election since the new ballot initiative allowing the people of Cali to choose for themselves whether to allow, or ban gay marriage in the California Constitution has been approved. If the majority of Californians truly have evolved to accept gay marriage in the last 8 years, then then the election this November will show it. Here's the article... http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_9459707\n CALIFORNIA MARRIAGE AMENDMENT QUALIFIES FOR NOVEMBER BALLOT &#8211; THE PEOPLE WILL DECIDE (6/2/08)\n 6/6/2008\n California Marriage Amendment Qualifies for November Ballot &#8211; The People Will Decide (6/2/08)\n Secretary of State Debra Bowen today certified the eighth initiative for the November 4, 2008, General Election ballot. The measure would amend California&#8217;s Constitution to define marriage as a union &#8220;between a man and a woman.&#8221;\n \n &#8220;The response from the people of this state has been unprecedented in support of marriage&#8217;s legacy, by responding with an all-out volunteer signature campaign,&#8221; said Ron Prentice, CEO of the California Family Council and Chairman of the ProtectMarriage.com coalition sponsoring the amendment. &#8220;We&#8217;re so grateful to the over 1.1 million voters who signed the marriage petition in time for the November election. Passing this amendment is the only way for the people to override the four supreme court judges who want to re-define marriage for our entire society.&#8221;\n \n In order to qualify for the ballot, the marriage definition measure needed 694,354 valid petition signatures, which is equal to 8% of the total votes cast for governor in the November 2006 General Election. The initiative proponents submitted 1,120,801 signatures in an attempt to qualify the measure, and it qualified through the random sample signature check.\n \n &#8220;The vast majority of research continues to state that California&#8217;s voters favor keeping marriage as it is, protecting its historic definition between only a man and a woman. The November ballot will give opportunity for citizens to respond to the State Supreme Court&#8217;s decision, by solidifying traditional marriage in the California Constitution. Californians are a tolerant people. But we also know that marriage is between a man and a woman, as the voters reaffirmed just a few years ago.&#8221; stated Prentice.http://www.protectmarriage.com/newsdetail.php?newsId=314",

   "I can't decide what I'd rather have: the prop to fail miserably, or the prop to pass so that someone takes it to the SCOTUS. I don't think that even the Fourth Reich will uphold it.\n\n \n If the voters of California were to amend their constitution to ban same-sex marriage, on what basis would it go to the U.S. Supreme Court? Plenty of other states have amended their constitutions to ban same-sex marriage, and these state constitutional changes have not been challenged before the U.S. Supreme Court. Voters in my state of Ohio amended our state constitution to ban same-sex marriage, and this has not gone to the U.S. Supreme Court. \n \n I think it would be a big mistake to try to take the issue of same-sex marriage to the U.S. Supreme Court at this time. I think the U.S. Supreme Court is unlikely to rule at this point that same-sex marriage is a fundamental right protected by the U.S. constitution. I think it is and should be regarded as a fundamental right, but the Supreme Court is pretty far to the right at this point. \n \n To my mind, the best course is to work to defeat the proposed constitutional amendment in California. If the forces of equality and justice succeed in that, the people calling for inequality under the law for gay people will find it harder to keep whining about \"the will of the people,\" just as in Massachusetts, where the people and the legislature refused to amend that state's constitution. If the people of California vote not to amend their constitution to deny gay people equal marriage rights, then we will have achieved an even more significant victory than having that state's supreme court rule in favor of equality. \n \n Btw, it's not true that in their ruling, the justices have thwarted or undermined \"the will of the people.\" The justices simply did their job of reviewing the constitutionality of state laws. They ruled, as they are supposed to, on whether the law passed by voters several years ago conflicted with the state constitution, which is itself a reflection of the will of the people. They ruled that the law banning same-sex marriage conflicted with the constitution, which is the ultimate will of the people of California. \n \n This is similar to what the supreme court of Massachusetts did more than 200 years ago when it ruled that slavery was illegal in the new state, under the newly ratified Massachusetts state constitution. The constitution itself never explicitly mentioned slavery, but it called for equality under the law, and the justices at the time ruled that this meant no slavery. That's how slavery was abolished in Massachusetts.",

While homosexuality was certainly common in these forerunners of western civilization, neither of them ever legalized homosexual marriage. So alien was the concept of same-sex marriage even in antiquity. So alien is it still today in the world beyond the Newton-Cambridge-Brookline axis of lunacy.\n \n The Massachusetts Constitution that he created revolves around the rights of the citizenry and the checks and balances within government to help facilitate those rights, foremost of which is the right of the people to seek redress with their government through petition. The state constitution is very precise on the procedure for the state legislature to address a \"qualified petition.\"\n \n Governor Romney summed it up best, \"The Constitution plainly states that when a qualified petition is placed before them, the legislature 'shall' vote. It does not say may vote, or vote if its procedures permit a vote, or vote if there are enough of the members in attendance. It says 'shall' vote.\"\n \n \"A decision not to vote is a decision to usurp the constitution, to abandon democracy, and substitute a form of what this nation's founders called tyranny, that is, the imposition of the will of those in power on the people.\"\n \n Simply put, the legislature is bound by law to honor and facilitate qualified petitions. If such a petition, submitted with the required number of registered voters, is presented to the legislature to appear as a public ballot question, the legislature must carry it through to fruition and let the people vote on the designated ballot question. There is no leeway on this. It's the law.\n \n The governor was of course referring to the successful ballot initiative where 126,000 citizens petitioned the state legislature to place on the ballot in 2008 a statewide referendum that would define marriage as between a man and a woman, thereby overturning by popular vote the decision of four judges of the Supreme Judicial Court that sanctioned same-sex marriage.\n \n Such a draconian edict by the judicial branch is the kind of abuse of power that Adams would expect to be overturned by the state legislature, and if they failed to act, then by the people through petition. Which is what 126,000 citizens did. But the state legislature refused to act on the petition, shelving it until the last day of the legislative session, which in effect means they have no intention of honoring the petition, or for that matter, the Constitution.\n \n To redress such an egregious act of government abuse John Adams had one last course of action- revolution: call out the state militia and storm the gates of the State House. In a perfect world such a popular uprising, common in Adams' era, would certainly be a worthwhile endeavor. In colonial times the Speaker of the House, Sal DiMasi, ringleader of these legislative charlatans, would have been dragged down the steps of the State House, tarred and feathered, then banished to Canada.\n \n If only that option were open to us right now.\n \n Our three State Reps, Ruth Balser, Kay Khan and Peter Koutoujian, abused their offices by conspiring with the Speaker to usurp the rights of the petitioners. They were among the 109 state legislators that violated their oath of office to the state constitution when they refused to honor this petition. Their intentions are clear: they don't like the petition, so they don't want it to appear on the ballot because they fear that the people will overturn gay marriage.\n \n Peter Koutoujian, as a lawyer, knows that what he has done is unconstitutional, but he's hoping few people in The Lake will take notice. Ruth Balser, our socialist-in-residence at the State House, cares only what her extremist comrades on the far left think. Kay Khan does whatever Sal DiMasi expects her to.\n \n These three profiles in cowardice have denied the people the right to vote and they're hoping and expecting that the people will do nothing. Yet even those who agree with same sex marriage ought to be alarmed at how these state legislators have conspired to deny a legal petition to be voted on by the public. It sets a dangerous precedent, one that could easily come back to haunt those liberals among us who think that defying the state constitution is a great idea. What will they do in fifty years if a reactionary court outlaws abortion, the people submit a qualified petition for redress, and the state legislature refuses to put the issue to the voters?\n \n Everyone inevitably suffers when the government trashes the Constitution.

Note the bolded from this editorial in the Providence Journal: and specifically the underlined; how can you possibly claim the Legislature is acting legally, morally or ethically if they refuse to take the vote to allow the ballot initiative to take place because they know they don't have the votes to win what they want in the Constitutional Convention? And why would Gov. Romney make his appeal to the SJC to force the vote or place the initiative on the ballot anyway if it wasn't right, expected, or legal to do it? \n Editorial: Constitutional crisis\n Providence Journal\n Sunday, December 3, 2006\n \n In Massachusetts, the same-sex-marriage issue isn't quite done. In fact, the state faces something of a political and constitutional conundrum whose outcome is hard to predict.\n \n The issue came to a head when 170,000 voters signed petitions to put the question of ending new same-sex marriage on the ballot as a referendum question in 2008. Under the state constitution, written in 1780 (by John Adams), as amended, these signatures require the legislature's 200 members, voting jointly in constitutional convention, to formally vote on the matter.\n \n If fewer than 50 members vote yea the issue dies. If 50 or more -- in other words, a fourth -- vote yea, the matter comes up a second time before the new legislature elected on Nov. 7. If 50 or more support it the second time (either in 2007 or 2008), it goes on the 2008 ballot. A simple majority of the people could then end new same-sex marriages. (Those that have taken place since May 2004, when the procedure became lawful, would be unaffected.) A simple majority could also settle the question by saving same-sex marriage.\n \n The constitutional problem is that the measure currently has well more than 50 legislative votes -- but fewer than a 101-vote majority. So the leadership has cutely used a majority vote to adjourn the constitutional convention without taking the mandated vote.\n \n Enter Governor Romney, with a petition to the Supreme Judicial Court to order the legislature to take the vote, or, if it refuses to do so, to order Secretary of State William Galvin to put the referendum question directly on the 2008 ballot, without the constitutionally mandated 50 votes of two successive legislatures.\n \n This happens to be the same Supreme Judicial Court that created same-sex marriage by a 4-to-3 margin, in 2003. And, of course, it is the same once putatively moderate Republican governor about to announce his candidacy for president as (in his own bragging) the truest conservative Republican since Ronald Reagan.\n \n The legislature has unquestionably broken the law and failed to do its duty by refusing to take a vote on the proposed amendment. But there may be no constitutional remedy for this politically slatternly inaction. It may be a separation-of-powers issue in which the Supreme Judicial Court is powerless to punish a co-equal branch of government. There doesn't seem to be any overt constitutional language authorizing the court to nullify the 50-vote-twice requirement, as Governor Romney has demanded. But, as we note, there is also no language authorizing the legislature to refuse to vote.\n \n Politically speaking, the worst of all outcomes would be for the same 4-to-3 majority that created same-sex marriage to whitewash the legislature's failure to perform its duty. That would save same-sex marriage, but it would guarantee that the issue would take on the same bitter recriminations that the abortion issue has for the last 33 years.\n \n Politically and morally speaking, the best outcome would be for the legislature to relent and to take its required up-or-down vote before this year's session ends. But a constitutional crisis seems more likely.http://voteonmarriage.org/editorials.shtml#nt112906 Click on link and scroll 2 articles up:",

   "You're incredible Op; you have the nerve to imply, by your accusation that I, a single voice in the wilderness here is acting according to some anti same sex marriage agenda, while simultaneously rejecting VIDEO EVIDENCE that confirms that the Mass Legislature is deep in the pockets of the Gay Lobby, and firmly under their control in acting illegally as they make believe they are doing the peoples business. This paragraph from the article above sums it up perfectly by stating what John Adams would do if this happened in his day.\n To redress such an egregious act of government abuse John Adams had one last course of action- revolution: call out the state militia and storm the gates of the State House. In a perfect world such a popular uprising, common in Adams' era, would certainly be a worthwhile endeavor. In colonial times the Speaker of the House, Sal DiMasi, ringleader of these legislative charlatans, would have been dragged down the steps of the State House, tarred and feathered, then banished to Canada.\n \n If only that option were open to us right now.\n \n \n Sorry Op, you've lost all credibility, and so have your alleged polls which are distorted and prejudicial at best. If you had confidence in the validity of your cause, then the gay lobby in Massachusetts wouldn't have usurped the will of the people in the first place. They would have demanded a fair playing field and earned what they wanted on its merits because they knew the majority supported their cause.\n \n How weak is it to forcefully steal from a person, and then claim that after speaking with them, they said they would have given it to you anyway, so what you did by stealing it wasn't really wrong? That is precisely what happened in Mass, and you're trying to justify it as usual with such weak excuses as, the people are all for it now.\n\n \n This is nonsense. The legislature in Massachusetts acted in accordance with the procedures outlined in the state constitution. You can huff and puff all you want because you don't like how they voted, but that's how they voted. Nobody stole anything from anybody. \n \n You claim to demand that the \"will of the people\" be done, but then when the will of the people IS done, you sputter and fume because you don't agree with it. The legislature represents the people of Massachusetts. They voted. You don't like how they voted. Too bad.",

Here is the story of what actually happened in 2007, from the Boston Globe. I am including a link and an excerpt from the story in blue: \n \n \n http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2007/06/legislators_vot_1.html\n \n Legislators vote to defeat same-sex marriage ban \n By the Boston Globe City & Region Desk \n June 14, 07 01:23 PM \n By Frank Phillips, Globe Staff\n A proposed constitutional ban on same-sex marriage was swiftly defeated today by a joint session of the Legislature by a vote of 45 to 151, eliminating any chance of getting it on the ballot in November 2008. The measure needed at least 50 votes to advance.\n The vote came without debate after House Speaker Salvatore F. DiMasi, Senate President Therese Murray, and Governor Deval Patrick conferred this morning and concluded that they have the votes to kill the proposal. \n \"Today's vote was not just a victory for marriage equality, it was a victory for equality itself,\" Patrick told reporters as cheers echoed in the State House. \"Whenever we affirm the equality of anyone, we affirm the equality of everyone.\"\n The three leaders - along with gay rights activists - spent the last several days intensely lobbying a dozen or more state representatives and state senators who had previously supported the amendment but signaled that they were open to changing their positions.\n Because fewer than 50 of the state's 200 lawmakers supported the amendment, it will not appear on the 2008 ballot, giving gay marriage advocates a major victory in their battle with social conservatives to keep same-sex marriage legal in Massachusetts. ...\n \n \n So you see that the Massachusetts legislature DID vote on the issue, and there were not the required 50 votes to move the measure forward. So it died. The legislature voted the proposed anti-marriage amendment down.",

The people of Massachusetts spoke through their elected representatives, and they retained marriage equality in their state.\n\n \n What I found particularly moving is why so many legislatures changed their votes and opposed the amendment. They were deluged by mail from their constituents. I can't track it down, but one letter essentially said \"I opposed gay marriage at first. But those two nice men who live next door to me and shoveled my driveway for me all winter are a married gay couple. If gay marriage were taken away it would hurt them, and I can't stand the idea of hurting those wonderful people.\" The people of Massachusetts learned that this wasn't just a mental exercise; real people were in danger of being hurt, and the people of Massachusetts chose correctly to not hurt their neighbors.\n \n That's why I like the Massachusetts method of amending the constitution, as opposed to the California method. In Massachusetts it's hard, it takes time. That means people have the time to think about what they're doing; slick media campaigns aren't enough to guarantee victory. California, amending the constitution is pretty easy. Frankly, anyone with enough money can probably do it. Get the signatures and keep the media blitz up for a few months and you're in; by the time people realise they've made a mistake it's too late.

Ergo, it logically could not be applied to \"women's voting\" based on EXPLICIT exclusion.\n The fact that an EXPLICIT exclusion was included COUNTERS your claim, as it would seem self-evident the people instituting the amendment understood that making a generic claim (without reference to gender) WOULD MEAN that \"women's vote\" would be mandated.\n \n Furthermore, I find your approach meaningless. You throw out two examples you say \"did not work\" (ignoring the fallacies in your claim), and then give ABSOLUTELY NO PRECEDENT to show how it did work.\n \n So I'm going to do just that, and prove that your interpretation was invalidated by the FIRST LAND-MARK USE of the 14th amendment...\n The first truly landmark equal protection decision by the Supreme Court was Strauder v. West Virginia (1880), soon after the end of Reconstruction. A black man, named Jeff Katz, convicted of murder by an all-white jury challenged a West Virginia statute excluding blacks from serving on juries. The Court asserted that the purpose of the Clause wasto assure to the colored race the enjoyment of all the civil rights that under the law are enjoyed by white persons, and to give to that race the protection of the general government, in that enjoyment, whenever it should be denied by the States.\n Exclusion of blacks from juries, the Court concluded, was a denial of equal protection to black defendants, since the jury had been \"drawn from a panel from which the State has expressly excluded every man of [the defendant's] race.\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_protection",

   "After considering what Kronus said, I took you off my ignore list and apparently you have responded to me a number of times with out me knowing. Lucky for me this one came up just in time. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and address your claims in a respectful manner.\n \n \nThis goes into the issue of \"legitimate state interest\" and the \"classes\" of the characteristic involved (i.e. strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and rational basis review).\nAll three of these tests are creations of later courts and the \"intermediate scrutiny\" test is a very recent (in court terms) development that holds no basis to the original meaning of the constitution. The meaning of the 14th amendment will be addressed below but as actually been addressed by you in some respect.\n \n \nHow can you say that is \"clear\" when the actual phrasing of \"equal protection\" includes absolutely no specific categoies.\n No \"clearly tailoring\" for \"only a few things\" exists. It just isn't worded that way.\n It was purposely left VAGUE to encompass more than just \"a few things\".\nTo say this is to imply the writers had no idea what \"equal protection\" meant or could mean. There is no support that this is true and no support to suggest it was \"purposely left vague\". If you have supporting historical documents of that time to show this then please present them. You can even reference the Strauder court case if needed. \n \n \nThis is just plain false.\n Moreover, anybody can see that the \"equal protection\" was invalidated by Texas's law which criminalized consensual sodomy between two men, but allowed it for a man and a woman.\n That is not \"equal protection\".\nOnly O'Conner embraced the equal protection argument. No other justice joined the opinion; not even in part\n \n \"Finally, I turn to petitioners&#8217; equal-protection challenge, which no Member of the Court save Justice O&#8217;Connor, ante, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment), embraces:\" ~ Dissent, Lawrence vs. Texas\n \n The holding of the case had to consider equal-protection as it was a claim. It was rejected. The Due Process clause was used in Lawrence vs. Texas.\n \n \n\"Race & Voting\" is an incredibly poor attempt for an example, cause you can't claim *it didn't work* for something that was never actually tried.\nFor the woman's vote it was. The Supreme Court ruled the privileges or immunities clause in the 14th amendment did not give women the right to vote. Furthermore, the fact that the 15th amendment was adopted a mere 2 years after the 14th amendment (by many of the same adopters of the 14th) would surely indicate they did not feel the 14th amendment covered discriminations for voting based on race.\n \n \nYour argument about voting and women is even more specious, as the 14th amendment EXPLICITLY states MALES with reference to voting...But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice-President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State... Ergo, it logically could not be applied to \"women's voting\" based on EXPLICIT exclusion.\n The fact that an EXPLICIT exclusion was included COUNTERS your claim, as it would seem self-evident the people instituting the amendment understood that making a generic claim (without reference to gender) WOULD MEAN that \"women's vote\" would be mandated.\nThe section of the constitution you highlighted has little to do with who can or can't vote. It definitely didn't exclude anything. In a weird sort of way it said males over 21 (and white males is all it meant) had to get the right to vote but clearly it didn't mean no one else could vote. In fact, the voting age was 18 in many places and the Voters Rights Act made it 18th prior to the 26th amendment being passed. Furthermore, many states allowed woman to vote. Finally, the challenge was not based on that section of the 14th amendment but rather, what came down to, the privileges or immunities clause. If you look into some of the history of the case, the equal protection idea was basically laughed at. No one thought it meant this. I think the Minor case opinion says it best:\n And still again, after the adoption of the fourteenth amendment, it was deemed necessary to adopt a fifteenth, as follows: \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States, or by any State, on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" The fourteenth amendment had already provided that no State should make or enforce any law which should abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States. If suffrage was one of these privileges or immunities, why amend the Constitution to prevent its being denied on account of race, &c.? Nothing is more evident than that the greater must include the less, and if all were already protected why go through with the form of amending the Constitution to protect a part?\n I realize this case is only dealing with the privileges or immunities clause but the fact that \"equal protection\" is excluded shows that this part of the amendment wasn't even close to being considered for the vote. \n \n \nSo I'm going to do just that, and prove that your interpretation was invalidated by the FIRST LAND-MARK USE of the 14th amendment...\nIf you read the case, it actually validates my claim and this is the biggest flaw in your argument.\n \n Below is taken from this very case in the opinion which confirms this amendment deals with race exclusively. You can read it all but I've bolded what I feel is important.\n \n I'd like to also note that they use originalism in this court case as was the practice for many years. Notice they often refer to the \"history\" or meaning when adopted.\n This is one of a series of constitutional provisions having a common purpose -- namely, securing to a race recently emancipated, a race that, through many generations, had been held in slavery, all the civil rights that the superior race enjoy. The true spirit and meaning of the amendments, as we said in the Slaughterhouse Cases, 16 Wall. 36, cannot be understood without keeping in view the history of the times when they were adopted and the general objects they plainly sought to accomplish. At the time when they were incorporated into the Constitution, it required little knowledge of human nature to anticipate that those who had long been regarded as an inferior and subject race would, when suddenly raised to the rank of citizenship, be looked upon with jealousy and positive dislike, and that State laws might be enacted or enforced to perpetuate the distinctions that had before existed. discriminations against them had been habitual. It was well known that, in some States, laws making such discrimination then existed, and others might well be expected. The colored race, as a race, was abject and ignorant, and in that condition was unfitted to command the respect of those who had superior intelligence. Their training had left them mere children, and, as such, they needed the protection which a wise government extend to those who are unable to protect themselves. They especially needed protection against unfriendly action in the States where they were resident. It was in view of these considerations the Fourteenth Amendment was framed and adopted. It was designed to assure to the colored race the enjoyment of all the civil rights that, under the law, are enjoyed by white persons, and to give to that race the protection of the general government in that enjoyment whenever it should be denied by the States. It not only gave citizenship and the privileges of citizenship to persons of color, but it denied to any State the power to withhold from them the equal protection of the laws, and authorized Congress to enforce its provisions [p307] by appropriate legislation. To quote the language used by us in the Slaughterhouse Cases,\n \n No one can fail to be impressed with the one pervading purpose found in all the amendments, lying at the foundation of each, and without which none of them would have been suggested -- we mean the freedom of the slave race, the security and firm establishment of that freedom, and the protection of the newly made freeman and citizen from the oppressions of those who had formerly exercised unlimited dominion over them.\n \n So again:\n \n The existence of laws in the States where the newly emancipated negroes resided which discriminated with gross injustice and hardship against them as a class was the evil to be remedied, and, by it [the Fourteenth Amendment], such laws were forbidden. If, however, the States did not conform their laws to its requirements, then, by the fifth section of the article of amendment, Congress was authorized to enforce it by suitable legislation.\n \n And it was added,\n \n We doubt very much whether any action of a State not directed by way of discrimination against the negroes as a class will ever be held to come within the purview of this provision.\n So, I have argued here that 1)The amendment does not mean what people commonly think it means and 2) That the true meaning deals with only race. \n \n Point 1 is supported by the Minor case, the very fact we have a 15 and 19th amendment and (not said here) historical documents of the time.\n \n Point 2 is supported by the very case you linked.",

   "As a matter of clarification, the question regarding the Massachusetts Legislature was covered in a discussion here and here. In short, Archangel's facts are wrong.\n \n In my judgment, Archangel probably should just quit. \n \n\n \n You're saying my facts are wrong, and yet you said in this post http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=240994&postcount=4 just what I was arguing with Op. That the Legislature was required to vote on it. And one must be suspicious when the first vote was passed, but the second one failed to pass.\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Massachusetts\n First Constitutional Convention vote\n The first Constitutional Convention vote on the petition amendment was scheduled for July 12, 2006,[11] but was postponed until November 9, 2006 to take place after the next state elections.[12] On November 9th, 2006 the Legislature voted to recess the Constitutional Convention until January 2.\n On November 19, 2006, Gov. Mitt Romney led a rally against the tactics that the Massachusetts legislature used to delay and possibly prevent a vote on the same-sex marriage ballot initiative in front of the Massachusetts State House. Romney said he would ask a justice of the state Supreme Judicial Court that week to put the initiative on the ballot in case the legislators failed to vote on the initiative on the last day of the Joint Session, January 2, 2007 as required by the Massachusetts Constitution Amendments Article XLVIII (The Initiative, IV. Legislative Action on Proposed Amendments, Section 2. Joint Session)[13] Romney said, \"The issue before us is not whether same-sex couples should marry. The issue before us today is whether 109 legislators will follow the constitution.\"\n On December 27, 2006, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court agreed unanimously with Gov. Mitt Romney's repeated assertion that Article 48 of the Massachusetts Constitution explicitly and unambiguously requires that the Massachusetts Legislature take a final vote on any and all voter initiatives placed before them. That includes the marriage amendment. The court, though, also stated that it had no legal remedy that it could enforce upon the Legislature due to laws that separate the judicial and legislative branches of government.[14] The legislature voted on the measure on January 2, 2007, shortly before its 2005-2006 session ended. The amendment received 62 \"for\" votes in Constitutional Convention and thereby cleared its first hurdle toward ratification.[15] However, a second vote during the 2007-2008 session was needed to put the amendment to the voters. \n Notice the delays till after the next State election, and then the legislature voted to delay the constitutional convention until Jan 2nd. Then the bolded which explains the Romney getting involved. And it passed with enough votes after all of the attempts to defeat it.\n [edit]Second Constitutional Convention vote\n A second joint session of the State Legislature meeting in a constitutional convention was held on June 14, 2007. The marriage amendment was defeated by a vote of 151 against to 45 in favor. At least 50 \"for\" votes were needed for the measure to move on to a public referendum.[6]\n [edit] \n Only with the second vote did they defeat the referendum. It makes you wonder what changed? What did they offer the hold outs in order to get them to change their votes? I don't know. But I do know it stinks to high heaven. \n \n Any way, this is history. The relevant post this morning was about what's happening in Cali with the ballot initiative being put back on this Novembers ballot for the people to vote on.\n \n http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_9459707",

The concurrence was not joined by the others for one...she just joined the judgment (not the opinion). This doesn't imply the opinion agrees to the concurrence or they would have joined. \n \n I guess you are not familiar with how a case works as all questions posed in a case must be answered in the case:\n \"1. Whether Petitioners' criminal convictions under the Texas \"Homosexual Conduct\" law-which criminalizes sexual intimacy by same-sex couples, but not identical behavior by different-sex couples-violate the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection of laws?\n Secondly, the dissent blatantly stated this point. (posted earlier)\n \n Finally, the argument was rejected in the opinion because, like I said, they had to address the first question (posted above): \n  As an alternative argument in this case, counsel for the petitioners and some amici contend that Romer provides the basis for declaring the Texas statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause. That is a tenable argument, but we conclude the instant case requires us to address whether Bowers itself has continuing validity. Were we to hold the statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause some might question whether a prohibition would be valid if drawn differently, say, to prohibit the conduct both between same-sex and different-sex participants.\n They do not hold the statue invalid under the Equal Protection Clause and therefore the argument is rejected. You only have two choices on it if you say you are going to address it: Accept or Reject.\n \n \nAgain, READ what the 14th amendment said.\n It specified MALE inhabitants.\n THAT is one of the reasons it does not apply.\nRight, that part does but it has little to do with voting. Instead it addresses what happens if a male over 21 is denied the right to vote. This doesn't say anything about who can or can't vote. Thus the 15th amendment. Furthermore, it doesn't exclude because people 18 and females were allowed to vote prior to the 26th amendment.\n \n To be honest, I'm not sure where you are getting this argument from...it just doesn't make sense.\n \n \nIt specified that MALE voting rights were covered, so obviously FEMALE voting rights were not covered.\n It baffles me how you cannot agree to that.\nBecause it doesn't make sense. It doesn't say what is covered by under any provision in section one..it says what happens to those over 21 and male who can't vote. They are two separate sections.\n \n \nIf you have an amendment, and a part of it deals EXPLICITLY with voting, you would start there as to determining the impact upon voting.\n You chose VOTING as a starting example, so I started my analysis of how \"voting\" is impacted by the 14th amendment by looking at the voting section.\n \n If the amendment was intended to include women's protections, it obviously would not have EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED them as not protected in that clause.\n It's as simple as that.\nIt isn't impacted and no court case that I have found, including the one dealing with woman's right to vote, has stated this. This is obvious because that section of the amendment deals with how you determine the number of representatives and not who can or can't vote or who is or isn't covered in terms of \"voting\" under section 1. Woman aren't included in Section 1 because they have never been and I suppose section 2 implies this but it has no bearing on section 1. Historical documents also show that woman are not protected by much of section 1. Furthermore, race was no protected by equal protection in terms of voting. Finally, if we were to go by intentions of what is or isn't included in the 14th amendment then we achieve my point and one would have to admit that marriage is not covered under equal protection unless dealing with the issue of race (which is only what the amendment means).\n \n \nAll this establishes is that \"voting\" is not one of the \"privileges or immunities\" afforded to citizens.\n It doesn't list what other \"privileges or immunities\" could exist.\n Just that the 14th amendment would not apply because they did not consider it to be a \"privilege or immunity\".\n If they had considered voting as a \"privilege or immunity\", obviously voting would have been covered...\nThe important part is why they were not included (which wasn't section 2 of the 14th amendment). The answer is, as stated in the case, because no where in the history of the amendment did it meant to apply to the women's right to vote. Likewise, no where in the history of the adoption of the 14th amendment was it meant to apply to homosexual conduct or marriage. \n \n \nI disagree. (Who saw that one coming?)\n It DOES show that \"race\" was a major part of the adoption of the 14th amendment...\n I do not deny that at all.\n \n But my question to you is WHY, since race was so important to the creation of the 14th amendment, does the 14th amendment COMPLETELY AVOID MENTIONING race?\nIt doesn't say it was a major part...it says it is the only part.\n \n Four years after the adoption the slaughterhouse case stated: We doubt very much whether any action of a State not directed by way of discrimination against the negroes as a class will ever be held to come within the purview of this provision.\n \n You can't get any clearer than that. \n \n \nThey were creating a definitive standard for due process and equal protection, but they NEVER SPECIFIED ANYTHING as far as what was covered.\nIf this is what you believe then one can't make up what should or shouldn't be covered. The constitution isn't a Mad Libs where you fill in the blanks with whatever you wish. This is clear from the anti-federalist papers.\n \n \nYour quotations establish, uncontestably, that race WAS a consideration.\nAnd the only consideration\n \nBut NOWHERE do they demonstrate it was the SOLE consideration. NOWHERE do they establish that it is one consideration on a very list of considerations.\nReally? \"No one can fail to be impressed with the one pervading purpose found in all the amendments...\" or \"We doubt very much whether any action of a State not directed by way of discrimination against the negroes as a class will ever be held to come within the purview of this provision.\"\n \n You really have to be doing an Archie type stretch to think they are saying something other than the amendment only applies to race (as stated in the case you linked to). \n \n \nIt was purposely left vague, with NO mention of race.\nI've asked several times to provide some historical evidence of this, yet none so far. Please show where they purposely left it \"vague\".\n \n \nIf the \"true meaning deals with only race\", then why is race never specified? \n Doesn't matter. The meaning stated in the case you linked to is clear.\n \n \nPoint 1 only goes as far as \"voting\" was not considered a \"privilege or immunity\".\nAnd the reasoning goes to saying (assuming you read the case history) that only the meaning of the 14th amendment when adopted can be used. This didn't include woman and it doesn't include homosexual marriage now.\n \n \nPoint #2 is not supported by the case I linked.\n It DOES establish that race IS AN ITEM.\n You go too far in claiming it is the ONLY item.\nIt very blatantly did. It stated off with the history and concluded with the exact meaning: It was designed to assure to the colored race the enjoyment of all the civil rights that, under the law, are enjoyed by white persons, and to give to that race the protection of the general government in that enjoyment whenever it should be denied by the States.\n \n If this overwhelming evidence was not enough then the slaughterhouse case which was referenced says it again:\n We are not without judicial interpretation, therefore, both State and National, of the meaning of this clause. And it [p81] is sufficient to say that under no construction of that provision that we have ever seen, or any that we deem admissible, can the restraint imposed by the State of Louisiana upon the exercise of their trade by the butchers of New Orleans be held to be a deprivation of property within the meaning of that provision.\n \n \"Nor shall any State deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n \n In the light of the history of these amendments, and the pervading purpose of them, which we have already discussed, it is not difficult to give a meaning to this clause. The existence of laws in the States where the newly emancipated negroes resided, which discriminated with gross injustice and hardship against them as a class, was the evil to be remedied by this clause, and by it such laws are forbidden.\n Will you at least concede that those two cases felt the only meaning of the 14th amendment was to deal with race?",

The court, though, also stated that it had no legal remedy that it could enforce upon the Legislature due to laws that separate the judicial and legislative branches of government.[14] The legislature voted on the measure on January 2, 2007, shortly before its 2005-2006 session ended. The amendment received 62 \"for\" votes in Constitutional Convention and thereby cleared its first hurdle toward ratification.[15] However, a second vote during the 2007-2008 session was needed to put the amendment to the voters. \n Notice the delays till after the next State election, and then the legislature voted to delay the constitutional convention until Jan 2nd. Then the bolded which explains the Romney getting involved. And it passed with enough votes after all of the attempts to defeat it.\n [edit]Second Constitutional Convention vote\n A second joint session of the State Legislature meeting in a constitutional convention was held on June 14, 2007. The marriage amendment was defeated by a vote of 151 against to 45 in favor. At least 50 \"for\" votes were needed for the measure to move on to a public referendum.[6]\n [edit] \n Only with the second vote did they defeat the referendum. It makes you wonder what changed? What did they offer the hold outs in order to get them to change their votes? I don't know. But I do know it stinks to high heaven. \n \n Any way, this is history. The relevant post this morning was about what's happening in Cali with the ballot initiative being put back on this Novembers ballot for the people to vote on.\n \n http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_9459707\n\n \n So, you admit you were wrong and that the Mass. legislature did in fact vote on the issue. They voted not to amend the state constitution to ban same-sex marriage. \n \n You only think it \"stinks to high heaven\" because you don't agree with the vote by the Mass. legislature. But this is the legislature elected by the people of Massachusetts, doing its duty under the state constitution. The fact that the state legislature voted to retain same-sex legal marriage means that you and other opponents of equality cannot make the argument that a court forced same-sex marriage on people in Mass. or that the people's voice went unheard. The people of Massachusetts have spoken, through their legislature, and they have endorsed legal same-sex marriage.",

   "The question of what, exactly, the framers of the 14th amendment intended is not easy to answer, and there has been much debate about this since John Bingham of Ohio introduced the language of section 1 in 1866. Did the amendment apply ONLY to denial of rights on the basis of race? Certainly Bingham and other framers intended to address the denial by the states of rights on the basis of race, or as the late constitutional scholar John Ely has argued, on the basis of \"racelike\" classifications. But did they intend to protect citizens from discrimination ONLY on the basis of race? The late Chief Justice Rehnquist has suggested this. Yet, if we go back to the debates over the language from the Joint Committee on Reconstruction in 1866, the drafters appear to have had a broader purpose in mind.\n \n John Bingham, who actually produced the language that became the final version of section 1 of the 14th amendment, appears to have intended the 14th amendment to incorporate the first 8 amendments in the Bill of Rights and apply them to the states. You can see this if you scroll to the bottom of Justice Hugo Black's dissent in Adamson v. California (1947). Black has added to his dissent an appendix containing language from the debates involving John Bingham during the framing of the 14th amendment, to show that he, wrote the language, intended the amendment to incorporate the first 8 amendments of the Bill of Rights and apply them to the states. http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0332_0046_ZD.htmlhttp://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0332_0046_ZD.html\n \n Now, what does the issue of incorporation have to do with whether the amendment protects citizens from denial of rights on the basis of race or for other reasons as well? If the 14th amendment was intended by its author to incorporate the bill of rights and apply earlier amendments to the states, then the 14th amendment went beyond merely guaranteeing those rights that were being denied on the basis of race, to protect, for example, the first amendment rights of freedom of the press and of religion. John Bingham's arguments suggest that the 14th amendment was intended, broadly, to protect all persons from the denial by the states of rights protected under the Bill of Rights. And indeed, proposed language that specifically named race, introduced by Thaddeus Stevens, was removed from the final version of the 14th amendment. So while it's clear to me that the framers of the 14th amendment were primarily concerned with preventing the states from denying rights on the basis of race, it's not clear that they were exclusively intending this. And of course, whatever the specific intent of the framers of the 14th amendment, the Supreme Court has over time interpreted the amendment as protecting the rights of all persons, and not merely to preventing race discrimination. The Supreme Court has ruled that the 14th amendment protects the rights of gay people. \n \n It should be noted that less than 10 years after the ratification of the 14th amendment, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Minor v. Happersett that Virginia Minor, a woman, was indeed a citizen, and as such, she had citizenship rights protected by the 14th amendment. However, the Supreme Court ruled, the 14th amendment did not prevent states from denying citizens the right to vote. The right to vote, the Court ruled, was determined by the states. So we see from this decision that the Supreme Court did NOT rule in 1875 that the 14th amendment protections did not apply to women. They ruled that the 14th amendment did not protect the right to vote. They insisted that it wasn't Virginia Minor's womanhood that prevented her from having the right to vote under the 14th amendment; it was the fact that her state had not granted women the right to vote, and the 14th amendment, said the justices, did not extend to protection of the right to vote.",

My article was from Dec.06, while the vote didn't take place until June 07. So nothing about what I posted was factually incorrect, it just happened prior to the actual vote taking place. \n \n \nThey voted not to amend the state constitution to ban same-sex marriage.\n \n \n Uhh, NO. What they finally voted on after numerous delays was the Constitutional Convention vote on the petition amendment. All the groups opposing same sex marriage were trying to accomplish, was to get the ballot initiative they had the 170,000 signatures for on the ballot so the voice of the people of Mass could be heard on the issue, and the Legislature that is owned and controlled by the gay lobby did everything possible to block that from happening. And they succeeded to until they could finally control the outcome of that vote and deny the people of Mass that their voice could be heard through a ballot initiative. And the initiative was needed because the activist judges attempted to make gay marriage legal from the bench. It's important to get these events in proper order. \n \n \nYou only think it \"stinks to high heaven\" because you don't agree with the vote by the Mass. legislature.\n \n \n Not at all Op, I think it stinks to high heaven because this corrupt Legislature delayed the vote until they could control the outcome so that it reflected denying the people their voice. \n \n \nBut this is the legislature elected by the people of Massachusetts, doing its duty under the state constitution.\n \n \n Sure, only in the mind of the delusional could it be said that the Mass Legislature did anything above board, legal, moral or ethical in dealing with this issue which they crammed down the throats of the people of Massachusetts without ever allowing the ballot initiative they wanted, to ever take place. \n \n \nThe fact that the state legislature voted to retain same-sex legal marriage means that you and other opponents of equality cannot make the argument that a court forced same-sex marriage on people in Mass. or that the people's voice went unheard.

So I ask you Op, without obfuscation; if what you say is actual factual history, then why were so many years spent by the Legislature refusing to vote on the Constitutional Convention to allow the Ballot Initiative on Gay Marriage to take place if they were convinced or believed at all that the people supported it? \n \n And what did they finally offer the holdouts in order to defeat the ballot initiative issue on the second vote? I know that representatives that opposed gay marriage were actually lobbied against during campaigns for re-election as the Mass Democratic Machine supported gay or pro gay candidates. So was that their strategy in delaying the votes? Until they could replace those who opposed them? I'm sure that's only one of the methods of accomplishing their agenda.

   "You haven't shown they are not foreign. \n\n Somehow, I would have expected that it would have been your burden of proof to show \"foreign\" since you came up with that argument, and that's why we are discussing the point... \n \n \n \n Well you seem to think it was clear they made it vague. Please provide proof that they purposely made it vague. \n It doesn't seem to me it was vague given the immediate cases after adoption. \n\n 1) It is vague. It never even specifies \"black\" or race.\n 2) Your argument is like saying the computer isn't a diverse tool, because the first thing people used it for was surfing the net.\n And then you complain that others that later use it to do their taxes, play games, perform math calculations, etc, etc... are abusing the \"intent\" of the computer... \n \n \n \nAre you kidding me? The concurrence was not joined by the others for one...she just joined the judgment (not the opinion). This doesn't imply the opinion agrees to the concurrence or they would have joined. \n\n These decisions are made on a LOT more than just one issue.\n For you to pretend that they would have had only ONE point of disagreement is myopic.\n If a justice feels differently enough, in conclusion, logic, or other argument, they will create their own commentary.\n \n There is no logic in presuming \"they must have said *no* to equal protection\" just because they didn't sign onto hers. \n \n \n \nI guess you are not familiar with how a case works as all questions posed in a case must be answered in the case:&#8220;1. Whether Petitioners&#8217; criminal convictions under the Texas &#8220;Homosexual Conduct&#8221; law&#8211;which criminalizes sexual intimacy by same-sex couples, but not identical behavior by different-sex couples&#8211;violate the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection of laws?\n\n And the answer is???\n \n \n \nSecondly, the dissent blatantly stated this point. (posted earlier) \n\n The funny thing is that since only ONE judge wrote that, that must mean the other eight judges disagree.\n The other eight judges disagree with the claim in the dissent that it is \"8 to 1\".\n \n Don't you hate it when your own logic proves you wrong? \n \n \n \n Finally, the argument was rejected in the opinion because, like I said, they had to address the first question (posted above):  As an alternative argument in this case, counsel for the petitioners and some amici contend that Romer provides the basis for declaring the Texas statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause. That is a tenable argument, but we conclude the instant case requires us to address whether Bowers itself has continuing validity. Were we to hold the statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause some might question whether a prohibition would be valid if drawn differently, say, to prohibit the conduct both between same-sex and different-sex participants.They do not hold the statue invalid under the Equal Protection Clause and therefore the argument is rejected. You only have two choices on it if you say you are going to address it: Accept or Reject. \n\n THEY NEVER SAID.\n They said \"Were we to ...\"\n They never said they WERE doing that...\n \n They stateyd that they felt obligated to address BOWERS itself instead of the \"equal protection\" angle. \n \n \n \nRight, that part does but it has little to do with voting. \n\n That part had EVERYTHING to do with voting.\n The first sentence fixes the \"blacks count as partial whites\" nonsense.\n The second part EXPLICITLY PENALIZES the state that discriminates in voting against males over 21.\n At first, they get to count EVERY PERSON.\n But if they discriminate, they are PENALIZED in the total count for their discrimination.\n \n How you can say it has \"little to do with voting\", when it explicitly sets up a punishment for voting discrimination, is baffling!\n \n \n \nInstead it addresses what happens if a male over 21 is denied the right to vote. This doesn't say anything about who can or can't vote. \n\n Suppose Virginia had 10 representatives (counting all its population), with 10% of its population black.\n Virginia prevents blacks from voting.\n This amendment requires that their representation be cut to 9.\n \n It's just that simple.\n \n \n \nFurthermore, it doesn't exclude because people 18 and females were allowed to vote prior to the 26th amendment. \n\n It's wording clearly denies protection to women.\n Obviously, that doesn't mean women cannot vote. Just that there is no requirement to let them. \n \n \n \n Because it doesn't make sense. It doesn't say what is covered by under any provision in section one..it says what happens to those over 21 and male who can't vote. They are two separate sections. \n\n 1) \"doesn't say what is covered\" =< VAGUE!\n It is vague in not saying WHAT is covered.\n \n 2) Yes. They are two separate sections. But part of a whole.\n You wouldn't expect one part to contradict another, would you?\n The CONSISTENT interpretation is that male votes are covered (part 2). Female votes are not.\n \n \n \n It isn't impacted and no court case that I have found, including the one dealing with woman's right to vote, has stated this. \n\n Have you found any case that actually uses that clause at all?\n Just because it hasn't been used doesn't deny what it actually says.\n \n \n \nWoman aren't included in Section 1 because they have never been and I suppose section 2 implies this but it has no bearing on section 1. \n\n You claim \"women aren't included\"...\n You quoted MINOR v. HAPPERSETT earlier which dealt with 14th amendment women's suffrage.\n Did Minor ever rule that women were NOT to be covered by the 14th amendment? NO!\n (Fatal hole in your argument...)\n \n Furthermore, it's interesting to note what Minor observes:If the right of suffrage is one of the necessary privileges of a citizen of the United States, then the constitution and laws of Missouri confining it to men are in violation of the Constitution of the United States, as amended, and consequently void. The direct question is, therefore, presented whether all citizens are necessarily voters. \n The Constitution does not define the privileges and immunities of citizens. For that definition we must look elsewhere. In this case we need not determine what they are, but only whether suffrage is necessarily one of them. \n \n It certainly is nowhere made so in express terms.\n First paragraph. \"If the rights of suffrage is one of the necessary privileges of a citizen of the United States...\", then Missouri CANNOT FORBID WOMEN FROM VOTING. They ruled EXCLUSIVELY on whether or not \"voting\" was covered as a \"privilege or immunity\". They EXPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGED that if voting WAS to be considered as a \"privilege or immunity\", then women COULD NOT BE PREVENTED from voting.\n \n Obviously, the 14th amendment has to apply to women for this to happen, destroying your \"race only\" claim.\n \n Second paragraph. \"The Constitution does not define the privileges and immunities of citizens. For that definition we must look elsewhere.\"\n Gasp! Is that \"Judicial Activism\"??????\n \n No. It's the court explicitly stating a fact. Our legislative body never defined \"privileges and immunities\", so the court took it upon themselves to figure it out for themselves.\n \n These days, they call it \"Judicial Activism\". emoticon_xgood \n \n \n \n The important part is why they were not included (which wasn't section 2 of the 14th amendment). The answer is, as stated in the case, because no where in the history of the amendment did it meant to apply to the women's right to vote. \n\n Let's be crystal clear on this.\n 1) The court decided for themselves that \"voting rights\" were not a privilege or immunity.\n 2) The court EXPLICITLY said that if \"voting rights\" were a privilege or immunity, women could not be forbidden from voting. Clearly demonstrating women ARE COVERED by the amendment. The ONLY issue was whether \"voting\" was a \"privilege or immunity\".",

Please show where they purposely left it \"vague\". \n\n You've been given it multiple times.\n There is no definition of WHO is covered, beyond \"citizens\" and other vague commentary.\n There is no definition of \"immunities and privileges\", which the Supreme Court explicitly noted.\n Keep pressing me for \"proof\" and I'll simply reply with what I have been telling you all along. \n \n \n \nDoesn't matter. The meaning stated in the case you linked to is clear. \n\n Let me get this straight.\n You press me for proof on \"vague\", and in your very next sentence, replying to me giving you proof on \"vague\", you claim \"doesn't matter\"...\n \n \n \nAnd the reasoning goes to saying (assuming you read the case history) that only the meaning of the 14th amendment when adopted can be used. \n\n No. That's what you want adopted as an underlying and uncontested assumption.\n \n \n \nThis didn't include woman and it doesn't include homosexual marriage now. \n\n 1) Minor clearly demonstrated that women WOULD BE INCLUDED by noting that the only thing preventing constitutional requirement of women voting was the classification of VOTING as an \"immunity and privilege\".\n 2) Repeatedly, you persist in insisting things are a certain way, ignoring the arguments and ignoring history.\n The 14th amendment has been repeatedly applied to homosexuals.\n By your standards, when the dissenting judge claimed \"only one\" judge accepted equal protection, and nobody else joined his opinion, that must mean the other eight judges thought he was wrong.\n Regardless of the way you WANT it to be, it DOES include homosexuals.\n It DOES include marriage.\n \n \n \n It very blatantly did. It stated off with the history and concluded with the exact meaning: It was designed to assure to the colored race the enjoyment of all the civil rights that, under the law, are enjoyed by white persons, and to give to that race the protection of the general government in that enjoyment whenever it should be denied by the States. \n\n A computer can be \"designed\" for a gaming machine, with tons of RAM, a smoking graphics card, ample hard drive, etc, etc..\n But obviously, it can do your taxes as well.\n \n If the SOLE design was JUST for \"race\" to be covered, they should have said that.\n The fact that they NEVER EXPLICITLY mentioned race demonstrates something substantial, that all you can reply with is \"doesn't matter\".\n \n \n \nIf this overwhelming evidence was not enough then the slaughterhouse case which was referenced says it again:\n We are not without judicial interpretation, therefore, both State and National, of the meaning of this clause. And it [p81] is sufficient to say that under no construction of that provision that we have ever seen, or any that we deem admissible, can the restraint imposed by the State of Louisiana upon the exercise of their trade by the butchers of New Orleans be held to be a deprivation of property within the meaning of that provision.\n \"Nor shall any State deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n In the light of the history of these amendments, and the pervading purpose of them, which we have already discussed, it is not difficult to give a meaning to this clause. The existence of laws in the States where the newly emancipated negroes resided, which discriminated with gross injustice and hardship against them as a class, was the evil to be remedied by this clause, and by it such laws are forbidden.\n\n Over and over again, you attempt to confuse the presence of A purpose with the declaration of a SOLE purpose.\n \"pervades\" is not \"sole\".\n \n The injustice they sought to address with this amendment was bigger than just race. The reason they did not CONFINE the amendment to JUST say \"race\". \n \n \n \nWill you at least concede that those two cases felt the only meaning of the 14th amendment was to deal with race?\n\n No. I refuse to interpret \"a\" as \"sole\".\n Will you concede that Minor clearly establishes that women ARE covered under the 14th amendment?",

   "Here is a link to an article about what would happen to marriages already legalized if the proposed anti-marriage constitutional amendment passes in November. I am including a link and an excerpt from the article, in blue:\n \n \n \n http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202421788142\n \n Future Gay Unions Face Legal Hurdles in California\n Mike McKee\n The Recorder\n May 30, 2008\n \n Same-sex couples excited by the California Supreme Court's two-week-old decision declaring their right to wed are already booking dates to get licenses. But what will happen to those marriages if voters approve a proposed constitutional amendment in November that would restrict marriage to the union of a man and a woman?\n \n There is no clear answer, but attorneys on both sides of the issue have staked out their positions and are ready for a fight. Gay-rights lawyers say the marriages would remain valid, conservative groups insist they would be nullified, and many on both sides predict there could be complicated legal battles to resolve the impasse.\n \n \"There's a strong argument that the initiative measure should not be viewed as retroactive because it is not expressly made retroactive, and generally constitutional amendments are not retroactive,\" San Francisco Chief Deputy City Attorney Therese Stewart said last week. \"The marriages performed in the interim have a good chance of being treated as having continued validity.\"\n \n Mathew Staver, founder and chairman of Florida-based Liberty Counsel, which represents the Campaign for California Families, a group that fought against same-sex marriages, disagreed. He said the initiative would void any gay marriages if it passes.\n \n \"So whenever anybody tries to file [a marriage license] or use it or bring it into court to obtain rights or benefits -- such as dissolution, child and family support, distribution of property -- the ink would be invisible ink that would not carry weight,\" he said. \"If the Constitution says they can't be valid or recognized, they are null and void and have no legal effect anymore.\"\n ",

   "Perhaps you should look in the mirror as you say that, cause Equal Protection sure as heck isn't used today like you want it to mean...\nI never denied this. This doesn't make it right.\n \n \n2) I just don't get how you can refer to my statement as \"what you believe\" and not as actual fact.\nProbably because it isn't.\n \n \nLet me say it again. \"They were creating a definitive standard for due process and equal protection, but they NEVER SPECIFIED ANYTHING as far as what was covered. \"\n This is not a \"belief\", but rather a fact. A fact that the Supreme Court, in the decision YOU pointed out to me, repeated explicitly.\nWhere!?!? It didn't get any clearer than what I posted. \n \nThe Constitution does not define the privileges and immunities of citizens. For that definition we must look elsewhere. In this case we need not determine what they are, but only whether suffrage is necessarily one of them. \n It certainly is nowhere made so in express terms.\nYou are addressing two different points here from two different cases. The equal protection clause was very much specified as shown in the slaughterhouse case. In the Minor case (dealing with woman vote) they dealt with the privileges and immunities clause and they admit there is a definition but did not find the need to fully define it as it was beyond the scope of the case. This doesn't imply a direct meaning doesn't exist because it does and they admit that (\"for that definition we must look elsewhere\"). The use of originalism was very much shown in that case.\n \n So not sure your point.\n \n \n \n1) \"The one\" is not the same thing as \"the only\". They are not synonymous. \n 2) Minor EXPLICITLY showed that women WERE COVERED when they stated that if voting were a \"privilege or immunity\", then the state could NOT forbid women the vote.\n 3) Talking of \"doubt\" seems irrelevant compared to what was explicitly pointed out in Minor.\n Their \"doubt\" was obviously erased by their own statements!\n\n 1)In this case it is clear they are and if you weren't sure from the first quote and the lengthy explanation in that court case then the slaughterhouse case just blatantly said it as well. To deny this is to deny reality quite frankly.\n 2) Minor vs Happersett was no dealing with the equal protection clause like the other cases. You confuse the two points. Furthermore, how is saying \"you aren't covered by this provision\" implying you are covered in it? Is your argument really \"if the meaning was different then they would be covered\"? Well of course....\n 3)What you quoted was not from Minor...neither quote was. What are you talking about?\n \n \nYou've been given it multiple times.\nWHERE!! You can just link to the post if you shown historical evidence. Some document..anything. Either you are a liar, plain wrong, or addressed in a different thread because I certainly can't find any links to historical documents or quotes from historical documents in this thread relating to what I've posted.\n \n There is no definition of WHO is covered, beyond \"citizens\" and other vague commentary.\n \nThere is no definition of \"immunities and privileges\", which the Supreme Court explicitly noted.\nActually they said there was a definition, it just wasn't stated in the constitution.\n \n Are you arguing \"immunities and privileges\" (sic) has no meaning or has a meaning decided by someone other than those who adopted it? If the former then what good is the amendment? If the later then you rendered the provision useless as it could mean whatever the group you feel should define it wants it to mean. Begs the question why it was adopted in the first place if they intended it to be defined by someone else.\n \n \nKeep pressing me for \"proof\" and I'll simply reply with what I have been telling you all along. \nIn other words providing no proof?\n \n \n Let me get this straight.\n You press me for proof on \"vague\", and in your very next sentence, replying to me giving you proof on \"vague\", you claim \"doesn't matter\"...\nI'm saying why the term \"race\" wasn't included doesn't matter because the meaning still is known. Your question is like asking me why they didn't combine the 9th and 10th amendment. Who knows...that is just the way it is worded. It doesn't speak anything to its meaning.\n \n \n1) Minor clearly demonstrated that women WOULD BE INCLUDED by noting that the only thing preventing constitutional requirement of women voting was the classification of VOTING as an \"immunity and privilege\".\nAnd if the constitution said \"Steve is always president\" then I would be president all the time according to the constitution. \n \n You have no point here. Woman were denied the vote because the amendment provision doesn't apply to the claim.\n \n \n2) Repeatedly, you persist in insisting things are a certain way, ignoring the arguments and ignoring history.\n The 14th amendment has been repeatedly applied to homosexuals.\n By your standards, when the dissenting judge claimed \"only one\" judge accepted equal protection, and nobody else joined his opinion, that must mean the other eight judges thought he was wrong.\n Regardless of the way you WANT it to be, it DOES include homosexuals.\n It DOES include marriage.\nIgnoring history? I'm the only way that is quoting it. The 14th amendment has repeatedly been applied to homosexuals? Perhaps in the last couple decades. This speaks nothing to the true meaning of the amendment. \n \n The way you apply my standard doesn't make sense. The simple fact that they rejected the argument in the opinion is enough. It was just explicitly said in the dissent and implied in the concurrence. If the argument was accepted then O'conner would not have had to file an concurrence. \n \n \n A computer can be \"designed\" for a gaming machine, with tons of RAM, a smoking graphics card, ample hard drive, etc, etc..\n But obviously, it can do your taxes as well.\n \n If the SOLE design was JUST for \"race\" to be covered, they should have said that.\n The fact that they NEVER EXPLICITLY mentioned race demonstrates something substantial, that all you can reply with is \"doesn't matter\".\nYou have no evidence of this. No framing document supports this and the one court case that happened FOUR YEARS after adoption blatantly says it only deals with race. \n \n Another good example of an amendment not explicitly saying something but does have a certain meaning is the 1st amendment. No where does it say \"expression\" yet expression was always thought to be a part of speech and as such is covered under the 1st amendment. While not a direct parallel it shows that just because something isn't stated doesn't mean it isn't part of the meaning. \n \n \nOver and over again, you attempt to confuse the presence of A purpose with the declaration of a SOLE purpose.\n \"pervades\" is not \"sole\".\nBut one is. Pervade is for purpose \"the one\" refers to the number of. \n \n Nevertheless the slaughterhouse case said it again which was then quoted in the case you gave.\n \n \nThe injustice they sought to address with this amendment was bigger than just race. The reason they did not CONFINE the amendment to JUST say \"race\". \nThen prove it! You are all talk and no show. Give me some congressional hearing notes of commentary on the adoption of the amendment. Anything will do that shows the amendment meant something other than what a case FOUR YEARS AFTER ADOPTION said it meant. \n \n \nWill you concede that Minor clearly establishes that women ARE covered under the 14th amendment?\nHuh? The ruling in Minor is that a woman's right to vote is not covered under the privileges and immunities clause. \n \n Where does it say in Minor that woman are covered under the 14th amendment?..or rather the meaning of it was meant for woman? Do you mean are they covered under the term \"citizen\"??? Well of course but they were covered prior to the amendment as well. You confuse two different cases together though!",

   "Ohioprof and Kronus:\n \n I think the ruling should have been stayed for the following reason. Staying the ruling until after November's results would have negligible impact whether the amendment is passed or not, whereas not staying the result could have massive impact in terms of money, litigation, and confusion (in many states) should the amendment pass (and there is a reasonable chance that it could). It really is unthinkable that the judges on the California court would accept the possibility of such legal nightmare when it could easily have been avoided.\n \n There is a judicial doctrine upon which this is based, by the way. It is the doctrine of deciding political questions.\n \n Also, my understanding is that they denied the petition to even hear whether they should stay the ruling, which I think is an even stranger than if they had simply declined to stay the ruling. The courts do not exist to insert mass confusion into law; yet this court is prepared to do just that.\n \n I also question the following analysis, which Ohioprof posted:\n \n \n\"There's a strong argument that the initiative measure should not be viewed as retroactive because it is not expressly made retroactive, and generally constitutional amendments are not retroactive,\" San Francisco Chief Deputy City Attorney Therese Stewart said last week. \"The marriages performed in the interim have a good chance of being treated as having continued validity.\"\n\n This idea of retroactivity seems strange to me. For example, when the 13th Amendment was passed, did that invalidate only slavery which might occur after the passage of the amendmnet, or did that ban all slavery, whether it initiated prior to or after the amendment's passage?\n \n In short, this really is opening up a huge can of worms that could simply have been avoided by postponing the ruling for 5 months.",

   "This is an interesting question, more complicated that one might think. If same-sex couples marry legally in California between June 17th and the time when a ban on such marriages may be voted in and take effect, what happens to those marriages?\n \n Could a constitutional amendment declaring same-sex marriages invalid be applied retroactively? The U.S. constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws has mostly been understood to apply to criminal laws, not civil laws. And while marriage seems to fall into the arena of contract law, marriage has been treated differently from other kinds of contracts in order to allow one party to get a divorce. \n \n But, if the people of a state can vote to invalidate the existing marriages of a particular class of people, does this not render marriages forever in danger of being invalidated by an act of the state?

We can make the argument that same-sex couples in California are already married. Do voters really want to invalidate those marriages, or possibly invalidate them? \n \n This decision may indeed cause a legal mess in the short run if we lose in November.

   "Six of the seven California Supreme Court justices were appointed by Republican governors, who lauded their conservative credentials. \n This same judiciary delivered the legal outcome dreaded by many members of their party -- the legalization of same-sex marriage in California and the simultaneous elevation of sexual orientation to the highest class of protection, making California the first state in the nation to adopt such a strict standard. \n \n \"The great triumph of the gay rights movement has been to transform American culture so that acceptance of gay people isn't just confined to the latte-sipping, windsurfing Democrats,\" says Andrew Koppelman, a professor of constitutional law at Northwestern University and the author of \"Same Sex, Different States.\" \n \n \"The fact that you can get this result with a court full of Republican appointees is more of a triumph than if it had been a court full of Democrats.\" \n \n Clearly, some members of the GOP aren't happy.

Not staying the decision has the great potential to cause disorder, and staying the decision could avert that potential with negligible harm. Not to mention the tax dollars it would save.\n\n \n I do not advocate the state \"altering\" civil marriage. I see the legalization of same-sex marriage not as an alteration of marriage, but as the extension of the existing institution of marriage to a class of people to whom marriage has been denied. This is an area where I strongly disagree with many of the opponents of same-sex marriage, who argue that extending marriage rights to same-sex couples will \"alter\" the institution of marriage. It doesn't do that. Extending marriage to same-sex couples simply includes people within the institution who were previously excluded. The institution of marriage in Massachusetts is the same now as it was before same-sex marriage was legalized there. The institution is the same, but gay people are now allowed to choose legal marriage to their beloved partners.\n \n I don't mean to suggest that the state should never be permitted to change the institution of civil marriage, and it has done so over the years, gradually and occasionally, by changing divorce laws, passing married women's property laws, etc. However, changing the specifics of people's rights and obligations within marriage is not the same as suddenly invalidating the marriages of a whole class of people simply because the voters don't like those people being married. The former is altering marriage itself. The latter is excluding a class of people from marriage out of animus against those people, in this example invalidating marriages that already exist legally. \n \n Let's imagine the voters in the state where you live suddenly decide to invalidate all marriages between Catholics and Protestants, out of a resurgent anti-Catholic animus and a widespread feeling that Catholics marrying Protestants have eroded true Christian faith, which most voters in your state see as Protestant. Should voters be able to invalidate the longstanding marriages between Catholics and Protestants? Do not married couples whose marriages have been recognized by the state have the right to stay married and not have their civil marriages dissolved by the voters simply because of the animus of those voters against them? \n \n Of course, in my hypothetical example of Catholic-Protestant marriages, a law suddenly invalidating those marriages would probably run afoul of the first amendment establishment clause as incorporated by the 14th amendment and applied to the states. There is no similar amendment that would protect same-sex married couples from similar treatment at the hands of voters. And there has been no Loving v. Virginia ruling protecting civil marriage between same-sex couples, as there has been protecting civil marriage between inter-racial couples. The result is that same-sex married couples, and our children, would have to live with the real possibility that a state could, at any time, suddenly invalidate our marriages. This seems like a big problem to me. \n \n Do not the rights of the parties in the legal marriage trump the powers of the state to force the dissolution of the marriage? Should not the parties in a marriage have the right, once married, to stay married, regardless of how popular sentiment about any class of people changes in the state? \n \n These are questions I put out there not just for you, but for everyone to ponder. If folks who oppose same-sex marriage are so concerned with \"protecting marriage,\" how, then, can they conceive of forcibly dissolving someone's legal marriage as \"protecting\" marriage and the family?\n \n On the \"ends justify the means\" question, I am a gay type, and my civil rights and those of my fellow gay and bisexual and transgender Americans matter more to me than \"law and order\" or saving the taxpayers money. I don't live in California, and so I am really just an outside observer to the legal developments in that state, not a participant. It's not up to me to determine how same-sex couples there keep the right to marry. I am happy however they do it, so long as they do it. If the Supreme Court ruling creates a legal mess in California, I don't care. Legal messes can be fixed, but the opportunity to win equal treatment under the law comes around usually rarely and is a precious thing.",

I dare say that no one on these boards really believes that it does.\n \n \n So you don't much care for state authority, except when you want state authority to recognize and protect same-sex marriage and give you the corresponding benefits associated with traditional marriage? That doesn't make much sense to me. Perhaps I have misunderstood your meaning though.\n \n \n Courts do not exist to throw out laws merely because they are unjust. It would have been massively incorrect and an abuse of power for the Supreme Court to hold that the Constitution forbade slavery in, say, 1857. That certainly would have been the just result; but an incorrect one nonetheless.\n \n So, in short, the Constitution was not written to give judges the power to overturn unjust laws merely because they were unjust. I think the founders did a fine job. Such a fine job do I think they did, that I would like it very much if we stuck with what they gave us, rather than what we would like them to have given us. For good or for ill, the founders did not put marriage in the Federal Constitution, and no future generation has either. So let's not go around pretending like they did.\n\n \n I think that equal protection does mean that we treat everyone equally unless there is a good reason not to. There are good reasons not to treat children as the equals of adults for many purposes, for example, because they are not yet capable of behaving like adults. There are no good reasons to exclude same-sex couples from marrying. \n \n To say that equal protection does not mean that we treat people equally is to strip the meaning out of equal protection and make it nothing. If the courts are to allow people to be treated unequally purely because of popular prejudice, then the 14th amendment has effectively been thrown out the window. The main reason the framers created the 14th amendment was to stop the unequal treatment of the former slaves who were facing a myriad of discriminatory laws and policies and practices in the South. \n \n No, the constitution does not say anything about marriage, but it does call for the equal protection of the laws. And I think that denying same-sex couples the equal right to marry, with no rational basis for such a policy beyond popular prejudice, is exactly the kind of abuse that the framers of the 14th amendment sought to prevent. They didn't envision future developments like same-sex couples marrying, but they did witness abuses against the freed slaves, and they sought to stop those kinds of abuses and prevent future abuses against anyone. And they did write the 14th amendment in broad language, to protect persons.\n \n No, courts do not or should not strike down laws simply because the laws are unjust. But they should strike down laws that deny persons the equal protection of the laws, because that's the language of the 14th amendment. The 14th amendment, like the Bill of Rights, is not absolute, and I think it's right that it be subject to a balancing test, which is what we have now. But we do need to take the 14th amendment seriously, not sweep it away by saying that it doesn't mean treating people equally. Yes, it does mean that, unless there is a good reason to treat people differently.",

   "I do not advocate the state \"altering\" civil marriage. I see the legalization of same-sex marriage not as an alteration of marriage, but as the extension of the existing institution of marriage to a class of people to whom marriage has been denied.\n\n Well, I think this clearly is altering it. But, let's just go with what you have said for the sake of argument. I still don't see the problem. If you think the state has the authority to extend marriage to a class not already included, then surely they have the authority to \"unextend\" it as well. I may be mistaken as to what you have been saying, though. Are you saying that, personally, you think it would be bad if they revoked marriage to same-sex couples after they had given it to them; or are you saying that some legal principle would prevent it? If the latter, I would disagree. If the former, well, I can't disagree that you believe something.\n \n \nHowever, changing the specifics of people's rights and obligations within marriage is not the same as suddenly invalidating the marriages of a whole class of people simply because the voters don't like those people being married. The former is altering marriage itself. The latter is excluding a class of people from marriage out of animus against those people, in this example invalidating marriages that already exist legally.\n\n Again, I think either would be altering marriage. But let's leave that aside and go with your view. I do not think you can presume that, in the event marriage is extended to same-sex couples at some date, and then is revoked at some later date, that the only reason it would have been revoked is because of animus against same-sex couples. That just cannot be reasonably maintained for the simple fact that neither you, nor I, can foresee the future.\n \n \nLet's imagine the voters in the state where you live suddenly decide to invalidate all marriages between Catholics and Protestants, out of a resurgent anti-Catholic animus and a widespread feeling that Catholics marrying Protestants have eroded true Christian faith, which most voters in your state see as Protestant. Should voters be able to invalidate the longstanding marriages between Catholics and Protestants? Do not married couples whose marriages have been recognized by the state have the right to stay married and not have their civil marriages dissolved by the voters simply because of the animus of those voters against them?\n\n Hypothetically, if there were no Federal Constitution, then certainly the voters could follow due process, and do just what you have described. I think this example is tougher because you have illustrated with a Federally protected class. The voters (through established democratic processes) created civil marriage, which implies that they are authorized to alter or abolish it. Either they were never authorized to establish marriage in the first place (in which case we should all argue that marriage be done away with as an abuse of authority), or they were authorized. And if authorized to create it, it seems to necessarily follow that they are authorized to alter or abolish it.\n \n \nDo not the rights of the parties in the legal marriage trump the powers of the state to force the dissolution of the marriage? Should not the parties in a marriage have the right, once married, to stay married, regardless of how popular sentiment about any class of people changes in the state? \n\n No. I simply cannot see the logic in saying that the state has the power and authority to create something, but does not have the power or authority to change, alter, or \"unextend\" what they have created.\n \n \nThese are questions I put out there not just for you, but for everyone to ponder. If folks who oppose same-sex marriage are so concerned with \"protecting marriage,\" how, then, can they conceive of forcibly dissolving someone's legal marriage as \"protecting\" marriage and the family?\n\n This is just a guess on my part, but those who currently use the rhetoric of \"protecting marriage\" seem to have a particular meaning to the word marriage. That meaning is that marriage is the union of one man and one woman, and can never be changed regardless of what the state happens to think.\n \n \nOn the \"ends justify the means\" question, I am a gay type, and my civil rights and those of my fellow gay and bisexual and transgender Americans matter more to me than \"law and order\" or saving the taxpayers money. I don't live in California, and so I am really just an outside observer to the legal developments in that state, not a participant. It's not up to me to determine how same-sex couples there keep the right to marry. I am happy however they do it, so long as they do it. If the Supreme Court ruling creates a legal mess in California, I don't care. Legal messes can be fixed, but the opportunity to win equal treatment under the law comes around usually rarely and is a precious thing.\n\n By hook or by crook. I respect your outlook, but I simply cannot see this approach as a good thing. And for what its worth, the legal mess I was referring to extends, potentially, far beyond California. As California does not forbid out of state couples from marrying there (at least that's my understanding), same-sex couple in other states, which by law prohibit same-sex marriage, are likely go to Califorina in order to come back to their state and open up a can of legal worms. You might find that a good thing; I find it a manifestly bad thing.",

Both of these courts were construing statutes.\n\n \n \nWe face a problem similar to one that recently confronted the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the highest court of that Canadian province, when it considered the constitutionality of the same-sex marriage ban under Canada's Federal Constitution, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Charter). See Halpern v. Toronto (City), 172 O.A.C. 276 (2003). Canada, like the United States, adopted the common law of England that civil marriage is \"the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman, to the exclusion of all others.\" Id. at, quoting Hyde v. Hyde, [1861-1873] All E.R. 175 (1866). In holding that the limitation of civil marriage to opposite- sex couples violated the Charter, the Court of Appeal refined the common-law meaning of marriage. We concur with this remedy, which is entirely consonant with established principles of jurisprudence empowering a court to refine a common-law principle in light of evolving constitutional standards. See Powers v. Wilkinson, 399 Mass. 650, 661-662 (1987) (reforming the common-law rule of construction of \"issue\"); Lewis v. Lewis, 370 Mass. 619, 629 (1976) (abolishing common-law rule of certain interspousal immunity). We construe civil marriage to mean the voluntary union of two persons as spouses, to the exclusion of all others.\n\n \n http://www.samesexmarriage.ca/docs/USA/mass_Nov182003.pdf",

I'm not so certain of this.\n\n \n Whether the California Supreme Court stays its ruling or not, the likelihood is that same-sex couples will come to California to marry and will return to their home states seeing to have their marriages recognized. I think the odds are that California voters will NOT amend their constitution, and same-sex marriage will remain legal in California. So the scenario that you find so disturbing, of same-sex couples marrying in California and then going home, is likely to happen no matter what the California Supreme Court ruled on a stay. And that makes the situation quite similar to the situation in the Loving case in the 1960s, except that getting married to a same-sex spouse or living with a same-sex spouse is not a crime in any state where spouses can be arrested, as the Lovings were arrested for living together. That's because of the ruling in Lawrence v. Texas. (Remember that Michael Hardwick was arrested in Georgia for having sex with his partner in his house, because of the then-existing Georgia sodomy law. The sodomy laws were sometimes used by the states in ways similar to the anti-miscegenation laws: to prevent relationships that the state did not approve of.) \n \n The reality is that Americans lived for years with some states recognizing inter-racial marriages and some states criminalizing those marriages or simply refusing to recognize them. We have been in this kind of circumstance before. Now we have a mishmash of state laws regarding same-sex marriages, and how that will play out legally is unclear. \n \n Can states simply refuse to recognize marriages performed in other states, using their state DOMA laws or DOMA constitutional amendments? It would appear so, as states have been refusing to recognize same-sex marriages performed in Canada. The reason states passed DOMA laws and amendments was precisely so they could avoid recognizing marriages performed in other states. The federal DOMA law was passed specifically to grant states the power to refuse to recognize marriages performed in other states. Is this constitutional (under the U.S. constitution)? I don't know, because we have not had a Supreme Court ruling on such a case up to this point. \n \n I personally hope that no one challenges the state DOMA laws in federal court anytime soon. I think we would lose in the U.S. Supreme Court, and that would be a huge setback. Losing the Bowers v. Hardwick case was a huge setback, and we are just lucky that the Supreme Court struck down the Bowers decision 17 years later. That is rare. We don't want to get a negative ruling in the U.S. Supreme Court that sets a precedent. \n \n I think we should keep working on the state level for equal marriage rights, for now. I think we need to win in California and let lots of gay people get married there. Same-sex couples in New York will be able to get married now in Mass and in California and then go home to New York and have their marriages recognized, which is, in effect, the legalization of same-sex marriage in New York. Couples can't get married in New York; but they can be married in New York if the marriage license is issued in another state. We are about to see a lot of same-sex couples getting married, and I predict that the sky will not fall. As more and more people get used to the idea that same-sex marriage does not harm opposite-sex marriage and does no harm to anyone, the opportunities to win at the state level, with voters, become greater. The important first step was to get the opportunity to marry somewhere and to keep that opportunity. We have succeeded in doing that in Mass, and we may soon succeed in doing that in California.\n \n My own view is that we need to win not just in the courts, but in the legislatures and in the hearts and minds of the people as well. If we don't, our right to marry our spouses will remain tenuous. Courts can issue rulings, but if the people don't come to support the court rulings, our hold on our rights is insecure. Winning in court can and often does help minority groups to win over the hearts and minds of the voters, but winning in court is not enough to make rights secure, in my view. We need to gain popular support for equal marriage rights. \n \n One positive sign in California is that the state legislature has already voted to legalize same-sex marriage (the governor vetoed the measure). And polls show a steady shift in attitudes among Californians toward supporting same-sex marriage.",

It's not clear at all that the Supreme Court would apply strict scrutiny in a same-sex marriage case; I doubt they would. Whether they should or not is a different question. But I don't think they will. They may not even reiterate the position that marriage is a \"fundamental right.\" \n \n I think we do best to avoid bringing any same-sex marriage cases before the U.S. Supreme Court right now. I think we will lose, and I think a loss in the Supreme Court will set us back terribly. I think we should work on securing marriage rights in California, and then work on the state level, perhaps seeking to get states with civil union laws to agree to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. That's a way to expand marriage rights to more states, by getting them to recognize marriages performed in California and Massachusetts and in Canada also. I think we should also work to get states with civil union laws to move toward full marriage rights, using state legislatures for this purpose. It's a piecemeal approach, certainly, but I think we need to use the marriage rights we have won to move popular opinion in our favor. I think we don't want to lose in the Supreme Court.",

   "So Massachusetts did not have a statute specifically defining marriage, thus they assumed the common law definition. I've read a lot of these cases and sometimes get mixed up. I'm still fairly certain that California had a statutory definition though. I'm too lazy to look it up mainly because it doesn't matter to the point that I was making, which is that the voters have the authority to alter or \"unextend\" marriage by statutes or constitutional amendments. But thanks for correcting my error about Massachusetts.\n\n \n Phyllis: I'm sorry I didn't respond sooner. I'm quite sure all the states use the common law definition of marriage. My link said the U.S. adopted the English common law definition, like Canada. So, the courts are acting accordingly, as it was meant to be. If that weren't the case, and the court was acting inappropriately, I'm sure those against equal marriage for same-sex couples, would have made that case, loudly and often.\n \n Quite right of course, your point on the constitutional amendment option. If it doesn't pass in California, then I see perhaps a similarity to here in Canada. Other courts will recognize that the common law definition of marriage is changed in the U.S. It will move from state to state, as it moved here from province to province. There will be increased pressure on the federal government to recognize equal marriage of same-sex couples. It will become very difficult to put the genie back in the bottle. People will see that no harm is being done. Opponents will be on the defensive, and their arguments about someone marrying a cat, will become stale, if that hasn't already happened.",

The focus was on how the relationships were affected by common causes of marital strife like housework, sex and money.\n \n \"Notably, same-sex relationships, whether between men or women, were far more egalitarian than heterosexual ones. In heterosexual couples, women did far more of the housework; men were more likely to have the financial responsibility; and men were more likely to initiate sex, while women were more likely to refuse it or to start a conversation about problems in the relationship. With same-sex couples, of course, none of these dichotomies were possible, and the partners tended to share the burdens far more equally.\n \n \"While the gay and lesbian couples had about the same rate of conflict as the heterosexual ones, they appeared to have more relationship satisfaction, suggesting that the inequality of opposite-sex relationships can take a toll.....\"",

   "The problem with stability within the family unit is not economic. But this discussion likely doesn't belong here.\n\n \n It's true there are social, demographic and political factors at work as well, but none of these are easily controlled by legislative fiat, either. Societies evolve culturally and technologically, and change is unavoidable.\n \n \nThe state cannot possibly respect the needs and desires of all its citizens. The CA supreme court decision does not relflect a respect of the needs and desires of all the citizens of California, as is evidenced by many citizens' outrage at the ruling, and many citizens' opposition to same-sex marriage in general.\n\n \n Why not? The state should leave people alone, for the most part. That's all that respect means here. Citizens have a right to be outraged by whatever it pleases them to rage about, but the state has a responsibility to ALL the citizens, not just the ones busy being outraged by someone else's existence and exercise of rights.\n \n \nEqual protection does not, and cannot, possibly mean that we treat everyone equally. I dare say that no one on these boards really believes that it does.\n\n \n It does mean treating them equally whenever it makes sense to treat them equally, and not singling out groups for special mistreatment because of the outrage of bigots. The state has no responsibility to cater to bigotry when it harms minorities and their basic rights. It's the proper function of the courts to protect minorities.\n \n \nSo you don't much care for state authority, except when you want state authority to recognize and protect same-sex marriage and give you the corresponding benefits associated with traditional marriage? That doesn't make much sense to me. Perhaps I have misunderstood your meaning though.\n\n \n I am a skeptic of authority and a convinced anti-authoritarian. My attitude towards authority is to question it rigorously, and force it to prove its case. The case against equal rights for gay people has never even been made rationally. Just because a state commands something, or a legislature passes it, does not mean the law demands respect or obedience. The law must also have a reasonable purpose, and treat people justly.\n \n People aren't equal in many ways, but I have yet to see the difference between a gay and straight marriage, beyond the relative sex of the spouses. Legally, there is, or should be, no difference at all, because the relationship is broadly the same for gays and straights.\n \n \nCourts do not exist to throw out laws merely because they are unjust. It would have been massively incorrect and an abuse of power for the Supreme Court to hold that the Constitution forbade slavery in, say, 1857. That certainly would have been the just result; but an incorrect one nonetheless.\n\n \n If the injustice is arguably an unconstitutional infringement of basic rights, then yes, I'd say the courts are right to revoke such laws and cause the legislature to think again. Legislators are inherently no more likely to do right than courts. The court would, in my view from the modern day, have been right to ban slavery as unconstitutional. That would have been a reasonable exercise of its powers, as they are seen today. Presumably the court of that day did not see it that way, but that doesn't mean they were right.\n \n \nSo, in short, the Constitution was not written to give judges the power to overturn unjust laws merely because they were unjust. I think the founders did a fine job. Such a fine job do I think they did, that I would like it very much if we stuck with what they gave us, rather than what we would like them to have given us. For good or for ill, the founders did not put marriage in the Federal Constitution, and no future generation has either. So let's not go around pretending like they did.\n\n \n I do not ask courts to overturn unjust laws merely because they treat everyone unjustly. Phyllis, you seemingly forget that gay rights activists do not claim that marriage as such is a constitutionally protected right -- the Supreme Court did that. However, although marriage is now considered a recognised right that the government cannot forbid for consenting adults (can you imagine the uproar and outrage if government did try to ban marriage for straights?), the state is merely not constitutionally obligated to regulate or even recognise it for the purposes of government. It chooses to do so for social convenience... but mostly, so far, for straight people only. \n \n The position of activists is that if the state chooses to regulate and recognise marriage, then it is constitutionally obligated to treat gay people with the same consideration and respect they choose to extend to straight people, and not single them out as strangers to the law, an argument the Court accepted in Romer v. Evans. If the government chooses to extend legal protections to straight marriages, how can it not extend them to gay ones, once the need is clear? You take your rights with respect to marriage law for granted, because no-one has ever thought to challenge them, yet you contentedly countenance the separation of gay Americans from the protection of US laws, even criticising judges for protecting minority rights, because a majority of bigots, so far, have demanded it.\n \n That's not a Constitution worth living under.",
