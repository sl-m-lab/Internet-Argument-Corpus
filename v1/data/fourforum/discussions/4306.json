   "Unkerpaulie,\n \n According to Pope John Paul II, the answer to your questions lies in the separation of the physical and the spiritual -\n \n \n6. With man, then, we find ourselves in the presence of an ontological difference, an ontological leap, one could say. However, does not the posing of such ontological discontinuity run counter to that physical continuity which seems to be the main thread of research into evolution in the field of physics and chemistry? Consideration of the method used in the various branches of knowledge makes it possible to reconcile two points of view which would seem irreconcilable. The sciences of observation describe and measure the multiple manifestations of life with increasing precision and correlate them with the time line. The moment of transition into the spiritual cannot be the object of this kind of observation, which nevertheless can discover at the experimental level a series of very valuable signs indicating what is specific to the human being. But the experience of metaphysical knowledge, of self-awareness and self-reflection, of moral conscience, freedom, or again, of aesthetic and religious experience, falls within the competence of philosophical analysis and reflection while theology brings out its ultimate meaning according to the Creator's plans. \n \n \n This is essentially how I perceive the two coexisting. Science is restricted to the physical, testable, and observable, religion is not. Based on that, I can wrap my head around \"theistic evolution\" or \"creationist evolution\" in so much as that God is working on the spiritual plane, while his work in the physical plane is done through evolution. \n \n Essentially, Genesis is allegorical in terms of the physical world and science, but at the same time, may be taken as literal in its laying of all the necessary groundwork in terms of man's spirituality.\n \n That's it, that's all, there ain't no more. :p\n \n Waxy",

He either created everything, or the conditions for new things to be made.\n\n according to science, the land and sea is a product of a massive iron-rich chunk of material spinning and cooling to form a spherical planet. science also suggests that the sky is present because of the gravitational force that the earth has on the air. science also tells us that all living things came from one common ancestor. what part did God play in all of this?\n \n \nYes. The better question is, did it happen just like in Genises? I don't think so.\n\n do we have any clue as to what caused this fall? is there even a seed of truth in genesis about any events that took place?\n \n \nMany of these stories are true, and have been proven true.

If he didn't perform miracles, who would have believed him? The difference is, Jesus uses his miracles for the good of the people, not to punish them.\n\n this same logic could apply to the israelites of the old testament. if God didnt perform miracles, what would that say of their God? why would the surrounding nemy nations respect them if they didnt have access to a miracle working God? in the old testament, God's power was used to protect the israelites about as much as it was used to dish out punishment. who would have believed God was with moses/noah/abraham etc if not for miracles?",

   " I was just referring you her/his catholic education which is (in catholic school) mostly based on Creation... \n\n Not sure where you got that idea. Here are some remarks made by Pope John Paul II in an address to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences by on October 22, 1996.\n \nIn his encyclical \"Humani Generis\" (1950) my predecessor Pius XII had already stated that there was no opposition between evolution and the doctrine of the faith about man and his vocation.\n\n He continued later with:\n \nToday, almost half a century after the publication of the encyclical, new knowledge has led to the recognition of the theory of evolution as more than a hypothesis. It is indeed remarkable that this theory has been progressively accepted by researchers, following a series of discoveries in various fields of knowledge. The convergence, neither sought nor fabricated, of the results of work that was conducted independently is in itself a significant argument in favor of the theory.\n\n I have been quite familiar with how science has been taught in Catholic Schools in the past. I began my education in biology in a Catholic school and I began my teaching career teaching biology in a Catholic school. I can assure you that the teaching of biology and science isn't based on creation. If that was your experience then I would think that it was the exception rather than the rule and that your teacher didn't understand either biology or Catholic faith very well.",

   "I appreciate that you said that because you are one of the few Creationits who realize that nothing the bible says is completely proven and a fact... it's not the infallible word of God... it's a book my humans and that IS a fact...\n \n And the examples you gave (Tower, Noah) only state that... I really like your opinion and really appreciate that...\n\n \n Thank You!\n And, to answer a few of your questions, I am a guy, :p , and I most certainly am a creationist, just not in the conventional sense. Essentially, my belief is that God purposefully created the circumstances which allow evolution to take place. \n The teachers in my Catholic school completely ignored evolutionism. Not that they mentioned God often in any science class, though.\n \n Finally, unkerpaulie, It's not that God didn't perform miracles for the Israelites, it's just that some of the stories are obvioulsy explanations for things they didn't understand back then (Babel), while others probably did happen (the Seven Plauges on Egypt, The Ten Commandments,). While there is no sure fire way to seperate the fact from the slightly exaggerated( :) ), a little reason goes a long way.\n Thanks again for your questions. As I said, they only help me.",

   "The teachers in my Catholic school completely ignored evolutionism.\n\n How surprising. It seems that the quality of Catholic education has declined a great deal since my experiences. The efforts to \"catch up with the Russians\" prompted the revisions of the science curriculum in the early 60s. All of the Catholic high schools with which I am familiar used the BSCS texts, the high track of which was evolution and bio-chem based. The low track had much less evolution because the concepts were more difficult.\n \n By the way, shortej, I think you mean that they ignored evolution. It isn't a philosophy but a scientific theory - the theory of evolution. Use of the term \"evolutionism\" is an effort by creationists to degrade science to the level of creationism, which is an -ism.",

Not that they mentioned God often in any science class, though.\n\n fair enough. of course the problem is that as far as evolution is concerned, it would proceed as it is right now with or without any \"guidance\" from God. but there really is no evidence for or against this, and while such guidance is unnecessary and need not even be considered, it cannot be disproven either (like many things pertaining to God)\n \n \nFinally, unkerpaulie, It's not that God didn't perform miracles for the Israelites, it's just that some of the stories are obvioulsy explanations for things they didn't understand back then (Babel), while others probably did happen (the Seven Plauges on Egypt, The Ten Commandments,).

As I said, they only help me.\n\n did any of the miracles actually take place? i mean we can take it that they were in egypt and all exodused out of there. but did God part the red sea and then kill the egyptians that tried to follow? and we can accept that crossed the Jordan river and defeated Jericho. but did God stop the river for them to cross, and cause the walls to suddenly fall when they marched around the city? and its likely that they had to fight the phillistines, amaleklites and everybody else that occupied those areas, and win those battles. but did they miraculously defeat their enemies as described? exactly what part did God actually play in any of this?",
