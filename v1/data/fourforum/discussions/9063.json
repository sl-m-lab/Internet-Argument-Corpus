   "To those who don't share your belifs or history. Your damned church does not get to lay claim to all that is good.\n\n \n I do not propose that the Church is responsible for all that is Good, though Jesus Christ is. But I do not want modernity to forget and continually attempt to erase the contributions Christianity has made to civilization. \n \n What did you think of the excerpt I provided on the other thread? Do you not think that Christianity announced women as warranting better treatment? Specifically, in relation to its prohibition against polygamy, its endorsement of lifelong marriage, and their implications for abortion and stranding women alone raising children? Here is a slightly expanded version of that quote:\n \n \"The idea that a human being per se has an inherent dignity began with the Jews. It is well-known that the ancient Israelites were unique in insisting that their God was not merely one tribal deity among others, but was the very Creator of the universe in whose image all men were made. \n \n What is perhaps less widely realized is that this distinctive metaphysical conception of God served as the foundation of a distinctive moral outlook. For given that every human being reflects the image of God Himself, it follows that every human being has a worth that surpasses that of anything else in creation, and that every human being is, in this respect, of equal worth. Moreover, this God-being an omniscient Lawgiver-commands all men to act in a manner consistent with their unique status, and will hold those accountable who fail to do so. The Jewish conception of God has, accordingly, often been described as an \"ethical monotheism\": No arid philosophical abstraction, it calls on men to change their behavior toward each other as well as their opinions about the nature of the divine... \n \n The social and political consequences of this lofty vision of human beings' place in the cosmic scheme of things were dramatic. The shabby treatment afforded the poor, the crippled and diseased, and the otherwise powerless in pre-Christian pagan societies was no longer considered morally tolerable. The Roman practices of gladiatorial combat, infanticide, and infant abandonment were abolished, as was abortion. The sexual act was no longer to be treated as a means by which a man might exert his dominance over women and other men (and, now and then, perhaps pro-create, too), but was elevated to the status of a physical manifestation of a marital love mirroring that of Christ for His Church. Fornication and adultery were prohibited for men no less than for women, and divorce and polygamy were condemned as incompatible with respect for the dignity of marriage. \n \n For these and other reasons, the status of women improved immeasurably. Wives could no longer be regarded as the property of their husbands, or as mere breeding machines or instruments for personal pleasure. A man was now expected to find release for his sexual appetites only under the condition that he bind himself to one woman for life, forsaking all others and undertaking not only to provide for her and for every child that might be born as a result of their union, but to love and sacrifice for her as Christ had for him. \n \n Feminists who somehow see in this a paradigm of sexist oppression fail to realize how vastly superior it was historically to the status of women in every culture outside the Judeo-Christian tradition. Indeed, the improvements that have occurred in such cultures-the abolition of sati (the practice of a widow immolating herself on her husband's funeral pyre), foot binding, and clitoridectomy, for instance-have typically come about precisely as a result of the influence of that tradition. And as Alvin Schmidt documents at length in Under the Influence: How Christianity Transformed Civilization , the Judeo-Christian tradition is the direct source of all of the moral reforms concerning the treatment of the individual-such as the abolition of slavery-that modern Westerners take for granted, and that have spread from the West to much of the rest of the world.\"",

The fact that Judaism was the first to practice monotheism? So I guess folks before the Jews were unable to comprehend the 'self' eh? This is kinda scuppered when transferring it to the Trinity anyway. \n \n And I like the fact that the article feels the need to baselessly slag of Islam as well, despite it having nothing to do with the subject matter.\n \n Of course the article makes no mention that documented human rights had been declared by Mesopotamia (Mesopotamian in religion) and Persia (Zoroastrianism) long before Judaism anyway.

   "Just because your freakin religion treated women better than some others does not mean they were the only ones to ever treat women well. Egyptian women could own property. Some native tribes let women lead. \n \n And the truth about women in history, changes to how women were perceived, treated, and the amount of power they weilded, were created by by women.\n \n Maybe your religion decided to be a little nicer to the their wives - - but it was women themselves who would demand and end up winning - the right to READ, to VOTE, to OWN PROPERTY, to MAKE A LIVING DOING WHAT THEY WANTED TO, to SPEAK, to SPEAK OUT, and to DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO BE MOTHERS.\n \n Your church is actually in OPPOSITION with what I consider MY human rights. Get over you patriarchal self. You aren't special because somewhere in your history you decided to be nice to women. It's incredible that we continue to like your sorry asses after it took so long, and in some ways and in some places we continue to fight for the same rights our male counterparts have.\n \n You know - I can't help but think of predominantly Catholic Mexico.

   "As a historian, I am at least somewhat with Maximus on this. Early on, Christianity was referred to as the religion 'of women and slaves'. \n \n I think there is all too often a disconnect between true Christianity (which is all about compassion) the way it's carried out. For sure, modern groups professing to be Christian have dropped the ball and have gotten sidetracked from being compassionate. The Religion Right is one such example, as is the Catholic Church at times.\n \n Another problem though, is that it is the abuses that always seem the most visible because they seem to get \"the most press.\" Robertson, Phelps, the Pope, the SBC, etc. are all very public and visible entities and so the things they say and do tend to be taken as representative of all of Christianity. But if one truly and honestly wants to get to the truth, it doesn't take a lot of research to find that there are literally thousands of Christian charities and humanitarian organizations out there doing honest and compassionate work and helping people in the world. They are there in large numbers; they just that they don't make the news. The media (and it's viewers) just don't think of helping women, helping the poor, and the poverty-stricken as sensational. They'd rather zero in on the cases where some Christian groups take politically controversial stances or simply fail in living out the Christian way of life.",

The fact that Judaism was the first to practice monotheism? So I guess folks before the Jews were unable to comprehend the 'self' eh? This is kinda scuppered when transferring it to the Trinity anyway. \n \n And I like the fact that the article feels the need to baselessly slag of Islam as well, despite it having nothing to do with the subject matter.\n \n Of course the article makes no mention that documented human rights had been declared by Mesopotamia (Mesopotamian in religion) and Persia (Zoroastrianism) long before Judaism anyway. No, we wouldn't like anything like 'facts' get in the way of inventing more stuff to attribute to 'God'...\n\n I would be interested to hear more about the human rights of Zoroastrianism. \n \n Islam is mentioned because it doesn't do a very good job with human rights.",

   "Just because your freakin religion treated women better than some others does not mean they were the only ones to ever treat women well. Egyptian women could own property. Some native tribes let women lead. \n \n And the truth about women in history, changes to how women were perceived, treated, and the amount of power they weilded, were created by by women.\n \n Maybe your religion decided to be a little nicer to the their wives - - but it was women themselves who would demand and end up winning - the right to READ, to VOTE, to OWN PROPERTY, to MAKE A LIVING DOING WHAT THEY WANTED TO, to SPEAK, to SPEAK OUT, and to DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO BE MOTHERS.\n \n Your church is actually in OPPOSITION with what I consider MY human rights. Get over you patriarchal self. You aren't special because somewhere in your history you decided to be nice to women. It's incredible that we continue to like your sorry asses after it took so long, and in some ways and in some places we continue to fight for the same rights our male counterparts have.\n \n You know - I can't help but think of predominantly Catholic Mexico. I was married to Mexican man and lived for 6 years in a primarily Mexican community. I saw EXACTLY how they treated their women. A cage is cage - no matter how \"safe\" it is, pretty it is, or comfortable it is - nobody wants to live there.\n\n Thank you for acknowledging that Christianity is nicer to women than some other religions. Yes, women have definitely had to fight for their rights. But Jesus and Christianity proclaimed them very early on--watch for a later post.\n \n Did your husband treat you badly due to his Catholicism?",

   "women had the same rights as men in the Greco-Roman Culture. Christianity simply absorbed the ethical values of the Greeks. When the Church was the dominant influence in Europe was during the well named Dark Ages of feudalism. The Church as always has been dogmatic, totalitarian in its methods, witness the Inquisition, and has always considered women second class humans.\n The Church become not only an spiritual but also a temporal power. In Western Europe. Europe libertarian and humanistic values began with the Renaissance, when Greek culture was re-discovered and continued with the Enlightenment and the heritage of the French Revolution where the Church was in cahoots as in all Catholic Europe with the rulers of the opressed. \n And when it comes to slavery Christian Britain and Christian America were enthusiatic slavers.\n So much for the humanitarian, libertarian heritage of Christianity.\n\n Women second class citizens? The value of women began with the re-discovery of Greek culture in the Renaissance?\n \n John 4\n 1The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John, 2although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples. 3When the Lord learned of this, he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee. \n 4Now he had to go through Samaria. 5So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph. 6Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour. \n 7When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, \"Will you give me a drink?\" ...\n 9The Samaritan woman said to him, \"You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?\" (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.[a]) \n 10Jesus answered her, \"If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.\" \n 11\"Sir,\" the woman said, \"you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? 12Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his flocks and herds?\" \n 13Jesus answered, \"Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, 14but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.\" \n 15The woman said to him, \"Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.\" \n 16He told her, \"Go, call your husband and come back.\" \n 17\"I have no husband,\" she replied. \n Jesus said to her, \"You are right when you say you have no husband. 18The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.\" \n 19\"Sir,\" the woman said, \"I can see that you are a prophet. 20Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.\" \n 21Jesus declared, \"Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. 22You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews. 23Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. 24God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.\" \n 25The woman said, \"I know that Messiah\" (called Christ) \"is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.\" \n 26Then Jesus declared, \"I who speak to you am he.\"\n 27Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, \"What do you want?\" or \"Why are you talking with her?\" \n 28Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, 29\"Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ[b]?\" 30They came out of the town and made their way toward him... \n 39Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, \"He told me everything I ever did.\" 40So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. 41And because of his words many more became believers. \n 42They said to the woman, \"We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.\"\n \n John 8\n 1But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. 3The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group 4and said to Jesus, \"Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. 5In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?\" 6They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. \n But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. 7When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, \"If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.\" 8Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. \n 9At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. 10Jesus straightened up and asked her, \"Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\" \n 11\"No one, sir,\" she said. \n \"Then neither do I condemn you,\" Jesus declared. \"Go now and leave your life of sin.\"\n \n Ephesians 5\n \n 21 Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. \n 22Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. 23For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. 24Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. \n 25Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her 26to make her holy, cleansing[1] her by the washing with water through the word, 27and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. 28In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 29After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church-- 30for we are members of his body. 31\"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\"[2] 32This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church. 33However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.",

   "Exactly the splinter groups rule by intimidation. Whereas in Muslim countries, polygamy is sanctioned by the Islam and the government does not interfere when men choose to have several wives. Polygamy is not practised by a tiny splinter groups of muslims who rule their areas by intimidation, it is sanctioned by the majority faith and the government.\n \n In the West, while muslim men may be only legally allowed to have one wife, some will have several wives illegally by marrying them in a muslim religious ceremony.\n \n You are of course joking about the 14 years as legal age in Utah ?\n\n \n No, I am not. It recently got changed to 16 I think. However, there are a numerous people who are in pologmous marriages in Utah, and elsewhere in the midwest that entered volentarily (early social conditioning I am sure). There is a great variety in the various splinter groups.. some rule by intimidation to be sure, but not all. Until 1998, the legal age was 14. \n \n Believe it or not, 14 is the age of consent for girls in South Carolina and iowa. and 16 for boys. Canada just raised their age of consent from 14 to 16 this past year.",
