Completing and returning some of those 21% interest credit card offers should also be on my do list to provide additional disposable cash. I need to shake off my fiscal conservativeness and take advantage of our growing economy with the tremendous opportunities it offers through new, high paying jobs and growing equity investments.

I wonder about the definition of orderly decline as we've built another house of cards with real estate, making increasing interest rates present a scenario even scarier than than the dot.com bubble. While retiring baby boomers will partially sustain the upper-middle home market, the dollar's decline will force them to tap their beloved equity market investments to maintain a semblance of their former standard of living and upset that applecart. Lower and what's left of middle income classes are in for some pretty nasty shocks as the dollar falls without compensating income increases for those not employed by a government entity with COLA support.
