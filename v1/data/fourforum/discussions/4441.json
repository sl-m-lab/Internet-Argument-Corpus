The major rule was that we followed the household rules. As I became older, I believe age 14 or so, I seriously questioned why my parents could make the rules and I had no input. My father pointed to the roof and stated as long as we were living under that roof and he and my mother were responsible for us, he had final say on the rules. Naturally that prompted me and a friend to run away from home, which lasted until about 10PM that night, when we decided the rules weren't all that bad considering that they were made by adults. I didn't realize it at the time, but that was probably when I accepted the fact that there were rules and what I did within those structures was my decision and would determine my course in life.",

I enjoy reading and do it when I can (usually right before bed for 45 minutes or so). I just think it's more important to understand the concept in terms of math then just be able to do it since you've done it repeatedly. That's why I don't like cramming for tests and why repetition shouldn't be how math is done (apart from multiplication tables, people should be able to multiply in their head). I never have the problem of keeping busy considering we have baseball practice and I don't get home until 6:30. After dinner it's 7:00-7:30 and I have homework and piano (40 minutes) to do. I'm lucky if I have time to do other stuff after that.",
