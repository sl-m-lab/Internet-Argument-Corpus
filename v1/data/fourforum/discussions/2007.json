   "BUSH ADMINISTRATION RESORTS TO LIES ABOUT 9/11\n \n With President Bush's former top counterterrorism expert Richard Clarke\n issuing well-documented criticisms of the White House's failure to defend\n America, the Administration has resorted to outright lies and distortions\n about its record. The president himself once again tried to deflect\n criticism, saying \"had my administration had any information that terrorists\n were going to attack New York City on September the 11\" (1) - a statement\n designed to deflect attention from the specific warnings that he personally\n received outlining an imminent Al Qaeda attack (2) that could involve\n hijacked planes (3) being used as missiles (4).\n \n Here are four other explicit lies that the Administration has told over the\n last few days:\n \n LIE: National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice claimed that Clarke \"chose\n not to\" (5) voice his concerns about the Administration's counterterrorism\n policy. But Clarke sent an urgent memo to Rice in January 2001 asking for a\n Cabinet-level meeting about an imminent Al Qaeda attack (6). The White House\n itself admits top Bush officials rejected Clarke's request, saying they \"did\n not need to have a formal meeting to discuss the threat.\" (7)\n \n LIE: White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan yesterday denied Clarke's\n charge that the president ordered the Pentagon to begin drafting plans to\n invade Iraq immediately after 9/11. (8) But according to the Washington\n Post, \"six days after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the\n Pentagon, President Bush signed a 2-and-a-half-page document\" that \"directed\n the Pentagon to begin planning military options for an invasion of Iraq.\"\n (9) This was corroborated by a September 2002 CBS News report which reported\n that, immediately after 9/11, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told \"aides\n to come up with plans for striking Iraq.\" (10)\n \n LIE: Deputy National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley denied Clarke's charge\n that there was an imminent domestic threat against America from Al Qaeda,\n saying, \"All the chatter [before 9/11] was of an attack, a potential Al\n Qaeda attack overseas.\" (11) But, according to the bipartisan Congressional\n report on 9/11, \"In May 2001, the intelligence community obtained a report\n that Bin Laden supporters were planning to infiltrate the United States\" to\n \"carry out a terrorist operation using high explosives.\" The report \"was\n included in an intelligence report for senior government officials in August\n [2001].\" (12)\n \n LIE: Bush National Security spokesman Jim Wilkinson claimed that \"it was\n this president who expedited the deployment of the armed Predator\" (the\n unmanned plane) (13). But, according to Newsweek, it was the Bush\n Administration who \"elected not to relaunch the Predator\" and who did not\n deploy the new armed version of it despite \"the military having successfully\n tested an armed Predator throughout the first half of 2001.\" (14)\n \n Sources:\n 1.

   "Secondly, you forget that the 9-11 platform is looking at not one but two administrations. Also, look back at the atmosphere surrounding Bush since his inaugration in January. He was regarded as a misfit president, one who had gotten in just based on his name. If he had tried to push through a war to remove Osama or decaptitate al-quida, would the american public have supported him? Remember, people protested even after 9-11 when he went into Afghanistan for that same reason. Stricter regulations/flight control? People would have called him paranoid, or even a dictator. Look at how people react now to the whole airport security thing.\n \n The panel found that the Clinton administration had reasonable intelligence to pinpoint Osama at least 5 times between 1997 and 1999, but failed to act. If anyone should be blamed, it should be him. He launched a stupid cruise missile strike at training camps after the bombing of the USS Cole. He didn't do diddly squat after embassy bombings, a world trade center bombing, etc. Who is to blame? I'd say the Democrats for cutting intelligence spending so much after the end of the Cold War. They do not understand that we have reached a new war, a war in which an invisible enemy seeks to bring down nations.",

   "Does anyone actually think that Clarke is credible? Come on, do a little research about him. How about wildly conflicting statements he's made about the 2 administrations? In 2002-03, he had nothing but praise for Bush's handling of the war on terror, and said that Clinton didn't do neary enough. So along comes a book deal from a liberal company (Viacom...which intersestingly enough owns 60 Minutes) and his story flip-flops completely. Just listening to the man, you know he's an egomaniacal disgruntled ex-employee. He got demoted in the new administration and he was ******, that's all.\n \n Jim, where did you get your info? I'm not doubting it, I've heard this too, I just want to know where you find this out.",
