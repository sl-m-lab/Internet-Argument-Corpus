   "From 1962-'65 I was a pilot on a C-130 E in the Air Force. 41st ATS, Charleston, AFB, SC. One of our most important missions was to transport bodies of servicemen and women from Vietnam back to Dover AFB. Some of you will recall that film was available for all to see the arrivals. This was unpopular at the time but shed light on what was going on in Southeast Asia. Pictures brought reality to Americans the way nothing else could do.\n \n On March 19, 2008, Air Force Staff Sgt. Phillip Myers was pinned with the Bronze Star. He was awarded for his efforts in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n \n On Saturday, Myers, now 30, was killed by an IED near Helmand province, Afghanistan.\n \n When this veteran came home Sunday night, the arrival of his flag-covered coffin was recorded by the media, the first American casualty so greeted after the ban on photographing the war dead was lifted by President Barack Obama.\n \n To the family of Myers, sincere condolences. And to his family, appreciation for sharing his solemn arrival. We, as a nation, should see this cost of war, in images that bring home the sacrifice.\n \n The ban on photographing our war dead came in 1991 when President George H.W. Bush said he wanted to shield grieving families during the Persian Gulf War. The ban remained when the war on terror began, and the site of flag-draped coffins across the tarmac at Dover Air Force Base became a much more common sight.\n \n Who was shielded? The families or the government that sent those men and women into harm's way?\n \n The Pentagon lifted the ban after President Obama asked for a review of it. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the ban made him uncomfortable.\n The ban, however, was more than uncomfortable. We need no urging to tally up the financial cost of these wars. The human cost is tallied in numbers of casualties, a four-digit number that might bring us to anger. The image of a family's sacrifice might bring us to tears, a much more fitting reaction.\n \n The American public should see the cost, such as when a flag-draped coffin is lifted from the transport and carried to a waiting hearse.\n \n The administration agreed that the Pentagon would need permission from the family of the fallen serviceman or woman before the media would be allowed to cover the ceremony. That is fair. In the rawness of the most horrible news, the attention could seem intrusive.\n \n But when a hero comes home, we need to know how his story ends. It's the least we can offer to the likes of Staff Sgt. Phillip Myers. That and our most heartfelt gratitude.",

I was at a high profile funeral a few years ago and the family was upset that people were taking pictures. The congregation formed a human wall to block the photographers and some guy went to his car and got a ladder to see over us! It was a disgrace.",

Didn't Obama say something about bringing our troops back after he was elected?\n\n \n I would use the analogy of trying to deal with a victim of impalation - you wouldn't have stuck the thing in but you know you can't pull it out without careful preparation. The hope is that Iraq is now on its way to the Emergency Room rather than having some thug twisting the implement to keep the patient occupied while he goes through his pockets.\n \n That said, Obama seems as keen on the war in Afghanistan as Bush was, and I have no desire to defend him on that score. The point remains that Bush began these misadventures and must take responsibility for the deaths that resulted.",
