Know you know why Jefferson gave us freedom and liberty from government. Welcome to your very first lesson in political philosophy\n\n \n \n \n Conservatism: The Politics Of Ignorance and Self-Interest\n \n The Goals Of Any Legitimate Political Philosophy\n Thomas Jefferson declared in the Declaration of Independence that the purpose of government is to secure for all persons subject to it, the rights, among others, of \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" Just what these words mean have been the source of a great deal of discussion and debate in the centuries since they were written. How government best secures those rights for its citizens was never defined by Jefferson or the other thinkers from whom he drew is ideas, but I believe that most would agree that inasmuch as government affects economic activity as well as popular culture, a reasonable philosophy of government has to consider these influences as well. So in my mind, the government governs best which secures for the greatest number of its subjects the greatest good. In this essay, we will assume that all the people are equal before the law, have certain basic inalienable rights, and the purpose of government is to benefit as many people as possible, to the greatest extent possible, without prejudice on the basis of class.\n Having stated that as our goal, I would have to say that it will be our touchstone, if a proposal fails to adequately meet that test, it is not worthy of further consideration without modification.\n \n For example of how this 'touchstone' process works, a few years ago, a bill was passed in Congress and signed by President Reagan which allows the manufacturers of fertilizer to add toxic chemical waste to those fertilizers if that waste contains micronutrients that are useful to the plants to which the fertilizer is to be applied. The wastes are allowed to be added even if they contain other components that are dangerous, bad for the plants, or damaging to the land to which they are applied, or even toxic to humans if absorbed by food plants. Manufacturers of such fertilizer are specifically absolved of legal responsibility for damages, disease or death caused by the use of the product. Additionally, such fertilizers need not be so labeled, and are widely sold in the U.S. today. The majority of fertilizers sold, even in garden centers for use by the general public, have such contaminants.\n \n How does this law meet the touchstone requirement? Here's how it stacks up as I see it:\n \n Those who benefit: \n \n \n Manufacturers who create toxic waste and need a means of disposal.\n \n Fertilizer manufacturers who take a subsidy from the source of the toxic waste.\n \n Politicians who take campaign money from the above.\n \n A very small number of farmers and gardeners who may happen to benefit from the addition of certain needed micronutrients, who happen to have not gotten a batch that contained those nutrients, but didn't contain other, more toxic components. \n Those who are harmed:\n \n \n Purchasers who want to know the components of the fertilizer they are buying.\n \n Consumers of the food grown with those fertilizers, who may be poisoned by it.\n \n Owners of the land, who have no way of knowing that the fertilizer they are using is damaging their land, often permanently and irreparably.\n \n Future generations who have to deal with the toxic waste sites created by the innocent use of fertilizers containing permanently polluting contaminants.\n \n In the example cited above, clearly the number of people damaged by the law is much greater than the number who benefit by it. It therefore clearly fails the 'greatest good for the greatest number' touchstone test.\n \n The way a political philosophy is put together is by the means of resolving apparent contradictions. For a philosophy to be useful, it has to be somewhat predictive; i.e., it must describe what would happen in the general circumstances in which it is applied. About the only way this can be done is to resolve apparent contradictions.\n \n A word of warning here: humans are fallible. Because they are fallible, there will always be contradictions in any philosophy put together by humans. It simply isn't possible to create a system of philosophy which contains no contradictions at all. Having said that, however, it is to be noted that the philosophy is most likely to be predictive that is consistent. So we should try to resolve genuine a basic inconsistency whenever possible.",

And where is your credibility? Who is here to vouch for you? \n Crickets. \n \n You obviously didn't read through the article from the link I provided.\n \n \n The founding fathers had lived under a system guided by Christian principles. They had lived very painfully under the effects of European style theocracies. The Pilgrims were driven from their homes in the Old World by religious persecution. Though they were Christian, they weren't apparently Christian enough for some. The Virginia House of Burgesses had established Christianity as the state religion, and had created special rights and privileges available to the Christians of that colony, that were not available to others. Similar situations occurred in other colonies. These facts so deeply grieved Thomas Jefferson, that he made it his life's work to rid the emerging American democracy of church influence. And he considered the First Amendment to be his magnum opus. He was so proud of the \"wall of separation\" (his phrase) which he built, that he had the First Amendment listed as his most proud achievement on his tombstone, even despite other great achievements, such as authorship of the Declaration of Independence.\n \n Whatever the matter, Jefferson's political ideology has little to do with the modern-day conservative movement (or should I say, \"Neo-Con Movement), founded by Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, Dick Cheney and Bill Krystol, whose parents were avid followers of Leo Strauss.\n \n From Wiki:\n Leo Strauss - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n Strauss taught that liberalism in its modern form contained within it an intrinsic tendency towards extreme relativism, which in turn led to two types of nihilism[12] The first was a \"brutal\" nihilism, expressed in Nazi and Marxist regimes. In On Tyranny, he wrote that these ideologies, both descendants of Enlightenment thought, tried to destroy all traditions, history, ethics, and moral standards and replace them by force under which nature and mankind are subjugated and conquered.[13] The second type - the \"gentle\" nihilism expressed in Western liberal democracies - was a kind of value-free aimlessness and a hedonistic \"permissive egalitarianism\", which he saw as permeating the fabric of contemporary American society.[14][15] In the belief that 20th century relativism, scientism, historicism, and nihilism were all implicated in the deterioration of modern society and philosophy, Strauss sought to uncover the philosophical pathways that had led to this situation. The resultant study led him to advocate a tentative return to classical political philosophy as a starting point for judging political action.\n \n Wrap your I.Q. around that.",

Bet or run away again with your liberal tail between your legs.\n\n \n Retard, this is well known:\n \n Sally Hemings - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \nBecause Jefferson descendants had identified Carr relatives as the father(s) of Hemings' children, few academic historians credited the paternity allegation or examined the possible relationship closely before the third quarter of the 20th century. Analysis of the historical evidence was bolstered by 1998 DNA testing that showed a match between the Jefferson male line and at least one of Sally Hemings' children. It disproved any Carr connection, and Jeffersonian scholarship has changed to reflect wide agreement that Jefferson fathered Hemings' children.\n\n \n IF you dont like wikipedia, here it is from the Monticello web page (jeffersons home...and now his museum):\n \n Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account Thomas Jefferson?s Monticello\n \n\n The study - which tested Y-chromosomal DNA samples from male-line descendants of Field Jefferson (Thomas Jefferson's uncle), John Carr (grandfather of Jefferson's Carr nephews), Eston Hemings, and Thomas C. Woodson - indicated a genetic link between the Jefferson and Hemings descendants. The results of the study established that an individual carrying the male Jefferson Y chromosome fathered Eston Hemings (born 1808), the last known child born to Sally Hemings.\n\n \n What makes this particularly weird is that Sally was inherited from Jeffersons wifes father, and Sally was his wifes half sister...thats right....Jeffersons father in law ALSO raped his slaves. \n \n Then to make matters even weirder, he kept his OWN CHILDREN as slaves. The older 2 he did finally release in 1822. The other 2 that we know of were released in his WILL...so he kept his own children as slaves until he died. There is some question of whether he was keeping them LEGALLY as slaves because at the time if you were 7/8 white, as Jeffersons children with Sally were, you were considered white and free....but he kept them as slaves. \n \n Your hero worship of Jefferson is cute. It sucks when you realize that your heros were real, live, flawed people, doesn't it? \n \n Did it not ever dawn on you that half the guys who wrote this:\n \n \nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\n\n \n Were slave owners?

   "1) a liberal will always have a low IQ\n \n Mine, at last count was 126...well above the national average.\n 2) it is well know that Liberals will hate American principles and its Founders because they lack the IQ to understand them.\n Conservatism: The Politics Of Ignorance and Self-Interest\n \n The Most Fundamental Fallacy of Conservative Philosophy\n The conservative theorist and the right-wing Libertarian theories from whom his ideas are derived, love to rail against the power of the state. The obtrusiveness of government, especially in economic matters, are the basis of the conservative's complaints about government.\n Yet the reality of life is that it is the economic power of corporations, which conservative theory ignores, that represents the greatest circumscription of personal freedom to the vast majority of people. As conservative principles are applied to government, the increasing restraint with which corporate activities are regulated means that corporations become increasingly free to tread on the personal freedoms of individuals who are powerless to stop them.\n \n Suppose, for example, a major corporation wishes to buy up property across the street to build a shopping mall. Those who already live across the street from the proposed shopping mall are in a very poor position to prevent the mall from being built and have to watch helplessly while their property values are negatively affected. Why? Because they don't have the political muscle that fighting the large corporation would take. In other words, those with the gold make the rules, and the rights of the individual property owners in reality don't matter. So even though the small property owner has the theoretical right to object, his objection will make little difference. As the zoning regulations become increasingly watered down, individual property owners are finding they have fewer and fewer options for stopping the loss of value of their principal investment, because of the greed of a major corporation.\n \n But the most serious circumscription of personal rights by corporations is in the workplace. The constitution and the bill of rights are essentially left at the workplace door. There is no freedom of speech, no freedom of assembly, no right of privacy, no right to petition for a redress of grievances, and little if any recourse for an unjust decision by management. And now, at least in Michigan and increasingly in other states, workers injured on the job are no longer entitled to compensation either for injuries or for lost income in any practical way.\n \n The conservative argument is that the worker has the right to bargain for improved conditions; but if the worker has no bargaining power, that right exists in theory only. A father with hungry mouths to feed and a single job offer has far fewer options than does a huge corporation with a massive human resources department. And when the ability to organize a union is stifled by unfavorable labor law, it isn't possible for the worker to aggregate that power.\n \n \n Dressing Up Intolerance As a Respectable Philosophy\n Put yourself in the position of the conservative Republican:\n I don't have any problem with conservatives teaching conservative Republicanism to their own kids. But I don't want them to advocate it in the public schools. And if their kids get beat up because they're conservative Republicans, that's their own fault, and they shouldn't expect any help from school officials, because conservative Republicanism is a choice, and if they want to avoid the beatings, they can quit being conservative Republicans any time they want.\n \n And if conservative Republicans want to date each other, that's fine, but if they want to make love to each other, then that ought to be against the law. After all, we do have some moral standards in this country, don't we?\n \n I think that we should allow conservative Republicans to be scout leaders and school teachers, but only of course, if we monitor them closely to make sure they don't recruit innocent young people into their foul brand of politics.\n \n I resent the way Hollywood and the press present conservative Republicanism as a respectable way to live. After all, if a person is sincere and motivated enough, he can convert himself to being a liberal democrat, and he wouldn't have to go around offending everyone and asking for special rights.\n \n And that's another thing. Special rights. I don't see why any conservative Republican should have his religious views protected by law. After all, being a conservative Republican is something I can distinguish only by behavior, and I don't see why simple behavior should qualify anyone for protected minority status. So we ought to do away with the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights.\n \n Their lifestyle offends my sense of right and wrong, so I cannot be indifferent to their claim to legitimacy. While there's some evidence that being born a conservative might be predisposed by inheritance, there's not any doubt that they could change if they want to enough, and so if they want the same rights as us liberal Democrats have, all they have to do is change.\n \n Well, this is a democracy, so I guess I'm going to have to tolerate the presence of conservative Republicans in this country. But that doesn't mean I have to endorse or accept them. So if they want to live in this country, that's fine, but they should keep it to themselves. I don't want to have to watch.\n \n Now, how does that rhetoric sound? Intolerant? Meanspirited? If you substitute 'gays' for 'conservative Republicans,' you have some common conservative rhetoric. How legitimate as a political philosophy does it sound to you? Of course I don't personally feel that way about conservatives, but aren't there more than just a few conservatives who feel that way about gays?\n \n All too often, conservative theoreticians fail to consider how their philosophies would feel if the shoe were on the other foot. If they did, they would quickly begin to see how their ideas are really designed to benefit themselves, at the expense of others who have just as legitimate a claim to a piece of the American dream as they do.\n \n \n Why Do Conservatives Believe What They Do?\n As has been mentioned, conservatives often come to their views through personal experience and familial socialization. Seldom does a conservative arrive at that point of view through rigorous intellectual discourse. Here's why:\n When you're hurt by someone, it is easy and natural to lash out at the person who hurt you. The same obviously holds true of being hurt by government. When you've been audited by the tax authorities, been fined for driving a polluting car or had difficulty getting a building permit, government is easy to blame. With government being a ubiquitous presence, it isn't surprising that large numbers of people end up being hurt by it at one time or another.\n \n Government in your mind then becomes the problem, and if others tell you that you're right in assuming that government is the problem, it isn't hard to accept an economic or social theory that agrees with that point of view. Indeed, it even becomes \"common sense\" in that the synergy of components of the emerging world view become self evident.\n \n Hence, the social theories that, on the face of it, decry \"social engineering\" (even though frequently engaging in it, usually in matters relating to sexuality or drug use), sound like a logical extension of this world view. Social problems, therefore, become the fault of a meddling government (hence the favorite conservative saying, \"a conservative is a liberal who's been mugged\"). Unfortunately, as we shall see, the world isn't quite that simple.\n \n This is especially true of conservative economic theories. Capitalist free enterprise as a model is very appealing to those who entertain this anti-government bias. Adam Smith claimed in his classic, \"The Wealth of Nations,\" that unrestrained accumulation of capital is good for the economy, because it allows the creation of large pools of investment capital. Thus, conservatives are given a reason for restraining government from intervening in the accumulation of wealth. Smith also argued that the most efficient way of arriving at the true value of a good or service is to see what price it will bring in an free and unrestrained market. Again, reason for keeping the meddling hands of government out of the market. But again, the world isn't that simple. No reasonable conservative would argue that the most efficient way to keep the price of paramedic service to a minimum, for example, is to allow the free market to set the price. When you're having a heart attack, you're not going to argue with the ambulance driver over the price of the ride to the hospital. Yet the reality is that this is what many conservatives unthinkingly propose.\n \n Conservatives often ask me, what is the problem with personal experience? Well, nothing, actually. It's perfectly fine as far as it goes. It's useful, even neccessary. The personal experience of the upper-class privileged male is just as valid as is the experience of the poor, the woman, the minority. As far as it goes.\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \"It is no accident that conservatism has arisen at the same time the public education system in the United States has declined.\n It is also no accident that conservatism is strongest in the same parts of America where education is weakest.\" \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n The problem is that personal experience is far too limited a basis on which to try to build a philosophy with which to run the world. It is my contention that no one, no matter how diverse his life experiences, is ever going to learn enough about the complexity of the world around him to build a coherent philosophy of politics in the absence of a good education. Indeed, it is the increasing rarity of good education, in my opinion, that is reason that conservatism is not only increasing in popularity, but increasing in influence as well. Liberalism, having been built over the centuries by the more educated, is more inclusive of this different knowledge, not gained by experience. And this is why conservatives have always been generally suspicious of institutions of higher learning.3) If Jefferson had relations with Sally it may have been in course of a loving relationship\n \n \n Right.

You cannot be out pursuing happiness if you have to stay at home 24/7 and guard your wife and kids against marauding bands of pirates. The primary job of Jeffersons government was to protect the people. \n \n \n \n Actually Jefferson was 100% oppposed to government. It was the only reason behind his entire political life. It is the reason he formed the Republican Party in 1794. He became the blood enemy to Washington Hamilton and Adams over this. Here are 100 quotes to get you started with the very most basics about American History:\n \n \" the natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to grain ground; that the greater the government the stronger the exploiter and the weaker the producer; that , therefore, the hope of liberty depends upon local self-governance and the vigilance of the producer class.\" \n \n \n -That government is best which governs the least, because its people discipline themselves.\n \"The path we have to pursue[when Jefferson was President ] is so quiet that we have nothing scarcely to propose to our Legislature.\"\n \n -The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not.\n \n -The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground.\n \n \" the natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to grain ground; that the greater the government the stronger the exploiter and the weaker the producer; that , therefore, the hope of liberty depends upon local self-governance and the vigilance of the producer class.\" \n \n \n -A wise and frugal government, which shall leave men free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor (read-taxes) and bread it has earned -- this is the sum of good government.\n \n -Experience hath shewn, that even under the best forms of government those entrusted with power have, in time, and by slow operations, perverted it into tyranny.\n \n -History, in general, only informs us of what bad government is.\n \n -I own that I am not a friend to a very energetic government. It is always oppressive.\n \n -I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them.\n \n -My reading of history convinces me that bad government results from too much government.\n \n -Our country is now taking so steady a course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction, to wit: by consolidation of power first, and then corruption, its necessary consequence.\n \n -Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government of himself. Can he, then be trusted with the government of others? Or have we found angels in the form of kings to govern him? Let history answer this question.\n \n -The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions that I wish it to be always kept alive.\n \n -Most bad government has grown out of too much government.\n \n -Were we directed from Washington when to sow and when to reap, we should soon want bread.\n \n -Experience hath shewn, that even under the best forms [of government] those entrusted with power have, in time, and by slow operations, perverted it into tyranny.\n \n -I think myself that we have more machinery of government than is necessary, too many parasites living on the labor of the industrious\n \"Agriculture, manufactures, commerce and navigation, the four\n pillars of our prosperity, are the most thriving when left most \n free to individual enterprise. Protection from casual \n embarrassments, however, may sometimes be seasonably interposed.\" \n --Thomas Jefferson: 1st Annual Message, 1801.\n \n \"The policy of the American government is to leave their citizens\n free, neither restraining nor aiding them in their pursuits.\"\n --Thomas Jefferson to M. L'Hommande, 1787.\n \n \"[Ours is a] policy of not embarking the public in enterprises\n better managed by individuals, and which might occupy as much\n of our time as those political duties for which the public functionaries are particularly instituted. Some money could be\n lent them [the New Orleans Canal Co.], but only on an assurance that it would be employed so as to secure the public objects.\"\n --Thomas Jefferson to W. C. C. Claiborne, 1808.\n \n \"The rights of the people to the exercise and fruits of their own industry can never be protected against the selfishness of rulers\n not subject to their control at short periods.\" --Thomas Jefferson\n to Isaac H. Tiffany, 1816.\n \n \"Our wish is that...[there be] maintained that state of property,\n equal or unequal, which results to every man from his own industry \n or that of his fathers.\" --Thomas Jefferson: 2nd Inaugural \n Address, 1805.\n \n \"To take from one because it is thought that his own industry and that of his father's has acquired too much, in order to spare to\n others, who, or whose fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of\n association--the guarantee to every one of a free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it.\" --Thomas Jefferson: Note \n in Tracy's \"Political Economy,\" 1816.\n \n \"Private enterprise manages so much better all the concerns to which it is equal.\" --Thomas Jefferson: 6th Annual Message, 1806.\n \n \"The merchants will manage [commerce] the better, the more they are left free to manage for themselves.\" --Thomas Jefferson to Gideon Granger, 1800.\n \n \n \"If ever this vast country is brought under a single government, it will be one of the most extensive corruption, indifferent and incapable of a wholesome care over so wide a spread of surface.\" --Thomas Jefferson to William T. Barry, 1822. ME 15:389 \n \n \n Some] seem to think that [civilization's] advance has brought on too complicated a state of society, and that we should gain in happiness by treading back our steps a little way. I think, myself, that we have more machinery of government than is necessary, too many parasites living on the labor of the industrious. I believe it might be much simplified to the relief of those who maintain it.\" --Thomas Jefferson to William Ludlow, 1824. ME 16:75\n \n \"Agriculture, manufactures, commerce and navigation, the four pillars of our prosperity, are the most thriving when left most free to individual enterprise. Protection from casual embarrassments, however, may sometimes be seasonably interposed.\" --Thomas Jefferson: 1st Annual Message, 1801. ME 3:337\n \n \"The power given to Congress by the Constitution does not extend to the internal regulation of the commerce of a State (that is to say, of the commerce between citizen and citizen) which remain exclusively with its own legislature, but to its external commerce only; that is to say, its commerce with another State, or with foreign nations, or with the Indian tribes.\" --Thomas Jefferson: Opinion on Bank, 1791. ME 3:147 \n \n \"Our tenet ever was that Congress had not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare, but were restrained to those specifically enumerated, and that, as it was never meant that they should provide for that welfare but by the exercise of the enumerated powers, so it could not have been meant they should raise money for purposes which the enumeration did not place under their action; consequently, that the specification of powers is a limitation of the purposes for which they may raise money. .\" - Thomas Jefferson\n \n \n \"The government of the United States [federal government] is a definite government confined to specified objects [powers]. It is not like state governments, whose powers are more general. CHARITY IS NO PART OF THE LEGISLATIVE DUTY OF THE GOVERNMENT.\"\n -James madison\n \n Jefferson: \"Congress has not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare, but only those specifically enumerated.\" \n \n Patrick Henry\n Tell me when did liberty ever exist when the sword and the purse were given up?\n \n Thomas Jefferson\n \"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\" \n \n \n I see,... and with the deepest affliction, the rapid strides with which the federal branch of our government is advancing towards the usurpation of all the rights reserved to the States, and the consolidation in itself of all powers, foreign and domestic; and that, too, by constructions which, if legitimate, leave no limits to their power... It is but too evident that the three ruling branches of [the Federal government] are in combination to strip their colleagues, the State authorities, of the powers reserved by them, and to exercise themselves all functions foreign and domestic.\" \n -- Thomas Jefferson to William Branch Giles, 1825. The Writings of Thomas Jefferson \n \n James Madison: \"If Congress can do whatever in their discretion can be done by money, and will promote the general welfare, the government is no longer a limited one, but an indefinite one subject to particular exceptions.\" \n James Madison: \"The government of the United States is a definite government, confined to specific objectives. It is not like state governments, whose powers are more general. Charity is no part of the legislative duty of the government.\" \n James Madison in Federalist paper NO. 45: \"The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce.\"\n \n \n I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion of the means. I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it.\" - Benjamin Franklin\n \n \n \"The Constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness. You have to catch it yourself.\" - Benjamin Franklin \n \n One single object... [will merit] the endless gratitude of the society: that of restraining the judges from usurping legislation. \n Thomas Jefferson, letter to Edward Livingston, March 25, 1825\n Our peculiar security is in the possession of a written Constitution. Let us not make it a blank paper by construction. \n Thomas Jefferson, letter to Wilson Nicholas, September 7, 1803\n \n \n That these are our grievances which we have thus laid before his majesty, with that freedom of language and sentiment which becomes a free people claiming their rights as derived from the laws of nature, andnot as the gift of their chief magistrate. \n Thomas Jefferson, Rights of British America, \n 1774\n \n \n \n The principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale. \n Thomas Jefferson, letter to John Taylor, May 28, 1816\n \n They are not to do anything they please to provide for the general welfare, but only to lay taxes for that purpose. To consider the latter phrase not as describing the purpose of the first, but as giving a distinct and independent power to do any act they please which may be good for the Union, would render all the preceding and subsequent enumerations of power completely useless. It would reduce the whole instrument to a single phrase, that of instituting a Congress with power to do whatever would be for the good of the United States; and as they sole judges of the good or evil, it would be also a power to do whatever evil they please...Certainly no such universal power was meant to be given them. It was intended to lace them up straightly within the enumerated powers and those without which, as means, these powers could not be carried into effect. \n Thomas Jefferson, Opinion on National Bank, 1791\n \n James Madison: \n A just security to property is not afforded by that government under which unequal taxes oppress one species of property and reward another species; where arbitrary taxes invade the domestic sanctuaries of the rich and excessive taxes grind the faces of the poor; where the keenness and competitions of want are deemed an insufficient spur to labor and taxes are again applied by an unfeeling policy as another spur; in violation of that sacred property, which Heaven, in decreeing man to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow, kindly reserved to him in the small repose that could be spared from the supply of his necessities.",

   "OF course if so why be so afraid to tell us why Jefferson was ignorant to create American around the concept freedom or liberty from governemnt?? What does your fear tell you about liberalism?\n\n \n Oh, I'm a liberal, through and through. Wouldn't have it any other way. \n And no need to distort the viewpoint of Jefferson to promote your own agenda. It was liberty from British Rule, without proper representation...the basic tenet of our Declaration of Independence. \n Wayne Besen addressed my view on Huff Post...admin forgive me for posting it in its' entirety. It's too good to truncate. \n Wayne Besen: In Defense of Liberalism\n \n It is campaign season, once again, which means conservatives, will try to paint Democrats as \"liberals,\" as if it were a dirty word. I, for one, am proud to be a liberal and believe we should stand up against these conservative smears.One of the great fallacies in modern lore is that liberalism stands for nothing and liberals have no core beliefs. The right wing, from the Pope to the President, has impugned the left by unfairly portraying it as a valueless movement mired in moral relativism.\n \n This could not be further from the truth. Indeed, the left is the backbone of freedom, the defender of personal liberty, the guarantor of free speech and religious worship and the nurturer of democratic movements across the globe. Far from believing in nothing, wherever liberal democratic values prevail, civilizations flourish and free people thrive.\n The cornerstone of liberalism is the idea that each person is endowed with the precious gift of liberty and can freely choose his or her own path - for better or worse. We believe this is crucial to greater enlightenment, personal growth and ultimate fulfillment. It also offers the best opportunity for people to realize their dreams and achieve their spiritual promise.\n \n Liberalism encourages exploration and education. It reveres science and celebrates the inquisitive mind. Indeed, liberal values are often superior to those held on the right, because they are tenaciously subjected to rigorous examination. Beliefs that are questioned and still prevail are the ones that stand the test of time.\n Like conservatism, liberalism has very strong core principles. But unlike conservatism, liberalism is not afraid to question \"the way it is.\" The fulcrum of this philosophy is that all ideas will be constantly examined, scrutinized, studied and debated. If new information emerges to counter the culture's prevailing values or understanding, it will be rightfully taken into account. Far from moral relativism, liberalism searches for the ultimate value in which to build a moral foundation: Truth.\n Right wing movements across the globe often seem uninterested in truth if it contradicts their obdurate belief systems. Reality averse, they are woefully unable to adjust to new understandings, burgeoning ideas and cultural awakenings. For example, despite overwhelming evidence that women are the equals of men, they still can't drive or vote in some Muslim countries. In America, gay people are still treated as second-class citizens, even though mountains of science and empirical evidence suggest that homosexuality is as biologically ingrained as eye color or handedness.\n Liberals believe in the power of \"reason,\" while conservatives are often just plain reactionary. This is why the GOP is the party of the \"southern strategy\" and anti-gay subterfuge. Republican power is directly related to fertilizing fear and fomenting fanaticism.\n Indeed, the great appeal of modern conservatism, or other forms of authoritarianism, is that people don't have to think for themselves. They can mentally \"check out\" of this world and place their worries in the hands of a commanding politician or a higher deity.Modern conservatives are often discomfited by the complexities of life and demand answers to the world's many unanswerable questions. They arrogantly and disingenuously claim to have absolute truth, while liberalism boldly proclaims that it does not have such ubiquitous powers of understanding. Liberalism is for those who are unafraid to fully embrace the magnificent journey of life and tackle the great mysteries of our time.If one looks at modern conservatism in the United States, it is easy to see that it is a movement of intellectual and spiritual atrophy. In the political realm, conservatives essentially call for judges who are \"strict constructionists,\" which is shorthand for saying \"the Constitution is a dead document.\"What a monumentally ridiculous notion to put forth, that American jurisprudence has not evolved in more than two centuries! Do strict constructionists believe that women and African Americans should have their rights restricted because the nation's founders treated women as second-class citizens and owned slaves?Likewise, modern conservatives have also rendered the Bible (or Koran) \"dead documents.\" In conservative houses of worship, traditionalists put forth the untenable belief that holy books are literal. They call these books \"God's Plan,\" as if the Creator hasn't had a new thought in a couple of thousand years.\n Modern conservatives will claim that liberals are sacrilegious for holding such beliefs. To the contrary, liberals are often extraordinarily religious or spiritual people. However, they diverge with conservatives in that they believe the strongest faith is one that is subject to healthy skepticism and painstaking examination. In encouraging people to explore all faiths -- free of guilt, shame, coercion or fear -- liberalism also offers people the greatest number spiritual options.Many of my columns deal with gay themes because equality for gay men and women is the civil rights issue of the new Millennium. However, gay rights mean nearly as much to heterosexuals as they do for homosexuals. The very peace and prosperity of nations can be easily predicted by looking at how they relate to their gay citizens.If a country treats gay people with dignity and respect and offers them equality, it signals that the country bases its decisions on sound education, rationalism and science. This inevitably leads towards success in all spheres of life.Countries that ostracize and penalize homosexuals tend to be superstitious, authoritarian and anti-intellectual. This almost uniformly leads to poverty, war, oppression and ultimately tyranny.\n \n A cynic might argue that the United States is not as gay friendly as other countries, yet, it is the richest country in the world. True, but nearly all of America's cities and states that are centers of profit and creativity offer acceptance for homosexuals. States most hostile to gay people are relatively backwards, with lower levels of education and income. Places that offer acceptance signal that they are open-minded and looking towards the future. Locales that reject homosexuals indicate that they are stuck in the past -- at their own peril.\n \n In essence, gay rights are the canary in the coal mine for freedom and prosperity. Unfortunately, the bird is hacking, signaling a period of increased oppression and a dangerous erosion of freedom. It is up to us to rescue this nation from the perilous path it is now on. It is time we proudly stand up for what we believe in. If we don't defend our values, our opponents will define them.\n Progressive does not mean passive. Our compassion does not mean that we lack passion. Our respect for other beliefs does not signify that we don't hold strong beliefs of our own that we are willing to fight for. Indeed, our power comes from out ability to adjust to reality. We are secure in our values, yet humble enough to adapt if our viewpoints are proven obsolete. Wherever liberal democracy takes root, a strong and proud record of economic, moral, social and political achievement follows.\n \n \n \n Now, address that!",

   "Actually Jefferson was 100% oppposed to government. It was the only reason behind his entire political life. It is the reason he formed the Republican Party in 1794. He became the blood enemy to Washington Hamilton and Adams over this. Here are 100 quotes to get you started with the very most basics about American History:\n \n \" the natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to grain ground; that the greater the government the stronger the exploiter and the weaker the producer; that , therefore, the hope of liberty depends upon local self-governance and the vigilance of the producer class.\" \n \n \n -That government is best which governs the least, because its people discipline themselves.\n \"The path we have to pursue[when Jefferson was President ] is so quiet that we have nothing scarcely to propose to our Legislature.\"\n \n -The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not.\n \n -The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground.\n \n \" the natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to grain ground; that the greater the government the stronger the exploiter and the weaker the producer; that , therefore, the hope of liberty depends upon local self-governance and the vigilance of the producer class.\" \n \n \n -A wise and frugal government, which shall leave men free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor (read-taxes) and bread it has earned -- this is the sum of good government.\n \n -Experience hath shewn, that even under the best forms of government those entrusted with power have, in time, and by slow operations, perverted it into tyranny.\n \n -History, in general, only informs us of what bad government is.\n \n -I own that I am not a friend to a very energetic government. It is always oppressive.\n \n -I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them.\n \n -My reading of history convinces me that bad government results from too much government.\n \n -Our country is now taking so steady a course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction, to wit: by consolidation of power first, and then corruption, its necessary consequence.\n \n -Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government of himself. Can he, then be trusted with the government of others? Or have we found angels in the form of kings to govern him? Let history answer this question.\n \n -The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions that I wish it to be always kept alive.\n \n -Most bad government has grown out of too much government.\n \n -Were we directed from Washington when to sow and when to reap, we should soon want bread.\n \n -Experience hath shewn, that even under the best forms [of government] those entrusted with power have, in time, and by slow operations, perverted it into tyranny.\n \n -I think myself that we have more machinery of government than is necessary, too many parasites living on the labor of the industrious\n \"Agriculture, manufactures, commerce and navigation, the four\n pillars of our prosperity, are the most thriving when left most \n free to individual enterprise. Protection from casual \n embarrassments, however, may sometimes be seasonably interposed.\" \n --Thomas Jefferson: 1st Annual Message, 1801.\n \n \"The policy of the American government is to leave their citizens\n free, neither restraining nor aiding them in their pursuits.\"\n --Thomas Jefferson to M. L'Hommande, 1787.\n \n \"[Ours is a] policy of not embarking the public in enterprises\n better managed by individuals, and which might occupy as much\n of our time as those political duties for which the public functionaries are particularly instituted. Some money could be\n lent them [the New Orleans Canal Co.], but only on an assurance that it would be employed so as to secure the public objects.\"\n --Thomas Jefferson to W. C. C. Claiborne, 1808.\n \n \"The rights of the people to the exercise and fruits of their own industry can never be protected against the selfishness of rulers\n not subject to their control at short periods.\" --Thomas Jefferson\n to Isaac H. Tiffany, 1816.\n \n \"Our wish is that...[there be] maintained that state of property,\n equal or unequal, which results to every man from his own industry \n or that of his fathers.\" --Thomas Jefferson: 2nd Inaugural \n Address, 1805.\n \n \"To take from one because it is thought that his own industry and that of his father's has acquired too much, in order to spare to\n others, who, or whose fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of\n association--the guarantee to every one of a free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it.\" --Thomas Jefferson: Note \n in Tracy's \"Political Economy,\" 1816.\n \n \"Private enterprise manages so much better all the concerns to which it is equal.\" --Thomas Jefferson: 6th Annual Message, 1806.\n \n \"The merchants will manage [commerce] the better, the more they are left free to manage for themselves.\" --Thomas Jefferson to Gideon Granger, 1800.\n \n \n \"If ever this vast country is brought under a single government, it will be one of the most extensive corruption, indifferent and incapable of a wholesome care over so wide a spread of surface.\" --Thomas Jefferson to William T. Barry, 1822. ME 15:389 \n \n \n Some] seem to think that [civilization's] advance has brought on too complicated a state of society, and that we should gain in happiness by treading back our steps a little way. I think, myself, that we have more machinery of government than is necessary, too many parasites living on the labor of the industrious. I believe it might be much simplified to the relief of those who maintain it.\" --Thomas Jefferson to William Ludlow, 1824. ME 16:75\n \n \"Agriculture, manufactures, commerce and navigation, the four pillars of our prosperity, are the most thriving when left most free to individual enterprise. Protection from casual embarrassments, however, may sometimes be seasonably interposed.\" --Thomas Jefferson: 1st Annual Message, 1801. ME 3:337\n \n \"The power given to Congress by the Constitution does not extend to the internal regulation of the commerce of a State (that is to say, of the commerce between citizen and citizen) which remain exclusively with its own legislature, but to its external commerce only; that is to say, its commerce with another State, or with foreign nations, or with the Indian tribes.\" --Thomas Jefferson: Opinion on Bank, 1791. ME 3:147 \n \n \"Our tenet ever was that Congress had not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare, but were restrained to those specifically enumerated, and that, as it was never meant that they should provide for that welfare but by the exercise of the enumerated powers, so it could not have been meant they should raise money for purposes which the enumeration did not place under their action; consequently, that the specification of powers is a limitation of the purposes for which they may raise money. .\" - Thomas Jefferson\n \n \n \"The government of the United States [federal government] is a definite government confined to specified objects [powers]. It is not like state governments, whose powers are more general. CHARITY IS NO PART OF THE LEGISLATIVE DUTY OF THE GOVERNMENT.\"\n -James madison\n \n Jefferson: \"Congress has not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare, but only those specifically enumerated.\" \n \n Patrick Henry\n Tell me when did liberty ever exist when the sword and the purse were given up?\n \n Thomas Jefferson\n \"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\" \n \n \n I see,... and with the deepest affliction, the rapid strides with which the federal branch of our government is advancing towards the usurpation of all the rights reserved to the States, and the consolidation in itself of all powers, foreign and domestic; and that, too, by constructions which, if legitimate, leave no limits to their power... It is but too evident that the three ruling branches of [the Federal government] are in combination to strip their colleagues, the State authorities, of the powers reserved by them, and to exercise themselves all functions foreign and domestic.\" \n -- Thomas Jefferson to William Branch Giles, 1825. The Writings of Thomas Jefferson \n \n James Madison: \"If Congress can do whatever in their discretion can be done by money, and will promote the general welfare, the government is no longer a limited one, but an indefinite one subject to particular exceptions.\" \n James Madison: \"The government of the United States is a definite government, confined to specific objectives. It is not like state governments, whose powers are more general. Charity is no part of the legislative duty of the government.\" \n James Madison in Federalist paper NO. 45: \"The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce.\"\n \n \n I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion of the means. I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it.\" - Benjamin Franklin\n \n \n \"The Constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness. You have to catch it yourself.\" - Benjamin Franklin \n \n One single object... [will merit] the endless gratitude of the society: that of restraining the judges from usurping legislation. \n Thomas Jefferson, letter to Edward Livingston, March 25, 1825\n Our peculiar security is in the possession of a written Constitution. Let us not make it a blank paper by construction. \n Thomas Jefferson, letter to Wilson Nicholas, September 7, 1803\n \n \n That these are our grievances which we have thus laid before his majesty, with that freedom of language and sentiment which becomes a free people claiming their rights as derived from the laws of nature, andnot as the gift of their chief magistrate. \n Thomas Jefferson, Rights of British America, \n 1774\n \n \n \n The principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale. \n Thomas Jefferson, letter to John Taylor, May 28, 1816\n \n They are not to do anything they please to provide for the general welfare, but only to lay taxes for that purpose. To consider the latter phrase not as describing the purpose of the first, but as giving a distinct and independent power to do any act they please which may be good for the Union, would render all the preceding and subsequent enumerations of power completely useless. It would reduce the whole instrument to a single phrase, that of instituting a Congress with power to do whatever would be for the good of the United States; and as they sole judges of the good or evil, it would be also a power to do whatever evil they please...Certainly no such universal power was meant to be given them. It was intended to lace them up straightly within the enumerated powers and those without which, as means, these powers could not be carried into effect. \n Thomas Jefferson, Opinion on National Bank, 1791\n \n James Madison: \n A just security to property is not afforded by that government under which unequal taxes oppress one species of property and reward another species; where arbitrary taxes invade the domestic sanctuaries of the rich and excessive taxes grind the faces of the poor; where the keenness and competitions of want are deemed an insufficient spur to labor and taxes are again applied by an unfeeling policy as another spur; in violation of that sacred property, which Heaven, in decreeing man to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow, kindly reserved to him in the small repose that could be spared from the supply of his necessities.\n\n \n No0t one single thing you posted here does anything at ALL to prove your point, and they ALL prove mine. At no point does Jefferson call for the abolition of government. He wants it strictly subordinate to the people. \n \n Jefferson understood what you are apparently not bright enough to grasp. Without government, there can be do liberty, no freedom, no prosperity. \n \n BTW.....are you really stupid enough to think this quote from Franklin is not bogus:\n \n \n\"The Constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness. You have to catch it yourself.\" - Benjamin Franklin \n\n \n Hint....he was involved in both the writing of the declaration of independence (where they talk about the pursuit of happiness) and the constitution (where it does not appear). \n \n Pathetic.",

The parties had names: Federalist and Republican.\"-Susan Dunn,Jefferson's Second Revolution.\n \n \n See why we are positive a liberal will be slow? what other conclusion is possible\n\n \n I know you're stuck on stupid, but try to comprehend the following:\n \n http://www.bidstrup.com/politics.htm\n What Is The Conservative Ideology?\n The conservative rallying cry is \"freedom.\" Freedom generally meaning freedom from government intervention in matters they do not want government interfering in (usually their own personal or professional lives). But as we shall see later in this essay, conservatives have an inherent mistrust of personal freedom, and can become quite uncomfortable when serious proposals are made to extend it to someone other than themselves. The problem here is that allowing personal freedom without allowing a similar degree of freedom to others violates to principle of 'greatest good for the greatest number.' It therefore creates a basic inconsistency.\n The essence of a free society is \"openness,\" which implies two things: the right to free speech, and the right, even the requirement, to think for oneself, make one's own decisions, and chart one's own destiny. While conservatives loudly proclaim these ideals, they do not mind circumscribing them in the name of their own ideology; restrictions on abortion, based on their own definition of human life, as if no other were possible, and the restriction on the civil rights of gays to marry the informed, consenting adult of their choice, presuming that their own definition of marriage is the only one that is worthy of being allowed by law. Such circumscriptions and many others that could be cited show clearly the distance that exists between conservative ideological rhetoric and actual practice. This is because in the headlong rush towards a laissez-faire economic model, it is easy to forget that the values and institutions of an open society are not neccessarily supported by the market, and need care and nurturing if they are to survive. This is because the conservative has failed to understand that by increasing his comfort level (ensuring that abortions or gay marriages don't occur) he has circumscribed the right of others to make their own decisions. Simply claiming that he is right is not enough; no evidence is ever provided to show that the greatest good for the greatest number is provided for by circumscribing the right of women to direct their own reproductive destinies or the right of gays or lesbians to marry the informed, consenting adults of their choice. \n \n The reason that the conservative doesn't nurture those values and instititutions of freedom for all, is that the concept of freedom to a conservative is a deeply personal one. It generally stems from personal experience or from personal history in which the conservative or someone close to him has had a negative experience with government or the intervention, perceived or real, of government in his life. Therefore, the language used by conservatives in relation to freedom is personal. It is replete with personal examples, such as personal forms of taxation, stories of government regulations or bureaucrats gone bad. In relation to the rest of society, it is always vague generalizations, such as \"getting government off the backs of the people.\" The disparity in the language reflects the personal nature of conservatism.\n \n Economically, conservatives hold only Adam Smith to be a true prophet of economic theory. Other, more modern economists such as Milton Freidman are held in esteem only to the extent that they echo Adam Smith's views. Why this is true is simply that Adam Smith propounded the most purely non-regulated economic model that has ever seen any degree of acceptance. This fits hand in glove with the conservative view that government is part of the problem rather than part of the solution. The obvious synergy of the theories seems to verify for the conservative the sensical basis of conservative theory. Yet conservatives fail utterly to acknowledge that the regulations they so angrily denounce were put there originally for a reason. That reason is that free markets, unrestrained by government regulation, do not neccessarily lead to the greatest good for the greatest number -- in fact, they never do. To the extent that they don't, government regulation is often neccessary to prevent abuse. This is a patently obvious fact almost never acknowledged by conservative theorists.\n \n A persistent, dominant feature of conservatism is social Darwinism. In economic terms, it takes the form of declaring intervention in the market to be the ultimate evil, and that non-interventionism informs the social theories that underlie conservative philosophy. By claiming that the free market will solve the ills, social Darwinism becomes an easy extension of that view, by asserting that those who aren't successful in the market are morally inferior; i.e., they are unsuccessful because they are weak or lazy. The anecdotal evidence that others have made it after starting with few if any resources, is used to justify this view. \n \n While this view is a central tenet of conservative social philosophy, it fails to consider differences in individual temperment and talent, and that while some have \"made it\" after starting from nothing, it presumes that all are equally equipped to do so, which is obviously not the case. The fact that some have, however, presumes to alleviate the conservative of any responsibility towards those who can't. Therefore, any notion of government support of the weak, infirm, or defective becomes anathema.\n \n This social Darwinism stands in stark contrast to the view of religious conservatives that Darwinism is the ultimate expression of the evil of secular science, which declares that humanity arose from the primates from just such a system of survival of the fittest. The irony that on the one hand, the view that Darwinism is an insult to what the religious conservative regards as the divinity of human creation with the disregard of that portion of that creation which is other than self, seems lost on such conservatives.\n \n In social theory, conservatism harks back to what it considers a simpler and somehow better time. More modern problems, such as feminism, gay rights, multiculturalism, urban decay, economic decline and political instability are considered by conservatives to simply be evidence that society has strayed from what it believes to be the non-interventionist wisdom of the past. To cure these ills, conservatives suggest simply returning to what they presume the values of the past to be, neglecting the obvious fact that the problems of today are quite different from those of past generations, and that the egregious moral and political inequities of the past are too unpleasant to be worth returning to, and that the past was nowhere near as non-interventionist as they presume. Nor do they consider that the interventions of the state were made neccessary by very real problems.\n \n These social theories are often lumped together under the banner of \"traditional family values.\" That term is never carefully defined, but usually is taken to mean a rejection of feminism, gay rights and even the right of women to control the destinies of their own reproductive lives in some cases. It also decries the decline of the two-parent family, while totally ignoring the factual reasons that the two-parent family is in decline. Again, government is often blamed, even though the problem is primarily an economic one. And conservative economic policies are largely to blame. The fact that these values have no effect at all on inner city decay, illegal drugs, street crime, collapse of the educational system, etc., are lost on the conservative, because he never stops to actually think about how these values would actually affect these problems. He simply accepts that they will, on face value, because such has been the pronouncement of conservative pundits.\n \n Running through all of this is a common thread of patriarchialism. There is an unspoken objectification of women and sexual minorities, in which they are regarded as less than men in terms of their rights within society. This view takes voice in such statements as \"A woman's place is in the home\" as if she weren't competent to run her or her family's affairs. Homophobia is considered quite acceptable, even honorable among many conservatives, as homosexuals don't quite seem to be men or even women, so are therefore something less that totally human (or even downright evil and perverted), and therefore don't deserve human rights. Many of the more outspoken and extreme conservatives will even give voice to this Fascist sentiment. There is also an assumption, false as it turns out, that the male was programmed by evolution to be the head of the family and by extension, head of everything else too. Even female conservatives, who from their own experience ought to know better, often buy into this mistaken view.\n \n The nostalgia for an earlier, and presumed better time takes a particularly virulent turn when it links up with a need for an enemy. Conservatives need enemies simply because of the failure of conservative policies to produce the nirvana predicted for them. Finding a scapegoat and blaming the problems of society on that scapegoat are vastly easier and more comfortable than the introspection and self-examination required to determine just where the root of society's problems lie, and whether conservative policies can actually affect the problems. To an extent, government intervention fills the role of scapegoat, but in cases were government obviously can't be blamed, another scapegoat must be found. In the \"golden age\" of the 1950's, that enemy was communism, the nostalgia was for a pre-world war II innocence, and together the virulence took the form of McCarthyism. Today, communism is dead, but the need for a scapegoat still exists, so in casting around for scapegoats, conservatives seem to have found twin evils in the gay community and providers of services needed by and used exclusively by women, particularly family planning services. Never minding, of course, the bigotry and stereotyping that the use of this particular scapegoat betrays.\n \n A priceless quote from a conservative \"intellectual\" about the gay community can be found in the November, 1996 issue of Commentary, a conservative intellectual journal. Norman Podhoretz wrote: \"Men using one another as women constitutes a perversion. To my unreconstructed mind, this is as true as ever; and so far as I am concerned it would still be true even if gay sex no longer entailed the danger of infection and even if everything about it were legalized by all 50 states and ratified by all nine justices of the Supreme Court.\" Of course, he might as well have said that to his pre-Enlightenment mind, it didn't matter how effectively he was proven wrong, he'd still believe he was right. As gay men and lesbians come out of the closet and prove such stereotypes wrong, the \"unreconstructed\" minds of such \"intellectuals\" start looking like the sorry lot of just-plain bigots they are. Yet such is the neo-conservative mentality of holding prejudices more dearly than the truth, just because it is so very, very comforting to believe yourself right in spite of all evidences to the contrary.\n \n In international relations, the laissez-faire ideology promotes the openness of borders and the internationalization of markets. It is doctrine that everyone benefits by the reduction of trade barriers on the assumption that the doctrine of \"comparative advantage\" will cause everyone in the world to do what is most economically advantageous.\n \n What this doctrine fails to consider is that, although about the only comparative advantage Bolivia has in international trade is in beef production, not everyone in Bolivia wants to be a cowboy. Nor the fact that while Mexico can build car engines cheaper than the United States, it may not be in America's strategic interests to become dependent on Mexico for all of its car engines. It was no surprise during the North America Free Trade Agreement debate that predictions were made that many American jobs would be lost to Mexico. Indeed, the threat of moving production to Mexico is routinely used by American manufacturers to extract wage and benefit concessions from American workers. Is this really in the workers' interests? \n \n The result of NAFTA as of this writing has been a net loss of about 112,000 American jobs to Mexico. One might think that Mexico has benefitted greatly, but the reality is that most of the profits earned by American business operating in Mexico have been repatriated to the United States. Investment in native business in Mexico has been stifled by competition from American businesses seeking the resources for their own operations. How Mexico has benefitted by this is difficult to see. Indeed, Mexico has seen a net loss of nearly a million jobs, because of stiff competition from American and Canadian businesses, who have deprived the native companies of their markets. So even the gains of the 'maquiladora' employment has been more than offset by the loss of employment in local businesses. That this situation has led to a net loss of opportunity for both Mexican and American workers is easy to see, in spite of the fact that the non-interventionist doctrine would claim that the opposite should have occurred. \n \n The \"Founded On Christian Principles\" Myth And Its Consequences\n One of the great rallying cries of the conservative-fundamentalist alliance is the idea that America was founded on Christian principles by devout Christians. The theory runs that America is faltering because it has strayed from those principles.\n \"Novus Ordo Seclorum\" declares the motto on the obverse of the Great Seal of the United States. As can be seen on the back of the U.S. One Dollar note, that seal depicts the Great Pyramid of Cheops in Egypt, with its capstone replaced by the Eye of Horus. Translated from Latin, the motto means, \"To Secure a New Order.\"\n \n Both the imagery and the motto reflect the true ideals of the American founding fathers: the notion that a better order than the largely Christian order which governed the Old World is one governed by reason and logic, not mysticism and superstition, based not on faith in the infallibility of the church and the Divine Right of Kings, but based on fairness, equality, and egalitarianism, and the administration of justice blind to the inevitable differences in race, class and economic and political power, and the recognition of human fallibility in government. Central to this ideal is the notion of \"higher mindedness,\" as symbolized by the Eye of Horus, that there are higher ideals than simple blind faith in the correctness of any particular religion, Christian or otherwise, or the notion that any class has any sort of divine right to rule.\n \n This concept of a higher mindedness is based on the recognition of human fallibility. It is the awareness that no one does or can have the right answer all the time. Because this is not possible, the New Order being declared must take account of human fallibility, and order a political system that allows for it. It is the notion that no class has an inherent right to rule, simply because it has or because it can. The establishment of any kind of theocracy, Christian or otherwise, is anathema, because the assumption of a superiority of moral virtue by any religious system, Christian or otherwise, is a denial of the fallibility of the authors of that system.\n \n The founding fathers had lived under a system guided by Christian principles. They had lived very painfully under the effects of European style theocracies. The Pilgrims were driven from their homes in the Old World by religious persecution. Though they were Christian, they weren't apparently Christian enough for some. The Virginia House of Burgesses had established Christianity as the state religion, and had created special rights and privileges available to the Christians of that colony, that were not available to others. Similar situations occurred in other colonies. These facts so deeply grieved Thomas Jefferson, that he made it his life's work to rid the emerging American democracy of church influence. And he considered the First Amendment to be his magnum opus. He was so proud of the \"wall of separation\" (his phrase) which he built, that he had the First Amendment listed as his most proud achievement on his tombstone, even despite other great achievements, such as authorship of the Declaration of Independence.\n \n What does the current conservative-fundamentalist drive towards theocracy mean for the average American?\n \n Well, suppose it were to actually happen. Imagine, for example, a situation in which religious doctrine, not scientific principles, were to become the basis of teaching science in the public schools. This is already happening in many school districts across America: \"creationism,\" which has no factual basis in science, but shares the favor of a spectrum of religious believers, has replaced evolution as the basis of teaching in biological sciences in districts controlled by board majorities of fundamentalist Christians. Such doctrines being taught as facts carry with them a grave danger. That danger is an end to scientific advancement.\n \n During the Stalin years in the Soviet Union, a similar set of notions gained the favor of Stalin, with the result that Soviet agriculture was set back by decades. Soviet biology became the object of ridicule by the scientific establishment all over the world. Do we want that to happen here?\n \n Another serious side effect of the emerging theocracy in America is intolerance. If you're right, why do you have to tolerate error? Should you tolerate error? So goes the thinking of the fundamentalist, and as a result, the Catholic Inquisition (for which that church has never apologized) killed hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Jews, Gypsies, Muslims, homosexuals and others it did not like. Do we want to see a return of that kind of intolerance?\n \n Political malignancy is another problem with theocracy. Once established, its view that the theocracy is the best possible government allows the government to adopt the notion that it has the right to impose itself on others to save them from their error. The result will be predictable: weak and essentially helpless nations, particularly in the Western Hemisphere, will be forced quite openly under American political domination. With the view that America knows best, the doctrine of \"manifest destiny\" will re-emerge, in a more virulent form than before. And America will become a moral pariah among other nations of the world. Do we really want to be seen once again as the \"ugly Americans?\"\n \n Egalitarianism of economic opportunity will disappear. As in the old order of Europe, opportunities will go to the members of the ruling class, i.e., the controlling members of the theocracy. Others will be denied opportunity because they will simply be seen as less worthy; Jews, Muslims, even those who consider themselves Christian, but who are not \"Christian enough,\" such as Mormons or Unitarians, will find themselves limited in opportunity, because they do not have access to the chambers of government. Is this the kind of equality on which we seek to build a society?\n \n \n All you need to know is found therein. Jefferson was a liberal. Seek therapy for your delusions. -poet",

   "A liberal who, with Madison, founded the Republican Party in 1792? Of course if this was not true you would not be so afraid to present some evidence. what does you fear tell you?\n\n \n By today's standard both Madison and Jefferson were Liberals. The fact that it was Jefferson who included the Idea of separation between church and state ( Which goes against Your Conservative Swill) is all the proof you need, but if you insist... Here's a few quotes from the Liberal himself.\n \n That liberty is pure which is to go to all, and not to the few or the rich alone.\n -- Thomas Jefferson, letter to Horatio Gates (1798) \n \n Rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add \"within the limits of the law\" because law is often but the tyrant's will, and always so when it violates the rights of the individual.\n -- Thomas Jefferson, letter to Isaac H Tiffany (1819)\n \n All, too, will bear in mind this sacred principle, that though the will of the majority is in all cases to prevail, that will, to be rightful, must be reasonable; that the minority possess their equal rights, which equal laws must protect, and to violate which would be oppression.\n -- Thomas Jefferson, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1801\n \n \n In America, no other distinction between man and man had ever been known but that of persons in office exercising powers by authority of the laws, and private individuals. Among these last, the poorest laborer stood on equal ground with the wealthiest millionaire, and generally on a more favored one whenever their rights seem to jar.\n -- Thomas Jefferson, Answers to de Meusnier Questions, 1786. ME 17:8 \n \n \n [The] best principles [of our republic] secure to all its citizens a perfect equality of rights.\n -- Thomas Jefferson, Reply to the Citizens of Wilmington, 1809. ME 16:336 \n \n \n Because religious belief, or non-belief, is such an important part of every person's life, freedom of religion affects every individual. Religious institutions that use government power in support of themselves and force their views on persons of other faiths, or of no faith, undermine all our civil rights. Moreover, state support of an established religion tends to make the clergy unresponsive to their own people, and leads to corruption within religion itself. Erecting the \"wall of separation between church and state,\" therefore, is absolutely essential in a free society.\n We have solved, by fair experiment, the great and interesting question whether freedom of religion is compatible with order in government and obedience to the laws. And we have experienced the quiet as well as the comfort which results from leaving every one to profess freely and openly those principles of religion which are the inductions of his own reason and the serious convictions of his own inquiries.\n -- Thomas Jefferson, to the Virginia Baptists (1808)\n \n \"Experience declares that man is the only animal which devours\n his own kind, for I can apply no milder term to...the general\n prey of the rich on the poor.\" --Thomas Jefferson to Edward\n Carrington, 1787.\n \n And to top that off apparently you don't get out much. The Most Conservative State in the U.S. voted to remove Jefferson from World History books because of his Political and religious views. If he was such a great conservative Texas would be agreeing with you but since they don't, well I guess now we know who the \"Slow\" one really is.\n \n Texas Removes Thomas Jefferson From Teaching Standard\n \n and you can send the 10 grand to Obama as an apology for your ignorance.",

The term \"conservative\" is more like a adjective in that it describes the restraint of doing something while republican is morel like a noun in that it is a certain set of specific ideas (note I'm not saying this conservative is only an adjective and republican a noun). If you see it like that you will see why it is improper and confusing to use the term as you have. Madison's ideas on government were liberal in the context of his times as they were a departure from the norm but to believe in those know would be conservative as you restrain from changing our rooted past. Now, take the Patriot Act. This was a departure from the traditional rights most Americans enjoyed. This would be a liberal act by the Republican party. So smaller government probably is more conservative but lower taxes (and for that matter raising them) is necessarily a conservative move. \n \n I suggest sticking to the actual meaning of the terms as to not mislead people.",

This all started when G.W decided to unravel everything Clinton had done in his 8 years in office. Slashing taxes across the board to the lowest rate in years Basically killed the economy all by itself. We were already spending too much as it was but slashing revenues on top of that caused us to have to borrow more to continue paying the bills. Then add the cost of 2 wars which we never needed, and those wars are still not paid for. Bush also gave out 2 stimulus packages which both failed to turn things around. Increased spending, Decreased Revenues, and deregulation led us into this mess. When Obama took over he inherited this mess, then he went and made it worse by increasing spending even more. His Stimulus package did little to nothing to spark the turn around, and with the revenues still slashed by billions he had no choice but to increase the debt by borrowing more. And it's not over, if the Teabaggers don't get smart real quick and they allow the U.S. to default on our debt You can be rest assured this little fiasco will seem like a walk in the park.

Since this is the natural state for everyone's mind, it requires that we check it, and minimize the stuff we present (judgments, beliefs, positions, rationalizations) in lieu of \"truth\", the very thing that doesn't need to be believed to be true. \n \n I came into this forum \"p'ed\" off, because I let my mind stuff get the best of me. And true to Dr. Smothermon's assertion, several others brought their mind stuff to bear, and then there was conflict. \n In an effort to defend myself, I told truths about myself to elevate me from pedestrian to worthy gladiator, and if you were coming for me, you'd better know that I'm educated, glib, and capable of higher reasoning. Well, that was summarily dismissed as a lie. It couldn't be, in the eyes of some. And a gay, black liberal, to boot? Oh, they would have to dismantle me. And they tried. But they couldn't do it, intellectually, but via ad hominem attacks. More mind stuff and egos. Well, I could only tolerate that nonsense for so long...and where, pray tell, was the debate? Wasn't this a political debate forum?\n It became a poet pinata forum, overnight. A pile on. \n So after rendering the bad actors moot, I still am desiring intellectual discourse about politics and society. Let's see if that can happen.\n\n \n You told lies that you cant substantiate, you got found out.\n Now dry your little eyes and dont debate on the premise that you automatically know better because you are more qualified and/or better connected than the ones who oppose you view and you may get a tiny bit more respect.\n Cant see it happening thoughemoticon_xdonno",

What I'm saying is that this is not a Conservative / or a Liberal Problem. This recession was caused by both parties initiating bad policies or just being ignorant selfish politicians . I know you right Wingers would like to blame the entire fiasco on the Democrats.. but you lack evidence to support that so all you do is insult peoples intelligence on the basis that they might have more Liberal views than you. That only shows that YOU are the one who is ignorant and should get a clue. \n \n Now for a few facts for you to chew on...\n \n First, The Housing Fiasco started in the late 90's under Clinton and the Republican held House. Deregulation began and the banks started pretty much doing as they pleased. The Government Put pressure on the likes of Fannie May to issue those Sub-Prime loans which started the chain going. However, due to the economic policies put into place by Clinton we didn't feel any back lash because at the time our economy was strong. \n \n When President Bill Clinton left office in 2001, the Congressional Budget Office was forecasting an average annual budget surplus of $850 billion for 2009 through 2012. If Bush would have left things alone our National debt would now be Paid.. but as we know Bush is stupid and did exactly opposite.\n \n Enter George W. Bush...\n \n When Bush took office As I said before he inherited an annual Budget surplus of roughly 230 billion dollars. Beginning his long list of failures he began fighting for and eventually got his precious Tax Cuts for the Rich as well as expanded on the De-regulation that had begun under Clinton. With the banks now running without any regulation the bubble began to form, and experts warned the bubble would burst if measures were not taken to avert this. \n \n The Bush Tax cuts added with the Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the Failed Medicare prescription drug plan Bush passed erased the 850 billion dollar surplus we expected over the next 4 years and put us back in the hole. With the decreased revenues the Government was now forced to Borrow more to continue paying for programs already in place and the downward spiral begins. \n \n Now the big one.. Stimulus Payments. I love how Repubs will point fingers at the Left and blame failed stimulus payments on Obama , yet they somehow forget that Bush actually spent as much on Stimulus than Obama has. Here's a list of Stimulus Bills passed by both Parties during a 2 year period..\n \n March 2008: Bush stimulus $29 billion for Bear Stearns/JP Morgan Chase deal\n May 2008: Bush stimulus $178 billion in tax rebate checks\n July 2008: Bush stimulus $300 billion for distressed homeowners\n July 2008: Bush stimulus $200 billion for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\n September 2008: Bush stimulus $50 billion to guarantee money market funds\n September 2008: Bush stimulus $25 billion to Big 3 automakers\n September-November 2008: Bush stimulus $150 billion to AIG\n October 2008: Bush stimulus $700 billion to banks (TARP)\n February 2009: Obama stimulus $787 billion in broad stimulus package\n February 2009: Obama stimulus $75 billion for distressed homeowners\n February 2009: Obama stimulus $200 billion for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\n March 2009: Obama stimulus $30 billion for AIG\n March 2009: Obama Stimulus $15 billion for small business lending\n March 2009: Obama Stimulus $1 trillion to get toxic assets off bank&#8217;s troubled asset sheets\n March 2009: Obama Stimulus $22 billion for Big 3 Automakers Chrysler and GM\n \n \n So as you can see your precious Right Wing is just as responsible if not more for our current condition.

The first is to defend rights, which is the courts, police, and most importantly objective laws which may not exist without specific justification and explaination for which right it is defending. The second is what I call government actions. Government actions are communal, public, societal initiatives that whether by convenience or necessity had best be carried out on the scale of government.\n \n Government actions are not laws they are programs which are carried out by government based on some need besides the protection of rights. They are initiated and supported solely by those citizens who vote for them.\n \n For instance, social security and universal health care could exist in my volitional society; as government actions. They do not protect a right they fulfill a perceived social requirement. The only difference would be that only those who are willing to put their wealth where there 'heart' or 'best judgement' or whatever the hec you (now addressing leftist in general and not you specifically accipiter) want to call it will be called upon to pay for it. They do not have a right to force others to pay for their idea they only have the right to try to convince them. This is the essence not of democracy but of liberty.\n \n If it is true that I am a fringe right wing kook because I don't think universal health care is a good idea for whatever reason, you can put that belief to the test. If I am fringe it would not effect your funds too much if I decide not to pay.\n \n It is at this point that the immorality of any other course is revealed. The truth is you don't think you can do it unless people are forced to agree with you. I have even heard the most absurd remarks possible at this time like \"they aren't forced to agree just pay\" as if it is better to take someones wallet if you 'permit' them to dislike it. It is at this point that it is revealed that those who disagree with a volitional society do so because they think they have the right as the majority to decide the course of action for all.\n \n This would be illegal in any private sector. If the greatest number of shoe consumers decided everyone had to buy a certain shoe, or if the richest corporation demanded the assets of smaller corporations just because it had more money. Yet it is considered by my opponents to be just and proper if the scale is large enough, say a state; a country; or a planet.\n \n You appeal to the majority, yet you will not test that appeal by giving the 'minority' freedom from it's decisions. I have heard it said \"well the majority could be 51% and somethings can't be done by only half a country\". I say those things shouldn't be decided by only half a country.\n \n It is my position which grants men the freedom they deserve. A conservative will tell you small government is necessary, big government is evil. Have you ever asked these conservatives why government must be small? Those few that will give you a straight answer will tell you that what the government does is inherently evil, but necessary; and therefore the smaller it is while fulfilling it's purpose the less evil. Governments don't need to be evil, they can be wholly moral and if they are why is more worse? A conservative would force men not to work through public avenue, force them to pursue their ends through private avenues. While this may be far more palatable than forcing everyone into a homogeneous hive under the dictates of a mob it is almost as unjustifiable. If you want to you can accomplish things through government, all I deny you is what you never had the right to do in the first place; accomplishing things through coercive force, using the government as a gun to rob people.",

This is the essence not of democracy but of liberty.\n \n If it is true that I am a fringe right wing kook because I don't think universal health care is a good idea for whatever reason, you can put that belief to the test. If I am fringe it would not effect your funds too much if I decide not to pay.\n \n It is at this point that the immorality of any other course is revealed. The truth is you don't think you can do it unless people are forced to agree with you. I have even heard the most absurd remarks possible at this time like \"they aren't forced to agree just pay\" as if it is better to take someones wallet if you 'permit' them to dislike it. It is at this point that it is revealed that those who disagree with a volitional society do so because they think they have the right as the majority to decide the course of action for all.\n \n This would be illegal in any private sector. If the greatest number of shoe consumers decided everyone had to buy a certain shoe, or if the richest corporation demanded the assets of smaller corporations just because it had more money. Yet it is considered by my opponents to be just and proper if the scale is large enough, say a state; a country; or a planet.\n \n You appeal to the majority, yet you will not test that appeal by giving the 'minority' freedom from it's decisions. I have heard it said \"well the majority could be 51% and somethings can't be done by only half a country\". I say those things shouldn't be decided by only half a country.\n \n It is my position which grants men the freedom they deserve. A conservative will tell you small government is necessary, big government is evil. Have you ever asked these conservatives why government must be small? Those few that will give you a straight answer will tell you that what the government does is inherently evil, but necessary; and therefore the smaller it is while fulfilling it's purpose the less evil. Governments don't need to be evil, they can be wholly moral and if they are why is more worse? A conservative would force men not to work through public avenue, force them to pursue their ends through private avenues. While this may be far more palatable than forcing everyone into a homogeneous hive under the dictates of a mob it is almost as unjustifiable. If you want to you can accomplish things through government, all I deny you is what you never had the right to do in the first place; accomplishing things through coercive force, using the government as a gun to rob people.\n\n \n Freedom I am finished discussing this with you.\n \n The last thing I want to do is read 823 words of you back peddling.",
