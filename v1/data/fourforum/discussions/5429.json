Authorian Conservitism didn't have the get out of my life, but I do recall the conservatives of the 50s holding that belief.\n\n \n Yeah, I can certainly buy that. To me, american (and european) conservatism seems to be more concerned with keeping the government out of your pocket-book than keeping the government out of your social life. But it might have been different in the 50-ies. I would go for \"classical liberalism\" if I wanted to make the case for an ideology that wants the government out of my life. The ideas John Locke and Adam Smith are quite reknowned. Libertarianism would perhaps be another ideology, allthough it could carry some other meanings as well. \n \n If you`re only concerned with keeping the govenrment out of your life (but want their presence in your pocket-book), I guess american liberalism (or social-liberalism) would fit the bill. If you want the government to be socialy liberal, but want the to redistribute resources, base decissions on social classes and own production factors, you would probably be more of a socialdemocrat (liberal-socialism). Allthough, I would say the line between the last two is somewhat blurry...\n \n Now, please correct me if you don`t agree. After all, what I write is based on my european perspective and it is no more valid than yours.",

   "well, as I recall, the 50s conservatism had some legislated morality, but it wasn't anywhere as bad as what some republicans are calling for, but it was definitently out to keep gov't away from your personal life. Conservatism of that time wasn't aganist taxes, but litterally thought that deficits were immoral and would take the necessary actions to get rid of them. While I don't think that small deficits are bad, the one we have now teeters on that brink of immoral behavior when regarding the future economy our children will enter. \n \n In many ways conservatism is classical liberalism.

   "[SIZE=4]\nDuo: I think you're confusing conservatives with libertarians.\n\n \n \n Nah, he isn't, one of our core beliefs is to have as little government interference into our lives as possible. And at one time that also included our bedrooms and our doctor's office. The smaller the government the better....\n \n \n And I must say, its kind of depressing these days to see what kind of people that we now have in this party. The neo cons and new so-called republicans are sometimes are going ruin this country and my part.\n They haven't a clue as to what we really stand for. \n \n Now? They think that all one has to do is swear an oath to defend Bushie boy if anyone dares to critize him or call him the bubbling idiot that he is. They think that if they are against abortion and love Bush than that makes them the best kind of republican there is.\n \n Hell my dog is smarter than Bush is and probably speaks better english than him too. \n These new republican/consevarives are selfish and mean spirited. And ignorant. They call the democrats all kinds of mean names while in the next breath pretending they the are innocent ones, who are hated only because they are good conservative christians and because they back Bush. Well after watching these people I can finally understand why it is that the are so smitten with Bush. Bush is an idiot. He doesnt have a clue about whats really going on, and is content to let Rove and Cheney take care of things. \n They are finally happy that they have a president that they can actually brag about being smarter than. Give Bush a beer and instantly he becomes a good old boy from their old hish school. \n \n Actually, 'm shocked at some of whatthey post .I read from some of the so-called new republicans. Its like they are stuck in a time warp and are in the years before we entered WWII. And at times, its down right scary! \n \n \n I once looked forward to the day that the democratic party finally collapsed in on itself...but now? \n \n I am no longer care about when that is going to happen, it is now my own party that I wanna see fall apart. \n And all I can do is now is pray loud and hard that God hurrys and knocks these people of the pedistals that they have put themselves on...[SIZE=3][FONT=Comic Sans MS]",
