   "Taken from \n http://www.housing.odpm.gov.uk/information/index05.htm\n \n \"Nuisance and anti-social behaviour\n Anti-social behaviour can destroy lives and wreck communities. Research shows that up to 20% of housing managers' time is spent on dealing with nuisance behaviour, and between 2 and 10% of tenants on any given estate have been the subject of complaints.\n \n Everyone can come up with their own definitition based on their own experiences, but briefly, anti-social behaviour can range from very serious, perhaps criminal behaviour such as:\n \n drug dealing \n racial harassment \n physical violence \n to less serious, but equally distressing behaviour, including:\n \n loud music, particularly at night \n barking dogs \n verbal abuse \n It can affect individuals on an estate, or it can affect everyone. The behaviour of one family can be enough to make people want to move away from an area.\n \n The Government is determined that local authorities should make tackling anti-social behaviour and neighbour nuisance a top priority. The laws are there to be used and the main provisions are set out below. The Government is working with local authorities, academics and professional housing bodies, to produce good practice guidance to ensure that the existing provisions are used as effectively as possible to tackle problems on the ground.\"\n \n \n I would like to know what problems people have with the prevention of the aforementioned anti-social activities. \n \n Anti-social in this circumstance does not mean being unsociable, it refers to playing loud music at night, which is clearly an offence, harassment, etc etc. Why would you want to allow people to do these things unchecked?",
