For example...\n \n \nAh, but we have experience with radio transmitters. At least with extraterrestrial intelligences we can guess what might have happened. But we don't have any experience with unembodied designers, and that's clearly what we're dealing with when it comes to design in biology. Actually, if an unembodied designer is responsible for biological complexity, then we do have quite a bit of experience with such a designer through the designed objects (not least ourselves) that confront us all the time. On the other hand, it is true that we possess very little insight at this time into how such a designer acted to bring about the complex biological systems that have emerged over the course of natural history. \n \n ...\n \n It is no objection at all that we don't at this time know how an unembodied designer produced a biological system that exhibits specified complexity. We know that specified complexity is reliably correlated with the effects of intelligence. The only reason to insist on looking for non-telic explanations to explain the complex specified structures in biology is because of prior commitment to naturalism that perforce excludes unembodied designers.\n \n (emphasis added, Is Intelligent Design Testable?, William A. Dembski, 01.24.01 http://www.arn.org/docs/dembski/wd_isidtestable.htm) \n\n \n What else could an unembodied designer, which naturalism perforce excludes, be but a deity? \n \n So Dembski's ID has one or more unspecified deities - supernatural, unembodied designers - creating biological systems, at some unknown time, at some unknown place, by some unknown series of steps.

MOVING THE GOAL POSTS!\n \n You're off to a horrible start in this thread marc9000. You started right off making some very confused and incorrect statements, then followed right up with an underhanded tactic! Bravo my friend, bravo.\n \n \nDamEtel: 2) Evolution is not atheist in nature ... you have it backwards. \n\n \n \nmarc9000: It really is atheist in nature ...\n\n \n No, it's not. \n \n While it is true that a God cannot be incorporated into the theory of evolution and it remain science, that is not the same as saying evlolution is atheistic. Simple fact is, not incorporating a God is not the same as stating that there is no God. Two different things.\n \n Also, how do you explain that 40% of prominent, mainstream scientists in the US who accept evolution, also accept a personal God who one can pray to and expect a \"response\"? How can evolution be atheist in nature, yet have 40% of its followers believe in the reality of a God?\n \n \n \nDamEtel: Atheists are evolutionists \"by definition\" because they reject God, and therefore have to accept evolution. But evolutionists are in no way forced to be atheists ... there are many evolutionists who accept the existence of God; they're called theistic evolutionists. \n\n \n \nmarc9000: Then why do atheists object to the teaching of theistic evolution in schools?\n\n \n Misleading and silly. \n \n I just watched a Larry King Live show last week that concerned the teaching of Intelligent Design in public school science classes:3 people pro and 3 con. One of those opposed to teaching ID as science was a Creationist! Not an atheist, but a hard-core, take-Genesis-literally, believer in a God. So don't try to imply that it is only atheists who object to the teaching of religious ideas as science.\n \n Now let's look at the silliness of your question. Why would ATHEISTS object to THEISTIC evolution being taught in science class? Gee, one reason for this is probably the same reason that THEISTS would object to ATHEISM being taught in churches! Were you really stumped by that? \n \n Why don't we all start petitioning our representatives to pass a law that requires churches to \"teach the controversy\"? Did the dead rise out of their tombs and walk into town when Jesus died on the cross? Did Mary really see an angel roll the stone away from Jesus's tomb? Is Jesus really God? Was God evil when He gave Satan the thumbs up to kill Job's children? Just how many of each animal did God tell Noah to take on the ark? Did God really create the sun after creating plants? Did God really create animals after creating fruit bearing plants? Did God really create birds and sea life at the same time? Did God really create the Earth just 6,000 years ago? Did Moses part the Red Sea or the sea of reeds? Did Enoch ascend into heaven? Why could a God-chosen army, with God on their side, not defeat an opposing army because the opponents has chariots of iron? Was Lot really a righteous man, considering that he attempted to hand over his virgin daughters to a crowd of horny men to be gang raped? Does God condone incest, considering how Genesis tells us that both of Lot's daughters got their father drunk and raped him, becoming pregnant? Is spilling one's seed on the ground really a crime so horrible that God should kill you? Was Abraham mentally disturbed for binding his son Isaac, throwing him up on an altar to be burned, and coming at his son with a knife to slay him? Was Isaac really Abraham's only son? And so on, and so on, and so on.\n \n \n \n Now, since you are trying to move the goalposts, let me re-establish where they are.\n \n \nmarc9000: Science IS largely evolution, and it's a backdoor for teaching atheism in public schools.\n\n \n \nDamEtel: You're horribly confused.\n \n 1) Science is NOT largely evolution.

You started right off making some very confused and incorrect statements, then followed right up with an underhanded tactic! Bravo my friend, bravo. \n\n \n The theory of atheism says order came from disorder. Since a defined beginning has pretty well been proven, atheism seems to say a beginning had no cause. The Law of Causality says that everything that had a beginning had a cause - it's the fundamental principle of science.\n \n \n \nNo, it's not. \n \n While it is true that a God cannot be incorporated into the theory of evolution and it remain science, that is not the same as saying evlolution is atheistic. Simple fact is, not incorporating a God is not the same as stating that there is no God. Two different things. \n\n \n So it's possible to not incorporate a God, yet not comment on the possibility of God? That's called 'uncertainty' - that's the most sound education possible that we should give children?\n \n \nAlso, how do you explain that 40% of prominent, mainstream scientists in the US who accept evolution, also accept a personal God who one can pray to and expect a \"response\"? How can evolution be atheist in nature, yet have 40% of its followers believe in the reality of a God? \n\n \n I'm saying evolution as it relates to a beginning is atheist. If 40% of scientests believe in some types of evolution, and also \"accept a personal God\" (believe in supernatural creation) how can you say creation isn't scientific? \n \n \n \nMisleading and silly. \n \n I just watched a Larry King Live show last week that concerned the teaching of Intelligent Design in public school science classes:3 people pro and 3 con. One of those opposed to teaching ID as science was a Creationist! Not an atheist, but a hard-core, take-Genesis-literally, believer in a God. So don't try to imply that it is only atheists who object to the teaching of religious ideas as science. \n\n \n One of the oldest tricks in the book, and you fall for it. Atheists masquerading as Christians. Who was it \"the reverend\" Barry Lynn? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nNow let's look at the silliness of your question. Why would ATHEISTS object to THEISTIC evolution being taught in science class? Gee, one reason for this is probably the same reason that THEISTS would object to ATHEISM being taught in churches! Were you really stumped by that? \n\n \n I would be stumped if that many atheist were so clueless to think that churches and public schools are controlled and funded in the same ways! Chruches are privately controlled and funded by Theists! Public schools are funded by taxpayers, the majority of whom believe in creation!! \n \n \nWhy don't we all start petitioning our representatives to pass a law that requires churches to \"teach the controversy\"? Did the dead rise out of their tombs and walk into town when Jesus died on the cross? Did Mary really see an angel roll the stone away from Jesus's tomb? Is Jesus really God? Was God evil when He gave Satan the thumbs up to kill Job's children? Just how many of each animal did God tell Noah to take on the ark? Did God really create the sun after creating plants? Did God really create animals after creating fruit bearing plants? Did God really create birds and sea life at the same time? Did God really create the Earth just 6,000 years ago? Did Moses part the Red Sea or the sea of reeds? Did Enoch ascend into heaven? Why could a God-chosen army, with God on their side, not defeat an opposing army because the opponents has chariots of iron? Was Lot really a righteous man, considering that he attempted to hand over his virgin daughters to a crowd of horny men to be gang raped? Does God condone incest, considering how Genesis tells us that both of Lot's daughters got their father drunk and raped him, becoming pregnant? Is spilling one's seed on the ground really a crime so horrible that God should kill you? Was Abraham mentally disturbed for binding his son Isaac, throwing him up on an altar to be burned, and coming at his son with a knife to slay him? Was Isaac really Abraham's only son? And so on, and so on, and so on.\n\n \n The Bible has been mocked for centuries, and for centuries it has stood the test of time. It also deals with subjects like right and wrong, good and evil, bad and good, sin and forgiveness. Why don't you mock them as well? \n \n \n \n \nNow, since you are trying to move the goalposts, let me re-establish where they are.\n\n \n Please re-read post #1 and the link.

   "While that may be what religion, or better expressed as certain religiously motivated groups, is doing, that is not what those who oppose the teaching if ID or any other form of creationism in science classes are doing. There may be a place for the teaching of various forms of creationism in the proper context - comparative religions, mythology, and maybe others. What we are saying is that just because someone can express an idea does not make it worthy of being taught along side of science.\n \n \n Moreover, you may teach your children whatever you wish about origins and ID. You may even call it science if you want, although it wouldn't be true. I have no objection to what you teach your children about your religion in your home or in your church. However, I do object to having my children taught your religion in public school science classes. I prefer that they learn science there, I'll teach them my religion where appropriate, and I object to the forced teaching of your religion.\n \n Or possibly you, Bush and McCain think that it is a good idea to teach alchemy in chemistry classes, after all, it is just another point of view isn't it? How about geocentrism in astronomy class and flat earthism in geography. You know, present every idea ever expressed and let the kids sort it out. Or perhaps should we teach only valid, empirically supported and tested scientific ideas in science classes?\n\n \n \n \n \nI have to disagree with you Big Orn.\n \n If you're teaching science, you teach SCIENCE. ID is religion, plain and simple.\n \n There's plenty of room in philosophy classes, religion classes, etc... for alternative ideas such as ID.\n \n We should be striving to give our children the best possible scientific education available in order for them to be able to compete on a world scale.\n \n The child still has every right to learn on their own, on their own being the key phrase, not in the classroom during a structured science class.\n \n There's always Sunday school.\n \n Waxy\n\n I think both of you know where I stand on the teaching of religion in public schools, but I am not talking about religion. People cannot accept new ideas if they are not exposed to new ideas. If a child never goes to church he/she would have no idea what the majority of Americans believe in - that being ID. So what - it's certainly not forced on that child to believe it. When I was growing up in rural Redneckville we were taught evolution in school and never once did our church object. Why should schools object to presenting alternate theories?\n One thing does bother me; a cloud that I can see hovering over this entire concept: What if religion does creep into the classroom? What happens when nothing is left but empty thought? Without giving the whole reason for Intelligent Design, then ID is lost altogether, imo. In all seriousness, without teaching the Gospel in schools and why God created us, then the whole idea of ID goes out the window.\n Due to ignorance and hardheartedness, God is left out of today's schools, which are being stroked all too often with the same broad brush - north to south, east to west - regardless of regional customs. I feel that that, in itself, is a tragedy. But I also feel that it is falling in line with scripture - which is fodder for another thread.\n \n It reminds me of a sentence in the novel Inherit the Wind, which reads, \"You see, I haven't really thought very much. I was always afraid of what I might think-so it seemed safer not to think at all. But now I know. A thought is like a child inside our body. It has to be born.

There are a large class of religious people known as theistic evolutionists who hold to the former but reject the latter. In that case, there is agreement that evolution is the process by which the world was created--but disagreement as to the initial cause that set evolution on its path, and perhaps the reason it continued to reach our present existence. ID does not state that God created the world in seven days or that He created the world over billions of years by a process of evolution, only that He was ultimately behind it. So my question is, does that make a difference to those who vehemently battle for teaching the theory of evolution in public schools, that ID could allow for the theory to be taught as is and only bring in different views on the issue of why it happened, not how?\n At the second point I won't argue that ID isn't religion. However, there are many conscientious observers who might point out that a worldview that regards science as the ultimate authority in determining truth is a religion unto itself. I don't think it would be unfair to say that some of the posters on this thread worship science with greater fidelity than many religious people give to their deity. That being the case, we are not actually dealing with a question of whether a religious view or no religious view should be taught--to frame the controversy thus is to turn a blind eye to the reality that any system intent on establishing criteria for declaring truth is a religion, for that is what religions hold in common. Not all religions have a god, not all believe in the supernatural, but all have some standard for deciding what is true--and a blind adherence to science is possibly one of the most pervasive religions in our world today. In light of this, shouldn't we be asking ourselves not whether religion should be taught in public school science, but whether it is right for the religion that has there attained dominance to maintain a monopoly over the minds of all the students to attend, unchallenged by other worldviews? Don't try to shove this to one side with some emotionally-grounded response that strict adherence to science does not imply a certain worldview; it in fact presupposes one. The dominant secular western consensus that science is the ultimate basis for truth is not, in fact, universal--and the diversity of truth systems held by others in the world is not evidence that we science worshippers are just smarter than they are. There is a question whether in our science classes we should teach science as informed by numerous understandings of its capacities or whether we should teach it as a stand-alone truth maker, and arguing that science should be taught as science alone is to promote a specific religious worldview.

It might be a good example to discuss in a philosophy of science class to point out on the difference between science and psuedoscience though. It can be discussed in a philophy class It should be be taught as SCIENCE though.. there is the point.",

   "I don't think it would be unfair to say that some of the posters on this thread worship science with greater fidelity than many religious people give to their deity. That being the case, we are not actually dealing with a question of whether a religious view or no religious view should be taught--to frame the controversy thus is to turn a blind eye to the reality that any system intent on establishing criteria for declaring truth is a religion, for that is what religions hold in common. Not all religions have a god, not all believe in the supernatural, but all have some standard for deciding what is true--and a blind adherence to science is possibly one of the most pervasive religions in our world today.\n\n \n Emphasis added.\n \n No, there is more to defining a religion than the fact that it makes truth claims. Is mathematics a religion? If not, why not? Is the Declaration of Independence ('we hold these truths to be self-evident...') a religious document?\n \n Your argument is a very clumsy one: you assert - without foundation - that science is as much a religion as - er- religion, then conclude that since it's all the same thing we might as well throw ID into the science classroom. Nice try, but no coconut.\n \n \nThe question is only whether we exclude all worldviews but one or allow a number of alternatives to our students. And if science is so powerful as its worshippers believe it should be able to hold its own when confronted by the alternatives, and not have to hide from them.\n\n \n It's been said many times by many people, but I suppose it needs to be said again.\n \n Opponents of ID in science classrooms are not seeking to have nothing but science taught to students. They are seeking to have nothing but science taught as science.",

   "Nice try but no coconut?\n If that's what debate has come to things are in a very sorry state. You can poke around ad hominem criticisms declaring that an argument has no foundation all you want, as long as you realize you aren't really saying anything of substance.\n The Declaration of Independence is not a religious document in that its purpose is to proselytize...which is more than can be said for any given origins theory...but it is a religious document in that it presupposes and promotes a certain world view filled with religious ideals, such as the writers' concepts of rights and morality. Mathematics is not a religion in itself, but it has the potential to be one if a person elevates its claims about reality above all other fields of truth claims.\n \n Your quote about having nothing but science taught as science is indicative that you do not understand the whole point of what I was trying to say. It is not possible to communicate without carrying a worldview in what you say. Science is not by nature a religion, but communicating scientific fact is not possible independent of communicating a certain worldview that will contain elements that are best defined as religious. Teach only science in the science class, that is fine. However, no one teaches only science without teaching a certain worldview. What those who want ID to be taught assert is that science should be taught in the framework of a theistic worldview. What those who do not want ID to be taught assert is that science should be taught in the framework of a naturalistic worldview. You cannot teach science without any world view, just as you cannot communicate without including your worldview. The statement that only science should be taught in a science classroom demonstrates a failure to understand that in every discipline there are presuppositions and implications that will be carried by how that discipline is taught. The platitude you so happily tossed my way rather than make a constructive argument is a rhetorical element carried over from our dominant social structure of naturalistic chauvanism.",

You might as well refer to structural engineering or linear algebra as world views. Please don't obscure the difference between methodological naturalism and philosophical naturalism. By doing so, you are just copying the Discovery Institute's \"Wedge Strategy\". Tell me how you can use a non-naturalistic method to test for ID. I would also like you to back up your claims that the empirical methods of science require a naturalistic world view. The more I read posts like your's the more I become convinced that ID is just a clever strategy of stealth creationism.",

   "Still you do not realize that the fundamental emphasis is not on the reality of science or its nature but upon the mediation of it as it is communicated in the classroom. It is not the facts of science that comprise a worldview as you would seem to think I was asserting by your statement about engineering and algebra, it is the framework within which those facts are transmitted that betrays the worldview of the communicator. There is no dispute here concerning the difference between methodological and philosophical naturalism, that is not what this argument is about. You insert such comments because you don't see that the ID controversy is centered on the philosophical level, that is how it differs from creationism. And as I said before, there are quite a few ID proponents who would agree to all the empirical evidences of the Earth evolving over billions of years, they don't have any wish to dispute that. But humans are not merely transmitters of fact. We choose the information we portray, framing our communications for \"selection and salience\" in order to persuade others of the validity of our reality. Our methods and framing choices transmit our worldview, and for all our efforts we cannot escape it.\n Try to understand what I am saying; humans are incapable of teaching science without teaching it in the framework of a certain worldview. Right now in our education system the philosophical/religious worldview that is communicated when science is taught is naturalism. ID wants to teach science in the framework of theism. The science in both cases can remain the same, but the method of communication makes all the difference in terms of what worldview is communicated. That is where the debate is centered; this is not an issue of science, it is one of philosophy and inclusive or exclusive philosophy in education.",
