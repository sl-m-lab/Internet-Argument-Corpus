People - be they religious or secular - will very often find excuses to justify the vicious acts that they commit. The underlying reasons for those vicious acts usually have little to do with religion and more to do with greed or vengeance. Religion and other ideologies are often just used to justify those acts. I think the main problem with religion and other unquestioned ideologies (such as Communism) is the very idea that they cannot be questioned and are not subject to change based on evidence. That makes them so easy to exploit as justifications for cruel attrocities.\n \n I think that a culture of transparency which allows for government criticism and analytical comparison of the government claims with evidence from reality is a culture that is less likely to commit attrocities. Though, in the US, we claim to have full freedom of the press, this freedom is often quite limited by government secrecy and is often curtailed by accusations of anti-patriotism.

Even if you take Middle Eastern terrorism, the terrorism of the Palestinian's against Israel is driven by their sense of desparation at being an occupied and downtrodden people with little or no legal recourse. There may be religious rhethoric used in that call to terrorism and there is certainly religious support in claiming that those who thus kill themselves will automatically go to heaven, but the force driving that terrorism is a political force. \n \n The terrorism of Al Qaeda against the US seems to be driven by a leadership that demonizes US actions (not US religious beliefs). They are not saying - attack the US because the US is mainly non-Muslim. They are saying - attack the US because we one-sidedly support Israel in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we support dictatorial regimes, we have invaded Iraq, etc. They call us the \"Great Satan\" not because we are non-Muslim but because they distort our purposes and actions to make us appear evil, so their followers view attacks against us as justified.\n \n Some say that they hate us because of our democracy. I would agree that most followers of militant Islam do not support democracy, supporting a religious oligarchy instead. However, if we, as a nation, would never have imposed our will on them but kept our military, CIA and our cultural influences to ourselves, then I highly doubt such terrorist actions would have taken place. You don't see them attacking Switzerland, Denmark, or other neutral democratic countries that don't interfere with the Middle East. I am not saying that the arguements that these terrorists use are reasonable - just that they are not purely motivated by religion. Religious arguements just seem to form a cloak around a core of political motivation.",

Religious arguements just seem to form a cloak around a core of political motivation.\n This excellent essay by Neal Gabler makes the point that fundamentalist groups like Al Qaeda indeed do consider us enemies for religious reasons... but in a much broader sense than that of just one sect vs. another: \nOur new war is a battle between mythos and logos. \n \n \n Osama bin Laden, the Taliban and their Muslim fundamentalist allies live within mythos and have subordinated themselves to it. They see themselves not as individuals with wants and needs, which is a relatively modern notion, but as operatives of Allah. For them, everything is religion, everything faith. In fact, they don't acknowledge any other legitimate way to look at the world. They are essentially premodern and ahistorical, believing only in what has been passed down to them by Allah; in the madrasas, the Muslim religious schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan, students are strictly forbidden from learning anything except the Koran, that is, anything except mythos. When zealots talk about bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age, it is futile not only because the Taliban are already there physically but because they are also there epistemologically. \n \n \n The spiritual and the rational can coexist, as they do in almost every society, but Muslim fundamentalist terrorists don't see it that way. As premodernists, they believe the two mind-sets are mutually exclusive; their grievance is that their way of thinking is being destroyed by the inundation of Western influences, which globalization has made it impossible to escape. They don't want our reason; they demand blind faith. They don't want progress; they demand tradition as prescribed by the Muslim fundamentalist clerics. But since they aren't pluralists and since they don't believe in tolerance, personal choice or persuasion, all of which are rationalist notions, their only option is to eradicate logos itself before it eradicates them. Their mission is to rescue the world from rationality and restore it to religion as they interpret it. \n \n \n In effect, they are attempting to turn back the clock to the time when reason wasn't empowered, and they are trying to purify the world of its putative secular taint, which is why they are always invoking the name of Allah to justify their crimes. Terrorism isn't their way back into the world, as it is for most terrorist groups trying to win recognition or gain some sort of advantage. For Bin Laden, terrorism is a way of destroying the world that has marginalized him.\n http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0102/gabler1.asp\n \n I highly recommend reading the entire article.",

No doubt, their version of the Islamic religion plays a critically important role in their lives and strongly influences how they view others. However, the question remains, why did they choose to attack the US as opposed to other countries?\n \n The following web site summarizes and explores the reasons Al Qaeda itself gave in a declaration to justify its attack on 9/11:  http://ics.leeds.ac.uk/papers/vp01.cfm?outfit=pmt&folder=10&paper=540 Al Qaeda had issued this declaration because of all of the criticism it had received from others in the Middle East about targeting innocent civilians in the 9/11 attacks. As a preamble to the documents justifying their attack, they write:\n \n \nBy means of this document we send a message to America and those behind it. We are coming, by the will of God almighty, no matter what America does. It will never be safe from the fury of Muslims. America is the one who began the war, and it will lose the battle by the permission of God almighty. \n -- Al-Qaeda statement, April 24, 2002 \n\n Yes, everything is couched in religious terms, but it is the \"fury\" of the Muslims against America and the idea that we \"began the war\" that are the main reasons given. \n \n The summary of the Al Qaeda document in that web site goes on to outline the main points made by Al Qaeda:\n \nFirst, proponents of a non-violent response to the United States are corrupt, ignorant and/or hypocritical, and therefore are not credible religious mediators. This is contrasted with the scientific, independent and religiously authentic interpretation of the jihadi Salafis. Second, the United States is waging a war against Islam. Therefore, violence is a defensive jihad that is incumbent upon all Muslims. And third, there is no unconditional prohibition against killing civilians in Islam. In fact, civilians can be purposely targeted under certain conditions, and these conditions are met in the current climate.\n\n The article goes on to outline many of the more detailed arguements presented by Al Qaeda, but this was the crux of their arguement. So, the reason they are targeting the United States specifically is that it is viewed as waging a war against Islam, for which they view a defensive jihad as not only justified but necessary.",

   "That's where they're screwed in the head. If we were really waging a war against people of the Islam faith we'd be butchering muslims here in the US too, along with other Islamic states we're currently at peace with.\n\n I agree. They seem to mainly be completely distoring some of our actions in the Middle East to jump to the exreme conclusion that we are waging a war against Islam. According to the Al Qaeda declaration summarized in that web site, some of the specific grievances they claimed against us include:\n \nConsistent with this understanding, the 2002 document frames September 11 and other al-Qaeda operations as defensive measures to protect the Muslim community from outside aggression. The argument repeats the framing in earlier al-Qaeda documents and includes a litany of U.S. aggressions and crimes against Islam: support for Israel against the Palestinians; support for Serbian genocide against Bosnian Muslims; support for India against the Kashmiris; the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan; actions in East Timor; support for the Philippine aggression against Muslims in the south. The document frames these examples as indicative of a nefarious \"Zionist-Crusader\" plot to annihilate Muslims. Under this assault, al-Qaeda argues that violence is the only solution: \"The only way to liberation from this humiliation is the sword, which is the only language the enemy understands that will deter it.\" September 11 is thus portrayed as a defensive response necessary to thwart U.S. aggression against the Muslim world. \n\n I certainly agree that to claim that we are waging a war against Islam is very much a distortion of our motives and actions. However, it does suggest that we should try to avoid unnecessarily adding fuel to the already existing fire. For example, the US does seem to favor Israel too one-sidedly in its conflict with the Palestinians and lack of progress in the peace process exacerbates those grievances. Also, Bush's unintentional use of the term \"crusade\" was completely misinterpreted in the Muslim world. It is a term full of sensitivity because of their experience with Christian crusades in the Middle Ages. \n \n Nevertheless, we cannot avoid those actions - military or otherwise - that actually ARE necessary for fear of paranoia on the part of those in the Middle East. All we can do is play as fairly as we can. I think we could also do a better job of passing on the message to those in the Middle East how our intentions are not as nasty as they believe.",

   "It is simply not fair to describe Christianity by the events and directives in the Old Testament. Jesus made it clear that the violent things they did in that era, like stoning for instance, simply was no longer acceptable. \n\n First of all, I am curious, can you reference the passage in which Jesus rejected all the violent ways of the Old Testament. The only thing I remember is his saving of a woman from stoning by calling on those without sin to cast the first stone. If you are extrapolating from that, then that is a HUGE assumption on your part. I have never heard of mainstream Christianity officially rejecting the Old Testament or any parts of it. After all, it is always (or nearly always) included in whole in Bibles - why would that be if the Old Testament or parts of it were rejected? \n \n There are many nasty aspects of the Old Testament justifying violence on a mass scale. Just as those who practice extremist Islam pick and choose among the packages of the Koran to justify their actions, those who practice or practiced violent acts have often justified their acts using selected passages from the Bible - ALL of it, not just the New Testament. \n \n You are picking and choosing yourself by ignoring the Old Testament. If Christianity rejects those teachings, it should exclude the Old Testament and officially reject it.",

   "It is both. God chose to act more violently in those situations in the OT. Doesn't mean we can do that in post-OT times.\n\n So God changed His mind? It was morally fine to wage an agressive war in the past and it is not morally fine now? What made the difference? If you say Jesus' teaching, then, if you claim that the Bible is the word of God, then that does not change the fact that it WAS considered morally right in the past. God does not make mistakes. If you say that one cannot know the will of God and why it was ok then and not now, then that is one interpretation - yours and those who believe like you. Other Christians might interpret that there ARE situations which allow for violence which God supports. It is a matter of interpretation of the Bible since the Bible offers enough content that can be construed in particular ways. \n \n This is the same thing that is done by radical Muslims. They selectively concentrate on those parts of the Koran that support their views. That is THEIR interpretation. \n \n The only way for a religion to claim innocence is to be so fully self-consistent that one could not selectively pick and choose among the text to find justification for violent acts. Neither the Bible nor the Koran seem to be sufficiently self-consistent. If one can blaim the acts of extremist Muslims, who concentrate on the violent sections of the Koran, on Islam, then one can do the same for acts of extremist Christians. That is my main point.\n \nThey are not a mainstream Christian group at all. That clearly is counter to Jesus' teaching, so it is not Christian.\n\n The trouble with finding mainstream groups is that the West - meaning the great majority of Christians - had gone through the philosophical transformations of the Enlightment in the 17th/18th centuries, something that Islam has not experienced. Therefore, using religious arguements to wage war or violent attrocities was no longer considered as culturally acceptable. One would have to look at mainstream Christianity prior to that to find comparitive justifications for violence. Indeed, one finds it in the massacres and enslavement of indigenous peoples of the Americas by the Spanish conquerors who fought in the name of God and the monarchy. Often, justifications were presented in exploiting these people because they were not Christian. Also, a large number of people died during the wars of the Reformation in order to support particular brands of Christianity. The earlier violence of the Spanish Inquisition also killed large numbers of people. The violence of the Crusades is an even earlier example.\n \nI'm not going to get into a war debate with you.

Part of the reason for this is that the Bible was not really available to the masses; the only thing available to them in terms of what Jesus actually said was what their church leaders allowed them to hear. It's no coincidence, IMO, that holy wars in Christianity began falling by the wayside around the same time that the Bible started becoming more widely available--around the protestant reformation and the invention of the printing press.\n \n \nDo you think that a religion bears no responsibility for those who pick and choose from it to justify their acts?\n\n \n Not if the religion actually teaches counter to what those people are doing, as in this case.\n \n \nI still say that those religions that are not so self-consistent in their message that they cannot be distorted are religions that do bear some of the brunt of responsibility for the actions of their adherents.\n\n \n How can you reasonably blame statements like \"love your enemies\" for violence? That is, after all, what we're dealing with here. On one hand you say it comes down to different interpretations, then want to blame the religion (which clearly teaches peace) rather than the people who wrongly interpreted. That doesn't seem rational to me.\n \n \nThe Old Testament leaves a lot of room for such interpretations, especially since any renounciations of the OT by Jesus that you claim are very indirect and since many a religious scholar claimed that God supported violence in certain situations. \n\n \n The only thing you have to go back on is the OT. Why would you want to define the NT by the OT? I would encourage you to read what Jesus said about \"the law and the prophets\" (the OT). He said the law and prophets are summed in the laws of love (love God, and love your neighbor). It seems to me that for a Christian, the interpretation of the OT that should supercedes others is that of Christ and what He said about it.\n \n \nSt. Benadict, for example, apparently did support the concept of holy war. \n \n It is all a matter of interpretation.\n\n \n So how else can \"love your enemies\" and forgive others\" possibly be interpreted? Those are pretty clear cut. How could you say that when someone goes and kills Muslims that they aren't going against those statements of Jesus? As I said earlier, there probably are rare instances where war may lead to a compassionate end, but they would be the exceptions (by far) and not the rule (Such as the war against Nazi Germany.) I'm not saying people don't have interpretations; I'm saying that the interpretation of non-violence is, IMO, the correct one when it comes to Christianity. Frankly I just don't see why this is something people here would disagree with. It seems to me that in most cases, an action should be able to be checked against the teachings of Christ--it's not like \"love your enemies\" and \"forgive others\" are vague statements. The reason people generally don't do them isn't because they interpret those statement differently (they can only be interpreted one way); it's because they don't WANT to do them in a given situation.",

He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.

Even the lesser gentry (with little political clout) would have probably been able to afford hand written bibles. The fact that bibles got in the hands of everyday people probably did not have much of an effect on the wars waged until after more democracy started getting introduced.",

Marcionism was eventually condemned as heresy by the institututional Church.\n \n Also, you seem to feel it is important that Jesus should have denied that God supported violence, but it's not.

   "It could be argued that the Enlightenment was responsible for the violence of the French Revolution - in which an attempt was made to supplant the Christian religion with a political religion. \n \n According to many secular critics, by dealing in moral absolutes or through focus on the transcendental, religious people are supposed to be intolerant, indifferent to the merely temporal, or drag societies into sectarianism. All of these arguments could be applied to secular ideological fanaticisms - notably fascism and communism - and neglect the work done by Churches to bring about peace and reconciliation in even the most vicious conflicts. \n \n (By the way, though I don't agree with some of your conclusions, your arguments are well reasoned and a pleasure to read).\n \n James.\n\n I agree that there are secular ideologies that also can be used and distorted to justify war. As you say, fascism and communism are two examples. As I mentioned in an earlier post, I think the main problem with religion and other unquestioned ideologies (such as Communism) is the very idea that they cannot be questioned and are not subject to change based on evidence. That makes them so easy to exploit as justifications for war and violence.\n \n Having said that, it is interesting to note, as you said, that Churches have often acted to bring about peace and reconciliation as well. I think both Christianity and Islam have adherents that are peace loving and those who advocate war and violence. In the past, Christianity in general seemed to be far more supportive of violence than it is now. It is indeed interesting to explore the reasons why that change occurred, which seemed to coincide with the Enlightment. Islam never went through its Enlightment and never separated its religion from the seats of power. Given that, unlike Jesus, Mohammed was both a religious and secular leader, I suspect that such a separation might not even be possible without a rejection of many of the tenets of Islam itself. I suspect that it is that connection with power which most drives religions to justifications of violence.",

The whole trinity is indeed a confusing concept - trying to call the father, son and holy spirit one god instead of three separate spiritual entities. Be that as it may, whether Jesus is identical to the God of the old testament or not, there was clearly a time where God did support wars, according to the Bible, and it was never clearly stated that such a time will not return or it was never clearly stated that God's policy had changed. It really does seem like two religions linked into one.

On the other hand, statements like \"love your enemies\" and \"forgive others\" are clear-cut--I don't see how that can reasonably be interpreted any other way than what it literally says.\n\n Even if Jesus was consistent in his message, which some argue otherwise, then he was inconsistent with the message of the past in the OT and never repudiated those OT messages or stated that there is a change - this leads to lack of clarity of message and, thus, to various interpretations.\n \nWell, let's break this down logically, with facts:[*]The Bible demonstrates NT Christian teaching as being peaceful and forgiving.[*]Before Bibles became prevalent among Christian people, religious wars were more common.[*]Around the time Bibles became more prevalent among Christian people, religious wars started becoming less common.\n Given those three facts, I think it is safe to postulate that the Bible becoming more widespread helped (not as a SOLE cause) to curb the prevalence of religious wars. Is it definitive? No. But my claim was that I don't believe it is a coincidence. And I don't. I believe they are related, and that it was an influence.\n\n If there are dozens of new factors that are followed by certain changes (in this case, less violence in the name of the Church), one cannot pick one of those factors (printing of the Bible in this case) as say that THAT is the one which caused the change without both detailing the mechanism and giving reasons why the other factors (ex. the reformation, enlightment, etc.) are less relevant. You have not done that. Indeed, I presented an arguement showing how those with the power to cause violence on a mass scale (wars or otherwise) would already have had access to hand written Bibles. You have given no arguements to repudiate my point. Either way, this is not a major issue for our discussion. \n \n On a more general note, my guess is that one of the main purposes of this thread was to surmise what would happen regarding Middle Eastern terrorism if the people of the Middle East were Christians, and not Muslims. In comparing Christianity to Islam, I would agree that the texts of the religions themselves show much more openess to violence in the Koran with its teachings of Muhammed than in the New Testament of the Bible with its teachings of Jesus. The Old Testament is supportive of violence but not in the same way as is the Koran. So, I would conclude that Christians suffering under the same political stresses as Middle Eastern muslims would be less likely to find justification for terrorism and violence in their religion. Nonetheless, human nature is human nature and many who might find themselves in desparate situations where they have no other voice might either distort their religious views or secular ones to justify violence that they might feel compelled to engage in. I think, under certain extreme circumstances, acts come first and justifications come later. All in all, though, I would think that Christians would, on average, engage in other means of fighting against their situation - if only for the reason that few people would be convinced to be suicide bombers if the Bible does not explicitly support that.",

It will be the Government's care to maintain honest co-operation between Church and State; the struggle against materialistic views and for a real national community is just as much in the interest of the German nation as in that of the welfare of our Christian faith.

   "Hitler a Christian? Ha!\n \n Jesus himself provided a number of clues as to what constituted a true Christian. First, he warned his followers about \"Wolves in sheep's clothing\" - an obvious indication that not everyone who will claim to follow Christ would be a Christian. History is full of these wolves and charlatans. But then, Jesus said one more thing that by which people would know who is and who is not a Christian: \"You shall know them by their fruits.\" Obviously, Hitler's \"fruits\" / works were heinous and against almost everything that Jesus taught. Instead of \"Love your neighbor,\" Hitler invaded and murdered his neighbors.\n\n \n Sounds familiar doesn't it?\n \n \n \nHe committed almost every despicable crime there was. So, I think anyone who wants to argue that Hitler was a Christian has to take that into consideration.\n\n \n I could find a million reasons why you are or are not a christian, the bible is so contradictory that you could do that with just about anyone.\n \n \n \n \nWe also have these quotations from Adolph Hitler that indicate his twisted mentality, and his hatred of true Christianity: \n \n \"Christianity is an invention of sick brains,\" Adolf Hitler, December 13, 1941.\n \"So it's not opportune to hurl ourselves now into a struggle with the Churches. The best thing is to let Christianity die a natural death,\" Adolf Hitler, October 14, 1941.\n \n Night of 11th-12th July, 1941: \n National Socialism and religion cannot exist together.... The heaviest blow that ever struck humanity was the coming of Christianity. Bolshevism is Christianity's illegitimate child. Both are inventions of the Jew. The deliberate lie in the matter of religion was introduced into the world by Christianity.... Let it not be said that Christianity brought man the life of the soul, for that evolution was in the natural order of things. (p 6 & 7) \n \n 10th October, 1941, midday: \n Christianity is a rebellion against natural law, a protest against nature. Taken to its logical extreme, Christianity would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure. (p 43)\n \n 14th October, 1941, midday: \n The best thing is to let Christianity die a natural death.... When understanding of the universe has become widespread... Christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity.... Christianity has reached the peak of absurdity.... And that's why someday its structure will collapse.... ...the only way to get rid of Christianity is to allow it to die little by little.... Christianity the liar.... We'll see to it that the Churches cannot spread abroad teachings in conflict with the interests of the State. (p 49-52) \n \n 19th October, 1941, night: \n The reason why the ancient world was so pure, light and serene was that it knew nothing of the two great scourges: the pox and Christianity. \n \n 21st October, 1941, midday: \n Originally, Christianity was merely an incarnation of Bolshevism, the destroyer.... The decisive falsification of Jesus' doctrine was the work of St.Paul. He gave himself to this work... for the purposes of personal exploitation.... Didn't the world see, carried on right into the Middle Ages, the same old system of martyrs, tortures, f@gg@ts? Of old, it was in the name of Christianity. Today, it's in the name of Bolshevism. Yesterday the instigator was Saul: the instigator today, Mardochai. Saul was changed into St.Paul, and Mardochai into Karl Marx. By exterminating this pest, we shall do humanity a service of which our soldiers can have no idea. (p 63-65) \n \n 13th December, 1941, midnight: \n Christianity is an invention of sick brains: one could imagine nothing more senseless, nor any more indecent way of turning the idea of the Godhead into a mockery.... .... When all is said, we have no reason to wish that the Italians and Spaniards should free themselves from the drug of Christianity. Let's be the only people who are immunized against the disease. (p 118 & 119) \n \n 14th December, 1941, midday: \n Kerrl, with noblest of intentions, wanted to attempt a synthesis between National Socialism and Christianity. I don't believe the thing's possible, and I see the obstacle in Christianity itself.... Pure Christianity-- the Christianity of the catacombs-- is concerned with translating Christian doctrine into facts. It leads quite simply to the annihilation of mankind. It is merely whole-hearted Bolshevism, under a tinsel of metaphysics. (p 119 & 120) \n \n 9th April, 1942, dinner: \n There is something very unhealthy about Christianity (p 339) \n \n 27th February, 1942, midday: \n It would always be disagreeable for me to go down to posterity as a man who made concessions in this field. I realize that man, in his imperfection, can commit innumerable errors-- but to devote myself deliberately to errors, that is something I cannot do. I shall never come personally to terms with the Christian lie. Our epoch Uin the next 200 years will certainly see the end of the disease of Christianity....

   "http://nobeliefs.com/HitlerSources.htm\n \n Excerpt: \nThose who deny Hitler as a Christian will invariably find the recorded table talk conversations of Hitler from 1941 to 1944 as incontrovertible evidence that he could not have been a Christian. The source usually comes from the English translation edition by Norman Cameron and R. H. Stevens, with an introduction by H.R. Trevor-Roper. \n \n The table talk has Hitler saying such things such as: \"Christianity is an invention of sick brains...,\" \"The best thing is to let Christianity die a natural death.\" \n \n But those that argue against Hitler's Christianity fail to see that Christianity comes in many forms, two of which consist as: a belief system held by Christians, and organized religion. It was the latter, organized Christianity, that Hitler spoke against (just as many Christians do today). Not once does Hitler denounce his own Christianity nor does he speak against Jesus. On the contrary, the Table-Talk has Hitler speaking admirably about Jesus. But the problems with using Hitler's table talk conversations as evidence for Hitler's apostasy are manyfold: \n \n 1) The reliability of the source (hearsay and editing by the anti-Catholic, Bormann) \n \n 2) The Table-Talk reflects thoughts that do not occur in Hitler's other private or public conversations. \n \n 3) Nowhere does Hitler denounce Jesus or his Christianity. \n \n 4) The Table-Talk does not concur with Hitler's actions for \"positive\" Christianity.\n Similarly, vide:\n http://www.liesexposed.net/nfp/tabletalk/tabletalk.html\n http://ffrf.org/fttoday/2002/nov02/carrier.php",

   "Those who deny Hitler as a Christian ...\n\n \n The issue is not, nor has it been, anyone \"denying\" that Hitler claimed to be Christian. The real issue is whether or not Christianity was truly behind Hitler's atrocities. Considering that he killed Christians along with Jews, and that plenty of Christians opposed him, it seems pretty clear that he was not guided by his \"christianity\" if indeed he was Christian in any real way (doubtful given how obviously far removed his actions are from the teachings of Christ.) Regardless, frankly one has to wonder why some here feel it is so important to argue and so avidly defend the idea that Hitler was Christian.",

   "\n As Hitler grew in power, he made other anti-Christian statements. For example, he was quoted in Hitler: A Study in Tyranny, by Allan Bullock, as saying: \"I'll make these damned parsons feel the power of the state in a way they would have never believed possible. For the moment, I am just keeping my eye upon them: if I ever have the slightest suspicion that they are getting dangerous, I will shoot the lot of them. This filthy reptile raises its head whenever there is a sign of weakness in the State, and therefore it must be stamped on. We have no sort of use for a fairy story invented by the Jews.\" \n ....\n In other words, while he was certainly evil, he also usually knew which wars he could win (at least until 1941) and only fought those. He knew he could beat the Polish, French, and British armies and he allegedly counseled the Japanese against attacking the U.S.; he also requested that they open up a front against Russia. He couldn't beat the church in open warfare--so he took control and then attacked them piecemeal while making statements to put them at ease. Think about it--how many other times did Hitler break his word or ignore a treaty? He said whatever would make things easiest, and then ignored it later. \n Author Doug Krueger notes that \"so many Germans were religious believers that Hitler, if not religious himself, at least had to pretend to be a believer in order to gain support.\" He adds, \"If the [Christian] message won converts, it would seem that most Nazis were probably [Christians] too. After all, would appeal to divine mandate win more theists or atheists to the cause?\" He also points out that \"Even if Hitler was not a [Christian], he could still have been a theist. Or a deist\" (www.infidels.org/library /modern/doug_krueger/copin.html). Remember that being a non-Christian is not equal to being an atheist. \n \n When all is said and done, Krueger says that anecdotal evidence from those close to him near the end of his life suggests that he was a at least a deist, if not a theist. Krueger concludes: \"So here's what evidence we have. There is a certain worldview, Nazism. Its leader, Hitler, professes on many occasions to be religious, and he often states that he's doing the will of god. The majority of his followers are openly religious. There is no evidence anywhere that this leader ever professed to anyone that he is an atheist. He and his followers actively campaign against atheism, even to the point of physical force, and this leader allies himself with religious organizations and churches. This is the evidence. So where does atheism fit in?\" As Krueger notes, there seems to be no real evidence that Hitler was an atheist. On the other hand, since one could never be sure when he was speaking his real thoughts and when he was simply riling up the masses, it's difficult to say for certain. \n \n http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mhitlerchristian.html\n \n\n \n He was the ultimate politician. Tell your present audience anything that you can to gain support and then do whatever-the-hell you want to after you're in power. :xcensored",

In fact, if I recall correctly, there was one Emperor who had vowed repeatedly to lead a crusade, and when he ended up not doing so, he was excommunicated.
