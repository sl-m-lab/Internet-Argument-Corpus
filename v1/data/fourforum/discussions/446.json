   "Aryans who advocate the preservation of their race are demonised by media, academia and government as \"haters\", \"bigots\", \"extremists\", \"racists\".\n\n \n I think the Aryan groups have done a better job of painting themselves in that corner.\n \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n You are right that many Western cultures have a birthrate that is surpassed by their death rate. The growth model applied to those demographics does not show an overwhelming growth trend as it does in 3rd world countries. This is a product of 3rd world cultures, as often times it is seen as a commodity to have a workforce of children to work the land. In places like India and Africa and many Arab nations many children equate to an economic advantage. At the same time, westerners are taught that abortions are righteous, and that a family's income must exceed $65,000 dollars, in order to \"properly\" raise a child. As a result, places like Germany, France, England, and the United States are finding it necessary to import labor to account for the declining growth rate of their populations.\n \n I would also agree that theoretically the more homogenous a nation is the greater its chances for success, as it will have less violence and societal cleavages. However, in this world of technological improvements, it is also an advantage to acquire different cultural perspectives by importing the best and brightest from around the world. The nation that can offer the kind of intellectual freedom that fosters innovation and freethinking will most likely come out on top. Of course, America has been very good about integrating alien people into its society in the past. Unfortunately, the liberal has distorted this part of our history, much like they do with every historical trend, into a perverted lie. They claim that everyone has a right to the wealth of our nation, and it should be handed out free of charge, without gaining anything in return. They ignore historical movements to conduct immigration in a wise fashion, by pulling at people's heartstrings and appealing to affect. I would not have agreed with \"give us your poor, your tired, your huddled masses\" then, and I don't agree with it now. Instead it should read, \"give us your best, your brightest, your most worthy individuals\". The liberals ignore the epidemiological problems that an unchecked influx of immigration can cause, and they could be responsible for the next epidemic in our borders. The liberals forget that we have had exclusionary acts to prevent an enemy's access to our country, and they have allowed an influx of people who are sympathetic to ideologies that run contrary to the principles that built this great nation of ours. They forget that we have had socialization processes within our schools and communities to assimilate those who venture to our land. Instead they defend their right to speak foreign languages and retain their allegiance to their former states, which is a huge national security blunder. They have done everything in their power to turn yet another one of the great aspects of our country against itself. Those who wish to destroy our nation, may well be using immigration to cause a demographics shift that has not been seen anywhere outside of war. \n \n Obviously, immigration and multiculturalism presents a danger if not done correctly, but you wish to turn this problem into a reason to balkanize our own country. The integrity of our borders depends on a rational immigration policy that combines the strength of varying backgrounds, with a common sense approach to maintaining the strength of the underlying culture that all Americans should understand. What I have seen, has been deliberate erosion of this culture, and part of the strategy has been to weaken it through unchecked immigration. You are right to be concerned about the survival of your culture, but to apply racism as a means to change it only hurts your argument. It plays into the hands of those who are seeking to divide and conquer America; so they can \"rescue\" it with a heavy handed government that expedites the erosion by countering the democracy, which has made certain problems persistent. They will have no choice but to combat the predator-prey system they have created, by undermining our courts and allowing unsavory characters into the nation, through a police state. However, the racially motivated crimes and separatist movements that accompany unchecked immigration will also require the kind of heavy-handed government sought by those who are orchestrating the decay.\n \n Even though this problem has been created by liberals, the conservatives are not immune to the political pressure such a large demographic can have. Neither side of the aisle is willing to touch this problem, because of the possible political fallout their party may suffer from, as a result of enforcing current laws. Really this is a beautiful maneuver, from a strategic standpoint, although the conspirators are not considering the possible blowback they could incur. How long do they think they will be able to maintain power if they allow their political power to be reduced by people who do not understand they are being used as a political weapon? Don't they see that a constituency that aims to vote out democracy can eliminate their power? Perhaps they think the chaos that will ensue will happen before the other scenario is likely to occur, and they can effectively ensure their stranglehold over the system, in an emergency situation. Whatever the case, racism is not the answer, sound immigration policy is.",

   "Stormin Norman,\n I suppose that you want more elaborate response. This link was posted in another thread, but I think it's relevant to your concern. \n Let me quote from the plan of the Revolutionary Communist Party of America.\n \n \"Our Draft Programme boldly says that the world capitalist system of exploitation and oppression is totally obsolete and unnecessary...that a radically different world is possible...and that there is a path to overthrowing the U.S. ruling class.\"\n \n \"This Programme builds on the experiences of revolutionary struggles throughout the world. And most especially, it builds on the achievements and lessons of our class when it held state power--in the Soviet Union from 1917 to 1956 and in China from 1949 to 1976. Our Party has developed and applied this understanding to the specific conditions of making revolution in the U.S.\"\n \n \"The Draft Programme is firmly rooted in the final goal of the world revolution--communism. Our goal is the complete liberation of humanity, not to replace one group of exploiters with another. The liberating vision of communist society lets us dream and think 'outside the box' of capitalism and its dog-eat-dog economics, politics, values, and ideology.The communist future will be a time when there's no domination of one group of people over another. It'll be the end of human society being divided into classes, of men having power over women, of some people doing only manual labor and others doing only intellectual work, of white supremacy, and of one nation oppressing another.\"\n \n \"If you can't accept the fact that half the population of this planet struggles to survive on less than $2 a day; if you can't accept the fact that one out of three young Black men is either in jail, on probation or parole; if you can't accept the fact that every two minutes, there's a rape or attempted rape of a woman in the U.S.--you've got to check out this Programme.\"\n \n \"The capitalists are dinosaurs and they have shown themselves to be incapable of being caretakers of the earth. But there is a class in today's world that is fit to rule and which can organize society rationally. That class is the proletariat.\"\n http://rwor.org/a/v23/1100-99/1102/mayday_speech.htm\n \n As we contemplate the problems in our capitalist society such as gender and racial inequalities and the income gap between the rich and the poor who can say that capitalism has been a success? Who will not embrace the liberating vision of communism? The idea of communism is relatively new. It is not surprising that communism has failed in some circumstances given the numerous efforts of the US to thwart the success of communism. Communism has not been given a fair chance. Karl Marx predicted that the proletariat (the working class) in a society will grow tired of the oppression of capitalism. The working class will rise up and rebel and establish a new government established on the principles of communism. As Karl Marx said, \"Workers of the world unite!\"\n \n Go to these communist discussion forums. They'll help set you straight and correct your misconceptions about communism. \n \n \n www.che-lives.com/cgi/community/forums.pl?forum=22\n http://www.commiediscussion.cjb.net/\n \n -Voice of Reason",

   "Wow. We appear to have two seperate debates in this forum. I am impressed. \n \n voiceofreason- the idea and theory of communism is wonderful idea, and if it worked, I would be all for it. In fact, it does work, on small scales where everyone is a willing worker and no one is greedy. Unfortunately, greed (and laziness, in its own way) is what had kept the human race alive since we went out of Africa (or whatever evolutionary/creationary pirnciple you believe), and it has fueled many of the advances in society, and therefore is still an innate part of the human psyche. It won't be going away anytime soon. Communism depends on the absence of greed, therefore, in a large society, such as just about any country, and escpecially the United States, Communism will never work. However blood sucking and filthy Capitalism may be, it is the best working system so far. \n \n As for Aryana~ I agree with you on some parts. I am very much pro-total equality, and I don't like punishing hate crimes or having affimative action. But I don't really think that we need to prepare for a genocide of the aryan people. Skin color doesn't affect how you think. Wait, let me rephrase that before I get battered down. Acheivement and intelligence and progress is not confined to your skin color/religion/etc. Cultural views may affect your own, but it doesn't make you stupider. Therefore, no one will be missing anything if all aryans die out. Which still isn't very likely. The Jews have been a very small minority among the world population for thousands of years, and gone though pogroms, inquisition, and the holocaust, but we're still here. I really don't think you have that much to worried about. You're not being barred from voting or something, are you?",
