The attacks were being carried out mostly by either Sunni nationalists or muslim fundamentalists. Now, the Muslim fundamentalists are in control of the nation. It is like Bin Ladens wet dream come to reality. The secular government in Iraq, which he opposed for years, has been destroyed and replaced by a fundamentalist one. Syria and Iran are putting up a united front, and it seems almost certain that Iraq will soon be joining them. The days of the US running roughshod over the ME are almost over. The military option has effectively been taken off the table in regards to syria or Iran either one. We saw what just the invasion and occupation of Iraq, a country already crippled by years of sanctions and utilizing 20 yr old russian equipment and a conscript army, did to our military.

   "trees instead of the forest.\n \n 1. why should our troop remain in hiding in saudi arabia when they can be in the open in iraq?\n\n \n The loss of our bases in Saudi arabia was a crushing blow to Us involvement in the middle east, and quite possibly the real reason for war with Iraq. there are very few nations in the region ccapable of sustaining large Us bases. Israel, Kuwiat, UAE, etc.. lack the infrastructure. The only country \"friendly\" to the Us in the ME with the infrasturcture to supprot US troops was Saudi Arabia. Now they have expelled our guys. They announced they were going to do this before the war. \n \n \n2. the iran-syria alliance will never matter beyond the paper, worse than the franco-brit guarantee for Czechoslovakia. a nation hostile to both reside between. iran is in no position as even supplied by the US they could not take on saddam.\n besides, they have their hands full from the \n \n \n Few problems with this rediculous ascertation. first, the Us armed Iraq against Iran, not the other way around. Second, a strategic aliance between Syria and Iran effectively givers Iran access to the modern weapons the russians are selling the syrians. It will also presumably give them access to syrias nucklear technologies, which the russains have continued to supply despite US objections (in fact, the very week that Bush got up and said that a nuclear equipped syria was \"unacceptable\", the russains sent the first shipment of reactor parts to syria).\n \n What \"hostile nation\" lies between them? Iraq? How is Iraq a \"hostile nation\" to Iran or syria either one? While it is true that Iran and Iraq fought a war int he past, so did the US and mexico. It doesn't matter. Iraniains were not fighting Iraqis, they were fighting saddam and his secular, western government. The tune has changed now. Ibrahim Jaafari is the prime minister of Iraq. He is the head of the Dawa party, which is funded by Iran. He favors Shariah law, and is one of the guys who, post invasion, took the position that the Us should leave immeditly and that Iraq should be put under control of the iranian government. \n \n \n3. and lets talk of Syria, from Debka \n \n \n While that is an interesting, and totally unsupported quote, it means nothing. The Baath party in syria is certainly making changes. They have spioken publicly about them. They are forming trade relations with the EU and are effectively starting the process if internationalization. \n \n \n4. iraqi new government. how are they anti-american and pro-iran. because they are religious? guilt by association and by proximity?\n for example\n\n \n No, because the vast majority of them are shia hardliners with links to sistani and the Dawa party, funded by tehran, and are strong supproters of a pro Iranian stance. Look at who has been elected so far. THe only guy we could really claim is on \"our side\" is Jalal Talabani. He has been elected to the post of president. Unfortunatly, the post of president in Iraq is purely symbolic. He has no power whatsoever.\n \n \ncan you provide the link to say they demand we pay for their entire reconstruction?\n\n \n Try any news article ont he subject for the last 2 years. Sheesh. Have you been living in a cave? International law requires that in a war of agression, the agressor pays all reconstruction costs. We were trying to dodge that bullet by using Iraqi oil money for reconstruction purposes. It ain't going to work. \n \n \nand why would we want permanent bases anywhere but here in the US? and get suck in like we were with germany and south korea? hell no! in fact the news today suggest we can start coming home in 2 years.\n\n \n Then why have we already spent over 3 billion building permanent bases in Iraq? We have maintained permanent bases in the middle east since the late 50's. They are seen as an essential part of \"stabilizing\" the region (read that, bending them to our will). \n \n \n5. what is looking up in the ME? well if you need immediate return on your investment i suggest cocaine. but if you want a foundation for future return, as have a reconstructed europe and asia, i'd say iraq, and the democratic changes in Saudi Arabia, Lebannon, and Egypt just to start.\n\n \n Except that the democratic changes in Egypt have been ongoing for years now, regardless of our actions in the region, the Sauds are thus far just giving lip service, and the lebenese government now consists of 30 pro syrian ministers, noit democratically elected.",

In the 1970s, Da'wa fought a bloody campaign against Saddam's regime, during which many were killed or forced to leave the country. \n \n \"He was very active in Iraq, he was jailed, and he fled Iraq in the 1980s,\" said Karadaghi. \"He went to Iran, then he left Iran and settled in London for the last maybe seven years.\" \n \n Many Iraq observers say it will be difficult to predict how Jaafari might act as prime minister. That is partly because he is a difficult figure to characterize politically or ideologically. \n \n During his years in exile, Jaafari strongly opposed Saddam, but never publicly supported an Iranian-style theocracy. \n \n \n Karadaghi said that many politicians in Iraq think Jaafari is not as modern as he seems and fear that he might try to push for a greater role for religion in the country. \n \n In the elections, the Islamist Da'wa Party ran as one of the main players on the broad Shi'ite List, the United Iraqi Alliance, with the backing of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.\n \n \n Regarding ongoing US military activities against the Saddam regime, Jaafari said in the same 1999 interview that he believed such attacks were designed \"to take out our nation's economic and civilian structure\". \"We do not and will not tolerate such rocket attacks on our country. This is terrorism pure and simple. It has brought on our patient people the worst kind of woes and torment and spread fear and panic.\" \n \n Widely viewed as a conciliator, Jaafari called in 1999 for disparate opposition parties to form a united position against the Saddam regime, while maintaining their distance from US attempts to court the opposition. It was his belief at the time that the involvement of any outside party in the opposition's activities would affect the opposition's ability to operate independently, and potentially discredit its reputation inside Iraq. Jaafari was also opposed to the sanctions regime, which he said contributed to the Iraqi people's suffering, rather than alleviating it.\n",

Because Hariri's influence far exceeded Lebanon's confines, and he embodied its links with much of the outside world, his killing accelerated the -- at least temporary -- convergence of the Syrian regime's multiple foes on a set of demands: complete withdrawal of Syria's military and intelligence (mukhabarat) from Lebanon; the truth on Hariri's assassination; and free Lebanese elections under international supervision.\n \n The Lebanese opposition, in the main, has sought to stress national unity, de-emphasise the underlying confessional dimension and avoid overly provocative positions that could alienate the powerful Hizbollah or the large Shiite community. Hizbollah has tried both to evince solidarity with Syria and urge a national dialogue, in effect acknowledging that Syria's time in Lebanon is over, that it has nothing to gain from civil conflict and that its priority is to preserve its position in the domestic arena. After some hesitation, Washington also displayed noteworthy restraint, intent on working closely with the French, focusing for now on the Lebanese arena and resisting the temptation to drag in broader (and evidently connected) regional and international dimensions, such as disarming Hizbollah, prosecuting the war against terrorism or changing the regime in Damascus.\n\n \n and published in the Daily Star , an french press article\n \nWith Washington heaping pressure on Syria and the UN demanding it pull its soldiers from Lebanon, the Syrian leadership has found itself on the defensive not only in Lebanon but also in the wider region.\n \n It's \"the end of the regional role of Syria,\" says Syrian political analyst and writer Michel Kilo, stressing that the withdrawal of the estimated 14,000 troops who were still in Lebanon last year would also have an impact on Syria's power structure, economy and society in general.\n \n Other analysts suggest that with the international spotlight emboldening the Syrian opposition, Damascus will need to revise its domestic policy quickly or risk the country being destabilized.\n\n \n again this does not confirm the Debka source, but it does support the idea of internal pressure on Assad.",

This was with a slow decline in Syria's military presence and the full removal of Israel troops in the Shia south.\n \n The assasination may end this calm and prosperity, the calming influence of Syria may eventually be missed.

Im not here to change your views, frankly i dont care what garbage you belive in, your so brainwashed nobody can change your views, except. \n \nis everything in iraq/ME aok? hell no, much work still need to be done to get to that point. are they better than a year ago? hell yes. only someone so consumed by their own bias would fail to acknowledge that.\n\n You really do live in cloud cuckhoo land, its interesting that only you have these views. Thats why the posters you mentioned earlier, daewoo, georged etc, have disproved your views completely.",

   "i agree, as you seem to as well that while not the only factor involved, western pressure was real and felt and did contribute to Syria's withrawal. the major factor i'll attribute to the lebanese themselves, and by this acknowledgement that it was the lebanese, we should also then acknowledge that it was the pro-lebanese faction and not the pro-syrian faction, suggesting numerical-political superiority to them\n\n I agree that the pro-Lebanon faction now has the numerical superiority. The Lebanese population can be roughly split into 60% Muslim and 40% Christian. Before Hariri's murder all the Muslims were pro-Syrian, which meant that the pro-Syrians had the numerical advantage. But after Hariri's murder the Sunni's (Hariri was a Sunni) have done a 180 so now the pro-Syrians are in the minority.\n Unfortunately numerical superiority only goes so far. The pro-Syrian minority still retains a lot of power which they won't let go very easily.\n \n But I believe that in the end all will work out fine for the Lebanese and the Syrians. It's in Syria's best interest to have a stable and prosperous Lebanon as a neighbour, especially considering that 20% of all of Syria's money is in Lebanese banks. It's just that the ruling elite has to get used to the idea that they no longer will have all the power and that they have to share it with others. \n People are usually afraid of change, so any change in Lebanons regime has to be slow and gradual for the sake of all the people.",
