This is only a partial listing-just enough to make the point.\n \"No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up.\"\n \"Who can open the doors of his face, with his terrible teeth all around?\"\n \"His rows of scales are his pride, shut up tightly as with a seal; one is so near another that no air can come between them; they are joined one to another, they stick together and cannot be parted.\"\n \"His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.

He regards iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood. The arrow cannot make him flee; slingstones become like stubble to him. Darts are regarded as straw; he laughs at the threat of javelins.\"\n \"On earth there is nothing like him, which is made without fear.\"\n Leviathan \"played\" in the \"great and wide sea\" (a paraphrase of Psalm 104 verses 25 and 26-get the exact sense by reading them yourself).\n Leviathan is a \"reptile [a] that is in the sea.\" (Isaiah 27:1)\n [a] Note: The word translated \"reptile\" here is the Hebrew word tanniyn. This shows that \"Leviathan\" was also a \"tanniyn\" (dragon).\n Job 41:18-21 \n 18\n By his exhaling a light does shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.\n 19\n Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.\n 20\n Out of his nostrils goes smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.\n 21\n His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.\n \n Isa 27:1 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that [is] in the sea.\n \n How do we rationally explain these creatures existence so recently in our human history if they were extinct for millions of years? And if they were the imaginings of bronze age sheep herders as your atheists/evolutionists would have you believe, then how did these ignorant people describe creatures we can now recognize from fossil evidence? And while your at it, ask yourself if it's reasonable that the bones of dead creatures have survived from 60 million years to some estimated to be more than 200 million years without becoming dust? \n \n Does that make rational sense to you? Just look at the egyptian embalming methods for preserving the Pharaohs. They are still a marvel to modern scientists yet they are nothing more than frail shells no more solid than the texture of a bees nest after a short 3000 to 4000 years in a dry and sealed sarcophagus.

Would those animals stand firm and not flee from men who stood up to them with spears, javelins and arrows?

   "At what point does the belief in the creation of the earth in 7 days stop? Why not go all the way? The earth is flat! The bible says so. \n \n Daniel 4: 10-11\n \n 4:10 Thus [were] the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof [was] great.\n \n 4:11 The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth: \n \n How can we see the end of the earth when those atheistic, evil scientists are telling us the earth is a sphere?\n \n I believe I have made my point. There is a full continuum set of beliefs.\n 1. Flat Earthers: Extreme literal interpretation of the bible as viewed in the example above.2. Geocentrism: The earth is the center of the universe/solar system. 3. Young Earth Creationism: The earth is less than 10,000 year old and the universe was literally created in 7 days. 4. Gap Creationism: The earth is old, because of a time gap between Gen 1:1 and Gen 1 1:2. However, God recreated the world in 6 literal days.5. Day-Age Creationism: The world was created in 6 days, but the days are thousands or millions of years long. The literal interpretation is disappearing.6. Progressive Creationism: Accept the science of the big bang and the age of the earth, but not science of biology. The line stops here. There are more of those atheistic, evil scientists in biology.7. Evolutionary Creationism: There is no problem with science, except in certain parts of evolution. God has to give little nudges here and there.8. Intelligent Design Creationism: A recent and growing meme involving irreducible complexity and intelligent designer. Randomness cannot account for evolution.9. Theistic Evolutionist:: God created the laws of the universe and set things in motion. God makes tweaks at critical moments in the history of life.10. Agnostic Evolutionist: There probably is not a god, but we cannot know for sure. Evolution occurs as tested by the scientific method. If there is a god, he is not part of the equation.11. Natural Material Evolutionist: All phenomena can be explained by natural means.12. Philosophical Material Evolutionist:: All phenomena can be explained by natural means and supernatural explanations do not exists. These are the hard core atheists.\n It is easy to see why religious people who interpret the bible as literal get upset with new discoveries of science. It chips aways at the literal interpretation of the bible. If I were in their shoes, I may act the same way. Science is not a religion. It is simply a method of gaining knowledge about the world. Science has proven to us that the world was not created in 7 literal days. I am sorry if that steps on some people's beliefs. However, the science is sound. Is truth not the same for all? Science and religion are two different aspects of the human experience and there is much that can be learned from each.",

In fact, the more we come to understand the awesome power of God through science the deeper our relationship becomes.\n Adam and Eve were metaphorical images.

I studied the Story of Adam and Eve in the garden and looked at exactly what it said, just using interpretations that were allowed in the Bible, where possible. I found that the Story exactly describes the moment is time when plants and animals were first domesticated. Every word seemed to have a scientifically true interpretation without needing to read the passage figuratively. See: sites.google.com/site/gardenineden/\n Then I looked at the connection to the seven days of Genesis 1.

   "Penfield asked about the length of the day. We know that the earth is slowing down so that 10,000 years ago the day was shorter by a little, 23 hrs and 50 Min maybe? But that doesn't matter. The use of the term day in the Bible can mean a much longer period. It can mean 6 days, generations, 1,000 years, or 6,000 years, or much longer. These are time spans the Bible used, not what I want it to say. Therefore, there is nothing Biblically wrong to say one of the six days of creation lasted 1 billion years.\n As for the lifespan of Methuselah, again are we forcing our modern interpretation on the passage? When it was first told, what did the people mean by father. In Jesus' time, the Jews said Abraham is our father. They did not mean it literally, but that they all traced their ancestry to him. Seven \"generations\" from Adam was three brothers Jubal, Jabal, and Tubal Cain. One was the father of musicians. Another was the father of Cowboys. We use the term similarly when we say that Hippocrates was the father of medicine. Methuselah could have been the father of a tribe or city, and 900 years later a child was born to one of his descendants that founded a new group. Look at Noah's sons and at Esau's sons. The only ones mentioned were the ones that started a group of people. The ancient people often only mentioned the important people in a genealogy.",

Evolution erases that relationship which erases the need for the need for being reunited with God through the shed blood of Christ on the Cross.\n \n Also, you must redefine what evolution teaches altogether in order to credit God with original creation and then assume evolution is His plan for humanity.

What is interesting is that you rarely have anything substantial against those criticisms. After all, you said that bees cannot fly, tv show props are good evidence of creationism, and that oil is not a hydrocarbon. \n \n Your opinion does not count for much given its consistent history of massive and epic levels of incorrectness. \n \n Interesting how you think that because we arouse through natural processes we don't have any more value than anything else that arouse through natural processes.

   "Of course, the simplest explanation is that the Bible is the mythology of bronze age nomads who were trying to explain the nature around them with insufficient knowledge. It is clear the they incorporated the mythology of other cultures around them. You don't actually understand that Eden is mythological?\n\n \n There are three possibilities when it comes to the \"Mythological\" content. Sumerian and other myths came first, and the Bible copied/adjusted them (very popular with some), the Bible event (or myth if you will) came first and the other societies corrupted them into myths, and finally, the Bible event happened to teach against that other worship. Moses seems to be a real event and yet it attacks the Egyptian Gods. The Garden could have been a real event and directly rejects the worship practiced in the Middle east at least from the time of the Garden even until 300 AD. (see Frazier's The Golden Bough)\n I see it as a true event that rejects the mythology/religion of the area.",

   "The First Fossil Hunters\n By Adrienne Mayor\n Throughout her book Mayor continually proves the two basic points that she originally set out in the introduction: that many Greek and Roman myths had a basis in fact, and that these facts were often fossils. However, she goes beyond this basis thesis, and proves that Greeks and Romans FREQUENTLY encountered the fossilized remains of mammals and dinosaurs, and that they developed very sophisticated concepts and myths to explain this bewildering and often confusing fossil evidence. Like their modern counterparts, Mayor writes, the ancient fossil hunters collected and measured impressive petrified remains and even displayed them in temples and museums. They attempted to reconstruct the appearance of these creatures through art and sculpture, and went even further in attempting to explain their creation and extinction.\n Remember hearing of the one-eyed Cyclops monster? Mayor's theoretical hard evidence is the multitude of mammoth, mastodon, and other elephant skulls found around the Mediterranean. A skull without tusks is especially convincing since elephant skulls have a huge single round opening directly in the middle of the front of the skull.\n \n Isolated bones were excellent evidence for the ancients that giant humans had previously existed. Amongst these were their heros that had slain the giant monsters and made the world safe for their civilization. Mayor shows photographs and illustrations of leg bones and shoulder blades from mammoths next to the human equivalents. For the ancients, and those of us who are not anatomists, the bones were identical to human bones save for size and some \"insignificant\" differences. They were able to discount the differences by allowing that giants would undoubtedly have some amount of changes due to their size. These bone finds were big events. Each find was attributed to a specific hero or monster. The local town would enshrine these bones in their temples as \"religious\" objects. Part of the riches taken from a town after conquest were these fossilized bones of the heros.\n \n One of the interesting chapters in The First Fossil Hunters deals with the artistic and archaeological evidence that supports Mayor's contentions. Until very recently, fossil bones found during archaeological digs were largely ignored or thrown away all together. Partly through the work of the author, this trend is changing. By researching the records of excavations and by talking to active archaeologists, Mayor was able to find out that fossil bone finds in archaeological settings were common. Mayor has provided the explanation for their presence. Here again is another instance wherein two widely varying disciplines (historians, paleontologists and archaeologists) can benefit by working together. \n Sorry, is that better? \n Greeks worshipped the creatures. God said, they are just creatures, don't worship them.",

Could they be used to prove the rest of the story? If I couldn't find Hercules bones, I would want to find the bones of the monster he killed to prove the rest of the story. With that in mind, for the Bible to claim these bones were not the semi-divine creatures that the Greeks claimed, but just ordinary created creatures would fit the Bible. See Rom 1:23 for a mention of worshipping images of creatures. Egyptians and many other groups clearly worshipped bulls. Greeks could have worshipped the creature also. Again, this is speculation.",
