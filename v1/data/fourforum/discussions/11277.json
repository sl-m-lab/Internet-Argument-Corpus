   "I've sat on this for a couple days, but now that I think I have sufficiently understood not only the ruling, but the surrounding context which led to the ruling, I thought I would throw this out for discussion.\n \n In short, Stephen Boissoin of Canada (who happens to be a pastor) wrote an op-ed piece in 2002 to a local Canadian news paper expressing his views on the advance of the \"homosexual agenda\" in Canada. Evidently this kind of thing is not permissible (or, in the very least, is very risky), as a Canadian Human Rights tribunal has held him in violation of Canada's Human Rights Citizenship and Multiculturalism Act.\n \n For this violation, the tribunal mandated the following punishment:\n [*]That Mr. Boissoin and The Concerned Christian Coalition Inc. shall cease publishing in newspapers, by email, on the radio, in public speeches, or on the internet, in future, disparaging remarks about gays and homosexuals. Further, they shall not and are prohibited from making disparaging remarks in the future about Dr. Lund or Dr. Lund&#8217;s witnesses relating to their involvement in this complaint. Further, all disparaging remarks versus homosexuals are directed to be removed from current web sites and publications of Mr. Boissoin and The Concerned Christian Coalition Inc.\n [*]That The Concerned Christian Coalition Inc. and Mr. Boissoin shall, in future, be restrained from committing the same or similar contraventions of the Act.\n [*]That Mr. Boissoin and The Concerned Christian Coalition Inc. provide Dr. Lund with a written apology for the article in the Red Deer Advocate which was the subject of this complaint.\n [*]That Mr. Boissoin and The Concerned Christian Coalition Inc. shall request the Red Deer Advocate publish a copy this Order in the Red Deer Advocate and that they request their written apology for the contravention of the Act be published in the Red Deer Advocate.\n [*]That Mr. Boissoin and The Concerned Christian Coalition Inc. shall pay to Dr. Lund an award for damages, jointly and severally, in the amount of $5,000.00.\n [*]That Ms. Dodd shall provide a list of expenses incurred as a result of her testimony at the hearing to the Panel Chair for review and such sum shall be paid to her for her actual expenses associated with this matter up to the maximum amount of $2,000.00 as directed by the Panel Chair upon receiving her list of expenses. Such amounts so ordered by the Panel Chair shall be paid jointly and severally by Mr. Boissoin and The Concerned Christian Coalition Inc.I've read fairly deeply into this (including the initial decision finding guilt), and I do not mind saying that I find this to be utterly ridiculous, and frankly, quite troubling.\n \n http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eugene-volokh/stop-all-disparaging-rema_b_106360.html (not usually a reputable source, but Eugene Volokh is well respected).\n \n Update: Mr. Boissoin's letter: http://youmaynotsaythat.blogspot.com/",

Unless Canada has problems with local newspapers disseminating and spreading hate speech, I think we can assume that the editorial in question was simply someone expressing an opinion.\n \n But, for those interested, here's the letter in question: http://youmaynotsaythat.blogspot.com/. I've read it, and find it hard to construe it as hate speech. In fact, I think it is quite clear that it is not. Incidentally, I do think it is funny that the tribunal tried to have Mr. Boissoin remove his letter from the web, only to find out that it can be re-published by anyone (especially in the US), where such ridiculous anti-speech laws have yet to take root. In fact, the tribunal's vigourous attempt to suppress Mr. Boissoin's speech might very well have increased his audience. And I heartily confess that I find that a happy irony.\n \n And, for what it is worth, even if it really was hate speech, part of the remedy offered by the tribunal was that \"Mr. Boissoin and The Concerned Christian Coalition Inc. shall cease publishing in newspapers, by email, on the radio, in public speeches, or on the internet, in future, disparaging remarks about gays and homosexuals.\" Not even by email? Come on; that is flat-out ridiculous. Since disparaging is subjective (only the tribunal knows it), this injunction effectively attempts to bar Mr. Boissoin from saying anything negative about homosexuals, homosexuality, or what he perceives to be a \"homosexual agenda.\"\n \n To that end, I think Archangel is right: calling the ruling \"troubling\" probably is an understatement.",

Neither of us is Canadian, so it doesn't affect us.\n \n Look, there is a conflict between two rights here. First is the reasonable right of people to live peacefully without being subject to verbal or physical abuse and harassment. Second is the right to freely express one's opinion, even if others find it obnoxious or threatening. Reasonable people can differ where to draw the line, and no doubt Canadian courts will eventually resolve whether the law is being applied justly in this case or not.\n \n While I yield to no-one in support of free speech, there have traditionally been limits on it, especially on aggressively hostile speech which can provoke violence or harm. Examples include shouting \"Bomb!\" in a US airport.\n \n So perhaps we should look and see the words in the original article that prompted the case, and see if they are merely a polite expression of opinion, or a call to aggressive action.

   "Aha, the New York Times has a story today on precisely this issue: the difference between the United States, which has mostly protected speech, including \"hate speech,\" and other nations, including Canada, that restrict hate speech. Here is a link to the story and the headline from it. \n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/12/us/12hate.html?hp\n \n \"Unlike Others, U.S. Defends Freedom to Offend in Speech\"\n \n Here in blue is a comment that I wrote to the NYTimes in response to the above article: \n \n June 12th, 2008 7:15 am \n \n The United States has not always protected free speech. During WWI, the Espionage Act and Sedition Act were used to jail critics of the draft and the war. The people jailed were often socialists, anarchists, and immigrants, who were widely feared and disparaged. Eugene Debs, the head of the Socialist Party, was jailed for making a speech criticizing the government for jailing people who callled on men to resist the draft. He ran for President from the Atlanta Penitentiary and got around 900,000 votes. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the Schenck case that the constitution did not protect free speech if the speech presented a \"clear and present danger.\" And handing out anti-draft leaflets during a war, in the view of the Supreme Court, did present such a danger.\n \n The story of the jailing of anti-war activists during WWI shows, I think, the \"clear and present danger\" of watering down or turning away from the free speech protections in the first amendment. As a gay person, I belong to a minority group that is frequently the target of hate speech. But I would rather answer that speech with speech than try to suppress it through the law. Speech must be free if people are to be free. I think Eugene Debs would agree with me. ",

Examples include shouting \"Bomb!\" in a US airport.\n\n \n The long answer:\n Free speech is a corollary of private property. Meaning: you can say what you want, on your own property. If you own an airport and don't want people yelling about bombs in it, it is your right as the owner of the airport to prohibit that, just as owners of bars restrict urination to the bathrooms.\n \n Somehow I suspect that an airport where yelling about non-existant bombs is allowed will be unsuccessful and quickly fold - then again some clever entrepeneur might prove me wrong by running one to attract a niche demographic that enjoys that sort of environment.\n \n Certainly the US also has placed legal restrictions on speech.

   "The question is, will someone be arrested in Canada if they write or publish a critical article about any aspect of the hetero community?\n\n You're damn right that's the question; I already asked it. And you haven't shown that the answer is no. You're throwing out the accusation of double standards with no evidence.\n \n \nThe criticism and concern that I expressed, as did Phyllis is with the Canadian Government and the law that forbids free and unencumbered critical public discourse against anyone for simply criticizing a particular group and labeling that OPINION as HATE SPEECH.\n\n A statement's being an opinion is not a disqualification as hate speech. I could have the opinion that you should be bound and gagged, tarred and feathered, and dragged out into the street and shot with plenty of witnesses because of your experience with Islam, and there's no law against having that opinion. However, if I tell people that they should do this, there is a law against my action of telling, not against my opinion.\n \n \n Let us not also forget that the U.S. has laws against slander and libel. The vast majority of homosexuals are not pedophiles. They do not \"recruit\" children into homosexuality. Professionals have concluded that nobody is being \"psychologically abused and brainwashed by homosexual and pro-homosexual educators\" or \"being subjected to psychologically and physiologically damaging\" material. The author cannot show that \"[homosexuals] are perverse, self-centred and morally deprived individuals\" or that they \"are spreading their psychological disease,\" especially when it is not a disease.\n \n Your bigoted author really shoots himself in the foot when he lambastes homosexuals for striving \"to gain complete equality in our nation.\" In other words, he is blatantly saying that homosexuals are not equals and should be treated as a class of subhumans. If I said that Christians are substandard and should have their rights restricted, that would qualify as hate speech, too.

Did the list call for the murder of abortion providers? Those who sought to shut the website down argued yes, while the lawyers for the website argued that there was no direct or clear call for anyone to commit murder. I don't recall exactly what the outcome was, but the website was shut down, though exactly how that came about I don't remember. \n \n When I get time I'll try to track this information down.

Let's put his speech right on the table and see that all this Pastor did was tell the cold hard truth about the negative impact the gay lobby is having in Canada.The Letter that got Mr. Stephen Boissoin in Big Trouble\n Homosexual agenda wicked\n \n Rev. Steven Boissoin\n Central Alberta Chairman Concerned Christian Coalition\n 6/17/02\n \n The following is not intended for those who are suffering from an unwanted sexual identity crisis. For you, I have understanding, care, compassion and tolerance. I sympathize with you and offer you my love and fellowship.\n \n I prayerfully beseech you to seek help, and I assure you that your present enslavement to homosexuality can be remedied. Many outspoken, former homosexuals are free today.\n \n Instead, this is aimed precisely at every individual that in any way supports the homosexual machine that has been mercilessly gaining ground in our society since the 1960s. I cannot pity you any longer and remain inactive. You have caused far too much damage.\n \n My banner has now been raised and war has been declared so as to defend the precious sanctity of our innocent children and youth, that you so eagerly toil, day and night, to consume. With me stand the greatest weapons that you have encountered to date: God and the \"Moral Majority.\" Know this, we will defeat you, then heal the damage you have caused.\n \n Modern society has become dispassionate to the cause of righteousness. Many people are so apathetic and desensitized today that they cannot even accurately define the term \"morality.\"\n \n The masses have dug in and continue to excuse their failure to stand against horrendous atrocities such as the aggressive propagation of homo- and bisexuality. Inexcusable justifications such as, \"I'm just not sure where the truth lies,\" or \"If they don't affect me then I don't care what they do,\" abound from the lips of the quantifiable majority.\n \n Face the facts, it is affecting you. Like it or not, every professing heterosexual is having their future aggressively chopped at the roots. Edmund Burke's observation that, \"All that is required for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing,\" has been confirmed time and time again. From kindergarten class on, our children, your grandchildren are being strategically targeted, psychologically abused and brainwashed by homosexual and pro-homosexual educators.\n \n Our children are being victimized by repugnant and premeditated strategies, aimed at desensitizing and eventually recruiting our young into their camps. Think about it, children as young as five and six years of age are being subjected to psychologically and physiologically damaging pro-homosexual literature and guidance in the public school system; all under the fraudulent guise of equal rights.\n \n Your children are being warped into believing that same-sex families are acceptable; that men kissing men is appropriate.\n \n Your teenagers are being instructed on how to perform so-called safe same gender oral and anal sex and at the same time being told that it is normal, natural and even productive. Will your child be the next victim that tests homosexuality positive?\n \n Come on people, wake up! It's time to stand together and take whatever steps are necessary to reverse the wickedness that our lethargy has authorized to spawn. Where homosexuality flourishes, all manner of wickedness abounds.\n \n Regardless of what you hear, the militant homosexual agenda isn't rooted in protecting homosexuals from \"gay bashing.\" The agenda is clearly about homosexual activists that include, teachers, politicians, lawyers, Supreme Court judges, and God forbid, even so-called ministers, who are all determined to gain complete equality in our nation and even worse, our world.\n \n Don't allow yourself to be deceived any longer. These activists are not morally upright citizens, concerned about the best interests of our society. They are perverse, self-centred and morally deprived individuals who are spreading their psychological disease into every area of our lives. Homosexual rights activists and those that defend them, are just as immoral as the pedophiles, drug dealers and pimps that plague our communities.\n \n The homosexual agenda is not gaining ground because it is morally backed. It is gaining ground simply because you, Mr. and Mrs. Heterosexual, do nothing to stop it. It is only a matter of time before some of these same morally bankrupt individuals such as those involved with NAMBLA, the North American Man/Boy Lovers Association, will achieve their goal to have sexual relations with children and assert that it is a matter of free choice and claim that we are intolerant bigots not to accept it.\n \n If you are reading this and think that this is alarmist, then I simply ask you this: how bad do things have to become before you will get involved? It's time to start taking back what the enemy has taken from you. The safety and future of our children is at stake.\n \n Rev. Stephen Boissoin\n Central Alberta Chairman\n Concerned Christian Coalition\n Red Deer\n Now since when, and how much trouble are we in as a civilization when telling the truth is a chargeable offense \n http://youmaynotsaythat.blogspot.com/",

Never let the facts get in the way of your bigotry, right Archie?\n \n \nThe existence of the legislation that created the laws that now restrict free speech in Canada most assuredly are a result of the power and persistence of the gay lobby up there.\n\n \n The section of the criminal code which makes it illegal to incite hatred is part of the Canadian charter of rights and freedoms, which came into force in April of 1982. Homosexuals had no protection under this until April of 2004. Ooo, those sneaky homos! They made sure everyone else had protection first before they got it for themselves! That way, no one suspects it part of the \"gay agenda\"!\n \n \nAnd the very complaints the Pastor expressed in his letter point to that fact.\n\n What?

Homosexual rights activists and those that defend them, are just as immoral as the pedophiles, drug dealers and pimps that plague our communities.\"\n He then goes on to compare homosexuality to a disease, saying \"Will your child be the next victim that tests homosexuality positive?\"\n Don't even try and say this is not inciting hatred against homosexuals.\n \n \nIsn't it the practice of tyrants to silence their opposition by making their dissenting opinions illegal?\n\n I'm all for making sure nutters like this guy (and you) aren't allowed to publicly advertise their hatred of another person just because they're different.\n \n \nYou still don't get it do you? That Pastor didn't write, nor publish hate speech against anyone.\n\n That's absolutely ridiculous, as any reader can see.\n \nHe gave his opinion in an open letter is all,\n\n And in Canada it is illegal to publicly incite hatred against a group of people. see here:\n \nSection 319 \n \n (1) Every one who, by communicating statements in any public place, incites hatred against any identifiable group where such incitement is likely to lead to a breach of the peace is guilty of \n \n (a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or \n \n (b) an offence punishable on summary conviction. \n \n Wilful promotion of hatred\n (2) Every one who, by communicating statements, other than in private conversation, wilfully promotes hatred against any identifiable group is guilty of \n \n (a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or \n \n (b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.\n\n \n \nand neither did he call for violence or abuse of any kind against the gay community.\n\n He said he declares war on homosexuals, says \"we will defeat you\", calls them no better than pedophiles, drug dealers and pimps, calls homosexuality a disease, says that children are being psychologically abused and brainwashed by homosexuals, etc, etc. And this isn't hate speech? Only to those who agree with it.\n \n \nNow since when, and how much trouble are we in as a civilization when telling the truth is a chargeable offense\n\n I rest my case.

It wouldn't be wilfully promoting hatred. Obviously not, if we are just directing hateful terms at Christians.",

Only to those who agree with it.\n\n Only a XXXXX could believe that his \"declaration of war\" is a literal call to arms. Ever heard of the term \"culture war?\" That's a very popular term in the US, and no who says it means there is a literal war with weapons, violence, etc.\n \n So what: he calls them no better than pedophiles, drug dealers, and pimps. Unless you are suggesting that painting these three clear minority groups negatively is also hate speech, I don't see your point. He certainly never suggested that folks should go out and perpetrate violent acts toward pedophiles, drug dealers, or pimps. So why would we assume that is what he meant when referring to certain homosexual activists. Mind you, he clearly didn't reference all homosexuals; only certain ones he deems activist. That may not be a distinction which you approve of, but he's certainly entitled to make it.\n \n Homosexuality has been called a disease before. Calling it such in this letter is not inciting hate, nor is it inciting violence. Maybe it's wrong, but it is not inciting hate or violence as such. It might make someone uncomfortable or feel bad, but discomfort and hurt feelings are not sufficient reasons to suppress someone's speech. It is not a sufficient reason to fine them. It is not a sufficient reason to force them to \"cease publishing in newspapers, by email, on the radio, in public speeches, or on the internet, in future, disparaging [what the heck does that mean?

Is he allowed to say that \"the Bible, which is the final authority on moral matters, declares that homosexual behavior is a sin?\" I submit that he is not under this ridiculous ruling.\n \n In short, no; it is not hate speech. Only a XXXXX would read that editorial and think that the author is calling them to take up guns and wipe out homosexuals. And if we are going to suppress speech on the basis of how some loony XXXXX might interpret someone's words, then free speech no longer exists.\n \n \nI rest my case. Only to a hate filled bigot would this be \"truth\".\n\n I hope you understand that for many of us here, the issue is not at all whether what he said was true; rather, it is simply whether he should be allowed to hold and publish his opinion. The issue for many of us is whether this man, who is a pastor, should be permitted to stand before his congregation and say (if he so believes) that, \"the Bible condemns homosexual behavior as a sin.\" I say he sure as heck should be allowed.",

   "Thanks for responding to TQ Phyllis, You saved me from wasting my time trying to reason with him. And I totally agree with you the issue isn't whether what he said is true at all, but his right to say it even if it was offensive. WHICH IT WASN'T, IT JUST HAPPENED TO BE FACTUAL IMO. Also, not being Canadian, we are at a disadvantage regarding their laws and all. But after doing a search I found some sites by canadians that show what they are dealing with regarding the content of the Pastors complaints in that letter. This may not belong on this thread based on your subject matter, but it does answer TQ in showing that to many people IN CANADA, also equal citizens; They are very concerned with the moral implications of what a specially protected class can accomplish when all vocal or written dissent is interpreted as HATE SPEECH.\n When I first launched theinquiry.ca I posted \"About this Site\" - there I made reference to my belief that most of the sexual predators involved in the Cornwall sex abuse scandal are homosexual paedophiles or pederasts. Nearly two years ago I blogged \"Pederasts are tuned in to Cornwall.\" Months before I blogged \"Paedophilia is a sexual orientation?\"\n \n And here we go again...\n \n First, the definition of pederast. The following from the Free Dictionary online\n \n (1) pederast or paederast\n Noun\n a man who has homosexual relations with boys [Greek pais boy + erast&#275;s lover]\n \n (2) ped\u0095er\u0095ast (p d -r st )\n n.\n A man who has sexual relations, especially anal intercourse, with a boy.\n \n (3) Thesaurus\n Noun1.pederast - a man who has sex (usually sodomy) with a boy as the passive partner\n \n child molester, paederast\n degenerate, deviant, deviate, pervert - a person whose behavior deviates from what is acceptable especially in sexual behaviour\n \n Now on....\n \n Under cross examination today by Dallas Lee Det. Sgt. Jeff Carroll became quite passionate when asked if he believed Hickerson was a paedophile. Carroll said Hickerson was not a paedophile, he was a pederast. Asked if he considered Hickerson to be a sex offender Carroll responded that he considered Hickerson had a \"particular sexual preference\" and \"sexual orientation\"!!!\n \n I will agree totally that Hickerson was a pederast. I believe in fact that most of the sexual predators at the core of the Cornwall sex abuse scandal are real or \"alleged\" pederasts. Indeed I made a comment in that vein when I first launched the website, explaining that I would use the word paedophile because that's the word traditionally used and understood by the masses.\n \n However, I am appalled to hear Carroll go a step well beyond and describe pederasty as a sexual orientation.\n \n A sexual orientation?\n \n Really?\n \n Sexually molesting young lads is simply a sexual orientation? Like homosexuality, bisexuality and heterosexuality and transgendered and transsexuality?!!!!\n \n Do people understand what this means? In Canada people receiving special protections and privileges based on their \"sexual orientation.\" People can not be discriminated against based on their \"sexual orientation.\" People can be charged for inciting hatred against anyone based on their \"sexual orientation.\" \n \n What it means is that men who molest young boys presumably have a sexual orientation to molest. That means have no control over it. Can't do anything about it. Perhaps they were even born that way. They have no choice but to molest\n \n What it means is we should be saying 'those poor misunderstood maligned pederasts. We should give them a break.' And we should give them our children.\n \n This is serious stuff. Scary stuff.\n \n Dr. Wolfe, an \"expert\"witness who helped Justice Glaude \"frame\" his inquiry, described paedophilia as a \"sexual orientation.\"\n \n Det. Sgt. Carroll describes pederasty as a \"sexual orientation.\"\n \n Where does that leave the children of the nation? Prey?\n \n Pederasts, paedophiles - makes no difference does it? Not to the child. Children are being sexually molested. That's wrong. It's wrong morally. It's wrong legally. It's sinful. It's criminal. It's wicked. It's just plain evil.\n \n Why the quibbling. Why the wordsmithing? Why introduce this novel notion that it's a sexual orientation?\n \n And why jump up and down and scream and shout if the word paedophile is used to describe a man who may be a pederast? Perhaps the paedophile is a pederast? Perhaps the pederast is a paedophile? It all comes down to definitions, and whose definitions we pick. There are countless. The only thing assured by the title pederast is that a pederast is a man who homosexually abuses a boy. Advocates of man-boy sex call it \"love.\"\n \n That's now a \"sexual orientation\"? A member of the Cornwall Police Service says that's a sexual orientation?!\n \n Do we say a serial murderer has an orientation to murder? Or a thief has an orientation to steal?\n \n No. We don't. But look what's happening when it comes to men who sexually abuse children. It's a sexual orientation. And if the abuse happened a few months ago it's somehow downgraded to \"historic\" abuse and the predator is somehow no longer a risk to children.\n \n A \"sexual orientation\"!\n \n I remind people once again that this is how the gay rights lobby advanced it's agenda. \"Sexual orientation.\" Those who fought that legislation begged to have the words \"sexual orientation\" replaced by \"homosexuality.\" Their argument was that if the intent was solely to give special protection and rights to homosexuals then at least let that be reflected in the choice of words - there were deep fears that with the use of the words \"sexual orientation\" the legislation as it stands will provide special rights, protections and privileges for those who molest children.\n \n The concerns fell on deaf ears. There were assurances that the sole intent was to provide protection for homosexuals, and more assurances that the sexual abuse of children would never be referred to as a \"sexual orientation.\"\n \n Here we are.\n \n It's happening.\n \n Wake up people!\n \n Look what's happened to the laws of our land. See where we're going:\n \n In 1995 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in Egan v. Canada that the term \"sexual orientation\" was to be \"read in\" to Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This is the section that deals with equality rights.\n \n Section 15 reads as follows. (Add the words \"sexual orientation\" to the list. They have been \"read in.\" )\n \n 15. (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\n \n (2) Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\n \n In 1996 Bill C-33 passed Parliament. The term \"sexual orientation\" was added to the Federal Human Rights Act. The act now reads:\n \n 2. The purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.\n R.S., 1985, c. H-6, s. 2; 1996, c. 14, s. 1; 1998, c. 9, s. 9.\n \n In 2004 sexual orientation was added to the hate crimes list, making it a hate crime to do or say anything which would be construed as inciting hatred against anyone based on their their sexual orientation. Section 319 of the Criminal Code of Canada now reads:\n \n Section 319\n \n Advocating genocide\n \n 318. (1) Every one who advocates or promotes genocide is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.\n \n Definition of \"genocide\"\n \n (2) In this section, \"genocide\" means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part any identifiable group, namely,\n \n (a) killing members of the group; or\n \n (b) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction.\n \n Consent\n \n (3) No proceeding for an offence under this section shall be instituted without the consent of the Attorney General.\n \n Definition of \"identifiable group\"\n \n (4) In this section, \"identifiable group\" means any section of the public distinguished by colour, race, religion, ethnic origin or sexual orientation.\n \n R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 318; 2004, c. 14, s. 1.\n \n Public incitement of hatred\n 319. (1) Every one who, by communicating statements in any public place, incites hatred against any identifiable group where such incitement is likely to lead to a breach of the peace is guilty of\n \n a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or\n \n b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.\n \n Wilful promotion of hatred\n \n (2) Every one who, by communicating statements, other than in private conversation, wilfully promotes hatred against any identifiable group is guilty of\n \n a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or\n \n b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.\n \n All I can say is if paedophilia and pederasty is, as Carroll and Wolfe and countless others say, how long before someone is in jail for presumably inciting hatred against paedophiles or pederasts? \n http://www.theinquiry.ca/wordpress/?m=20080522\n \n So this site is dealing with the slippery slope that Canada has slid down with gusto as she sacrifices her children at the alter of perceived political correct definitions of maladies that lead to the abuse of their young. And to add insult to injury, In 2004 sexual orientation was added to the hate crimes list, making it a hate crime to do or say anything which would be construed as inciting hatred against anyone based on their their sexual orientation. \n \n When I said to tq earlier that it was the practice of TYRANTS to silence the people by using laws to prevent them from speaking against the injustices committed against them, this is exactly what I was referring to.",

   "Really? Wow, I've never heard that term before...\n No kidding he wasn't saying to arm up and gun down gays. The fact remains his wording is meant to incite confilct.\n\n I feel I should clear something up here just in case my meaning did not come across as I intended it. I was not calling you a XXXXX; I was calling anyone who would respond to Mr. Boissoin's letter with violence, etc. would have to be a XXXXX.\n \n \nYou know perfectly well that stating that someone is no better than a pedophile/drug dealer/pimp is done to show that they are deviant and criminal, and are at a lower moral/social standing that \"normal\" society. He does this to dehumanize gays.\n\n Highly controversial? Yes. Likely to incite a reasonable person to hate or violence against a minority class? No.\n \n \nNo, he didn't. He just said that a group of people that he doesn't like are no better than child abusers and criminals.\n\n Highly controversial? Yes. Likely to incite a reasonable person to hate or violence against a minority class? No.\n \n \nThe tone is quite clear as to what his opinion of gays is. Did you read my previous post? The part where I reference the criminal code? This meets section 2.\n\n Here's the relevant law:\n \n3(1) No person shall publish, issue or display or cause to be published, issued or displayed before the public any statement, publication, notice, sign, symbol, emblem or other representation that[*](a) indicates discrimination or an intention to discriminate against a person or a class of persons, or[*] (b) is likely to expose a person or a class of persons to hatred or contempt because of the race, religious beliefs, colour, gender, physical disability, mental disability, age, ancestry, place of origin, marital status, source of income or family status of that person or class of persons.(2) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to interfere with the free expression of opinion on any subject.\n\n We'll go ahead and concede that Section two, the part that says that free expression is still OK, is in there probably just so they can say there are three subsections. It is clear that it has no meaning or effect in practice. It's there as visual eye candy; its there to look pretty.\n \n Sure, he's advocating particular action against a particular agenda, which he believes is being advocated and advanced by a certain class of individuals. So opining and trying to persuade one's fellow citizen's to oppose some public policy or law violates this statute? What if he were to write a similar letter stating his opposition to giving 5 year-olds the right of voting? That is intention to discriminate against a class or persons, and would likewise violate section a. Thus I conclude that the statute is as bogus as the ruling. Do you really think that every person should be silenced and fined if they have shown \"intention to discriminate\" against a certain class of persons (including advocating that 5 year-olds, as a class, not be able to vote)?. Under that standard, no one could write any editorial voicing opposition to just about any proposed public policy.\n \n \nOh, well it's all right then.\n \n No? Telling people their kids might \"catch gay\" is an ok thing?\n\n Again, not the issue. Highly controversial? Yes. Likely to incite a reasonable person to hate or violence against a minority class? No.\n \n \nThen you'd be wrong. He's allowed to say that to his congregation, his friends, family, co-workers, etc. He is not allowed to publish it.\n\n \"shall cease publishing in newspapers, by email, on the radio, in public speeches, or on the internet\"\n What if he emails sermon notes to his congregation? And is a sermon in a church not considered a \"public speech\" in Canada? He cannot post his sermons online? He can't publish a book about his views?\n \n This sounds a whole lot like saying, \"you are allowed to believe X, you are allowed to say X, but you are not allowed to write X down. If you are asked what you think, you must either lie, or remain silent. True, the law states that '[n]othing in this section shall be deemed to interfere with the free expression of opinion on any subject,' but that doesn't really mean what it says.\"\n \n \nAnd only a XXXXX would think that \"hate speech\" means guns or violence need to be involved. If you can't see that this is hate speech, then I don't know what qualifies.\n\n Mr. Boissoin was convicted for violating the section I cited above. Thus, hate speech appears to mean any speech that \"is likely to expose a person or a class of persons to hatred or contempt because of the race, religious beliefs, colour, gender, physical disability, mental disability, age, ancestry, place of origin, marital status, source of income or family status of that person or class of persons.\" So no, I do not believe his letter is hate speech. I do not think it satisfies this threshold because no reasonable person would take Mr. Boissoin's letter and hate homosexuals because of it. I also think that the question of whether his letter was unlawful is highly suspect given the fact that a local newspaper decided to publish it. Surely they wouldn't have had they thought his letter violated the law, which would make them liable if they were to publish it.\n \n \nAs I stated before, when people demonstrate they're mature enough to handle the responsibility of free speech, there are no issues.\n\n I don't know how this could possibly be implemented except by implementing some sort of speech police, whereby the government is deciding what speech is acceptable, and what speech is not. This typically turns out very bad, where the government doing the policing surprisingly ends up suppressing speech that is critical of it.\n \n \nHe's allowed to hold it. He's allowed to share it. He's not allowed to publish it.\n \n And he is. He cannot, however, publish this diatribe in a newspaper.\n\n By all means, we simply cannot allow all those Canadian citizens to be exposed to such hateful remarks. They simply are not mature or \"evolved\" enough to be able to handle it appropriately. Better have the government filter out the good from the bad for them. No, this isn't Orwellian at all.",

   "IT [the author's rant] JUST HAPPENED TO BE FACTUAL IMO.\n\n Archie believes:\"The masses have dug in and continue to excuse their failure to stand against horrendous atrocities such as the aggressive propagation of homo- and bisexuality.\"\nThat is, Archie believes that the increase in acceptance of homosexuality and bisexuality is \"aggressive.\" Archie must have also believed that the '60s civil rights movement was \"aggressive,\" as each movement argues only for equal treatment.\n Archie also believes that this increase in acceptance qualifies as \"horrendously atrocious.\" The push for equality strikes Archie has horribly wicked.\n \"Like it or not, every professing heterosexual is having their future aggressively chopped at the roots.\"\nArchie also thinks that the homosexual movement is somehow harmful to him.\n \"From kindergarten class on, our children, your grandchildren are being strategically targeted, psychologically abused and brainwashed by homosexual and pro-homosexual educators.\"\nArchie thinks that teaching equality is \"psychological abuse\" and \"brainwashing\" despite every single medical organization's official position that it is nothing of the sort.\n What is incredibly ironic is that Archie, of all people, is complaining about brainwashing. \n \"Our children are being victimized by repugnant and premeditated strategies, aimed at desensitizing and eventually recruiting our young into their camps.\"\nArchie finds equality \"repugnant.\"\n Archie also thinks that teaching equality of homosexuals is intended to make (or even merely has the effect of making) heterosexuals into homosexuals.\n \n I don't know if this is insanity or mere stupidity. In Archie's case, it could be both. Nobody can make somebody change sexual orientation. Those poor homosexuals who are subjected to religious \"fixing\" do not convert, they only suppress who they are.\n \"Think about it, children as young as five and six years of age are being subjected to psychologically and physiologically damaging pro-homosexual literature and guidance in the public school system...\"\nExcept that professionals have determined that it is not psychologically or psychiatrically (or even physiologically, however that might be) harmful. But Archie has never been one to listen to people who disagree with him, regardless of how qualified and experienced those other people are or how unbelievably unqualified and uneducated he is regarding that topic.\n \"Where homosexuality flourishes, all manner of wickedness abounds.\"\nArchie thinks that homosexuality induces problems, but he has NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER for this.\n \"The agenda is clearly about homosexual activists that include, teachers, politicians, lawyers, Supreme Court judges, and God forbid, even so-called ministers, who are all determined to gain complete equality in our nation and even worse, our world.\"\nSo Archie agrees that the push is for equal rights. It's just that Archie doesn't want homosexuals to have equal rights.\n He won't even deny this. He thinks that his bigotry is defensible.\n \"They are perverse, self-centred and morally deprived individuals who are spreading their psychological disease into every area of our lives.\"\nYet Archie's only reason for thinking this is that they're homosexual and wanting equal rights. This is circular reasoning, one of Archie's favorite pastimes.\n And Archie still thinks that homosexuality coupled with the desire for equal rights qualifies as a \"psychological disease\" even though all the professionals say otherwise.\n \"Homosexual rights activists and those that defend them, are just as immoral as the pedophiles, drug dealers and pimps that plague our communities.\"\nMore circular reasoning. Archie and his thug friends have no evidence to back up the assertion of immorality except for the claim that their activism makes them immoral.\n \"It is only a matter of time before some of these same morally bankrupt individuals such as those involved with NAMBLA, the North American Man/Boy Lovers Association, will achieve their goal to have sexual relations with children and assert that it is a matter of free choice and claim that we are intolerant bigots not to accept it.\"\nArchie and his thugs already are intolerant. Here the author purposely misrepresents NAMBLA supporters as typical homosexual activists, when reality -- about which Archie knows virtually nothing -- shows that this is not typical. But look at what Archie says later:I wouldn't insist that it was hate speech if the word christian replaced homosexual in that letter the Pastor wrote at all foundit. But I would scream up and down that it was full of lies and scurrilous defamation because none of what that letter say's represents what Christians believe in, or contribute to Society at large. So what is it they call this type of argument? A strawman, fallacious? How about a red herring. However you define it, it paints a false picture by implying that the two lifestyles have anything in common at all in order to be compared to each other. [emphasis added]\n the same disqualifying problem exists with the original bigoted article.\n \n Hey Archie, have you watched For the Bible Tells Me So yet?",

   "The short answer: \n Yes, it does, it means you are free to say what you like, even if what you say is unpopular, politically incorrect, or indirectly outcomes you find offensive, distasteful, or even, god forbid, harmful to the ideal social order you envision.\n\n \n Well, were you to make a public speech to the effect that you advocate the assassination of President X, you should be aware that you would find the Secret Service at your door, and would conceivably face a prison sentence for terrorism.\n \n Even in God's Own US of A, freedom of speech has been traditionally limited, though it has been generally broader than in most of the world, and remains a standard to be respected.\n \n \nFree speech is a corollary of private property. Meaning: you can say what you want, on your own property. If you own an airport and don't want people yelling about bombs in it, it is your right as the owner of the airport to prohibit that, just as owners of bars restrict urination to the bathrooms.\n\n \n In the context of our discussion, the only relevant freedom of speech is that which applies to public speech. What you mutter to yourself in your bedroom is not at issue here. \n \n If you were to falsely shout \"Bomb!\" in Times Square, I suspect the NYPD would not take it kindly, and you might find your free speech rights were not quite as protected as you might wish, as they haul your XXX off in the paddy wagon. You might even get charged and convicted for behaviour leading to a breach of the peace, wasting police time, and god wot what else.\n \n Speech that is incitement to violence, riot or public disorder has never enjoyed the same protections as political speech designed to change government policy or change government. Not even in the US, which has laws against sedition. You have a theoretical right to advocate revolution, for example, but don't expect government institutions to support any attempt to exercise revolution itself, or anything they suspect might lead to it.",

   "Because contrary to what some may have concluded from some prior conversations I've had on these forums, I do happen to think that rights exist; that they are given to all human beings by their Creator; and that governments ought to secure these rights. That is troubling to me even though the ruling does not directly affect me. That is troubling to me even though I could (if I wished) re-publish Mr. Boissoin's letter without any sanction from some ridiculous tribunal.\n\n \n It will not surprise you to learn I disagree with most of that. Rights do not exist objectively, they are constructed by human philosophy; they are not granted by any creator, because there is no creator. However, I do agree that one of the functions of government is to guarantee the rights that the people feel they need to live fulfilled lives.\n \n As far as the Canadians are concerned, they have the liberty to chose to live under a different set of laws from the ones you prefer. If they chose to live under these, or they choose to rescind them, that is up to them. We can only comment on their periphery, and it doesn't much matter to Canadians what we think about it.\n \n You, personally, may find Canadians \"ridiculous\" because they have chosen to protect the right to freedom from harassment, whereas you would presumably claim your \"Creator\" didn't give anyone that right -- though how you would know that I have no idea. However, they don't have to bow to your opinion or mine. \n \n \nNo reasonable person can understand the letter to be a call to violence.\n\n \n Come off it, Phyllis. You mean that you, personally, wouldn't take the letter to be a call to violence. Do you then agree with its sentiments?\n \n First of all, there are lots of us here who are reasonable people who find the letter as troubling as that Alberta commission did, even if some of us may disagree with the final verdict. Or is it your assertion that the members of the Alberta human rights commission are a bunch of irrational, babbling baboons bereft of all reason, just because they don't agree with you? Yes, Phyllis, perfectly reasonable people CAN find that letter unreasonably threatening, and did, so it's plain daft to claim in effect that no reasonable person would disagree with you -- and that's a pretty self-serving definition of \"reasonable\".\n \n However, the real issue the commission had to decide is not how REASONABLE people would see it, and they might see it either way, even as you and I do: the real problem is that UNREASONABLE religious zealots might find the letter a call to arms... which, oddly enough, is exactly what the letter was! Literally, in so many words. Arms that might lead to violence. And, I might add, the publication WAS followed by violence, though it's hard to establish cause.\n \n \nDo you really think that a newspaper, which is subject to the same exact anti-hate speech legislation, would dare publish it if it were even questionable that it was? A call to some action? Yes. A call to violence? I don't think so on its face.\n\n \n I haven't seen the newspaper in question, so I do not know what sort of right-wing garbage it might be disposed to publish. At any rate, the ruling was not exactly going to bankrupt anyone, and no doubt the paper might well think it was worth the cost for publicity mere advertising couldn't buy.\n \n However, here you are thinking as a literalistic lawyer, and not as a student of human nature or psychology. True, the letter did not overtly advocate the righteous murder of gay people -- bigoted religious tracts such as this rarely do, because it reflects poorly on Christianity, and because it would rapidly send the writer and publisher to a well-deserved jail sentence. \n \n What it did was create an atmosphere in which unreasonable Christians might see it as their moral duty to wreak their god's punishment on gay people. Violence did, in fact, follow its publication, and though direct cause can't be established, a reasonable person might very well suppose such excessive rhetoric contributes to a climate of violent hostility against gays. \n \n \nAnd what's more, even if one supports hate speech prohibitions (I emphatically do not), wouldn't one rather have these kinds of cases decided by a jury rather than some established tribunal? If we are going to go after people for violating subjective terms in statutes, then it seems to me that a jury of one's peers should be the ones to decide the subjective meaning of the terms.\n\n \n Well, you are here castigating Canadians for not being Conservative Americans, and blaming them for not subscribing to the US system of jurisprudence. What is so wonderful about the jury system, anyway? Does it invariably provide a better disposition of cases than a panel of judges? That's a matter of opinion. In any case, the decision of the commission is subject to appeal. I'm sure the Canadians are perfectly capable of deciding the best policy in their community without gratuitous advice from their neighbours.\n \n Superior courts may well reverse the decision... and if they do not, that might well reflect the tenor of opinion in Canada at present more effectively than any local jury.",

With that caveat, and since you asked me directly, I am a free speech advocate. The letter in question is (1) inaccurate in many respects and (2) offensive and absurd in its claims.

I accept that reasonable people can reasonably disagree about both the intent and consequence of this bigot's letter.

You can read excerpts from their interviews here: http://www.deepfocusproductions.com/page_html/film_LTK0.html\n \n There was also the case of the brothers who brutally killed the gay couple in Redlands (or was it Redding?), CA, who basically said later that \"God told them to do it.\" I doubt they came up with this idea in a vaccuum; the media is rife with messages that \"God hates f@gs.\"\n \n Sure, these are unstable people.

   "The question of what constitutes a \"call to violence\" can be a tricky question, difficult to answer. And calls to violence can run afoul of the law even in the United States. The issue has become even more complicated with the advent of the internet. I remember a few years ago an anti-abortion website listed the names and addresses of doctors and nurses who provided abortions, and it included a line through the names of those who had been killed by anti-abortion activists. Did the list call for the murder of abortion providers? Those who sought to shut the website down argued yes, while the lawyers for the website argued that there was no direct or clear call for anyone to commit murder. I don't recall exactly what the outcome was, but the website was shut down, though exactly how that came about I don't remember. \n \n When I get time I'll try to track this information down. Now I must run off and get my daughter to her dress rehearsal for her dance recital.\n\n \n Okay, I promised to track down the anti-abortion website whose crossing out of the names of murdered abortion providers was ruled by a U.S. court to be an illegal threat because it called for the murder of abortion providers. I found the website in question, and here is the link: http://www.christiangallery.com/atrocity/aborts.html\n \n As the website itself explains, in response to the court ruling, the website simply changed the form of its list of murdered abortion providers. It strikes me that the website still suggests that these abortion providers deserved to be killed. No longer here, as far I can see, is a list of the names and addresses of living abortion providers intermingled with the list of those who were murdered or physically attacked. \n \n Note that I am not trying to change the subject here to abortion, but rather to illustrate some of the issues that arise in trying to determine what is constitutionally protected free speech and what is an illegal threat in the United States. In reading this website, I think it still sounds like the owner is calling for the murder of abortion providers, not directly, but by implication quite strongly. This website still sounds like it's making a threat, whereas the letter in question in Canada that is the specific subject of this thread does not sound to me like it's making a threat.",

So now in Canada, what has historically been considered sexual perversions are now considered sexual orientations and fall under a protected class of sexual preference. To the absolute dismay of parents of young boys who now can't even convict perpetrators of crimes against children as the sexual needs of perpetrators have been deemed as right and normal in Canada now. The grey are is huge now as to how can a person who is just doing what is natural to them be held legally responsible for breaking any laws? From my post above, I repeat...\n Do we say a serial murderer has an orientation to murder? Or a thief has an orientation to steal?\n \n No. We don't. But look what's happening when it comes to men who sexually abuse children. It's a sexual orientation. And if the abuse happened a few months ago it's somehow downgraded to \"historic\" abuse and the predator is somehow no longer a risk to children.\n \n A \"sexual orientation\"!\n \n I remind people once again that this is how the gay rights lobby advanced it's agenda. \"Sexual orientation.\" Those who fought that legislation begged to have the words \"sexual orientation\" replaced by \"homosexuality.\" Their argument was that if the intent was solely to give special protection and rights to homosexuals then at least let that be reflected in the choice of words - there were deep fears that with the use of the words \"sexual orientation\" the legislation as it stands will provide special rights, protections and privileges for those who molest children.\n \n The concerns fell on deaf ears. There were assurances that the sole intent was to provide protection for homosexuals, and more assurances that the sexual abuse of children would never be referred to as a \"sexual orientation.\"\n \n Here we are.\n \n It's happening.\n \n Wake up people!\n \n Look what's happened to the laws of our land. See where we're going:\n \n In 1995 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in Egan v. Canada that the term \"sexual orientation\" was to be \"read in\" to Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This is the section that deals with equality rights.\n \n Section 15 reads as follows. (Add the words \"sexual orientation\" to the list. They have been \"read in.\" )\n \n 15. (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\n \n (2) Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\n \n In 1996 Bill C-33 passed Parliament. The term \"sexual orientation\" was added to the Federal Human Rights Act. The act now reads:\n \n 2. The purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.\n R.S., 1985, c. H-6, s. 2; 1996, c. 14, s. 1; 1998, c. 9, s. 9.\n \n In 2004 sexual orientation was added to the hate crimes list, making it a hate crime to do or say anything which would be construed as inciting hatred against anyone based on their their sexual orientation.",

I think the issue of homosexuality is a little unique because it has the nature of being both a moralistic issue for some AND an issue of bigotry for others, and with some it may be both. Nevertheless we shouldn't regulate the debate and censor one side of it, even if we are appalled at the arguments. My opinion is that censoring something like this is an example of the powers that be dumbing down society, not trusting people to be able to make up their own minds about an issue. I believe information we don't agree with should be countered as a response, but not censored, unless it's clear and quantifiable that someone is calling people to violent action. Clearly this article isn't such a case. I re-read it just now and the only such things there are vague statements like \"it's time we stand together.\" Or \"take whatever steps are necessary.\" Sorry, but that's no call to violent action.",

   "It will not surprise you to learn I disagree with most of that. Rights do not exist objectively, they are constructed by human philosophy; they are not granted by any creator, because there is no creator. However, I do agree that one of the functions of government is to guarantee the rights that the people feel they need to live fulfilled lives.\n \n\n Let it never be said again that I am a softy when it comes to the existence of human rights, and that human rights ought to be defended and protected.\n \n \nAs far as the Canadians are concerned, they have the liberty to chose to live under a different set of laws from the ones you prefer. If they chose to live under these, or they choose to rescind them, that is up to them. We can only comment on their periphery, and it doesn't much matter to Canadians what we think about it.\n\n No disagreement with this; of course Canada is a sovereign nation. But so are the North Koreans, Iranians, and Venezuelans. The point is not to compare Canada to these three countries; rather it is simply to say that, even though Canada certainly is free to choose their laws, I'm still certainly free to call them out for enacting a bad law, just as I am free to call Kim Jong il a tyrant.\n \n \nCome off it, Phyllis. You mean that you, personally, wouldn't take the letter to be a call to violence. Do you then agree with its sentiments?\n\n So if I don't think it is hate speech, then I must agree with it? If I don't think the Constitution requires the states to recognize gay marriage, then I must be a bigot? The reasonableness of these types of statements would certainly be called into question.\n \n \nYes, Phyllis, perfectly reasonable people CAN find that letter unreasonably threatening, and did, so it's plain daft to claim in effect that no reasonable person would disagree with you -- and that's a pretty self-serving definition of \"reasonable\".\n\n The definition of a reasonable person to which I was referring is simply: the common person of average intelligence.\n \n \nHowever, the real issue the commission had to decide is not how REASONABLE people would see it, and they might see it either way, even as you and I do: the real problem is that UNREASONABLE religious zealots might find the letter a call to arms... which, oddly enough, is exactly what the letter was! Literally, in so many words. Arms that might lead to violence. And, I might add, the publication WAS followed by violence, though it's hard to establish cause.\n\n So you suggest that anytime somebody says something, they must consider how the village idiot might take their words? That they must consider not how normal people might interpret the words and react, but only how the village idiot might understand them and react to them? If this is the standard for public discourse, there would be no public discourse; for there will always be a village idiot, and that idiot will always be capable of taking any editorial written by any person and misinterpret it in such a way as to believe it calls for violence or, God forbid, \"action\" against some person, class, or agenda.\n \n And that violence occurred after the letter was published cannot possibly mean anything in this unless one can prove causation, or at least reasonably establish its likelihood. Otherwise, its like saying, \"the day after the letter was published, the sun came up. Therefore, Mr. Boissoin's letter is responsible for making the sun come up.\"\n \n \nWhat it did was create an atmosphere in which unreasonable Christians might see it as their moral duty to wreak their god's punishment on gay people. Violence did, in fact, follow its publication, and though direct cause can't be established, a reasonable person might very well suppose such excessive rhetoric contributes to a climate of violent hostility against gays.\n\n It is true then. Mr. Boissoin should be held accountable for how the village idiot, or just some psycho, might respond to his letter. Interesting. Would this be your view if, say, someone wrote an editorial into the newspaper that simply said, \"Vanilla ice-cream is the best ice cream flavor ever,\" and a couple weeks later some psycho, stating that the letter was calling him to exact God's punishment on non-vanilla lovers, beats someone up because they were eating chocolate ice cream? Would it not simply be easier, and more accurate, to say that the person who acted in this manner was wacko? This is why I have been emphasizing how a reasonable person (or, simply, a common person of average intelligence) would react to the letter, rather than how the village wacko might respond. It is clear that mass violence did not ensue as a result of this letter. In fact, to be honest, no violence can be attributed as a result of this letter. It would appear, then, given this overwhelming response by the public of non-violence, that a reasonable person would not interpret this as a letter likely to incite violence or hate, no matter what the Alberta Human Rights Commission says to the contrary.\n \n \nWell, you are here castigating Canadians for not being Conservative Americans, and blaming them for not subscribing to the US system of jurisprudence. What is so wonderful about the jury system, anyway? Does it invariably provide a better disposition of cases than a panel of judges? That's a matter of opinion. In any case, the decision of the commission is subject to appeal. I'm sure the Canadians are perfectly capable of deciding the best policy in their community without gratuitous advice from their neighbours.\n\n I merely said that if we are going to advocate holding people guilty under subjective terminology, it would be better to have their guilt assessed by a jury of their peers, who are endowed with the wonderful quality of common sense reason, rather than a judicial panel comprised (probably of lawyers), who evidently are not.\n \n \nSuperior courts may well reverse the decision... and if they do not, that might well reflect the tenor of opinion in Canada at present more effectively than any local jury.\n\n Perhaps. But there is a high suspicion whether a jury of Canadians really would view this letter as worthy of suppression, reprimand, and retribution. Again, that no violence can be attributed to this letter proves that a reasonable person was not incited to violence or hate as a result of the editorial. Even considering that the one incident which followed the letter (but which cannot be attributed to it), the conclusion is still sound. In other words, the fact that people did not respond to the letter with hate or violence toward homosexuals is de facto proof that the letter is not likely to incite hatred or violence.",

Also, It falls under the protection of these hate speech laws so anyone caught even writing an article warning people about the dangers these people pose to their children and Society at large can be charged under this law for inciting hate and violence. When all they are doing is exposing a very real social danger of the existence of sexual predators. It is tyranny to limit good people the right to freely expose social dangers that exist within their communities.\n \n Here's the definition of pederast:\n First, the definition of pederast. The following from the Free Dictionary online\n \n (1) pederast or paederast\n Noun\n a man who has homosexual relations with boys [Greek pais boy + erast&#275;s lover]\n \n (2) ped&#8226;er&#8226;ast (p d -r st )\n n.\n A man who has sexual relations, especially anal intercourse, with a boy.\n \n (3) Thesaurus\n Noun1.pederast - a man who has sex (usually sodomy) with a boy as the passive partner\n \n child molester, paederast\n degenerate, deviant, deviate, pervert - a person whose behavior deviates from what is acceptable especially in sexual behaviour\n And here is the sites authors relevant concerns regarding the protections they receive in Canada.\n Sexually molesting young lads is simply a sexual orientation? Like homosexuality, bisexuality and heterosexuality and transgendered and transsexuality?!!!!\n \n Do people understand what this means? In Canada people receiving special protections and privileges based on their &#8220;sexual orientation.&#8221; People can not be discriminated against based on their &#8220;sexual orientation.&#8221; People can be charged for inciting hatred against anyone based on their &#8220;sexual orientation.&#8221;\n \n What it means is that men who molest young boys presumably have a sexual orientation to molest. That means have no control over it. Can&#8217;t do anything about it. Perhaps they were even born that way. They have no choice but to molest\n \n What it means is we should be saying &#8216;those poor misunderstood maligned pederasts. We should give them a break.&#8217; And we should give them our children.\n \n This is serious stuff. Scary stuff.\n \n Dr. Wolfe, an &#8220;expert&#8221;witness who helped Justice Glaude &#8220;frame&#8221; his inquiry, described paedophilia as a &#8220;sexual orientation.&#8221;\n \n Det. Sgt. Carroll describes pederasty as a &#8220;sexual orientation.&#8221;\n \n Where does that leave the children of the nation? Prey?\n \n Pederasts, paedophiles &#8211; makes no difference does it? Not to the child. Children are being sexually molested. That&#8217;s wrong. It&#8217;s wrong morally. It&#8217;s wrong legally. It&#8217;s sinful. It&#8217;s criminal. It&#8217;s wicked. It&#8217;s just plain evil.\n \n Why the quibbling. Why the wordsmithing? Why introduce this novel notion that it&#8217;s a sexual orientation?\n \n And why jump up and down and scream and shout if the word paedophile is used to describe a man who may be a pederast? Perhaps the paedophile is a pederast? Perhaps the pederast is a paedophile? It all comes down to definitions, and whose definitions we pick. There are countless. The only thing assured by the title pederast is that a pederast is a man who homosexually abuses a boy. Advocates of man-boy sex call it &#8220;love.&#8221;\n \n That&#8217;s now a &#8220;sexual orientation&#8221;? A member of the Cornwall Police Service says that&#8217;s a sexual orientation?!\n \n Do we say a serial murderer has an orientation to murder? Or a thief has an orientation to steal?\n \n No. We don&#8217;t. But look what&#8217;s happening when it comes to men who sexually abuse children. It&#8217;s a sexual orientation. And if the abuse happened a few months ago it&#8217;s somehow downgraded to &#8220;historic&#8221; abuse and the predator is somehow no longer a risk to children.

Surely you don't think that someone in a case like this who is addressing a cultural and extremely socially controversial issue likely means war in the sense of violence. He simply means this in the sense of a culture war, or ideological 'war'. This is particularly a common concept in religion, which often uses 'war' as sort of a way to refer to ideological or spiritual conflict. In no way does that call for people to 'hate gays.' It's the same idea as people saying \"I'm going to take up the fight\" when standing for an ideological cause. It doesn't literally mean they are going to go out and start a fist fight, or take up arms. For instance, if someone is researching cancer to find a cure, and they say \"I'm going to win this war\" they aren't talking about a literal war. \n \n \n\"horrendous atrocities such as the aggressive propagation of homo- and bisexuality\"\n\n \n \n\"every professing heterosexual is having their future aggressively chopped at the roots\"\n\n \n These may be wrong and ignorant statements, but that's not the same as calling for hate against gays.

Ignorance and hate are not necessarily the same thing. I read this and I see what are pretty typical misunderstandings about gays and a lack of understanding. Maybe I read it that way because I grew up among people who believed this sort of thing, and since I knew them I know there's no way a lot of them were hateful people. They weren't monsters; they just didn't understand the issues very well.There are a lot of people who really do think that people who engage in gay relationships are being \"wicked\" (sinful) in doing so--that's not the same as hating them (which is more of something that involves malice toward someone).",

   "... please address the point I raised. To repeat: hatred doesn't come from no where. It's taught and reinforced, by letters like this.\n\n \n Hmm ... I don't think so--I think hate can come from 'nowhere'. For example, kids can exhibit some of worst behavior, just on the basis of someone being different. And consider this: your stance that \"hatred doesn't come from no where\" means that you think hate can't happen in a vacuum of ideals. So ... should we assume that you think if someone never hears anything negative about someone very different than them, than when they encounter such a person it's a given that there won't be hate there? I don't think human behavior really seems to bear that out at all--in fact, quite the opposite given human history. (think about it: often when one culture encountered another very different culture for the first time, there was sometimes automatic distrust and prejudice; for instance, when Europeans encountered African tribes. Also, where do you think the \"hate\" that hate requires for spawning comes from? See, it's a chicken-or-the-egg thing. If hate always requires hate to come into existence, then no one would hate anyone, to this day, because there would be nothing to have started the cause-and-effect process. Human beings quite simply often have an unfortunate tendency to hate what is very different from them. They may not be naturally all evil, but they certainly aren't naturally all benevolent either. So hate does, in fact, sometimes come from 'no where.' And again, regardless of whether or not the letter constitutes 'hate', I'm not saying people can't be 'driven over the edge' by something like this letter. I thought I had made that clear. I'm saying the danger of that isn't enough to warrant telling people they shouldn't take a moralistic stance or full-blown hate speech.\n \n \nYou seem to be ignoring the whole bit there about \"accepted standard\". I don't get to have my own personal accepted standard, that's what accepted standard means.\n\n \n So, who decides the standard of morality for humanity? It's not like there's a Morality Committee to set the rules. It varies from person to person sometimes; clearly one person's morality may not be another's. (We've had this discussion before, and frankly, I'm surprised to this day you never could agree with something that's so easily observable.)\n \n \nNo, they do not need to be addressed individually. These aren't fortune cookie snippets that were found on his desk; they are part of a single letter, the whole of which was dedicated to delivering a single message. Yes, if you look at each sentence in isolation you can rationalize it away; but that's not how they were presented. They were presented as a theme, each part supporting the rest, and their collective weight screams homophobic hatred of gays.\n\n \n Sorry, but I'm not going to blithely lump it all into one big ball. It needs to be analyzed and if you are going to refute it, you're going to have to do better than just refuse to deal with its specifics and try to wish it away.\n \n \nReally?! Seems to me that's [hate] the central issue here. Which question am I begging?\n\n \n \nWell then, you seem to have a prejudice you need to overcome if you want to have a clear view of this issue. Trully, I really don't understand how you can read that letter and not see homophobia and hate.\n\n \n Ok; then what specifically has to be in place in a given piece of speech for something to constitute hate speech to you? What is it--specifically--that makes this hate speech as opposed to something that's not? You're insisting that this is a case of hate; that's fine, but I'd like to know what your criteria is for something to qualify as 'hate' speech. If you're going to levy such a serious accusation, I think it's only fair that you make it clear what defines the standard you're going by.\n \n Also, re. your statement about prejudice; prejudice is being against someone, as you are in this case. I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt; you aren't. In point of fact, if anyone is demonstrating prejudice here, it's you, against this author. I already said he may hate gays. I'm not ruling it out. But I'm not going to assume it's hate as opposed to religious moralism either. You're the one taking the position here (that it's hate); I'm saying it may or may not be. (FWIW, the author is exhibiting a form of prejudice clearly, but it could be a religious moralistic thing rather than 'hate'.)\n \n \nThen what is he calling upon people to do? If he's not saying \"I hate gays and you should too\" then what is his message?\n\n \n It seems to me he's calling on people to take a moralistic stance against people who engage in gay relationships. I don't agree with that approach personally; I think if one is going to take a moralistic stance they need to be very clear that it's actions they are talking about as opposed to people. But even then, opposing people on something doesn't mean hating them. Just as gay rights advocates oppose religious people sometimes; it doesn't mean they hate them.",

And if it doesn't seem like hate speech to you, what does it seem like? I'm truly curious... I mean it's speech, there's no question of that, and it's an overt expression of gut bigotry and hatred.\n \n \nThe definition of a reasonable person to which I was referring is simply: the common person of average intelligence.\n\n \n This person of above average intelligence finds the relevant tract provocative, aggressively hostile and threatening. \n \n \nSo you suggest that anytime somebody says something, they must consider how the village idiot might take their words?\n\n \n They would be fools not to. Do you think unreasonable people don't read? Do you think they cannot be inflamed by rhetoric? \n \n \nThat they must consider not how normal people might interpret the words and react, but only how the village idiot might understand them and react to them?\n \n \n Yes, if they want to make public statements. They need to consider ALL the possible consequences. Remember, we are not talking about discussing tax policy here, but whether direct action should be taken against homosexuals... you know, fellow citizens with human rights.\n \n \nIf this is the standard for public discourse, there would be no public discourse; for there will always be a village idiot, and that idiot will always be capable of taking any editorial written by any person and misinterpret it in such a way as to believe it calls for violence or, God forbid, \"action\" against some person, class, or agenda.\n\n \n Come off it... one can express one's religious opinion without calling for a jihad against gay people, can't one? Or perhaps one can't.\n \n \nAnd that violence occurred after the letter was published cannot possibly mean anything in this unless one can prove causation, or at least reasonably establish its likelihood. Otherwise, its like saying, \"the day after the letter was published, the sun came up. Therefore, Mr. Boissoin's letter is responsible for making the sun come up.\"\n\n \n I stipulated in my posts that cause could not be proven, but it can be reasonably suspected. The bigot's rant did, after all, contribute to a climate of hostility, as all hate speech does. I'm not suggesting Boisson be indicted for incitement, however, but he does need to have his wings clipped.\n \n \nI merely said that if we are going to advocate holding people guilty under subjective terminology, it would be better to have their guilt assessed by a jury of their peers, who are endowed with the wonderful quality of common sense reason, rather than a judicial panel comprised (probably of lawyers), who evidently are not.\n\n \n A jury of Boisson's peers? He could probably outrightly call for vigilante violence and his peers would still acquit! They all think the way that odious man does. OK, seriously, I suppose you really mean not his peers so much, as his fellow citizens. I do not personally have a problem with that, however, neither would I have a problem with a panel of judges adjudicating the issue. Remember, even a jury trial is subject to judicial appeal. It's not such a big issue for me, and one solution seems as good as another.\n \n \nIn other words, the fact that people did not respond to the letter with hate or violence toward homosexuals is de facto proof that the letter is not likely to incite hatred or violence.\n\n \n First of all, you cannot prove that the real violence following the publication letter was not incited by it. It's merely difficult to prove that it was. Yes, I am aware the publication of a hate tract isn't sufficient to prove that Boisson was guilty of incitement to this particular act of violence, which is why I would not call for an indictment on those grounds. But it wasn't designed as reconciliation, either, far from it. It was deliberately violent and provocative rhetoric.\n \n Second, it's not just THIS letter that's the problem, it's the vast tide of homophobic hate speech emanating from some Christian quarters that creates a situation where gay people are seen as fair game by far too many of your co-religionists.\n \n The Canadian government sought to stem it. Good for them. The more I listen to the anti-gay screeds, the more I think that the people who make them ought to be confronted with the responsibility for the consequences of such speech.",

   "It's pretty obvious that had Boisson's published letter targeted blacks, Jews, Christians (or even lawyers!), there would be considerably less upset about the verdict against him among the right-wing chattering classes in the press. But when violently aggressive speech is directed against gays, suddenly it's more protected than most. Go figure!\n \n No free speech rights -- referring here to freedom of the press or soapbox, which is the case at issue, not so much individual private speech -- have ever been held to be absolute, not ever, not anywhere. The only question really is to what extent and under what circumstances they can be legitimately limited. While I agree one should err on the side of freedom of speech, it is an exaggeration at best, and disingenuous at worst, to claim that this Canadian case is some sort of dagger against the throat of free speech.\n \n The best answer to hate speech remains, as always, more speech. But when hate speech turns towards advocacy of direct action against a group of people, which Boisson's letter clearly verged on, it goes beyond mere hatred into incitement. It then falls into that grey area of speech that it might be legitimate to hold people accountable for.\n \n Now, certainly reasonable people can reasonably disagree on exactly where to draw the line, and some might put Boisson on this side of the line rather than that, but it's a pathetic dodge to claim that no line should ever be drawn, for reasons of lofty idealism. We just don't live in an ideal world. There is a fuzzy boundary between merely obnoxious speech and outrightly inciteful speech, but that doesn't mean we should treat the latter with the same tolerance as the former.\n \n The law doesn't handle fuzzy boundaries as easily as science, this is true. However, usually the law resolves the problem by drawing a more-or-less arbitrary line through the fuzz. We do this for many legal issues, such as abortion or age of majority, which are every bit as important as freedom of speech. While freedom of speech is important to preserve public discourse, so is freedom from persecution.",

   "\n Nonsense Matthew. I fully support the 13th Amendment, and would vigorously oppose any effort to repeal it. But go ahead and say that slavery is perfectly fine with me anyway. Don't ever let the truth stand in the way of your bias. What would you suggest? That the Supreme Court had said \"Slavery is permitted under the Constitution; but, nevertheless we are going to say that it is unconstitutional\"? You do realize that after many years of progress regarding the slavery issue in the legislature, it was the Supreme Court that enshrined slavery for good, right? So much for relying on Courts to do \"the right thing.\"\n\n \n Just as an aside, at least one scholar has argued that even before the 13th amendment, slavery should have been struck down as an unconstitutional violation of the takings clause. Here's a link to an abstract of the writer's article and the headline of the article: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=420540\n \n \"Slavery as a Takings Clause Violation\" \n \n I think this is a stretch. But even before the Civil War there was debate over whether the constitution promoted slavery, disallowed slavery, or simply took a neutral position on slavery. The famous abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison argued that the U.S. constitution was a vile proslavery document, and he burned the constitution in the public square. He also called for people not to vote, because he regarded voting as a compromise with a sinful proslavery system. The famous abolitionist Frederick Douglass argued the opposite. He said that properly interpreted, the constitution is a \"glorious liberty document.\" He argued that properly interpreted, the constitution did not allow slavery. (Note that this was before the 13th amendment.) Others argued that the constitution was neither proslavery nor antislavery but was an attempt by the framers to be neutral on the subject so that subsequent legislatures could eliminate slavery in the future if they chose to do so. And of course you are right that the Supreme Court in the infamous Dred Scott case fixed slavery on the entire nation by declaring that Congress had no power to abolish slavery anywhere. \n \n Much of the debate over slavery revolved around property rights, as you certainly know. Proslavery activists argued that slaves were property, and the government had no power to strip slaveholders of their property by declaring slavery illegal in any of the states or territories. Thus, they argued in Dred Scott, a slaveholder had every right to bring his slaves into free states or territories, and his property still remained his property. Opponents of slavery argued that slave property was ill gotten in the first place, because it was, in effect, stolen property. The slave himself or herself was the owner of himself or herself, and no one could legitimately seize human property and take it from the person him or herself. Regarding the Dred Scott case, the antislavery forces insisted on the right of states to make slavery illegal and the power of Congress to make slavery illegal as well. \n \n On the question of whether the opponents of slavery were making headway in the legislature, meaning either Congress or the state legislatures, I will argue to you that they were making little headway in Congress and some headway in the state legislatures north of the Missouri Compromise line, but this progress was sometimes undone by acts of Congress. When Congress passed the Compromise of 1850, which provided for a strong fugitive slave law, some northern state legislatures rebelled and passed personal liberty laws in defiance of the Congress. They viewed the requirement that they return fugitive slaves to their owners as government tyranny over the states. \n \n The Civil War was in many respects the result of the failure of the legislative process to resolve the issue of slavery peacefully. Of course the Supreme Court with its Dred Scott ruling made things worse by effectively shutting down the legislative process and thus further polarizing North and South. But by 1857, the legislative process itself had already failed to create a solution, and the effort to resolve the issue of slavery by popular sovereignty in the new territories entering as states led to warfare in Kansas before the Civil War itself broke out. \n \n So my argument to you is that yes, the Supreme Court certainly made things worse with its Dred Scott ruling, but the legislative process was not working to resolve the issue of slavery either. And I think it could not have done so. The fact that the republic we call the United States was created based on principles of universal liberty and equality with slavery still alive and permitted in it created a problem that neither the legislative process nor the judicial process was able to resolve. Yes, the 13th amendment did finally resolve the question, but only in ashes of the Civil War, when the North and the Republicans in Congress were able to force the South to comply and accept the abolition of slavery. Only in that context, of 600,000 Americans dead and the South in ruins, were Americans able to abolish slavery by constitutional amendment. This was the one circumstance where both the legislative and judicial processes failed, and the republic came apart in war.",

   " I'm saying the danger of that isn't enough to warrant telling people they shouldn't take a moralistic stance or full-blown hate speech.\n\n So you do admit there is a danger then? I feel you've been avoiding saying that letters like this can and do cause harm, and that's all I've been trying to say here.\n \n \n So, who decides the standard of morality for humanity? It's not like there's a Morality Committee to set the rules. It varies from person to person sometimes; clearly one person's morality may not be another's. \n\n Exactly my point. If morality varies so from person to person than saying that someone's views are moralistic means nothing. The fact that their stance is moralistic doesn't excuse anything or cut them any slack, it doesn't mean that allowances should be made for them. They're simply expressing an opinion, and that opinion needs to be judged on its own merits, not on the basis of its being \"moralistic\".\n \n \n\n (We've had this discussion before, and frankly, I'm surprised to this day you never could agree with something that's so easily observable.) \n\n Frankly, you've never really listened to my point of view, you still don't get it. But that's not a discussion for this thread.\n \n \n\n Sorry, but I'm not going to blithely lump it all into one big ball. It needs to be analyzed and if you are going to refute it, you're going to have to do better than just refuse to deal with its specifics and try to wish it away. \n\n That's how writing works, I'm afraid. Sentences work together to form and support themes. If you refuse to look at the letter as a letter, but instead as a bunch of unrelated snippets to be analyzed seperately, then you're indulging in willful ignorance.\n \n \n\n Ok; then what specifically has to be in place in a given piece of speech for something to constitute hate speech to you? What is it--specifically--that makes this hate speech as opposed to something that's not? You're insisting that this is a case of hate; that's fine, but I'd like to know what your criteria is for something to qualify as 'hate' speech. If you're going to levy such a serious accusation, I think it's only fair that you make it clear what defines the standard you're going by.\n\n I'll happily talk to you about this, but only if you promise to be reasonable. No \"quantifiable standards\", no \"absolute proof\", no ludicrously high bench marks. This isn't math, this is emotions; I can't show you the formula for hate. Agreed?\n \n \n\n Also, re. your statement about prejudice; prejudice is being against someone, as you are in this case. \n\n Nope. Prejudice = pre judge. It's to form an opinion based on preconcieved notions rather than on the facts. Usually the notion is negative, but not always.\n \n \n\n But I'm not going to assume it's hate as opposed to religious moralism either.\n\n Why can't it be both. The later has led to the former, that's all. You seem to be of the opinion that if someone is taking a religious stance than they can't be hating; that's simply not true. And that's your pro-religious prejudice showing.\n \n \n\n It seems to me he's calling on people to take a moralistic stance against people who engage in gay relationships. \n\n But since \"moralistic\" can mean nigh on anything, that tells us nothing. Be specific, what \"morals\" is he pushing? What does this stance involve?",

I question an emphatic insistence without given standards on your part that it's definitely hate, and you somehow raise that to \"if-someone-is-taking-a-religious-stance-than-they-can't-be-hating\" (which is a much more general statement). Do you not see the leap you've just made here? I did NOT say religious stance can't equal hate. I didn't even say THIS religious stance (in the letter) can't be hate! In fact, I've said more than once now that it might be, which is quite the opposite. You're taking the position here, that this letter is hate. You're saying, emphatically (without giving what standards you're using to go by), that it is. Nowhere have I said that someone taking a religious stance can't be hating.

The focus should be holding people accountable for when they harm gays, if they're so stupid to let something like this letter influence them to do that.\n \n \n \n Ah, and I guess letters never say more than one thing in them, as this one does. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \n Sorry, I'm not interested in your emotions; no offense. This is a debate forum; it's quite appropriate that you qualify your statements; emotion won't cut it. And I hope the day never comes when quantifiable standards and proving your position is is a 'ludicrous' concept. (Also FWIW, I didn't say \"absolute\" proof, that's your addition.) \n \n \n \n Then what have I prejudged? You're the one taking a position here about this author.\n \n \n \n That is absolutely a falsehood. Why is it that you often portray things much farther than I ever said them? I question an emphatic insistence without given standards on your part that it's definitely hate, and you somehow raise that to \"if-someone-is-taking-a-religious-stance-than-they-can't-be-hating\" (which is a much more general statement). Do you not see the leap you've just made here? I did NOT say religious stance can't equal hate. I didn't even say THIS religious stance (in the letter) can't be hate! In fact, I've said more than once now that it might be, which is quite the opposite. You're taking the position here, that this letter is hate. You're saying, emphatically (without giving what standards you're using to go by), that it is. Nowhere have I said that someone taking a religious stance can't be hating. I just want to know how you determine if something is hate.\n \n \n \n Clearly, his morals are that people who engage in gay relations are doing wrong, and that doing so is not right. I think he made that fairly clear! He called them 'perverse' for example. \n \n Now since you asked me for specifics, I again ask, how 'bout you being specific (since I indulged you on that) on what you're criteria is for something to qualify as 'hate' speech. And please don't use begging-the-question responses like \"if it leads people to do bad things to a given group.\"\n\n \n \n Had this been a writer saying people who engage in gay relations are doing wrong, there wouldn't be an issue. That is perfectly acceptable under Canadian law. This wasn't taking a moral stand. It is the willful promotion of hatred. And there was no other purpose to this letter.\n \n Please don't isolate one part, and say because \"perverse\" can also involve taking a moral stand, the letter represents a moral stand and nothing more. If this were a letter against your social group, you'd be saying the context is important. This was in the context of hate speech.\n \n Hatred is culturally learned. It doesn't happen out of nowhere, as you said earlier. Your example of colonial times was a surprising one. The whites hated the native populations they encountered on other continents, because the latter did not worship the former's God. Blood-spilling, the destruction of cultures, the stealing of land, followed. I guess you can say it's a part of the nature of humans, as is love and co-operation. Which leads to better results? As we contiually make up our societies, our subjective realities, we will decide. \n \n There is plenty of evidence hate speech doesn't stay in a vacuum. You say if \"people are so stupid\" to act on it...? They are stupid enough to act on it, just as they are stupid enough to write it. It's true that some really messed up people may act in a violent hateful way, after watching Little House on The Prairie, or even a letter that states the writer believes something is wrong without completely dehumanizing an identifiable group of people with hateful rhetoric and incitement. However, aren't some things more likely to inspire the most extreme acts, things like letters where the entire purpose is to propagate hate?\n \n A conviction for hate-speech is very difficult to get in Canada. It's meant to deal with only the most extreme forms of hate. There are many other ways to disagree and debate.",

A conviction for hate-speech is very difficult to get in Canada. It's meant to deal with only the most extreme forms of hate.

I don't agree with your assessment that this was not a moralistic stance, nor your assessment that it was a willful promotion of hatred. The author didn't call on people to 'hate gays'--he didn't say \"hey everybody, be sure and go hate gays today.\" What he did do was use a number of characterizations that you find offensive. But that doesn't automatically mean it's hate, and it is certainly not hate just because you say it is. (After all, why should you get to decide what constitutes hate and what doesn't? Why does your standard--whatever it is--get precedence instead of someone else's?) That is the problem with throwing around labels like \"hate\" and \"bigot\". They may work great for trying to paint someone in a really bad light when you don't like them, but they are such 'eye-of-the-beholder' type terms that they really don't qualify as much more than rhetoric when it's all said and done. And again, I am not saying this was not a \"hate-piece\", whatever the heck that means. Or that it was ONLY a moralistic stance, but nevertheless, a moralistic stance, it was.\n \n Also, I didn't say \"hatred\" could not be culturally learned. I was taking issue with the claim that \"hatred\" (or actually, homophobia, as originally stated I believe) doesn't come from no-where--the idea that it essentially can't exist in an ideological vacuum. In fact, it very well may--the idea that it can only come from social influence is very much of a behavioralist model way of thinking, which has been altered greatly in terms of prominence in recent years with what we've discovered in the field of genetics. Behavioralism is still a factor of course, but there are likely other factors as well that shape peoples' behaviors. You say it's culturally learned, but then you indicate it's human nature. I have no problem with the idea that a letter like this could send someone over the edge. But they shouldn't have been at the edge to begin with, and that's really the greatest concern I have over this paranoia people seem to have toward things like this letter; I'd much rather see that indignation spent over keeping people accountable for the actions of harm gays, rather than trying to sterilize and whitewash things that might influence the public. So regardless of whether the letter was \"hate\" or not (whatever that's supposed to be), the deeper issue here is government taking upon itself to decide that for me. We've somehow gone from teaching personal responsibility and accountability when one hears something that's not right, to trying to spoon-feed people sterilized content. And I don't think that's necessarily a good thing. I don't want a government deciding what I should and shouldn't read--I'm capable of doing that myself, thank you.",

Saying that a particular group is evil is not the same as saying that people should go out and kill members of the group. \n \n The debate over this is similar in some respects to the debate over pornography. Can we blame pornography for the actions of, for example, Ted Bundy? Bundy tried to lay the blame for his horrible murders on the pornography he viewed. I don't buy it. Ted Bundy was responsible for his own actions. \n \n There probably is a line that people sometimes cross with hate speech, in that they directly incite others to engage in violent acts. But unless the incitement to violence is clear and direct, I think we do best to protect the right to free speech, including hate speech.

That's not always true. \n It's not always easy to draw the line between free speech and threats against people or calls to harm people. Sometimes threats or calls to harm are disguised or coded. That's something we as a society have to determine on a case-by-case basis. It's not easy. But it's important, because if we go overboard in punishing speech, we end up denying one of our most important rights, a right that is critical for gay people working for equality. Repression of free speech is more likely to silence us than it is to silence those who hate us, I fear. In the 20th century, state repression of free speech was most often directed against alleged Communists and socialists and other radicals and immigrants and gay people. It was most often directed against anti-war protestors and those who challenged authority. I think that protecting free speech mostly tends to protect us and to advance our movement for equality. On the other hand, if we go overboard in allowing threats and calls for violence, we end up potentially turning a blind eye to speech that leads directly to horrible hate crimes. \n \n This is not an easy line to draw, and Canada has obviously drawn the line differently than the U.S. has. I personally think that we need to use state repression of speech rarely, and only in circumstances where the threats to people or the calls for violence are clear.",

It depends on what exactly the speaker says. Speech calling for violence against gays or blacks or Christians or anyone else probably does cross the line beyond free speech. If someone urges people in a speech to go out and kill gay people, that should not be protected speech. If someone says that gay people are all going to hell, which is the speech of Fred Phelps, that is and should be protected free speech in the United States. If someone says that gay people are vile sinners, that also is and should be protected speech, in my view, in the United States. The difference is that in the first example, the speaker is calling on people to kill gay people, whereas in the latter examples, the speaker is simply denouncing gay people, which is different. All of these are examples of hate speech. Some hate speech crosses the line and becomes an incitement to violence, while other hate speech does not cross that line, in my view.",

   "Well, I agreed with most of this, and then you wrote that line about \"speech that would indicate it's ok to put forth violent action against gays,\" and I would have to say no, that's probably not okay. It depends on what exactly the speaker says. Speech calling for violence against gays or blacks or Christians or anyone else probably does cross the line beyond free speech.\n\n I've had this thought for some time throughout this discussion, and I think I'll piggy-back it off of your response here. The general claim of some has been that speech that advocates, or is likely to lead to, violence is not (and should not) be tolerated (in the sense that government should step in). But what if someone were to write an op-ed arguing that the United States should use a pre-emptive military strike against, say, Iran. Certainly this is advocating violence, and depending on who the author is might actually lead toward the performance of said violence; yet this seems to clearly be speech that may not be suppressed. Here is a case (I believe) where violence is clearly being advocated, but may not be suppressed. So, if we are going to suppress speech, it seems to me that it cannot be merely because it advocates violence.\n \n I'm interested to see how various folks would make the distinction. Would this be different than what we have been discussing? If so, why; if not, why not?",

Would this be different than what we have been discussing? If so, why; if not, why not?\n\n \n Good question, and this kind of example is why I said \"probably\" in my post rather than definitely. Your example illustrates the importance of context in efforts to draw the line between free speech and an illegal threat or illegal incitement to violence. If someone in the United States were to make speeches calling on his or her followers to go out and blow up the White House, we would probably regard that differently than someone calling for a U.S. invasion of Iran. Obviously we collectively do not regard advocating U.S. military action as illegal speech. We also collectively don't regard U.S. military action as illegal violence, though some Americans see it that way. We don't throw troops in jail for shooting the enemy in combat. We draw a distinction between acceptable and legal violence and unacceptable and illegal violence. But speech advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government or advocating attacks on U.S. institutions may fall into a different category, again depending on what the person says. \n \n When the Supreme Court in the Schenck case laid out the \"clear and present danger\" test, they allowed the executive branch and the Congress wide leeway to suppress speech that elected leaders claimed constituted a \"clear and present danger.\" People who opposed World War I were jailed for speech critical of the U.S. government, and the Supreme Court permitted this despite the first amendment. In the 1950s, Communists were repressed and jailed because Communist doctrine called for the violent overthrow of the U.S. government, and government leaders believed that Communists posed a \"clear and present danger.\" In more recent decades the Supreme Court has adopted a narrower view of what constitutes a \"clear and present danger.\" The danger, the threat, has to be real, not merely philosophical, and the danger has to be immediate, not in some distant imagined future. In the case of Brandenburg v. Ohio, the Court essentially replaced the \"clear and present danger\" test with the \"direct incitement test.\" The U.S. Supreme Court has thus moved in the direction of protecting free speech under the first amendment and narrowing the power of government to restrict speech in the interest of national security.",

The Court then adopted a broad understanding of \"fighting words.\" Over time, the Court has limited the scope of unprotected \"fighting words,\" thus protecting more speech from government abridgement.

St. Paul in 1992 narrowed the scope of unprotected \"fighting words\" and provided for greater freedom of expression for unpopular, some would argue hateful, ideas.",

This case involved a man named Brandenburg, a Ku Klux Klan member, who was convicted of violating Ohio's criminal syndicalism law. Here is a link to the Oyez website's description of the case, and a quotation from the website about the ruling:\n \n http://www.oyez.org/cases/1960-1969/1968/1968_492/\n \n \"The Court's Per Curiam opinion held that the Ohio law violated Brandenburg's right to free speech. The Court used a two-pronged test to evaluate speech acts: (1) speech can be prohibited if it is \"directed at inciting or producing imminent lawless action\" and (2) it is \"likely to incite or produce such action.\" The criminal syndicalism act made illegal the advocacy and teaching of doctrines while ignoring whether or not that advocacy and teaching would actually incite imminent lawless action. The failure to make this distinction rendered the law overly broad and in violation of the Constitution.\"",

In fact, that extremist op-ed would -- and rightly so -- never get published, because it would incitement to a crime, as well as plain obnoxious. No matter that I despise Bush and everything he stands for, there are legitimate and illegitimate courses of action with respect to him.\n \n It really isn't much different when some bigot demands all possible actions against gays, it's just more generic.",

   "I think it's interesting that opponents of free speech in this case (and yes, that's the bottom line here)\n\n \n Sorry, but restricting incitement to violence is not opposing freedom of speech. no-one has argued against preventing the sort of anti-gay hate speech we see on this forum, for example.\n \n \nare jumping to the most far-reaching examples possible to make their point--such as \"That doesn't mean that freedom has to be absolute without any reasonable restrictions whatever.\" \n \n \n If you want to reply to me, at least have the courtesy of linking to my post so people can see the whole argument rather than just the quote you decide to select.\n \n \nI for one haven't seen a soul argue for that; this isn't about yelling fire in a crowd.\n \n \n Yes, I realise you have a blind spot about anti-gay hate speech.\n \n \nI mean, geez, it's not like anyone's arguing for rhetorical anarchy here. emoticon_rolleyes Yeah, free speech means you may have to put up with having to hear something that's offensive to you. It may even mean having to hear something that many people find offensive. Tough noogies. That's part of having freedom--it's easy when you are hearing things you like, where it's harder is when you have to hear things you don't like.\n \n \n Listen, my dear, this isn't about being called nasty names by nasty Christians. That, I don't care about. Christians can preach homophobia till kingdom come for all I care, it won't make a bit of difference, because society is moving on.\n \n What concerns me is the incitement to violence, but of course, you just carefully look the other way when those come along.",
