Thanks George.\nI think it was due to the multiple nature, the security threat didn't rise after the initial London car bombs, it was only when there was another attack in a different place over 24 hours later that they decided there may well be a potential spate of bombings and to put up the level. Normally I agree that people's reactions are wrong: the longer since an attack the more complacent we get, yet the safest time is probably immediately after one. This time, however, I think a raising of security worldwide was sensible.\n \n Oh and I agree with the amateurness of this one, obviously all the clever terrorists have blown themselves up already, so they're resorting to the ones who failed the entrance exam first time round.\n \n Then again of course it could all be a government conspiracy to keep us scared.... emoticon_wow emoticon_ic emoticon_confused",

And also respond to this summery of what islam stands for if you can.\n \n http://www.cfr.org/publication/11546/muslims_complicity_with_violence.html\n \n Muslims' Complicity With Violence\n Author: \n Max Boot, Senior Fellow for National Security Studies\n September 27, 2006\n Los Angeles Times\n Ever since 9/11, a dark view of Islam has been gaining currency on what might be called the Western street. This view holds that, contrary to the protestations of our political leaders-who claim that acts of terrorism are being carried out by a minority of extremists-the real problem lies with Islam itself. In this interpretation, Islam is not a religion of peace but of war, and its 1.2 billion adherents will never rest until all of humanity is either converted, subjugated or simply annihilated.\n Is the war on terrorism really a \"clash of civilizations\"? The overreaction to Pope Benedict XVI's relatively innocuous remarks at the University of Regensburg on Sept. 12 would seem to lend weight to this alarming notion.\n As part of a plea for combining reason with religion, the pope cited a 14th century Byzantine emperor who condemned Muhammad's teachings as \"evil and inhuman\" because of \"his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.\" The pope subsequently made clear that these were not his own views, but this did not stop an explosion of animosity across the Muslim world. Amid calls from angry clerics to \"hunt down\" the holy father (a.k.a. \"the dog of Rome\" and the \"worshiper of the cross\"), various hotheads have taken to the streets and attacked Christian churches. This recalls the over-the-top outcry this year after a Danish newspaper dared to print cartoons depicting Muhammad as an instigator of violence.\n Muslim spokesmen claim that these are unconscionable slurs. Yet, while demanding respect for their own religion, too many Muslims accord too little respect to competing faiths or even to competing brands of their own faith.\n Where are the demonstrations in the Muslim street when the president of Iran denies the Holocaust and calls for the destruction of Israel? Or when Palestinian kidnappers force two Western journalists to convert to Islam at gunpoint? Or when Sunni terrorists in Iraq bomb Shiite mosques and slaughter hundreds of worshipers? All too many Islamic leaders prefer to harp on the supposed sins of the \"infidels,\" however exaggerated or even fictionalized (no, the CIA didn't bomb the World Trade Center to create an excuse for invading Afghanistan), rather than focusing on the problems within their own umma (community).\n And yet it would be a mistake to conclude that the woes of Islamic society today, serious as they are, are endemic to the religion itself.\n It is true that, alone of the world's major faiths, Islam was founded by a prophet who used force to win converts. \"I was ordered to fight all men until they say, 'There is no god but Allah,' \" Muhammad proclaimed in his farewell address to his followers in AD 632.\n Countless Muslims since then have followed the path of jihad-literally, \"exertion in the path of Allah\" but usually taken as an injunction for waging holy war. But countless Muslims also have been willing to trade with unbelievers, to live peaceably alongside them, to learn from them and even to enter into military alliances with them against Muslim rivals.\n Religions are not monolithic. They have no fixed, eternal identity. Until the 18th century, Christianity was a militant faith whose adherents did not hesitate to kill \"heathens.\" Throughout the Middle Ages, Islamic states usually offered greater tolerance to religious minorities and were more open to secular learning than their Christian neighbors.\n Even now, most Muslim countries-from Senegal to Indonesia-are far more pluralistic and much less fundamentalist than Iran or Saudi Arabia. And even in the most militant Muslim societies, clerics are able to maintain a rigid orthodoxy only by force. Left to their own devices, the Saudi or Iranian people would opt for a less monastic existence-a danger that the guardians of official morality are keenly aware of.\n The real enemy we face is not Islam per se but a violent offshoot known as Islamism, which is rooted, to be sure, in the Koran but which also finds inspiration in such modern Western ideologies as fascism, Nazism and communism. Its most successful exponents-from Hassan Banna and Sayyid Qutb to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and Osama bin Laden-are hardly orthodox interpreters of Islam. They are power-mad intellectuals in the mold of a Lenin or a Hitler. The problem is that the rest of the Muslim world, by not doing more to curb the radicals-whether out of fear or sympathy-lends credence to the most objectionable caricatures of their faith.\n \n Again, Islam was founded on violence, Christianity wasn't. To blame the founder of Christianity for the sins of men with personal agendas is very different than the ongoing violence of a religious cult that was founded on violence by the founder of islam.",

   "That is not accurate. Depending upon which terrorist group one cares to listen to, they have also demanded that we all convert to Islam, institute Sharia law, let them destroy Israel, etc.\n \n They want to kill anyone who doesn't subscribe to their particular beliefs. That is why you have Sunnis killing Shiites, Shiites killing Sunnis, and both of them killing Kurds and Druses. All four are sects of Islam. They have been killing each other since before George Washington was a zygote. It has nothing to do with the U.S. and everything to do with fanaticism.\n\n \n BS on all counts. You see about the same proportion of muslims arguing for the genocide of non muslims that you see of christians arguing for the death of all muslims. I spend about an equal amount of time on arabic language boards as I do on english boards, and regardless of the language being spoken, you see exaclty the same kinds of thing on both boards. Occasionally I am tempted to introduce folks like Archangel to their muslim counterparts because they are both exactly the same kind of folks. They even use the same pathetic tactics.\n \n This is something that Americans seem to miss. When you see coverage of whatever lunatic fringe muslim cleric calling for the demise of the non muslim world, that is getting coverage BECAUSE it is the lunatic fringe. \n \n Frankly, I expect this to be lost on you. The last paragraph of your post pretty well illustrates that you have absolutly no idea what you are talking about. Kurds do not have their own sect of islam. \"Kurd\" is its own ethnic identity assinged to people from Kurdistan. About 90% of Kurds are Sunnis. They are Indo-Europeans, similar to Persians. \n \n Your statement is akin to claiming that the difference between Mexicans and Canadians is a religous one rather than an ethic/racial one.",

I've never read anything so blatantly bigoted and inaccurate. Check this out.\n \n http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2002/issue3/jv6n3a3.html\n \nWhile economic development theorists generally hold that security is a prerequisite for economic growth, Israel's war-torn history has not prevented it from creating a strong, modern, and diversified economy, one which rivals European countries instead of its neighbors in the region. This article considers the factors that allowed for Israel to succeed economically despite its persistently poor security situation. It specifically cites the importance of the location and type of violence Israel has faced, the consistent arrival of highly educated immigrants, the influx of foreign capital driven by political motives, and the development of a robust domestic military-industrial complex. \n \n Since independence in May 1948, Israel has fought six wars, two intifadas, a continuing terrorism threat, an economic boycott, and intermittent diplomatic isolation. It is currently in a formal state of war with two of its neighbors (Syria and Lebanon) and has only a cool peace with the other two (Jordan and Egypt), despite peace treaties. In effect, all of its land borders are relatively closed to trade. More generally, it is an outcast in the Middle East, deprived of any opportunity to benefit from the commerce generated by regional oil wealth but having to bear the costs of living in a neighborhood characterized by arms races and instability.\n \n Nonetheless, Israel has a strong, modern, and diversified economy that in 2000 posted an annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of $104.1 billion, 40 percent of which consisted of exports of goods and services. Growth for 2000 reached six percent.(1) Israel's per capita Gross National Income (GNI) for 2000, at almost $17,000, placed the state ahead of Spain, Portugal, Greece, and New Zealand.(2) No longer classified as a \"developing country\" by the World Bank, 54-year-old Israel now ranks as a high-income economy and was identified as one of the most global emerging markets by Foreign Policy magazine's Globalization Index.(3) Over the past decade, Israel's high-technology industry, second only to California's Silicon Valley in concentration of firms, powered economic growth and attracted massive Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to the country, a figure that reached $4.4 billion in 2000.(4)\n \n Israel today ranks third in the world in the number of university graduates per capita, after the United States and the Netherlands.(5) It possesses the highest per capita number of scientists in the world, with 135 for every 10,000 citizens (compared to 85 per 10,000 in the United States),(6) and publishes the highest number of scientific papers per capita.(7) According to one recent survey, almost 81 percent of Israelis own cell phones, placing it sixth in the world. Another survey found that 54 percent of Israelis own personal computers, in comparison to only 42 percent of U.S. respondents.(8)\n\n \n \nDoes Bin Laden count?\n \n http://www.guardian.co.uk/alqaida/story/0,,1192341,00.html\n \n They offered the Us the same terms.\n \n \n 2 points: 1) check out the Koraish Doctrine. Learned from Mohammed himself. When your enemy is close to destroying you make a peace treaty with him until you can rebuild your forces and utterly destroy. In other words, a peace offer from Ossama is nothing more than a delaying tactic.\n \n And B) Did you read the article, because it specifically say's the same offer wasn't made to the US. \n \n \nWere you in a coma for the shock and awe campaign? The very firs bomb we dropped in Iraq was on a busy diner in downtown Baghdad during the luch rush because we thought Saddam might have been there.

   "Got any evidence of that ? Because the only attacks on Arab Countries Israel has ever done were to take out Nuclear programs. And that was a defensive act. Every other land grab they've accomplished was due to thwarting an unprovoked invasion. \n\n \n Do you even know where the middle east IS? We are talking abou the country that invaded and occupied lebanon for years, then RE-INVADED last year and is STILL holding thousands of lebanese citizen that it captured in cross border raids. We are talking about the country that pulled a surprise attack 2 days after Johnson brokered a peace deal. Nobody has tried to invade israel since 1948.\n \n \nAnother lie, beside that, would you believe an enemy who has broken every treaty they have ever made with you ? And how do you have the audacity to say every Nation in the Middle East has offered Israel normalized relations for land returns when all except Egypt and Jordan refuse to even recognize Israel's right to exist ? \n\n \n Why do you feel compelled to come here and debate something that you obviously know nothing at all about? Are you a plant....purposefully making foolish statements in order to make the religous right look like a bunch of absolute XXXXXX? If so, please PM me so I don't waste my leisure time on this garbage.\n \n http://newsblaze.com/story/20061016000334nnnn.nb/topstory.html\n \n \nIn an effort to jumpstart the peace process, Saudi Arabia has resurrected the idea of negotiating with Israel on the basis of a formula outlined by then Crown Prince Abdullah in 2002. Abdullah's ideas were revised and adopted by the Arab League as a peace initiative that offered Israel \"normal relations\" in exchange for a withdrawal to the 1967 borders and resolution of the Palestinian refugee issue. \n\n \n That as been on the table for israel in one form or another for the last coupld of decades. What has been the primary sticking point has been that israel wants to keep the land that is considered vital to their security, which happens to be all the land with water. They know full well that nobody is ever going to accept that...if they keep all the water and all the agricultural land what they are giving back is just the uninhabitable parts.\n \n Following Israels humiliating defeat in lebanon, it looks like they are considering capitulating:\n \n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,279384,00.html\n \n \nJERUSALEM - Israel sent secret messages to Syria recently signaling willingness to give up the captured Golan Heights in return for a peace deal that would require Syria to distance itself from Iran, an Israeli newspaper reported Friday.\n \n Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had German and Turkish diplomats relay to Syrian President Bashar Assad that Israel is willing to hold direct peace negotiations and give up the strategic plateau, seized in the 1967 Mideast war, the Yediot Ahronot daily said, quoting officials close to Olmert.\n\n \n The Golan heights have always been a major sticking point for Israel because it is of enormous strategic importance. It seems that the debacle in Iraq has shown Israel that the US may not be able to protect them, and their defeat in lebanon has shown that they cannot protect themselves effectively. \n \n \nI see now, so Israel had their own suicide bombers blowing up their own citizens going back 50 years in order to garner sympathy. I've never read anything so blatantly bigoted and inaccurate. Check this out.\n\n \n Not going to touch that strawman with a 10 ft pole. Search here. We have been over this before. It is a simple matter of economics and simple math. Subtract Us aid from the Israeli economy, Israel cannot afford to even feed their people. \n \n \n \n2 points: 1) check out the Koraish Doctrine. Learned from Mohammed himself. When your enemy is close to destroying you make a peace treaty with him until you can rebuild your forces and utterly destroy. In other words, a peace offer from Ossama is nothing more than a delaying tactic.\n\n \n BS. We have neve been close to destroying Al Queda. They are stronger and better funded than ever. There is an interesting article at the American Conservative about this. IT is by Michael Scheuer, the guy who originally designed our rendition system and headed the Bin Laden Unit at the CIA. He has been called the worlds foremost expert on Al Queda...and with good reason. \n \n http://www.amconmag.com/2007/2007_05_21/article1.html\n \n \nSo al-Qaeda got out of Afghanistan in good shape and with little need to regroup, if regrouping is defined, as it has been by U.S. officials, as a thoroughly defeated military force trying to pull its fractured pieces back together. Al-Qaeda simply moved from one safe haven to another-from Afghanistan to Pakistan's Pashtun-dominated border provinces. From there, with the Taliban, it began to plot the reconquest of Afghanistan. Sayf al-Adl, then al-Qaeda's military commander, has written that bin Laden, Mullah Omar, and company concluded that it would take about seven years to re-establish Taliban rule. Al-Qaeda made its plans on that timetable and sent many of its insurgent fighters home to rest until they were needed. Far from regrouping, al-Qaeda decided to disperse and wait. Al-Adl adds that many of these fighters were in tears when they learned they would not immediately fight the U.S. military. Presumably their tears have now turned to grins. \n \n Beyond failing to defeat or even permanently impair al-Qaeda Central-the forces commanded by bin Laden and al-Zawahiri-we now confront a substantial number of al-Qaeda franchises, 29 of whom have publicly declared their presence in such places as Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Egypt. \n \n\n \n \nOur political and military leaders have swallowed the theory that al-Qaeda is a \"terrorist group,\" so they believe, and have told Americans, that by fighting al-Qaeda on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq, they are preventing attacks in the United States. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but, as Jefferson once said, \"The moment a person forms a theory, his imagination sees in every object only the traits that favor that theory.\" \n \n The al-Qaeda forces we are fighting in those two countries are the group's insurgent forces, not its \"special forces\" -those that attacked Washington and New York on 9/11. As noted, those forces left Afghanistan before the U.S. Marines landed and have been planning new attacks since then in Pakistan's border provinces, Saudi Arabia, Britain, and other secure locations in Europe, across the Muslim world, and perhaps even in the United States and Canada. \n\n \n The article is a good one to read. He does a good job of explaing why the \"fight them there or fight them here\" mentality is 100% incorrect (not that anybody with even marginal intelligence could have bought that one to begin with). \n \n The problem is that most Americans had no idea who Bin Laden was or what Al queda was prior to 9/11, and now their entire education on the matter is basically nothing but a series of sound bytes. This serves our politicians well because it means that people fail to see that we have handed AQ one victory after another until we have reached the point that victory may well be permanently beyond our grasp. \n \n \nAnd B) Did you read the article, because it specifically say's the same offer wasn't made to the US. \n\n \n sorry, linked the wrong offer:\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/01/19/binladen.tape/index.html\n \n \n\"In response to the substance of the polls in the U.S., which indicate that Americans do not want to fight Muslims on Muslim land, nor do they want Muslims to fight them on their land, we do not mind offering a long-term truce based on just conditions that we will stick to.\n \n \"We are a nation that God banned from lying and stabbing others in the back. Hence, both parties of the truce will enjoy stability and security to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan, which were destroyed by war.\n \n \"There is no problem in this solution, but it will prevent hundreds of billions from going to influential people and warlords in America -- those who supported Bush's electoral campaign. And from this, we can understand Bush and his gang's insistence on continuing the war,\" bin Laden said. \n\n \n http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=18136\n \n \nAmericans want peace\n \n \"We know that the majority of your people want this war to end and opinion polls show the Americans do not want to fight the Muslims on Muslim land, nor do they want Muslims to fight them on their [US] land. \n \n \"But Bush does not want this and claims that it is better to fight his enemies on their land rather than on American land.\n \n \"Bush tried to ignore the polls that demanded that he end the war in Iraq.\n \n \"We are getting increasingly stronger while your situation is getting from bad to worse,\" he told the US, referring to poor US troop morale and the huge economic losses inflicted by the war.\n \n \"The war in Iraq is raging and the operations in Afghanistan are increasing.\"\n\n \n You know, there is a page at WWW.google.com that allows you to search the internet for information like this. If you tried using it before you made your ludicrous claims, it would save you the embaressment of being constantly wrong.\n \n \nNo I wasn't in a coma, I just wasn't watching pro radical propaganda. How do you insist our dropping the very first bombs at high noon lunch rush when we attacked at night in Baghdad using our stealth fighters ? We hit his favorite restaurant, true. But it wasn't for lunch. And we hit his Palace, 300 foot deep bunker and his top Generals homes. Do you have a problem with actually trying to cut the head off the beast to end the War quickly ?\n\n \n My sole interest in the invasion of Iraq was the tactical situation. Since I knew absolutly that the invasion had NOTHING to do with WMDs or the war on terror, the tactical side was the only interesting part.\n \n Once again, you are WRONG. The opening shot of the Iraq war came when the Us dropped 2 2000 lb bombs on a baghdad cafe in the middle of the luch rush. We were immediatly told that this was not the start of our shock and awe campaign, but rather they had taken it as a target of opportunity because they had reason to believe that Saddam Hussein was meeting with many of his senior advisors there. The problem with that is that the place was a dive. There is no possible way that Saddam Hussein woud have been eating there. In the US it is what we would consider a greasy spoon kind of place. \n \n Months later it became apparent that the Bush administration was buying intel from Chalibi and the INC, despite the fact that even our own intel agencies were saying that they were unreliable and they had no resources that were actually in Iraq...they were telling Bush what he wanted to hear so he was listening to them. Given that information, it is pretty clear that the INC, under pressure to provide intel, pretty much just picked a location at random that they did not believe we would have the gall to hit, and then we surprised them by hitting it anyway. \n \n The tactical component there was decisive to the war and frankly I was surprised that the American people did not catch on (though since then my opinion regarding the intelligence of your average american has sunken so low that no amount of stupidity surprises me). Here we have Rumsfeld saying that we would be met as liberators...parades and flowers and statues of Bush in the public square, and at the same time we are dropping bombs on civlian targets in downtown baghdad. From a purely practical standpoint, that was the dumbest move we could possibly have made. Here we are invading a country where we will depend heavily on the population for support in order to keep it from degenerating into s cesspool of violence, and our VERY FIRST move is one that alienated the people. \n \n I don't know if the srchives here go back that far, but on that day I put together a post where I outlined my prediction as far as the course fo the war. It has been 100% correct since day one. The real clincher there was the fact that we learned that Bush personally authorized that attack with the collaboration of Rumsfeld. It became obvious at that point that we were going to have a couple of absolutly delusional XXXXXX with no compuction about killing civilians if it served our purpose micromanaging the war. Once that was clear, there was only one possible outcome.",
