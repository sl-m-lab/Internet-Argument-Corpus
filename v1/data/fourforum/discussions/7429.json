   "Dear Readers\n I recomend a book for you if you are interested. Especially if you are a republican and want a good laugh at the democratic ########. It is J.H Hatfields book called Fortunate Son. The author accuses Bush of dodging the draft during Vietnamn, having a cocaine habit, and having DWI'S. This book is a laugh at the democrats.\n One, the dodge of the draft is not true. Bush did not dodge a draft. Second, he did not have a cocaine addiction or any use to anyones knowledge. However, he did have a DWI, and so that is that. But, my point on suggesting this book is, Why are democrats liars?\n What ever happened to the good old days when people said, \"Ok, if I am elected, I will handle this problem without so and so tkaing place.\" Now a day, it is:\n \"My opponent can not do so and so, his record says he has so and so, and he is a so and so.\"\n Democrats make lies about their opponent to seize power. Now, republicans are not at all innocent. They do the same stuff. But, they should not have to make lies to promote themselves to power. For god sakes. They also have to reveal a DWI incident, and make the other look bad. So what, Bush had a DWI. Lots have them. \n I guess what I am saying, is democrats have to put their opponent party down just to promote themselves to power That is not right.",
