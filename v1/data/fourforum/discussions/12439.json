Just like when the courts established interracial marriage was a right, and that segregation in schools was wrong. It was established.\n\n \n Whether that's true or not, the very fact prop 8 is before the courts IS indicative that the court's role is not \"meaningless\" as Jake said. If it were meaningless, they wouldn't be reviewing it with the power to even overturn the will of the people by striking Prop 8 down. It's getting its day in court. If it's truly a right as you say it is, and so cut and dry, the judiciary will surely rule in your favor, eh? After all, you say judges don't rule on 'whims' but on things far removed from whims like \"equality\". (snicker) So what are you so worried about? ;) By your own claims, Prop 8 will surely be struck down and was never any danger to you.\n \n \nI would love for people like you to spend some time in a universe where it's YOUR rights that are questioned.\n\n \n Our rights are 'questioned' all the time. For example, my right to adequately defend myself is flat out denied in some states because I can't even carry a firearm in some states even though there is a high probability that an accosting criminal will be using one. Our freedom of speech may be questioned or taken away depending on the circumstances. \n \n So again, this all goes back to limits and degree of what a right entails. Marriage is no exception to that.\n \n \nCan you justify why religion, which is obviously a choice, should be protected in this United States?\n\n \n Well there's certainly ample constitutional basis for protecting religion, and IMO considerably more than there for redefining the granting of marriage benefits. I mean, geez, the former has had its own amendment with specific wording since 1791. \n \n \nNow, I believe in the freedom of religion. But at the same time, based on secular arguments, I think religion has a far more tenuous justification for protection than something with a long-standing an irrational prejudice against it, like homosexuality.\n\n \n Since when is justification of constitutionality determined by level of vitriol from opposition? Now THAT'S what I call a 'tenuous'.\n \n \nIt's obviously not your rights that are being questioned, so you being comfortable that my rights are restricted is amusing ... emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n You know, of all arguments you make, this one has to be least effective. It's not like one has to have had an abortion to take a legitimate opinion on pro-choice/pro-life issues. It's not like one has to live in a state that doesn't have carry laws to be able to take a legitimate stance on gun restrictions. If you're amused at the idea of someone taking a position on something they haven't directly had to deal with, then you must be amused at many pro-choicers as well, or many in the gun control lobby. It's not an issue of \"being comfortable\", regarding anything. Gay marriage IS a controversial and debatable issue. \n \n \nAnd they aren't deciding things \"for all of society\".HOW does society actually have to change if gay marriage is legal?\n\n \n Well for one, they would be effectively forcing people to allow the government to grant taxpayer-supported benefits to a new group, when in fact many (most) don't want to do that. \n \n But I didn't use the term \"change\". You did. To decide something for all of society isn't necessarily the same concept as society having to change. Nice try, though.\n \n \nDo people in society have to change their opinions on gay marriage? Do they have to allow gays get married in their churches?\n No.\n\n \n People wouldn't have to 'change' their opinions about guns either, if the government gave full rights to people to carry one to defend themselves. Nor would they have to change their opinions on abortion if law changed one way or the other. This is a distraction you're on--I never said people would have to change their opinions.\n \n \nThis issue is about telling gays what they can and can't do, in order to justify the whims of society. \n\n \n And that's what happens with any group that wants to come along and effectively redefine what constitutes the criteria for getting a given example of benefits from the government. How is it not telling what people in a theater can and can't do by saying they can't yell fire in that crowded theater? \n \n So once again, this all goes back to limits or how far any given right goes, not whether the right is even there to begin with. You know you've had the right to marriage benefits all along by marrying the way that the govt. uses as criteria to get them. You just want to change that criteria, just like any group would be doing if they wanted to come along and also get those benefits. Again, it all goes back to the tenuousness of marriage law to begin with, and as always, I'm once again reminded of the need to take marriage out of government altogether at this point. It's too much the potential for a collosal mess.\n \n \nThe court decides these things on issues that are far removed from just \"whims\".\n\n \n Yeah ... and we all know judges just never rule the wrong way. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "If you looked at the arguments currently before the court, NONE of them really revolve around whether or not gay marriage is a right.\n They revolve around whether or not the proper amendment procedure was used (for example).\n\n \n Yeah, yeah, yeah amendment versus revision. A rather 'loophole'-oriented attempt to get around something, I might add. You'd have done much better I think to just challenge the thing directly. But your point is irrelevant--if the court wants to, it certainly can use this as an opportunity to make sure Prop 8 is not effective. My point still stands .. if you're so sure your position is locked up by constitutionality, then a.) there is no reason you shouldn't have challenged Prop 8 DIRECTLY (as opposed to the revision/amendment thing) and b.) the court would STILL use it to render Prop 8 ineffective because they're so noble in your view that they obviously would do so ... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nIt's rather obvious that you haven't a clue as to what the issue is before the court.\n\n \n It's rather obvious you're missing the point here.\n \n \nblah, blah, blah...\n Not interested.\n We're talking about an entire segment of the population being marginalized.\n Straight couples can marry, but gay couples are forbidden legal recognition.\n\n \n Actually, EVERYONE who doesn't fit the criteria of opposite-gender/state-legal-marrying-age/not-related/has-to-tie-the-knot/whatever-else-there-is is marginalized. That's the problem--this is really about marriage and the fact it's an exclusionary institution, not just gay people.\n \n \nIf it were an issue of CHRISTIANS being forbidden firearms, it would have a comparison.\n\n \n Nah, gays certainly aren't the only \"group\" effected by qualifications to get marriage benefits. The broader example works fine.\n \n \nWhen your marriage rights are being questioned or denied, then I'll take the comparison seriously.\n\n \n Again, one doesn't have to directly experience the effects of an issue to have involvement in the debate. A lot of pro-choicers AND pro-lifers haven't had to deal with not being able to get an abortion, either. Your personal requirements to take peoples' positions seriously are apparently therefore pretty silly, so if you don't take seriously peoples' views based on something like that, it's really your problem and not theirs.\n \n \nCould you persuade people that religion warranted protections in the way it gets today, without assuming them just cause you already have them...\n\n \n It's irrelevant. We don't determine protections based on need--if we did, anyone should be able to claim marriage benefits and avoid things like legal-age laws--after all, 17 year-old could may be able to reasonably say they NEED marriage as much as an 18 year old couple.\n \n \nI just think that there are more reasons for protecting sexual orientation than there are for protecting religion.\n\n \n That may be, but it's really not pertinent here. This isn't an I-need-it-more-than-you pissin@ contest.\n \n \nThe point is that you are rather indifferent to the real impact of the situation upon real people. You are \"comfortable\" with the masses deciding against gay marriage. You are \"comfortable\" with the masses removing a RECOGNIZED RIGHT from gays.\n \n ..... I'm amused with you saying you are COMFORTABLE with the masses deciding gay rights.\n\n \n It seems you're really trying pretty hard to misrepresent what I said. My words were (and I quote): \"Personally, I'm a whole lot more comfortable with something that a least takes the will of the people into consideration rather than just a few oligarchical judges being able to decide things for all of society at their whims.\"\n \n That's not a statement pertaining to comfort of an OUTCOME. It's a statement pertaining to comfort with a PROCESS. Do you get it? I'm saying I'm comfortable with ballot initiatives more so that individual judges being able to make sweeping changes in society, because relying on such judicary power is more oligarchical rather than democratic. At least with a ballot initiative it a.) takes a very significant amount of people to do it, and b.) it at least is likely to reflect the will of the people. My statement was not about comfort with a given outcome. Do understand what I meant now?\n \n \nAt least with \"abortion\" issues the \"pro-lifers\" can talk about DEFENSE OF A LIFE. What do you have in this situation? False claims of impacts upon society, when as I previously demonstrated society IS NOT really impacted at all?\n\n \n Well, that's coming from someone who's inside the bias of your issue. I'm sure plenty of pro-choicers would say pro-lifers are using false claims, and many pro-lifers would say many pro-choicers are using false claims. In reality, it all depends on what you consider important. For religious people, cultural maintaining of the institution of marriage is a high priority. For people pushing gay marriage, changing marriage is the priority. \n \n \nWhy do people think that \"controversy\" is a justification for the issue?\n\n \n No, you aren't getting it. The issue is THERE, regardless of whether justification is even needed or not. What you're saying is like someone demanding justification for the gun control debate, or the abortion debate. It's an issue because it's controversial. The issue is THERE, and so people are going to take sides and sometimes disagree on these matters (which are usually matters of DEGREE, not all-or-nothing issues). No one OWES you justification for having a debate in society. Whether you choose to acknowledge that debate or just stay mad that the debate is there is up to you and you alone, but it really doesn't matter--the debate is there just like any other society-issue that is debatable.\n \n \nMassachusetts has gay marriage.\n Show me ANYBODY there who is \"forced\" to do something they don't want to...\n\n \n They are effectively forced to accept changes to the institution of marriage benefits to be \"openable\" or not, which is an issue we all should have a say in--it's tax-payer funded, after all. I can't help it if it doesn't measure up to whatever stringent standard you have for the word \"force.\" You're using a pounce-on-semantics kind of approach here today. I never said anyone was going to have to do something at gun point or anything to that effect. But when one group does something such as change the institution of marriage, they are basically forcing their views on society. The funny thing is that you never seem to have a problem here if someone argues that Christians are \"forcing\" their religion on society by fighting gay marriage. Yet you cry foul if the approach is used the other way, which basically the same sort of usage. Now why is that not surprising? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nI think this qualifies as an oxymoron.\n\n \n I think it qualifies as you picking some semantic nits.\n \n \nFor a \"you can't yell fire in that crowded theater\", people are ACTUALLY RESTRICTED from doing something.\n\n \n You're not able to seemingly follow the analogy here at all. One is an issue of limits of freedom of speech. The other is an issue of limits on freedom of marriage. There's probably not a right in existence that doesn't have some limits, some more than others. My point is that this is always an issue of limits of the right, NOT whether the rights exist or not.\n \n \nAnd, as previously explained, gay marriage WAS A RECOGNIZED RIGHT.\n It was decided.\n And Prop 8 removed that recognized right.\n\n \n So again, if it's that locked and stocked, then why haven't you directly challenged Prop 8 in terms of violating that right in the courts? If it's that cut and dry, you should have no problem overturning it with one of your never-on-a-whim judges ... \n \n \nOkay.\n I'm outlawing Christian symbology.\n You have the \"freedom of religion\" by using the Jewish symbology.\n Sound good?\n\n \n That analogy would only work if Christians were trying to use something that was Jewish to begin with to the point of even redefining what it is they are wanting. It's like a group of Christians demanding to use a Jewish building and saying they should have equal rights to that building, rather than trying to get their OWN means to assemble. Then even going so far as to saying they shouldn't be separate even though they DO claim themselves as a separate group when it's convenient.\n \n \nThe really funny thing about that is that what REALLY changes if you do that. Straight people lose their straight marriage rights.\n\n \n Now you've read my arguments enough times to know that my view is that both should get access to benefits, straights and gays included. I mean that marriage should be relegated to the religious and cultural sector, and have government assign benefits via CUs for BOTH groups. Why are you arguing over something you ALREADY know I don't hold to?\n \n \nCause there is no real \"mess\" unless you count gay equality as a \"mess\".\n The \"mess\" has been going on for years in Massachusetts.\n\n \n If it were ultimate just about gays, you'd have a point. But it's about marriage being changed which is ultimately broader than that. That's why I'd rather go ahead and avoid a mess. Marriage becomes a open-ended institution if we allow groups to come along and change it anytime.",

   "Yeah, yeah, yeah amendment versus revision. A rather 'loophole'-oriented attempt to get around something, I might add.\n\n Not at all, unless you're saying that the Prop 8 proponents who failed to follow the proper procedure are attempting a \"loophole\".\n Denying the rights of a group should require more than just a measly majority. A federal constitutional amendment requires much more than just 50.1%.\n \n \n \nBut your point is irrelevant--if the court wants to, it certainly can use this as an opportunity to make sure Prop 8 is not effective.\n\n Of course they can do that.\n What you fail to recognize are the REAL REASONS that they have available to achieve that.\n Earlier, you talked about \"If it's truly a right...\"\n This court HAS ALREADY RECOGNIZED it as a right.\n \n You fail to recognize where this amendment appeal situation really lies in the legal world.\n \n \n \nMy point still stands .. if you're so sure your position is locked up by constitutionality, then a.) there is no reason you shouldn't have challenged Prop 8 DIRECTLY (as opposed to the revision/amendment thing) and b.) the court would STILL use it to render Prop 8 ineffective because they're so noble in your view that they obviously would do so ... emoticon_rolleyes\n\n Your point lies down and plays in traffic.\n I'll ask you directly and expect no answer.\n Do you understand the small list of EXISTING reasons that the court is being asked to rule on regarding Prop 8 validity / invalidity?\n \n Over and over again, it's like a situation where Mary's employment eligibility is being decided on her programming skill, her educational background, and her capability to travel.\n And along you come and insist that it's about whether or not Mary has a criminal record.\n Yet you ignore that Mary would never have made it to this point if she had a criminal record. It's already established that Mary has no criminal record.\n And likewise, it has already been established that gay marriage IS A RIGHT.\n \n \n \nIt's rather obvious you're missing the point here.\n\n Jyoshu, the point is that you DO NOT KNOW the point.\n You're making up standards for (supposedly) how we should attack Prop 8.\n Yet you fail to recognize how invalid your standards are in the first place. You aren't presenting legal arguments, and you fail to recognize the true legal status.\n I understand what YOU WANT.\n YOU don't understand that your desire for us to attack Prop 8 according to your wishes is not feasible or legally valid.\n \n \n \nActually, EVERYONE who doesn't fit the criteria of opposite-gender/state-legal-marrying-age/not-related/has-to-tie-the-knot/whatever-else-there-is is marginalized. That's the problem--this is really about marriage and the fact it's an exclusionary institution, not just gay people.\n\n And there are LEGITIMATE STATE INTERESTS for other exclusions.\n What you're doing is like pointing to the mentally insane as an excuse to ignore justification (or lack thereof) for excluding felons from having a gun.\n YES. There are multiple restrictions.\n \n To put it another way, a little over 40 years ago it was \"Actually, EVERYONE who doesn't fit the criteria of opposite-gender/ same race /state-legal-marrying-age/not-related/has-to-tie-the-knot/whatever-else-there-is is marginalized.\"\n That observation is just as meaningless for interracial marriage as your observation is for gay marriage.\n \n \n \nAgain, one doesn't have to directly experience the effects of an issue to have involvement in the debate. A lot of pro-choicers AND pro-lifers haven't had to deal with not being able to get an abortion, either. Your personal requirements to take peoples' positions seriously are apparently therefore pretty silly, so if you don't take seriously peoples' views based on something like that, it's really your problem and not theirs.\n\n For the abortion issue, we have a \"defense of others\" doctrine and an established practice of protecting the rights and lives of the defenseless.\n That reason for involvement is perfectly acceptable and legally recognized.\n \n We're talking about a LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST and how you lack one for involvement.\n Furthermore, the fact that you feel a need to create a false one (this \"society is forced to ...\" nonsense) further demonstrates how you yourself understand you need one, or you wouldn't feel a need to offer that flimsy excuse.\n \n \n \nIt's irrelevant.\n\n Just saying \"no, you can't justify religious protections without relying on the fact that they already exist\" would have sufficed.\n But of course, YOUR protections are not up for question, so you feel \"comfortable\"...\n \n \n \nThat may be, but it's really not pertinent here. This isn't an I-need-it-more-than-you pissin@ contest.\n\n I never said it was.\n I'm just putting your \"comfort\" in the vote of the masses in context.\n \n \n \nIt seems you're really trying pretty hard to misrepresent what I said. My words were (and I quote): \"Personally, I'm a whole lot more comfortable with something that a least takes the will of the people into consideration rather than just a few oligarchical judges being able to decide things for all of society at their whims.\"\n That's not a statement pertaining to comfort of an OUTCOME. It's a statement pertaining to comfort with a PROCESS. Do you get it?\n\n Yes.\n And my point still stands.\n What you fail to recognize is why others DO NOT share your comfort, including our legal system and our founding fathers' system which established the courts as a constitutional check on legislation.\n \n What we have here is two wolves and one sheep voting on what's for dinner.\n You propose that one of the wolves could vote for a vegetarian meal that night. You are \"comfortable\" with the democracy process.\n I say that we should not have the situation where the two wolves and one sheep \"vote\" on the sheep's right to life in the first place.\n \n \n \nI'm saying I'm comfortable with ballot initiatives more so that individual judges being able to make sweeping changes in society, because relying on such judicary power is more oligarchical rather than democratic. At least with a ballot initiative it a.) takes a very significant amount of people to do it, and b.) it at least is likely to reflect the will of the people. My statement was not about comfort with a given outcome. Do understand what I meant now?\n\n I understood what you said when you said it.\n My contention is against your trust in the \"democracy\" on the issue of PEOPLE'S RIGHTS.\n There is a REASON WHY our founding fathers didn't put people's rights up to blind democratic vote.\n There is a REASON WHY our courts have routinely overruled some democratic votes which have removed the rights of the minority group.\n You repeatedly fail to recognize those reasons, and opt for \"democracy\" instead.\n \n \n \nWell, that's coming from someone who's inside the bias of your issue. I'm sure plenty of pro-choicers would say pro-lifers are using false claims, and many pro-lifers would say many pro-choicers are using false claims. In reality, it all depends on what you consider important. For religious people, cultural maintaining of the institution of marriage is a high priority. For people pushing gay marriage, changing marriage is the priority.\n\n Again, you fail to recognize what was said...\n The issue is not \"bias on the issue\" or \"false claims\".\n The issue is this.\n \n IF the \"pro-lifers\" have ANY CHANCE of making abortion illegal, against the already recognized constitutional protections, that chance rests FIRMLY on the issue of the life of the embryo.\n IF the abortion issue had NO issue on \"protection of a life\", they would have no constitutional chance. They would fail in being able to tell women what to do with THEIR bodies, because they lack a LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST for being involved in the first place.\n \n Here, you have no \"protection of a life\" issue.\n You have NO real issue or concern that would LEGITIMIZE your involvement.\n \n You don't like women getting abortions? Tough. It's not your body.\n A \"life\" may be at stake? Then that's cause for interest.\n \n You don't like gays getting legally recognized as married by the state? Tough. It's not your relationship and you have no legitimate reason for butting in in the first place.",

   "No, you aren't getting it. The issue is THERE, regardless of whether justification is even needed or not. What you're saying is like someone demanding justification for the gun control debate, or the abortion debate. It's an issue because it's controversial.\n\n Don't mix the contexts here.\n \"Discussion\" doesn't need a reason. \"Discussion\" doesn't have to be controversial.\n If a group of people thought Obama was the Messiah, they could meet together and agree with each other night long if they wanted to.\n \n GOVERNMENTAL ACTION against people's rights DOES require a justification.\n \n We can \"debate\" gun control all we want, but the government's actions are held to a higher call than just \"controversy\".\n \"Controversial\" doesn't justify squat regarding GOVERNMENTAL action.\n Don't blur that difference, cause it's significant.\n \n Suppose it was \"controversial\" for parents to raise their kids as Christian.

Yet you cry foul if the approach is used the other way, which basically the same sort of usage. Now why is that not surprising? emoticon_rolleyes\n\n Are you seriously incapable of realizing the difference?\n When Christians do as you describe, a CHANGE DOES OCCUR.\n There IS A LIMITATION upon gays and what they can and can't do.\n \n If allowing gay marriage meant that Christians COULD NOT SPEAK OUT against gay marriage, THAT would be force.\n But with Christians involvement preventing gay marriage, that IS A LIMITATION upon them.\n \n By your approach, you wouldn't accept that Rosa Parks was \"forced\" to sit in the back of the bus, but when the law mandates that she has to be able to sit where she wants to, the people who don't like that are somehow \"forced\"...\n \n \n \nI think it qualifies as you picking some semantic nits.\n\n Then you should have no problem coming up with analogous situations where a group which wishes to impose governmental discrimination is somehow \"forced\" just because the government does not discriminate.\n \n \n \nYou're not able to seemingly follow the analogy here at all.\n\n No. I follow it.\n I'm just pointing out UNIVERSAL TRUTHS that apply even to your attempted use of analogies.\n \n \n \nOne is an issue of limits of freedom of speech. The other is an issue of limits on freedom of marriage. There's probably not a right in existence that doesn't have some limits, some more than others. My point is that this is always an issue of limits of the right, NOT whether the rights exist or not.\n\n Jyoshu, THINK.\n I have no problem acknowledging that rights have limits.\n But as I have repeatedly explained to you in the past, those limits on rights require LEGITIMATE STATE INTERESTS before they can be imposed.\n For shouting fire in a theater, there IS a legitimate state interest in public safety. People could get trampled in the panic for exiting the theater.\n Do you know WHAT LAW RESTRICTS shouting fire in a theater? Do you know what police would charge that person with?\n \n \n \nSo again, if it's that locked and stocked, then why haven't you directly challenged Prop 8 in terms of violating that right? If it's that cut and dry, you should have no problem overturning it ...\n\n Again, you demonstrate you don't understand the legal situation.\n Can you comprehend THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED with the LAW version of Prop 8?\n That is EXACTLY what happened when the court ruled that the LAW version of Prop 8 was unconstitutional.\n \n And note the end word there. UNCONSTITUTIONAL.\n (is anything starting to click here????)\n They ruled it was an UNCONSTITUTIONAL violation of rights.\n \n Now when the people CHANGE the constitution, can you comprehend how them CHANGING the constitution to say \"not a right\" suddenly can make it \"constitutional\"?\n \n I just have to ask again.\n Do you have ANY clue as to what the ACTUAL legal arguments against Prop 8 ACTUALLY are?\n Cause you're pretending to tell us how to challenge it, with this nonsense approach that misses the obvious.\n \n \n \nThat analogy would only work if Christians were trying to use something that was Jewish to begin with to the point of even redefining what it is they are wanting.\n\n Oh jyoshu, jyoshu, jyoshu, jyoshu, jyoshu! \n The GOVERNMENTAL RECOGNITION of marriage IS NOT something that Christians own...\n \n Your reply is meaningless, and it shows an absurd arrogance in pretending Christian control / ownership of a governmental right.\n \n \n \nNow you've read my arguments enough times to know that my view is that both should get access to benefits, straights and gays included.

It's like a board of directors trying to change company policy that guarantees 2 hour water breaks by employees, but with one of the board members objecting on the basis of saying \"but the company policy says you can't restrict employees' water breaks.\" It's using the rule that IS being changed to argue against it being changed.

Now you're saying that, to oppose it on the basis of unconstitutionality, is not legally valid!! You keep demanding ME to tell you the legal issue of Prop 8, when YOU'RE the one who has said it violates the fact that gay marriage has been claimed as a legal right!

But it's an acceptable and legal process. Frankly, it's like you're mad at someone for saying they're comfortable with the process the government uses to create a bill just because you don't like the bill itself. I'll say it again ... it's funny how the only time we ever hear all this outrage over the particular process of ballot initiatives is when one doesn't go your way. If you think people should be so UN-comfortable with the process of ballot initiatives, one would think it would be a priority of yours to fight against that particular part of process. We hear all this outrage that ballot initiaves are so unfair when they target a supposed 'right', yet no attempts to limit it to non-RIGHTS issues, that I know of in CA. When you put it to action and start putting your 'money where your mouth is' so-to-speak, you'll be able to be taken a little more seriously on this whole ballot initiative outrage thing. Obviously it's not THAT big a deal to you all if no one's even taking up the issue.\n \n \nI never said it was.\n I'm just putting your \"comfort\" in the vote of the masses in context.\n\n \n No, you're really just misrepresenting what I said, because my statement of comfort was one of saying I'm MORE comfortable than the alternative, which involves a far LESS number of people deciding the rights of society at large.

Regardless, you're conflating things here; Prop 8 doesn't impose government--it REMOVES the basis for saying government can't be imposed for a GIVEN situation (in this case, marriage, by defining it as being between a man and a woman).\n \n \n\"tax-payer funded\".\n Don't you mean to say that MY TAXES are going to pay for HETEROSEXUAL MARRIAGES when I am denied marriage to my partner?\n \n Jyoshu, this is just plain common sense.\n You want to use the word \"force\" and its absurd.\n I could claim (by your approach) \"I am forced to accept the government protecting religious freedom.\"\n \n\n \n With that logic, a healthy fully capable 25 year old could say that his taxes are going to fund social security (a benefit he might never reach if he doesn't live that long) or disability and demand he get the benefit as well.\n \n Society and its institutions belong to ALL of us, not just one group wanting to broaden marriage. You're effectively expecting people to accept what YOU want as the status quo in terms of its institutions. It would be like expecting people to just go along with the idea of 17 year olds marrying--effectively forcing people (who think an 18 year old age minimum is best) to go along with it.

It's a completely unreasonable basis of objection.\n\n It's funny how you try to point that out to me.\n What you just said is something YOU need to apply to YOUR statement as for how you think gay marriage activists should proceed.\n What you just said proves YOUR statement not feasible.\n \n And no. I am not \"trying to argue against the change of a rule using the rule itself\".\n You quote ONE SENTENCE and completely misrepresent what I was actually saying. Sun must have risen in the east...\n \n I am simply acknowledging WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.\n Gay marriage was a RECOGNIZED RIGHT.\n And the vote took it away.\n I challenge you to QUOTE ME as to what I actually said which was \"trying to argue against the change of a rule using the rule itself\"...\n \n \n \nWell now, you're the one who has emphatically asserted that Prop 8 is unconstitutional (Foundit: \"It's be determined gay marriage is a RIGHT\".)\n\n Either you accidentally chopped an \"en\" from that \"be\" =< \"It's been determined...\", or else I forgot it.\n Either way, your interpretation is ridiculously inaccurate.\n It HAS BEEN DETERMINED that gay marriage is a right. That is a fact.\n \n The fact that Prop 8 could CHANGE that does not mean it's \"unconstitutional\".\n It's amusing to watch you try to pretend I said something was \"unconstitutional\" when you can't even quote me saying \"unconstitutional\"...\n \n \n \nNo, I'm well aware of the arguments about the ballot-initiaves-and-rights thing.\n\n You're proving that claim ridiculously false.\n You can't even comprehend what I have been saying!\n \n \n \nBut it's an acceptable and legal process.\n\n There are TWO legal processes for modifying the constitution, depending upon the scope and nature of the change.\n If the anti-gay marriage proponents used the WRONG method, then their approach is NOT \"acceptable\".\n \n \n \nFrankly, it's like you're mad ...\n\n Quit fantasizing about emotional reactions and address what was said. My arguments have nothing to do with emotion.\n \n \n \nI'll say it again ... it's funny how the only time we ever hear all this outrage over the particular process of ballot initiatives is when one doesn't go your way.\n\n When the Loving couple complained in Loving v Virginia, it's funny that they had \"outrage\" cause they \"didn't get their way\"...\n You keep ignoring the REAL arguments being put forth for this absurd assessment.\n Maybe I should just start summarizing your position as \"Jyoshu is mad that gays can get equal rights and he doesn't get to discriminate against them\".\n If you won't trouble yourself to be intellectually honest in your approach, why should I treat you like you are?\n \n \n \nIf you think people should be so UN-comfortable with the process of ballot initiatives, one would think it would be a priority of yours to fight against that particular part of process.\n\n How many times have you raised this absurd red herring?\n \n I can easily turn this around. During Loving v Virginia times, our society didn't want interracial marriage by a margin of 3 to 1.\n Suppose they put forth an amendment to the constitution, making not only this segregation but other segregation legal.\n Would you have no problem with that?\n \n \n \nWe hear all this outrage that ballot initiaves are so unfair when they target a supposed 'right'...\n\n This is part of the reason I keep pointing out that gay marriage WAS RECOGNIZED as a right.\n There is no \"supposed\" about it.\n \n \n \n... yet no attempts to limit it to non-RIGHTS issues, that I know of in CA. When you put it to action and start putting your 'money where your mouth is' so-to-speak, you'll be able to be taken a little more seriously on this whole ballot initiative outrage thing. Obviously it's not THAT big a deal to you all if no one's even taking up the issue.\n\n Man-oh-man-oh-man-oh-MAN!\n If one were to take your refusal to recognize what is discussed with you seriously, it would be frustrating.\n Instead, I just have to laugh.\n \n As it has already been pointed out REPEATEDLY, this is what the \"amendment vs revision\" issue is truly about.\n It shows that it IS a big enough deal to require those extra requirements and super-majority vote.\n \n For some reason, you think there is an argument in that people don't want to make it impossible, instead of just very, very hard.\n By that mentality, it must not be a big deal for you in that you think Christianity is \"stigmatized\" cause you obviously won't take any legal action to stop it...\n \n \n \nNo, you're really just misrepresenting what I said, because my statement of comfort was one of saying I'm MORE comfortable than the alternative, which involves a far LESS number of people deciding the rights of society at large. At least with ballot initiatives, it's not just a few people which is an oligarchical situation.\n\n I explicitly quote you as saying \"more comfortable\", and then I'm accused of \"misrepresenting\" you...\n My mind boggles as to how you think what you just said is true...\n \n \n \nAnd if it's so unconstitutional, the court can over-rule it in this case too. Again, if it's so cut and dry as you think it is, then you've got nuttin' to worry 'bout. emoticon_smile\n\n Yeah. It's official.\n You're talking out both sides of your mouth, and thoroughly ignoring what I'm saying.\n WHERE did I argue Prop 8 was \"unconstitutional\"???\n \n \n \n17 year olds aren't your relationship, either, but you discriminate against them by not redefining marriage to include them. There's no real case to say there's a legitimate state interest of discriminating against 17-year-olds over 18 year-olds. The lines have to be drawn somewhere, in marriage, or else it might as well be wide-open to anything.\n\n By that mentality, interracial marriage would still be illegal.\n After all, \"the line has to be drawn somewhere\"...\n \n The real heart of the matter is that YOU want to draw the line where YOU want to draw it, and the justification is unnecessary for removal of rights.\n My position is I present a LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST for where the line is drawn, and you turn around and ignore my arguments for the legitimate state interests.\n YOU draw a line to include interracial marriage, and you ignore what you're doing.\n I draw a line INCLUDING gay marriage, and you automatically pretend that has to mean any other form is included...\n Again, the mind boggles at the illogical nature of it all...\n \n And the legitimate state interest for an age requirement for marriage has been repeatedly explained.\n Quibbling over the LOCATION of the line is not the same thing as REFUTING THE LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST of the EXISTENCE of the line.\n \n \n \nRegardless, you're conflating things here; Prop 8 doesn't impose government--it REMOVES the basis for saying government can't be imposed for a GIVEN situation (in this case, marriage, by defining it as being between a man and a woman).\n\n OMG. You are a riot.\n The eternal twist to pretend up is down and black is white.\n So by your approach, we could say that Jim Crow laws don't impose government, but rather REMOVES the basis for saying government can't be imposed for a GIVEN situation.\n So allowing Jim Crow laws is a LACK of governmental imposement...\n \n \n \nWith that logic, a healthy fully capable 25 year old could say that his taxes are going to fund social security (a benefit he might never reach if he doesn't live that long) or disability and demand he get the benefit as well.\n\n Do I really have to remind you that social security IS NOT A RIGHT....\n Disability IS NOT A RIGHT....\n \n Furthermore, there are LEGITIMATE STATE INTERESTS for drawing a line on those issues.\n \n \n \nSociety and its institutions belong to ALL of us, not just one group wanting to broaden marriage.\n\n And if there is no legitimate state interest for not allowing it, then the restriction should not exist.\n By your mentality and approach, SCOTUS should never have ruled Loving v Virginia as they did.\n \n \n \nNo, the claim often made is that 'Christians are FORCING THEIR RELIGION ON PEOPLE.' Which isn't being forced at all.\n\n Christians have a religious tenent on not having gay marriage.\n Because of their religion, I am prevented from having gay marriage.\n That IS force.\n \n \n \nYou have no problem with an invalid use of a claim of \"force\" when it's convenient for you, but balk at what you think is invalid when it's something you don't like.\n\n You claim \"invalid\", but then you can't really show WHY I am wrong.\n It makes perfect sense that if a group experiences NO CHANGE based on a claimed phenomenon being present or absent, then that phenomenon cannot be said to \"force\" them to do anything.\n The grass is green. John goes to work.\n If somebody paints John's grass pink, and John still goes to work, it would be pointless and baseless to claim that the grass being green \"forces\" John to go to work.\n \n Can you propose another intelligible definition of \"force\"?\n Wait. Let me guess. You won't.\n Cause you can't contort far enough to try to insist that anti-gay marriage proponents are not forcing gays on the issue of gay marriage, and at the same time try to insist that allowing gay marriage somehow \"forces\" anti-gay marriage proponents.\n Again, the illogical nature of your claims boggle the mind.\n \n \n \nYou know, it's funny how proponents of ONLY giving couples' benefits to gays via ONLY by redefining marriage always demand \"legitmate state interests\", even to people who argue that gays SHOULD get benefits!\n\n How is that \"funny\"?\n \n \n \nThey want to redefine an institution, and make others justify why they SHOULDN'T do so, when it is THEY who are wanting to enact change and piggyback on someone elses' insitution, even to the point of redefining that institution.\n\n I know.\n Those pesky interracial couples should have made up their own name, like \"mixed couples\".\n < end sarcasm <\n \n I hate to break it to you, but if the government enacts discrimination against a right, the GOVERNMENT must supply a legitimate state interest for doing so.\n That's the way it works.\n If you would actually READ Loving v Virginia, you would understand that.",

If you wanna use that argument, then you're obviously prepared to head back to before interracial marriage was allowed, right?\n\n \nInterracial marriage still involved a man and a woman. It didn't redefine marriage at a fundamental level like that.\n\n I realize you don't want to admit it, but you're picking and choosing how you want to claim \"force\" here.\n You provide an absolutely absurd standard for claiming \"force\", whereby the oppressor for discrimination is somehow \"forced\" by an incapability to discriminate against a minority right.\n \n And with interracial marriage, you COMPLETELY IGNORE that standard for absolutely no reason.\n It agrees with YOUR \"fundamental definition\" of marriage, so therefore you claim there is no \"force\".\n Gay marriage agrees with MY \"fundamental definition\" of marriage, so therefore I can just as validly say there is no \"force\".\n \n Moreover, when Loving v Virginia was decided, a MAJORITY of society (by a margin of 3 to 1) had a \"fundamental definition\" of marriage which excluded interracial marriage.\n So WHY were they not \"forced\" by the minority, as you claim gays would \"force\" the majority here?\n It was a smaller minority group which defined marriage to \"fundamentally\" include interracial marriage back then.\n \n \n \n This is like take the issue of social security benefits and expecting society to go on a completely different view of what \"age\" is in determining to the point of redefining the concept altogether.

He has done this in argument AGAINST prop 8. \n - Ergo, Prop 8 is unconstitutional.\n - But then Foundit says \"your desire for us to attack Prop 8 according to your wishes [the basis of being a violation of RIGHTS and therefore unconstitutional] is not \"legally valid.\"\n \n It's a fact gay marriage is a RIGHT.\n It's a fact that Prop 8 violates the right of gay marriage.\n But according to Foundit, it's not \"legally valid\" to challenge prop 8 for being unconstitutional. Of course, he's not going to explain WHY it's not valid to him, because the real problem is that he doesn't know whether he's coming or going here, and has argued himself into a pretzel.\n \n It's either unconstitutional, or it NOT unconstitutional. If it's unconstitutional, it CAN be challenged on that basis. Frankly, I think a lot of this hot air that Foundit is venting is just that--he likes to argue by saying things along the lines of \"you just don't know what you're talking about\" when in fact he can't even express (or won't) his reasons for making outlandish claims such as that 'challenging prop 8 on the basis of being constitutional is \"not legally valid.\" Again, it's his \"everything you say bounces off me and sticks on you\" approach again--HE doesn't really understand Prop 8 (likely it's all based on what he reads on lobbying blogs and websites) so he uses that as a stock statement when someone puts out an interpretation of the situation he doesn't like, rather than actually realizing the breakdown in his own logic. (Or rather than giving his basis for his claims to begin with.) But hey, that's our Foundit! :)\n \n \nThere are TWO legal processes for modifying the constitution, depending upon the scope and nature of the change.\n If the anti-gay marriage proponents used the WRONG method, then their approach is NOT \"acceptable\".\n\n \n We already covered that; everyone knows about the revision versus amendment thing as the basis for the current challenge of prop 8. The issue I'm pointing out is that, if prop 8 is unconstitutional [in that it violates the RIGHT of gay marriage that you so adamantly say has been ruled] then you should have nothing to worry about by challenging it on THAT basis. Which brings us to the REAL problem you have: it's NOT really a violation of your rights/unconstitutional. Because it changes the constitution which is the BASIS of said rights. So you're attempting the revision/amendment quibble workaround. You argue out of both sides of your mouth on this--on one had you can't stop saying your rights are violated with prop 8; then you say it's not legally valid to challenge the constitutionality of your rights being violated. Which means that, it's NOT unconstitutional. You can't have a right that's not there because the constitution has been changed. If your position is so weak that you can't even mount a challenge to Prop 8 based SOLELY on constitutionality, you're up the creek here. The fact you're having to resort to a challenge based on PROCEDURE (the revision/amendment loophole thing you're trying) says a lot.\n \n \nThis is part of the reason I keep pointing out that gay marriage WAS RECOGNIZED as a right.\n There is no \"supposed\" about it.\n\n \n Yeeeaah. It's just not \"legally valid\" to challenge it when recognized rights are violated. emoticon_xangel\n \n \nBy that mentality, interracial marriage would still be illegal. After all, \"the line has to be drawn somewhere\"...\n\n \n The funny thing about your continued use of that analogy here is, interracial couples didn't try to get that right based on a workaround approach of revision versus amendment to make it where opposers didn't have enough votes. They didn't try to move the goalposts, which is largely what the whole current challenge is really designed to do. They challenged it DIRECTLY as a violation of rights which you're already on record several times here saying you HAVE in terms of gay marriage, and that Prop 8 violates that right.\n \n \nThe real heart of the matter is that YOU want to draw the line where YOU want to draw it, and the justification is unnecessary for removal of rights.\n \n I hate to break it to you, but if the government enacts discrimination against a right, the GOVERNMENT must supply a legitimate state interest for doing so.\n That's the way it works.\n\n \n Problem is, even just THAT justification alone (leg. state interest) as the only qualifier for a boundary line would mean we have to open marriage up to a number of other things too--again, there's no legitimate state interest in outlawing incest marriages, for instance. (The only argument usually given is the birth defect one, and we don't prevent UN-related people from marrying if we know their offspring might likely have birth defects. There's no legitimate state interests in preventing 17 year olds as opposed to 18 year olds from marrying--some 17 year olds may be MORE capable of making a mature decision than many 18 year olds, after all. So when you really take the time to THINK, the inherent problems with the blithe stock answer \"legitimate state interest\" become clear. The best answer is ultimately to take marriage out of govt. altogether and relegate it to the religious/cultural sector where it belongs.\n \n \nIf you would actually READ Loving v Virginia, you would understand that.\n\n \n Foundit, THINK. Loving was ruled under an understanding of marriage and speaks to INTERRACIAL marriage. Can you say that 17 year olds can marry because Loving said marriage is a right? No you cannot. Can you say that a brother and sister can marry because Loving said marriage is a right? No, you cannot. You're obviously in the group of folks out there who think Loving v Virginia is some automatic swiss-army knife fit for gay marriage; it's not. It said MARRIAGE is a right, but the way you blithely take it and try to apply that to gay marriage is the sort of approach anyone could take to apply it to ANYTHING they want called a 'marriage.' And you need to stop making dishonest accusations or assertions that I (or others) haven't read so-and-so [insert-title-here] when we've discussed that very matter numerous times, and have read it but don't come to the same conclusions as you or disagree with its outcomes. You don't own the issue here; believe it or not your interpretation and take on Loving isn't the only one. You'd do well to realize arguments don't have to follow YOUR prescribed narrow boundaries (which typically are only to support Foundit's arguments rather than discuss issues more thoroughly). \n \n \nI realize you don't want to admit it, but you're picking and choosing how you want to claim \"force\" here.\n You provide an absolutely absurd standard for claiming \"force\", whereby the oppressor for discrimination is somehow \"forced\" by an incapability to discriminate against a minority right.\n\n \n OMG. You're just determined to beat this semantics-based argument like a dead horse, huh? You know what, that's fine--change \"force\" in all those cases to something that you consider less imposing by definition--I don't care. You're making a mountain out of a molehill here and arguing as if the use of the word had intentions that it never had. When you make society go along with something by changing it, I consider that a form of 'forcing' something, but, good grief, the term is obviously a lot bigger deal to you than me, so just forget I said it. It's not worth all that.\n \n \nI pointed out to you that the same argument could be made against interracial marriage\n\n \n And it could be used against incest marriages. It could be used against 17 year-old marriages. Just because your example happens to be a socially-acceptable criteria for granting marriage benefits doesn't prove that it's legitimate. The arguments you guys use are so tenuous that marriage would have to be a HECK of a lot more wide open than it is not in NUMEROUS ways.",

It is absolutely ridiculous to watch this unfold.\n \n You relay that I have said *it's not \"legally valid\" to challenge prop 8 for being unconstitutional*.\n But then you fail to recognize THE REASON WHY I have argued that, because it conflicts with your FALSE claim that I am saying *Prop 8 is unconstitutional*.\n \n \n \nOf course, he's not going to explain WHY it's not valid to him, because the real problem is that he doesn't know whether he's coming or going here, and has argued himself into a pretzel.\n\n ROFLMAO! OMG. Tears in my eyes.\n I have REPEATEDLY explained why it's not valid.\n Prop 8 is a CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.\n They are CHANGING the constitution to EXCLUDE gay marriage from not being a right.\n \n The courts INTERPRET the constitution.\n First time around, the courts had a LAW which the constitution supercedes.\n They found the law to CONFLICT with the constitution, so they threw the law out.\n This time around, they have a constitution which includes a NEW part which defines \"marriage\", so they have to USE THAT CONSTITUTIONAL DEFINITION.\n \n \n \nIt's either unconstitutional, or it NOT unconstitutional.\n\n I have repeatedly argued that the Prop 8 constitutional change is not \"unconstitutional\".\n It's like saying \"Jesus established it is improper to strike people. Jesus later established that it is okay to punish children by spanking.\"\n So is Jesus's later comment supposed to be considered as \"not biblical\" because of the first statement?\n No. Obviously a FULL CONTEXT interpretation establishes the boundaries of what is and is not acceptable for striking people.\n \n \n \nIf it's unconstitutional, it CAN be challenged on that basis.

It is THE REASON WHY many constitutional amendments are made in the first place.\n \n Take \"prohibition\". We had one amendment which established \"No alcohol transportation, manufacture, sales...\"\n Then later, we had another amendment repealing the other one.\n By your approach, the later amendment would be \"unconstitutional\" cause it contradicts the existing constitution.\n But the point of the 21st amendment was to MODIFY the constitution to CHANGE what was existing there.\n To argue the 21st amendment is \"unconstitutional\" cause it conflicts with the 18th amendment constitution is illogical because the POINT of the 21st amendment (and even the preceding 18th amendment) was to CHANGE the constitution.\n \n \n \nBut hey, that's our Foundit! :)\n\n It's funny when you pull junk like this, cause if we were to do a poll to see what the generic board members in your \"our\" truly feel about the situation, it wouldn't be pretty for you...\n \n \n \nWe already covered that; everyone knows about the revision versus amendment thing as the basis for the current challenge of prop 8.

   "Problem is, even just THAT justification alone (leg. state interest) as the only qualifier for a boundary line would mean we have to open marriage up to a number of other things too--again, there's no legitimate state interest in outlawing incest marriages, for instance.\n\n BLOWI.\n There is no legitimate state interest THAT YOU AGREE WITH.\n A legitimate state interest has been repeatedly provided to you.\n \n \n \n(The only argument usually given is the birth defect one, and we don't prevent UN-related people from marrying if we know their offspring might likely have birth defects.\n\n So?\n We have statistical knowledge of incest related births.\n If John and Mary get married, how do you determine what their chances are for having birth defect offspring?\n Do you require them to pay for expensive tests to see if they are susceptible for their combined DNA to result in a defect?\n \n There is a difference inbetween KNOWING a group is likely to have defects, and outlawing couple combinations that you don't have knowledge on.\n \n \n \nThere's no legitimate state interests in preventing 17 year olds as opposed to 18 year olds from marrying--some 17 year olds may be MORE capable of making a mature decision than many 18 year olds, after all.\n\n Again, you seem to think that just cause you pose an argument for the legitimate state interest LOCATION of the line being drawn, you have somehow invalidated the EXISTENCE of the line being drawn.\n The legitimate state interest is in ensuring that young people are aware of the seriousness of the contract they are entering into.\n Whether or not a person could be sufficiently aware at 17 would go to a question of CHANGING THE AGE, but not to INVALIDATING the existence of AN age limit.\n \n \n \nFoundit, THINK. Loving was ruled under an understanding of marriage and speaks to INTERRACIAL marriage.\n\n I am thinking.\n Your problem is that you fail to recognize the MECHANISMS they utilized.\n Suppose I try to demonstrate addition by putting down two buttons. Putting down two more buttons, and showing that 2+2=4.\n \n I repeat the process by putting down 3 buttons, and 1 button, and showing 3+1=4.\n Along comes Jyoshu and complains \"But your previous method spoke to EVEN number addition. It can't be used for ODD number addition.\"\n WRONG!\n \n The METHOD is still valid. We are working with different parameters in the second case, but that doesn't mean the METHOD is somehow thrown out the window cause we're using gender distinctions instead of race.\n \n Suppose somebody were to propose that people of different RELIGIONS should not marry, citing statistics on divorce.\n By your approach, it would be conceivable that we would have to allow it.\n By what I am talking about, the SAME TESTS that were used in Loving v Virginia would be used to help verify whether or not the law is constitutional. But instead of \"race\" we would evaluate \"religion\".\n \n By your approach, you seem to think that allowing the EXISTENCE of the test to evaluate a standard somehow automatically allows all sorts of types of marriage, JUST BY THE EXISTENCE of the capability to quesetion the validity AND by the existence of ANY counter-argument against a legitimate state interest. The VALIDITY of the counter-argument is often ignored, just like people who argue \"well then we would have to allow 17-year olds\" IGNORE people like me pointing out why their argument is not valid.\n \n And the really sad part of all this? I mean, the TRAGIC part of all this?\n It's not like I'm creating anything NEW here.\n What I am talking about ALREADY EXISTS. It's here.\n \"Gay marriage\" doesn't NEED to exist for those arguments you propose to be brought before a court. And some of them HAVE BEEN TRIED and already rejected.\n \n \n \nCan you say that 17 year olds can marry because Loving said marriage is a right? No you cannot.\n\n You fail to recognize the REAL REASON WHY 17-year olds are not allowed to marry based on Loving's content.\n The concept of \"legitimate state interest\" for rights EXISTS REGARDLESS of whether or not \"Loving\" is around.\n Loving is an EXAMPLE of \"legitimate state interests\" in action on a MARRIAGE issue, and that is why it is used.\n \n \n \nYou're obviously in the group of folks out there who think Loving v Virginia is some automatic swiss-army knife fit for gay marriage; it's not. It said MARRIAGE is a right, but the way you blithely take it and try to apply that to gay marriage is the sort of approach anyone could take to apply it to ANYTHING they want called a 'marriage.'\n\n Yes. MARRIAGE is a right.\n Just like VOTING is a right, or SPEECH is a right, or RIGHT TO ASSEMBLY is a right.\n But what you fail to recognize is that I am NOT JUST saying \"Loving v Virginia is some automatic swiss-army knife fit for gay marriage\".\n I am saying that, like in Loving, if there is no LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST for the rights discrimination, then the discrimination cannot be instituted.\n \n By your approach, we say \"speech\" is a right.\n But does that mean HATE speech is a right?\n By your approach, you IGNORE the justification for WHY or WHY NOT hate speech could be regulated, and you rush in proclaiming \"it's about speech and doesn't say anything about hate speech\".\n By your approach, any modifier could be used for \"speech\" and you throw any justification for the limitation out the window.\n \n \n \nAnd you need to stop making dishonest accusations or assertions that I (or others) haven't read so-and-so [insert-title-here] when we've discussed that very matter numerous times, and have read it but don't come to the same conclusions as you or disagree with its outcomes.\n\n 1) I apologize for asserting that if you read Loving v Virginia you would understand it.\n It was wrong of me to assume you have a level of reading comprehension necessary to justify that statement...\n \n 2) Okay. You claim to have read Loving v Virginia.\n Explain it.\n Explain WHY the arguments for miscegenation failed.\n And be prepared for me to point out WHERE YOU REPEAT some of the very arguments made against Loving v Virginia, and for me to point out WHY they failed (and it had nothing to do exclusively with race).\n \n \n \nOMG. You're just determined to beat this semantics-based argument like a dead horse, huh?\n\n You keep claiming that \"force\" is exerted against the opponents of gay marriage if gay marriage is legalized.\n I keep responding.\n It is foolhardy to complain that I object to your argument, just cause you call it \"semantics\".\n It isn't \"semantics\" at all. You are just using an absolutely ridiculous interpretation of the word, and it fails consistency.\n Which is probably the real reason why you are now trying to drop the issue...\n \n \n \nYou know what, that's fine--change \"force\" in all those cases to something that you consider less imposing by definition--I don't care.\n\n This claim will be tested over time, as I suspect you're just going to repeat your claims all over again and you'll argue them until I point out the hypocrisy and ridiculousness of your standard.\n \n \n \nWhen you make society go along with something by changing it...\n\n That's just it.\n There IS NO MAKING society do anything here.\n WHAT are they made to do?\n \"go along with something by changing it\"???\n \n That's like saying \"I am *forced* regarding John painting his kitchen in polka dots, cause I have to \"go along with\" his \"change\".\n That's absurd!\n My life DOES NOT CHANGE ONE IOTA if John paints his kitchen in polka dots.\n \n Is there CHANGE? YES!\n But the change is in the GOVERNMENTAL RECOGNITION.\n Society doesn't have to \"change\" anything or \"made to go along with\" anything.\n \n Like it was pointed out earlier, were the racial bigots \"made to go along with\" interracial marriage when SCOTUS proclaimed it was a recognized right???\n \n \n \nAnd it could be used against incest marriages.\n\n Shivers just ran up my spine.\n Just cause you can \"use an argument\" against something that is illegal to help keep it illegal DOES NOT JUSTIFY THE APPROACH the argument makes.\n Incest marriages will remain illegal, and there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in your argument of \"forcing society\" or \"society made to go along with it\" that will justify keeping incest illegal.\n \n Your argument of \"forcing society\" or \"society made to go along with it\" could be used IN ANY SITUATION.\n Washington D.C. voted on gun banning. When SCOTUS overturned their legislation, should they have been stopped cause \"society is made to go along with\" the change???\n Your standard is nonsense! It argues against change FOR THE SAKE OF THE EXISTENCE of the change itself.\n \n \n \nJust because your example happens to be a socially-acceptable criteria for granting marriage benefits doesn't prove that it's legitimate.\n\n OMG. Forest for running into the trees, and you're ignoring the blood that is coming out of the resulting gash in your head...\n YOU are pretending YOUR argument is legitimate.\n We are showing you HOW YOUR ARGUMENT FAILED HISTORICALLY.\n \n You turn around and try to pretend that your argument could be used against OTHER THINGS, ergo it has to be legitimate.\n \n Here's what's going on.\n Jyoshu proclaims \"Things painted red can burn\"\n We point to a metal post that is painted red.\n Jyoshu turns around and points to firewood that has been painted red, and insists our logic must be flawed ...",

And on that, it's up to the state to provide their own rationale for its location.\n The fact that there may be \"exceptions\" does not disprove the need for the existence of the line.\n \n Quite frankly, if people want to lower the age to 17, then that's their perogative. If they want the state law to provide for exceptions to the rules, that's their perogative.

You didn't get it at all.\n The issue of gay marriage is about the EXISTENCE of that particular line with regards to gender.\n Your argument on AGE is not about the EXISTENCE of the line. It's about the LOCATION of the line.\n \n To recap, GENDER discrimination SHOULD NOT exist in marriage. That line should not EXIST.\n But on your \"age\" argument, you do not argue against the EXISTENCE of age discrimination in marriage.

The AMOUNT of weight that could be put in may be adjustable, but the EXISTENCE of the weight limit is a necessity due to the nature of the elevator.\n Here, we COULD make the weight limit higher or lower.

Your actions in the Uganda threat clearly demonstrate that you often ignore simple actions which could help you to see what's going on.\n \n If you read Loving v Virginia, it would help you see that the \"legitimate state interest\" thing is not something I am \"starting\", but something that has existed with the 14th amendment for well over a century.\n \n If you want to explain YOUR interpretation of Loving v Virginia, that would help further this conversation.\n Unfortunately, I think we both know there is nothing of worth for your side of arguing this in a REAL discussion on Loving v Virginia.\n \n \n \nFoundit continues to want to harp on and on about the semantics thing, when I've said now--quite clearly--that's fine. It's not even an issue to me. It's he who is making this an issue by freaking out over the use of the word.\n\n \"freaking out\"? emoticon_rolleyes\n Same ol' Jyoshu. He gets cornered on an argument, then pretends the other guy is over-reacting as he runs away from the issue.\n But have no fear! He'll undoubtedly repeat the SAME ARGUMENT he claims to have no interest in at a later time...",
