   "for liberals that is\n \n NEWTOWN, Conn. -- Firearm sales continued to surge across the country for the fifth straight month, extending a trend that began after the November elections. The increase also follows recent comments by several high-profile members of the Obama administration about re-imposing permanently and expanding the ban on modern sporting rifles.\n \n Data from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) show background checks on the sale of firearms jumped 29.2 percent in March when compared to March 2008 and were up 27.1 percent for the first quarter of 2009 over the same quarter last year.\n \n The increase follows a 23 percent rise in February, a 28 percent rise in January, a 24 percent rise in December and a 42 percent jump in November, when a record 1,529,635 background checks were performed. \n \n FBI background checks are required under federal law for all individuals purchasing firearms from federally licensed retailers. These checks serve as a strong indicator of actual sales. \n \n Correspondingly, ammunition manufacturers are reporting record sales across the country as demand continues to outpace supply. \n \n Americans concerned about their ability to purchase many types of home defense, hunting and target shooting firearms in the future are continuing to purchase these products in record numbers today,\" said NSSF President Steve Sanetti. \"Along with this strong sales showing, we've also seen increased participation in firearm safety and education programs such as NSSF First Shots.\"\n \n NICS reported 1,345,096 checks in March, up from 1,040,863 in the same month a year ago.",

   "  Fear of restrictions spurs huge boost in gun sales \n Gun sales are booming nationwide - and in Erie County, applications for pistol permits are rolling in at nearly three times last year's rate, the county clerk's office reports. \n \n Meanwhile, in the nation's capital, gun control has become, in essence, dead on arrival. \n \n Chalk it all up to the election of a Democratic president with a long record of supporting gun restrictions and a Congress that includes a surprising number of pro-gun Democrats from rural areas. \n \n The election of Barack Obama as president is sparking a run on firearms and ammunition in both Buffalo and nationwide, according to gun dealers and experts on the issue. \n\n Unfortunately Democrats have a credibility problem. Many Pro-gun Democrats have been elected, and America is giving them a chance, but apparently they do not believe Obama because of his past Anti-gun support and votes. \n \n However   Ms. Feinstein's comments about waiting for the correct timing to bring up gun control  did not help the creditability problem either. I guess only time will tell.",

I guess only time will tell.\n\n \n Forwarded to me by one of my co-workers;\n \n \"HR 45 Blair Holt Firearm Licensing & Record of Sales Act of 2009\n Please send this to everybody on your list...\n this is Obama gun control by secrecy.\n \n Very Important for you to be aware of a new bill HR 45 introduced into the House. \n \n This is the Blair Holt Firearm Licensing & Record of Sale Act of 2009.\n \n We just learned yesterday about this on the Peter Boyles radio program. \n \n Even gun shop owners didn't know about this because it is flying under the radar.\n \n To find out about this - go to any government website and type in HR 45 or Google HR 45 Blair Holt Firearm Licensing & Record of Sales Act of 2009. You will get all the information.\n \n Basically this would make it illegal to own a firearm - any rifle with a clip or ANY pistol unless:\n \n .It is registered\n \n .You are fingerprinted\n \n .You supply a current Driver's License\n \n .You supply your Social Security #\n \n .You will submit to a physical & mental evaluation at any time of their choosing\n \n .Each update - change or ownership through private or public sale must be reported and costs $25.\n \n - Failure to do so you automatically lose the right to own a firearm and are subject up to a year in jail.\n \n .There is a child provision clause on page 16 section 305 stating a child-access provision. Gun must be locked and inaccessible to any child under 18. \n \n The Government would have the right to come and inspect that you are storing your gun safely away from accessibility to children and fine is punishable for up to 5 yrs. in prison.\n \n If you think this is a joke - go to the website and take your pick of many options to read this...\n \n OpenCongress - Text of H.R.45 as Introduced in House Blair Holt's Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2009\n \n It is long and lengthy. But, more and more people are becoming aware of this. Pass the word along.\n Any hunters in your family - pass this along.\n \n He suggests the best way to fight this is to tell all your friends about it and \"spring into action\". Also, he suggests we all join a pro-gun group like the Colorado Rifle Association, hunting associations, gun clubs and especially the NRA.\n \n This is just a \"termite\" approach to complete confiscation of guns and disarming of our society to the point we have no defense - chip away a little here and there until the goal i s accomplished before anyone realizes it.\n (Did Obama promise transparency? It seems his motives are more and more transparent while his methods are hidden in back rooms.)\n \n This is one to act on whether you own a gun or not.\"",

   "\"HR 45 Blair Holt Firearm Licensing & Record of Sales Act of 2009\n  H.R.45 - Blair Holt's Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2009 \n There has been alot of publicity about this bill. It is many bills we have to fear all wrapped up in one. I have received a few notes about it asking about it and I appreciate those.\n \n The reason that I have not devoted much time to it is that the House has not. As of right now it is in the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security within the House Committee on the Judiciary. It has no cosponsors.\n \n This bill says a lot about Representative Bobby Rush. But until there is action, it says nothing about anyone else.\n \n Stay vigilant.\n\n I \"personally\" feel this is one of those bills that will go no where. It is Far Too Radical for it to be taken very seriously. I could be wrong, but I believe I am not.\n \n If it were to pass the very next Brand New Republican Congress would repeal it.",

If law enforcement is allowed to concentrate its efforts on policing the criminals rather than policing the law-abiding because of gun control regulations and compliance, then they are better able to make an impact on the communities they serve. That is just common sense. No?\n \n However, the the idea that criminals have no idea who owns a gun, does give them pause when they decide to burgle someone who is at home. No? \n \n Take Manchester for example. They jailed the Drug Gang and had a remarkable results.   Manchester: 'Streets safer after jailing of Gooch Gang members'\n Martin Wainwright reports from Moss Side, where shootings, murders and drug offences have plummeted after the jailing of members of the 'Gooch Gang'\n\n Truly remarkable bit of police work.
