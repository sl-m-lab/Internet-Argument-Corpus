   "Amazing!\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/science/03arsenic.html?partner=rss&emc=rss\nScientists said Thursday that they had trained a bacterium to eat and grow on a diet of arsenic, in place of phosphorus &#8212; one of six elements considered essential for life &#8212; opening up the possibility that organisms could exist elsewhere in the universe or even here on Earth using biochemical powers we have not yet dared to dream about.\n \n The bacterium, scraped from the bottom of Mono Lake in California and grown for months in a lab mixture containing arsenic, gradually swapped out atoms of phosphorus in its little body for atoms of arsenic.\n \n Scientists said the results, if confirmed, would expand the notion of what life could be and where it could be. &#8220;There is basic mystery, when you look at life,&#8221; said Dimitar Sasselov, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and director of an institute on the origins of life there, who was not involved in the work. &#8220;Nature only uses a restrictive set of molecules and chemical reactions out of many thousands available. This is our first glimmer that maybe there are other options.&#8221; \n",

   "heres a synopsis of the paper written, summed up by a fellow tumblr blogger, jtotheizzoe who released this before NASA dished out their press conference:\n \n \n \n The great Ed Yong has a full write-up out of the NASA arsenic-bacteria news alluded to earlier. Ed&#8217;s an awesome science writer, but I have to say that it isn&#8217;t fair that he has access to the paper days and days in advance of the rest of us so that he gets to fully analyze and report on it while we are left to wring our hands and pick up scraps. I blame Eureka Alert. Ok, done complaining.\n \n Anyway, so here&#8217;s the gist:\n \n - The bacteria are able to substitute arsenic into their DNA and proteins in the place of phosphorous. This shatters the notion of C, H, O, N, S, P being the only six elements that Earth life is based on. But they don&#8217;t depend on arsenic, and can actually use phosphorus, too.\n \n - These bacteria are not a new branch of life, but are related to the same ones eating Gulf of Mexico oil as we speak. There is (as of yet) no secret biosphere of independent evolution on Earth. But independent evolution in a previously-termed &#8220;toxic environment&#8221; is always neat.\n \n - The arsenic fed to these bugs was incorporated in the DNA, proteins, fats, everywhere. They seem to cope with the unstable nature of the element quite well, and make it a critical part of their metabolism.\n \n So it isn&#8217;t aliens. We knew that. But I think it is still immensely exciting. It changes the notion of what we should be looking for in a habitable environment for extraterrestrial life. It is a key reminder and correction to all scientists to not become comfortable in the established dogmas, but to always be ready for exciting rule-breakers. It&#8217;s a reminder to think about what is possible, not only what we know to exist.\n \n The implications for new biochemical pathways, synthetic biology and evolution are still huge, and the fact that this isn&#8217;t aliens or anything like that shouldn&#8217;t stop anyone from being excited to all get-out.\n \n Mono Lake bacteria build their DNA using arsenic (and no, this isn&#8217;t about aliens) | Not Exactly Rocket Science\n\n \n Mono Lake bacteria build their DNA using arsenic (and no, this isn&#8217;t about aliens) | Not Exactly Rocket Science | Discover Magazine",

Jupiter's atmosphere, im sure contains ions that are similar to what we are made of, and the same thing could happen. thats what gets me really excited about this whole ordeal, what if colonization of another planet isnt so far off, with the help of evolution?\n \n is the universe a mortal entity? Einstein proposed that time is relative to mass, right? the universe as an entity contains mass, but its not a massive entity. planets for example are subject to time obviously, but how about the deepest regions of space farthest away from any massive entity, or the edge of space that has yet to form. is that exempt from time, due to that point in space being nowhere near anything which contains mass? this is all getting way over my head, im confused fit to burst. gravity is also related to mass; is gravity related to time as well, since theyre both related to mass? woooooooooah!\n \n \nBy the way, if you're interested in investigating the origins of religion itself from a materialist perspective, check out Robert Wright's The Evolution of God.

   "silicon-based life\nIn 1891, the German astrophysicist Julius Scheiner became perhaps the first person to speculate on the suitability of silicon as a basis for life. This idea was taken up by the British chemist James Emerson Reynolds who, in 1893, in his opening address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, pointed out that the heat stability of silicon compounds might allow life to exist at very high temperatures (see thermophiles). In an 1894 article, drawing on Reynolds's ideas and also those of Robert Ball, H. G. Wells wrote:\n \n \nOne is startled towards fantastic imaginings by such a suggestion: visions of silicon-aluminium organisms &#8211; why not silicon-aluminium men at once? &#8211; wandering through an atmosphere of gaseous sulphur, let us say, by the shores of a sea of liquid iron some thousand degrees or so above the temperature of a blast furnace. \n\n \n Thirty years later, J. B. S. Haldane suggested that life might be found deep inside a planet based on partly molten silicates, the oxidation of iron perhaps providing it with energy.\n \n Silicon biochemistry?\n \n At first sight, silicon does look like a promising organic alternative to carbon. It is common in the universe and is also a p-block element of group IV, lying directly below carbon in the periodic table of elements, so that much of its basic chemistry is similar. For instance, just as carbon combines with four hydrogen atoms to form methane, CH4, silicon yields silane, SiH4. Silicates are analogs of carbonates, silicon chloroform of chloroform, and so on. Both elements form long chains, or polymers, in which they alternate with oxygen. In the simplest case, carbon-oxygen chains yield polyacetal, a plastic used in synthetic fibers, while from a backbone of alternating atoms of silicon and oxygen come polymeric silicones.\n \n Conceivably, some strange life-forms might be built from silicone-like substances were it not for an apparently fatal flaw in silicon's biological credentials. This is its powerful affinity for oxygen. When carbon is oxidized during the respiratory process of a terrestrial organism (see respiration), it becomes the gas carbon dioxide &#8211; a waste material that is easy for a creature to remove from its body. The oxidation of silicon, however, yields a solid because, immediately upon formation, silicon dioxide organizes itself into a lattice in which each silicon atom is surrounded by four oxygens. Disposing of such a substance would pose a major respiratory challenge.\n \n Life-forms must also be able to collect, store, and utilize energy from their environment. In carbon-based biota, the basic energy storage compounds are carbohydrates in which the carbon atoms are linked by single bonds into a chain. A carbohydrate is oxidized to release energy (and the waste products water and carbon dioxide) in a series of controlled steps using enzymes. These enzymes are large, complex molecules (see proteins) which catalyze specific reactions because of their shape and \"handedness.\" A feature of carbon chemistry is that many of its compounds can take right and left forms, and it is this handedness, or chirality, that gives enzymes their ability to recognize and regulate a huge variety of processes in the body. Silicon's failure to give rise to many compounds that display handedness makes it hard to see how it could serve as the basis for the many interconnected chains of reactions needed to support life.\n \n The absence of silicon-based biology, or even silicon-based prebiotic chemicals, is also suggested by astronomical evidence. Wherever astronomers have looked &#8211; in meteorites, in comets, in the atmospheres of the giant planets, in the interstellar medium, and in the outer layers of cool stars &#8211; they have found molecules of oxidized silicon (silicon dioxide and silicates) but no substances such as silanes or silicones which might be the precursors of a silicon biochemistry.\n \n Even so, it has been pointed out, silicon may have had a part to play in the origin of life on Earth. A curious fact is that terrestrial life-forms utilize exclusively right-handed carbohydrates and left-handed amino acids. One theory to account for this is that the first prebiotic carbon compounds formed in a pool of \"primordial soup\" on a silica surface having a certain handedness. This handedness of the silicon compound determined the preferred handedness of the carbon compounds now found in terrestrial life. An entirely different possibility is that of artificial life or intelligence with a significant silicon content.\n",
