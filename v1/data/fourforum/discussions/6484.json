That's another talk show. \n \n Also, a LOT of people here and fighting in Iraq believe that we could care less that our soldiers/children/fathers/sond/daughters are stuck in a sand hell, fighting and dying for causes only known to the puppetmasters. I would imagine that knowing someone cares enough to raise a stink about it at the homefront gives them solace. Not ALL of us want them there.
