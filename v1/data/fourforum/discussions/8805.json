   "Sock puppets? Yes, sock puppets. For those of you not familiar with the intricacies of message board and blog posting, here's how it works. You post your brilliant thoughts for public consumption, but for some bizarre reason you get a bunch of negative comments. Why, those people must be fools! What to do? Simple: anonymously create a second account and use it to puff yourself up while taking on your detractors. You get to keep your hands clean and tell all those disagreeable bastards what you think of them. Et voila - a sock puppet is born.\n \n Unfortunately if someone catches you out, well, you end up looking like a massive tool. And last week two prominent conservatives got busted.\n \n First, Lee Siegel of The New Republic was caught using a sock puppet called \"sprezzatura\" to attack critics on his blog. Here's an example of the sort of thing that Siegel liked to post about himself:\n How angry people get when a powerful critic says he doesn't like their favorite show! Like little babies. Such fragile egos. Siegel accuses Stewart of a \"pandering puerility\" and he gets an onslaught of puerile responses from the insecure herd of independent minds. I'm well within Stewart's target group, and I think he's about as funny as a wet towel in a locker room. Siegel is brave, brilliant, and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.\n Insecure? Immature? Fragile egos? Hmm. I believe that's what they call \"projection.\" Fortunately The New Republic got wise to the antics of their \"powerful critic\" and gave him the boot.\n \n Meanwhile, Rochester City Council member and mayoral candidate Pat Carr (yes, he's a Republican) was also caught with his pants down. Carr made a habit of replying to himself on the Rochester Post-Bulletin's website under the username \"127179.\" According to the Post-Bulletin:\n The most outspoken member of the Rochester City Council is also an active user of the Post-Bulletin's Web site and frequently comments about local issues, politics and even other council members.\n \n But most online users don't know that \"127179,\" as he is identified on the Web site, is really Pat Carr, the council member and a candidate for Rochester mayor in this fall's election.\n \n More likely, they'd guess he is a supporter or a friend of Carr's, to judge by the third-person comments that often praise and defend Carr's work on the council.\n \n One recent example:\n \n \"Pat Carr has done nothing but stand up for the silent majority,\" Carr wrote in a comment posted Sunday at Postbulletin.com, answering a critical comment from another reader.\n \n \"People that run him down are special interest groups and insiders that Carr exposes,\" Carr wrote Friday, as part of the same thread of messages.\n \n Others of the many dozens of messages posted from Carr's account since November sound similar notes of praise. Some attack officials who voted differently than Carr. \n When caught, Carr proclaimed, \"If people want to trash me, I have the right to stand up and defend myself. I stand by what I said.\"\n \n Wow. That's, er, brave of him.\n http://journals.democraticunderground.com/top10/258",
