They have no business seeking censorship. This is not the only example. They are quite hypocritical - until they can manage to stop being offensive, they have no business being outraged that someone offends them.\n \n Big babies.\n \n In a way they probably just helped further Madonnas career. People will come out in droves to buy the concert by other means - as is the usual response when psuedo purity driven kicks up a fuss.

Madonna's religious freedom was NOT taken away, and neither was the network's. She was completely free to use the antics she did in her concert, and she did use them. The network was completely free to show it or not to show it, so their religious freedom was not taken away either. They chose not to show it, based on the fact that they didn't want to have to deal with the controversy. But it's not like they were forced to by law, or really forced in any way. They certainly could have gone ahead if they'd wanted to. This is not a 1st amendment issue. Democracy doesn't mean people can't protest something or even put pressure on commercial outlets to act a certain way--in fact it's because we're a democracy that we can do that. The only way this would truly be a \"religious freedom\" issue would be if they were trying to somehow create and impose a legal restriction on her. You may not like the stance of these people that protested Madonna's actions, but they didn't really take away anyone's freedom of choice in this case (evidenced by the fact that she DID do those actions).",

Most things we would not tolerate someone making such a mockery of in such an insulting way. NBC's refusal to show this is more like a case of a network refusing to show something racial or culturally insensitive. It's too bad pressure from outside groups to make it happen. that's not to say that NBC did it merely for altruistic reasons; I'm sure they were just trying to avoid controversy and possible financial fallout. But if we're going to not have insensitive things on television about black people, gays, and other groups, we should be consistent and not publically insult religious groups as well. So all in all I think this is a good thing.\n \n I think our culture needs to get past this idea that religion is ok to bash or insult while there are so many other things that are off-limits. If we're going to be a culture of tolerance, then we need to be a culture of tolerance even with religion. To do otherwise is simply hypocritical.

   "Christians are against gays\n\n \n Yes i have to admit it, some of our protestant bretheren are out there minds..I have heard some of them on, it really is disgusting\n \n However your statement is totally wrong about true Christianity...Catholicism\n \n By the definition that somehow because the church is against the homosexual act it means that it is against gays....My priest is Gay and he is the best priest I know, he is the 3rd highest ranking priest in my dioceses. I have friends in my parish who are homosexual. I know one person in my parish who commited murder\n \n By that deffinition It means it is against fornicators, adulters, murderers, pedophiles, rapists so on and so forth.\n \n I am both a fornicator and an adulterer, the church is not against me....my sin does not define who I am. I have been given the ability to choose to have sex before marriage or with a married woman... both of which I have done in the past. \n \n a person has a choice to have relations with a member of the same sex or not, they do not have to do it, just as I did not have to have sex before marriage or with a married woman....Jesus Christ/ The church calls us to live our lives free of sin - he/they dont demand it!\n \n Jesus Christ/The church understands that mankind is living in a fallen state and the temptation to sin can be extremely hard to resist.. ThE good news of the gospel is centered on the all powerful love and mercy of God that over comes sin.\n \n The church is against fornication, not fornicators\n The Church is against Homosexuality, Not Homosexuals\n The church is against Rape, not rapists\n The Church is against murder, not murderers\n The Church is against pedophilia, not pedophiles\n \n Ultimatly the Church is against sin, not Human Beings!\n \n \nYou degrade, mock and are insensitive to the lives and relationships of gay families.\n\n \n NO I do not and neither does the Catholic Church, We simply profess our belief in Jesus Christ... we do not demand others live by our faith. We do not degrade nor mock anyone we are not insensitive towards anyone it is simply that you find the teachings of Jesus and the church incompatiable with the way you choose to live your life...you are intollerent of our possition, we are not intollerent of your posstion.\n \n \nYou mean like Fred Phelps hurts? You mean like ammendments banning your family hurts?\n\n \n I have never heard of fred phelps, but unless he is a catholic who teaches catholic truth, you can denounce and rip him apart as much as you like.\n \n Unless you havent noticed but the government is not the Catholic church...your beef is with your government not Christianity.\n \n Last point... We were talking about maddona action...why try to take the focus off maddona and place it on the catholic church?\n \n \nYet it is ok for some christians to ignor his teachings by Dehumanizing, Demonizing, and hating gay people? \n\n \n NO ITS NOT OK\n \n Do not believe anyone who dehumanizes any human being of any group. They do not stand up for truth, their message is of hate not love\n \n Christianity is under attack and has been for the last 500 years since the kings and queens of europe decided to support and help a monk called martin luther start the reformation in hope of destroying the catholic church.\n \n So called christians who dehumanize any human being are false prophets...even if they profess to be catholic - they are not. \n \n I have met a few, burburing on about how the unborn child is not a human being, how its a blob of tissue... heretics...not Christian!\n \n \n and anyone who says such things about you or your family almost deserve to suffer at the hands of the inqusition and burned at the stake.\n \n But maddona's mockery of Christ would not of hurt the protestants as much because they do not have the crucifix as central to their faith but the cross. The Catholics do however have the crucifix and are very close to it.\n \n \nyou have no right to insult people for things that they can't do anything about, like gender, race, disability, sexuality\n\n \n True enough sexuality is something out of our control...acting upon it is not.. we Condmen the act not the persons sexuality...we understand it because we are human too and many catholics are gay.\n \n \nReligion is a matter of choice, like political opinion, and hence is fair game.\n\n \n Catholicism dosnt seek to impose \"Christ\" on others, its aim is to help bring others to \"christ\" Catholicism is very public in spreading the message but very personal in individual acceptance and growth in faith... it is a choice, but its a private choice that effects the individual privately. Political opinion on the other hand is an opinion on how governments effect the lives of every one in the nation/world.. The Catholic church bans priests from running for office..of course lay catholics can, but they are not the (C)hurch but part of the \n (c)hurch. THe church always has an opinon on matters of morality that should not be a matter for politics and it gets confused as thinking the church has political opinions....no government has the right to tell you what is right and wrong...morallity is not a political issue...but if government insist on legislating morality the catholic church has to voice its opinion...its often ignored of course! The pope begged bush not to go into iraq he still did. \n \n So although they are both a matter of choice, faith is private and personal choice and shouldnt really be what you call \"fair Game\" You dont have to be a catholic if you dont want to be.\n \n \n \nThe more they try and force people to believe as they do\n\n \n The catholic church isnt trying to force anyone into belief... it can not be achieved.... it must be a willing acceptence, it can not be forced. If you can not be reconcilded to Jesus Christ... Be wary of such groups who try to force you into accepting Christ!\n \n \n \nI do not wish to convert them to what I believe, I merely want to have my beliefs respected and left alone.\n\n \n \n we do wish to convert people but we do not and can not force them... it simply can not be done.... its impossible to MAKE someone believe.\n \n Those who have and do convert should be left alone and respected.",

He was head of \"the doctrine of faith\".\n\n \n http://www.rotten.com/library/history/inquisition/\n a quote from the site\n \nBased in Vatican City, the Holy Office of the Inquisition is still one of the most powerful branches of the Church hierarchy. In 1965, the P.R.-sensitive Pope Paul VI rebranded the Inquisition as the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, but it was still basically the Inquisition.\n\n \n \n\n but its not her religious belief... it was a mocking of Christ not practicing her own faith but mocking others.\n\n How do you know what Madonnas religious beliefs are?\n \n\n Yes but you can ignore the impulses to act on our fallen nature.... no man has to sin, he can choose not too...the homosexual need not have sex with other members of his own sex, just as the hetrosexual need not have sex with a married woman. \n\n You missed the point the sin is denial of our nature. If I as a gay man engage in an unnatural act such as having sex with a woman that is the sin.\n \n\n Being Gay is not the sin acting on those impulses is. \n\n I could say that being heterosexual is not a sin but acting upon your heterosexual impulses is. That is how you sound to a gay person\n \n \n \n\n agreed but since we can not export such people to non christian countries...we should just let them have about 25% of the land in united states to create their own nation or split themselves further into smaller nations. leaving the 75% of the land to be occupied by the 75% of the population that areChristian...this seems the best solution because obviously you wouldnt want 75% of the population to be slaves to a secular nation...would you?\n\n \n Why is a secular nation such a bad thing? A secular nation protects religious freedom and expression. It is only the religious fanatic that wants thier religious belief to be forced upon others that believes that a secular nation is a bad thing. In a secular nation all religions have an equal footing. Does this scare you?

   "Epaphras Faith: Censorship is not limited to Governments. Censorship can be done by Coporations who don't like opposing viewpoints against their products. I have found Censorship occuring at a media company that ironically speaks out against Censorship. A person being banned on a message board could be viewed as a form of Censorship. The person being banned by the message board could sue them for violating their First Amendment Rights to be heard.\n\n \n I do not think that would comport with supreme court findings. Private organizations also have the right to allow whomever and whatever they want to be a part of the group (ie boy scouts, KKK, etc.) There are other rights guaranteed under the constitution. Certainly somebody may sue, but that does not mean they would win. I can sue anybody for anything. Doesn't mean I cannot be sued for frivolous suit.\n \n However, you point is well taken. It still does not apply in this case. NBC made a business decision. They have not prevented Madonna from going to CBS or ABC. The action they took was a contractual action. It was included in their agreement with Madonna. It is standard contract language. No rights have been violated. None. Simone could not sue NBC for this choice.

   "If a doctor cals a back person sick for being black is that dehumanizing?\n\n \n Yes. But being black is not a result of falen human nature\n \n Our sexuality can be affected by it. I am not trying to be nasty to you all I am asking is for you to try and understand our possition.\n \n If we are born gay as we are born hetrosexual it would be a fair assumption a A sexual would be born A Sexual and a pedophile born a pedophile.. is pedophillia a sickness of the sexuality?\n \n You see being black is not a skin condition, it is quite natural to be black, those who evolved in hot countries evolved with darker skin as a protection against the sun....However being gay is a sexual condition, a condition that is not natural, nature intends the sexual act to reproduce and reproduction can only occur between members of the opposite sex...Hetrosexuality is the natural inclination of human beings, homosexuality is a sexuality that has gone wrong...it sounds quite nasty to say but i dont mean it that way.. homosexuality is a freak of nature. Some would say it is a perversion, I wouldnt say it was because its a freak of nature not a perversion of nature. A hetrosexual going with men would be a perversion, a homosexual going with a member of the opposite sex would be a perversion etc.\n \n Now hetrosexuality is a sin if it is not practiced in the correct sphear.\n \n Natural sex (hetrosexuality) prime purpose in nature is to cause reproduction, with reproduction comes responsibility to the child and to the mother or the father, when a person is ready to make the commitment to each other and to the child hetro sex is no longer a sin..a christian gets married before god an athiest before the state either by ceremony or by living together (common law)\n \n \nBeing gay and having gay sex is not a sin. It is a great and Glorious gift from God. What better way to trully understand and love God, who is male, then though the act of sex with another man.\n\n \n Being gay is not a sin.\n \n Having relations with members of the same sex is because it is not proper according to the nature God has given to us, rather homosexuality is an accident of nature, a result of the fall of mankind to wallow in and embrace our fallen nature is to deny our true nature... our original created nature in the image of the divine nature of god.\n \n So to embrace homosexuality by having sex with members of our own sex we deny our original created nature...therfore we deny God... and all sin is the denial of God.\n \n \n If I as a gay man engage in an unnatural act such as having sex with a woman that is the sin.\n\n \n \n Yes I think it could be a sin too although I am not sure because although it is a perversion of your own sexuality its not a perversion of the natural law... in someways that could be taken as an attempt to live according to the natual law...but then you have to consider the woman.. SO I am unsure.. I agree you could and most probably are correct.\n \n \n \nI could say that being heterosexual is not a sin but acting upon your heterosexual impulses is. \n\n \n It most certainly is!\n \n The sexual act should only be undertaken if it has been properly assesed acting on impulss makes for a clouded judgement.... I know that better than anyone.\n \n \nA secular nation protects religious freedom and expression.\n\n \n Thats a Christian influence, without christianity the west will not be able to sustain it.\n \n \nIt is only the religious fanatic that wants thier religious belief to be forced upon others that believes that a secular nation is a bad thing.\n\n \n A Christian nation (one built on Christian principles...not a theocracy) wont force the christian faith on you I dont want to force my faith on you, but as a nation that is 75% Christian and built on christian principles I dont think you have much right trying to force a secualr nation on them.\n \n Why should 25% of the population force 75% of the population to live in a country run according to their standards?\n \n Why should the majority be forced to live according to the minority\n \n The law of equality dictates that 75% of the public office should be Christian",

Its sole purpose is to slam christians not to discuss an actual issue.\n \n The topic starts with \"Some Christians...\"\n \n You might just as well start with \"Some Blacks...\" Or \"Some muslims...\"\n \n The point in making such statements is to appear to be unbiased, but has the connotation that christianity is the source of such problems. It is not. People are individuals and any category of person can behave badly.\n \n Additionally, it is pretty clear that no one has restricted Madonna's freedom of speech.

It's the attempt to get something banned that is the problem. Just because the YOU may not like what she did you no business EVER trying to limit whether I see it.\n \n Ever.\n \n\n \n I replied with:\n \n \nThis is simply a ridiculous statement. There is no act pending in congress to ban such a thing. If there is please post a link to that bill. The protesting and boycotting is how people get their voices heard by big business.\n \n If you really meant this then no one would ever be allowed to protest. THAT is the whole point of freedom of expression. Madonna is free to express her views. I am free to express my views. NBC is free to act based on what Madonna wants or what I and my group of consumers want. I would imagine their decision is based on the bottom line (how much money will they lose or bring in through a given action).\n \n Your statement about banning is without any real forethought or merit.\n \n EF\n __________________\n \n\n \n The back and forth continues until some time when you say:\n \n \nEF, you don't get it! You just don't get it!\n \n If my freedom to know and investigate is infringed upon by religious radicals who do not want me to know about scientific and medical developments, it makes me very, very, very, very angry and I will be very sure to get into the faces of anyone who tries to restrict my freedom to know in such a way.\n \n I also have a freedom to believe what I believe. If that freedom is infringed upon, there will also be Hell to pay!\n \n\n \n The point is you seem to be missing is the topic. It is about Madonna's hanging on a cross thing.\n \n Yous ay you don't care about NBC and Madonna. Then why are you even bothering to respond?\n \n You don't seem to understand that while Madonna has every right to do what she wants in her show, her contract with NBC allows them to not carry it or to carry it. My rights (and yours too) allow me to protest their decision whatever direction it goes. Neither you nor I should LEGISLATE that but protest is a constitutional right.\n \n This is why I suggested you get a course in government or constitution. You do not seem to grasp that we have the same rights, even though my opinions disagree with yours. \n \n So, if you can't actually argue logically then don't argue. \n \n EF",

   "See you have to be gay to trully see and undersatnd what heterosexaul privledge is. I will try and explain it. Heterosexual peivledge is the belief, in part, that the world is heterosexual and everyone is and should be heterosexual. If I meet a heterosexual I am assumed to be a heterosexual until I say something. It is where every adveretizement, every book, every magazine, tv program, and movie extolls heterosexuality as if it is the only way and the best way of living. It is the attitude by some heteros that homosexuality is sick and disgusting because they belive that their lifestaly is the way everyone should be. It is going into a resturnat and have ing the wait person ask two men if it is seperate checks but then assuming that a man and a women are together. Most heterosexuals do not see or understand thier heterosexual privledge.\n\n \n OK, by and large the vast majority of the world is Heterosexual. It isn't a priviledge but the way things are. Advertsiments etc will cater for the majority. There are a number of homosexual magazines/books around. Some heterosexuals may well find homosexuality disgusting; very many more are quite happy for homosexuals to live their own lives and stop pushing their orientation into other people's faces as much as they can. You must go into some very strange restaurants. As said being heterosexual is not a priviledge it is a state of being which contains the vast majority of the human race.",

   "Poor excuse to continue to put up with prejudice.\n \n \n \n Expecting a person to either live a lie or live alone is not compassionate.\n \n \n \n And vice versa.\n \n \n \n How about you keep your understanding forgiveness and compassion and instead mind your own damned business and not involve yourself in legislating other people's lives.\n \n \n \n \n Did you note the part where I said I was determined to be happy?\n \n \n \n I was married and divorced in the same courthouse. Thems the facts regardless how your church views it. For the record - no I am not a Catholic. Thank whatever maker that be.\n \n \n \n It just feels that people should be more loyal towards their miserable past than make an attempt at a happy future. \n \n \n \n It is quite telling that you take this opportunity and my description to decide MY character and defend that of a man you do not even know. \n \n When I described him I was being nice as possible. Get the pretty picture out of your head - there were no bottles of wine. He hit me, sexually abused me, would only help out so much with the bills - anything above and beyond what he felt like contributing was my problem - as was all the housework and childcare in addition to being the main bread-winner. The last time his son saw his (biological) father he had his mother (ME) in a strangle hold against the wall. Since throwing him out on the street he has not paid a dime in child support and after a year never even called to enquire as to how his son was. There are those who call a spade a spade, I am one to call it ####ing shovel. He was a mean, cheap, bastard and I will never feel compelled to offer the time of day, let alone fidelity to that man's memory.\n \n And also - since, my son has been adopted by a loving, caring, generous man - who happens to be gay. He is hands down the best man I have ever known. He is in a relationship. He is happy. My son is happy. I am happy. And if that isn't OK with God - to hell with him.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Amen to that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

   "Do you really know what the word 'priviledge' means ?\n \n In your use of it I strongly suspect you do not. heterosexuality is the way of life of by far the greater part of humanity. That hardly makes it a priviledge.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Being \"white\" 50 years ago was a way of life in this country by the majority of the population. And from the \"black\" perspective it was a priveledge.",

   "We do that all the time and give them titles like \"Megans law\" ect.. \n Top answer your question if the horse and sign its name and speak a human language then sure let them get married. If a child is legally able to make legal descions for itself then sure let them gat married. \n \n Once again you show your heterosexual privledge with this statement \"to marry a adult human being who is a member of the opposite sex.. this says you belive that gay people should not\n get married and marriage should be a heterosexual exclusive club.\n \n The heterosexual gets to marry the person of their choice. The gay person does not.\n\n \n To clarify, I doubt you believe \"privilege\" (the first time we got this word correct in this whole thread) is really a bad thing...you just want to expand the \"privilege\" to include what you want. So we will have a hetero and homo privilege where young people can't marry and you can't marry many folks at one time. \n \n I don't understand why people are so worried about \"privilege\".",
