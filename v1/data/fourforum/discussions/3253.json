IF there is no connection, why don't they just demand the release of ALL Muslim prisoners anywhere in the world? Why is SHE singled out?\n\n \n Actually, conventional wisdom has stated that there wasn't a credible link between Iraq and Al Queda prior to our invasion. That's an important distinction to make with the key word being \"prior\". Since our invasion of Iraq it's no secret that terrorists are pouring over the borders to engage the US and undermine our efforts in the region. We are not welcome in the Middle East so our very presence is breeding animosity toward the US and our allies. As long as we insist on being there, we'll likely be a target. I thought it was unusual that the US stated that they weren't even holding any female prisoners and now they instantly appear. Are we really that dissorganized???",

   "Why did McVeigh blow up the Federal Building in OK City instead of the White House? Terrorists are terrorists. They will take advantage of any situation, how they can, when they can. This is not a fair assessment of who terrorists are, i.e., linking them with or against a certain party. Hussein got on Bin Laden&#8217;s bad side because Hussein was power-hungry and wanted things his way instead of the Islamic way &#8211; that&#8217;s all. If you look at the big picture they were and still are in bed together. Also, just because this cell or that is not directly affiliated with Bin Laden or his fundamentalist ways, does not mean you can &#8220;mess&#8221; with them and go untouched.\n \n If you strike Canada, I&#8217;m gonna grab my rifle. So, I agree with GW and his bunch on that: If you are part of the gang you get what the gang gets&#8230;and these extremists know that.\n \n I&#8217;m afraid we have not seen terror like that which will crawl out of the woodwork unless we leave the ME completely or at least come to some kind of mutual agreement with the Islamic leaders. Will that happen, though? I don&#8217;t think so.",

If China had invaded and occupied us under false pretenses I wonder how many Americans would be upset when our women were imprisoned for working for say the Dept of Nuclear energy.
