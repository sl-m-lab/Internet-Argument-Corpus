   "I have a question for all the so called \"people\" that are Christian. If Jesus Christ was our Savior, shouldn't we all be somewhere right now, like Heaven or.....the other less nice Heaven that has Roach Patrol and a noisy ice machine (Jewish Heaven)? Or is Jesus one of those time release saviors that may take a while? Is he coming back again because he apperently wasn't \"man\" enough for the job the first time. Well I don't blame you Jesus. After all, you're only human. Well I said my piece. No pipe bombs.",

Tell us why you hate God (Jesus) and maybe we can stand on common ground. Most of us &#8220;so-called&#8221; people that are Christians have been where you are right now.

   "Im sorry if it pained you to read my post, but it was obvious that you were just avoiding the question by attacking me. Call me childish, but is it so wrong to look at something in an objective light. I'm looking for clarification in the form of a logical argument, but you've just responded the way any person afraid of what that might amount to would. Defamation! I'm sorry I said something less than complimentary about Jesus Christ, but the right thing to do would not be to call me a blasphemer and in clear violation of the universal moral code that was apparently established while I wasn't looking. It would be to answer me in a calm and non-insulting fashion the way any \"adult\" might have a reasonable conversation. You also make the assumption that I hate God(Jesus). Even though I may not believe in the assumption you make with the parenthetical, I don't hate God or Jesus, but I would like to hear an honest answer on Christian belief about these questions. Also, dont slander someone by saying they hate God, that is extemely childish and utterly irrelevant to the conversation at hand. \n \n Oh and by the way, most of the post is meant in jest (the wording mostly), but it does contain real questions that would be interesting to find answers to. So climb down from your ivory tower and answer my post. Or not.",

   "Hey Alucard, I'm afraid I'm going to have to second Big Orn here. And I assure you it is not because I am insulted by blasphemy or wish to avoid answering any question, as I am pretty much as atheist as you can get.\n \n I have no doubt you can express yourself rationally, however your first post did come across sarcastic, aggressive and juvenile. Maybe that wasn't the intention, maybe it was poor wording in jest, but it did not appear to be 'in an objective light'.\n \n If you could re-phrase your question, as I am not entirely sure what you are getting at, I'm sure that Orn, myself and others would be more than happy to discuss it.\n \n Phunting",
