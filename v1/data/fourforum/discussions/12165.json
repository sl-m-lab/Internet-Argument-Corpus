   "1. Is the Bible fallible, or not?\n \n 2. Is the Bible literally true, or not?\n \n 3. Is the value of the Bible dependent on its being literally true, or not?\n\n 1. The bible, and all the many interpretations of it, are fallible. To claim otherwise is to claim that the person who has written the bible/made the interpretation is infallible, which is (as far as I am aware) not something that humans ever are. This is always my issue with people who proclaim an 'absolute truth' - in order for their proclamation to be absolute, the person themselves must be incorruptible (by Satan, if you want to look at it from that point of view) and infallible, which strikes me a little arrogant.\n \n 2. This excuses the second answer - the bible (more specifically, large swathes of the Old Testament) is not literally true. Creationism is observably false - simply by seeing the light from stars that have taken millions of years to get here. There is absolutely zero scientific evidence that supports a 8000-year-old earth - the only 'evidence' that creationists have is perceived holes in 'opposing' theories, nothing that supports their own. Why should all of the Bible be literally true? Jesus never put a 'this didn't really happen' disclaimer in his parables...\n \n 3. The moral/spiritual value of the Bible is not affected by it's literal truth. Many fiction books provide and support good moral behaviour (R.A. Salvatores Drizzt series, Orson Scott Card's Ender series and Catherine Fisher's Book of the Crow all spring to mind) - and while many others don't, this is not because they are works of fiction. If it turned out Jesus' name was actually Brian (mistranslated many years ago), would that affect the message of the bible?\n The bible does not stand and fall as one. If I say 'My name is Ian and I am a giant koala bear', this doesn't imply that I've got my name wrong. If I take it one step further and say \"My name is Ian, I am a giant koala bear, and if I am not a giant koala bear then I am not called Ian\" then all this means that two out of my three statements are false.\n \n NB: as you can see from my reply in the other thread, all of this works under the assumption that God has not messed up logic. Just to be consistent.\n NB2: Good couple of threads, Matthew. I like this sort of thinking...",

   "1. Well anything written by hand is fallible. Man is fallible even when he does his best.\n \n 2. Is the Bible true? Well given the nature of the Bible and all the ideas, teaching and history involved then I would say parts are not true even if the authors are doing their best to describe the indesctibable e.g. Creation. Parts aren't open to being true/not true e.g. Psalms and other teachings. Parts may well be true (if slanted for propaganda purposes) in the historical aspect that is.\n \n The Bible was written, translated and retranslated by so many different people over the millenia (most of them doing their very best) that a single global statement is impossible to answer.\n \n 3. No. Its value is not dependent. Too much goes into its make up. Does its value depend on its story of Creation being literally true ? Of course not.

The data on literal interpretation of the Bible is from a book which you can read via Google. The IQ scores are from the General Social Survey as reported by The Inductivist. I already knew that this sort of correlation existed, it's pretty unsurprising as I noted. The same pattern shows up if you use post-graduate eduation as the dependent variable. And I spot checked SAT scores by denomination, and again the association shows up. All that being said, the title was obviously tongue-in-cheek.\n \n Update: Follow up post....\n \n A few months ago I posted data which showed, unsurprisingly, that Unitarian-Universalists tend to have high IQs and Pentecostals not so much. What about something like Biblical literalism and IQ? Well, I plotted the IQ values from the General Social Survey for selected denominations and plotted them against the proportion which believed in a literal interpretation of the Bible. .... \"\n Gene Expression: Biblical literalism or low IQ: which came first?",
