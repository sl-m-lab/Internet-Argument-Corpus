   "I talked with my father last ngiht when he came to have diner at my house. I asked him if we would ever get in a war with China or Russia. He said no. He said that China and America are allies. We are trade partners and have great power over them.\n He said\n 1. We have more nuclear weapons then they do. \n 2. Our air force would kick their butt.\n 3. They have more ground forces, but size does not matter. The tactics and weaponry used does. \n 4. We would never get into a war with them cause we are allies with them. We have trade with them. Most of our clothes comes from China and other things. Besides, they know as well as we do that we could kick their XXX.\n 5. Russia would not attack us because we would kick their XXX too.\n \n Now, Tsyic said that Russia and China are both nuclear powers. Yes. But, America is a far better nuclear power. We have more than China does. We have a huge stockpile that keeps growing. World War three won't happen in our life time.\n Tsyic, sorry, but you were not accurate with your World War III predictions. Secondly, I urge you to study more. Ask a wise political follower like my father. He studies politics. Not for school or anything. But her reads political books, and watches the news a lot and understands a lot. Plus, he likes government and stuff.\n I would like to hear any disagreement. But, China and Russia would never attack us. Ever!!! The only possible way we would ever get into a war with China is if:\n 1. They attack Taiwan.\n This would result in a atack on China.\n But, that is the only way. Or I guess number two is if we got dumb enough to attack China or vice versa. Which will never happen. So, please write me any disagreements.\n I feel dumb for even beleiving that crock. Daewoo gave you all some great advice about applying yourselves and not beleiving that world war three XXXX. Use that advice. Daewoo and my grandfather are right.\n -John",

   "Lets not forget that China is holding 15% of our debt and has been buying up dollars right and left in order to stabilize our economy so they can keep selling cheap junk to us. \n \n We would not attack or attempt to invade china for ANY reason because if we did, they would win. No question. They would dump those dollars and those bonds on the open market. Our currency would crash. We could not afford to wage wart under those circumstances.\n \n When the re-integration of taiwan comes, I fully expect it to be a strongly worded letter. They know in Taiwan that te can no longer count on the US to protect them. The US has too much to loose. China could level the entire island regardless of US intervention or objection. Taiwan cannot possibly stand against China. China will simply wait until they have consolidated a little more power then announce that they are bringing Taiwan back into the fold. Nobody on the planet, and certainly not the Taiwanese, will be able to do anything about it.",

   "1. We have more nuclear weapons then they do. \n\n That really doesn't matter. China can flatten the US 10 times over, the US can flatten China 100times over. The end result is the same; two dead countries.\n \n If the US attacked Russia or China it would lose. Russia and China would also lose. You cannot 'win' in a nuclear war, where both sides have nuclear weapons.\n \n \nSecondly, I urge you to study more. Ask a wise political follower like my father. He studies politics.
