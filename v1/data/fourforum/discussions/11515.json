   "And since when are Hades or Pluto, for example, considered evil?\n (below is all from wikipedia.org)\n Akuma is an evil spirit in Japanese Mythology (not the devil)\n Angat is not found in either google or wikipedia\n \n Angra Mainyu is credited as another creator god, though one who created sickness and other scourges\n \n In Welsh mythology, Arawn was the king of the otherworld realm of Annwn (ie-not evil, not a demon, not a spirit)\n \n In old Pagan religions pre-dating Christianity, Azazel is viewed and acknowledged as a physical and spiritual being. Azazel is a master of Spiritual Alchemy, Astrology and Constellations he is also highly adept in the arts of crafting jewellery and ornaments. Azazel has gone by many names including but not limited to Utu, Ashur, Shamash and Babbar. Azazel is an upholder of Justice and fights in the name of Truth, he is very dedicated. Azazel is capable of helping those who are loyal and dedicated to truth in achieving Spiritual Perfection. He is depicted having fair skin and golden flowing hair up to his shoulders he is also quite tall\n \n \"Ba'al\" can refer to any god and even to human officials; in some texts it is used as a substitute for Hadad, a god of the rain, thunder, fertility and agriculture, and the lord of Heaven. Since only priests were allowed to utter his divine name Hadad, Ba'al was used commonly.\n Early demonologists, unaware of Hadad or that \"Ba'al\" in the Bible referred to any number of local spirits, came to regard the term as referring to but one personage. Baal (usually spelt \"Bael\" in this context; there is a possibility that the two figures are not connected) was ranked as the first and principal king in Hell, ruling over the East. According to some authors Baal is a duke, with 66 legions of demons under his command. (This is also the origin of Ba'al zebub or Beelzebub)\n \n \n Baphomet is a name of unestablished origin. It first appeared in trial transcripts during the Inquisition of the Knights Templar in the early 1300s. Some modern scholars believe the name to have been an Old French corruption and misspelling of the name Mahomet (Muhammad)[1] (see Etymology for a list of possible origins).\n \n However, in the 19th century the name came into popular English-speaking consciousness with the publication of various pseudo-history works that tried to link the Knights Templar with conspiracy theories elaborating on their suppression. The name Baphomet then became associated with a \"Sabbatic Goat\" image drawn by Eliphas L\u00e9vi.\n \n Behemoth (Hebrew &#1489;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, behemot; Arabic &#1576;&#1607;&#1610;&#1605;&#1608;&#1579; bah&#299;m&#363;th, or &#1576;&#1607;&#1605;&#1608;&#1578; baham&#363;t) is a creature mentioned in the Book of Job, 40:15-24. The word is most likely a plural form of &#1489;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492; (b&#601;h&#275;m&#257;h), meaning beast or large animal. It may be an example of pluralis excellentiae, a Hebrew method of expressing greatness by pluralizing a noun; it thus indicates that Behemoth is the largest and most powerful animal ever to exist. Metaphorically, the name has come to be used for any extremely large or powerful entity.\n \n etc, etc, etc.\n \n \n You just grabbed a list of death/underworld deities and other mythological names, didn't you Archie?",

Many other coutries, such as Sudan, Syria, and good old Saudi Arabia exercise the same methods of corporal punishment and police brutality that you call tortue here. \n\n \n WOW, talk about misinterpreting the complete message? You have perfected the skill paulie. Here's the difference between Sudan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and saddams Iraq. We don't have evidence that those Governments are actively supporting Terrorist attacks by radical islam against us and our allies. \n \n We do know that terrorist groups work out of those Countries, but those Governments have NOT been shown to be culpable in those activities. Unlike saddam, who openly supported terrorist activities to the point of publicly stating, and following through with sending a $25,000.00 CASH BOUNTY in American dollars to the family of any suicide bomber who gave his life on at attack against Israeli or American interests, anywhere on Earth. \n \n Also, only saddam used chemical/biological weapons on the Kurds, citizens of his own Country. He also used them against Iran in the 8 year war they had. We have found evidence of Mass Graves in Iraq where it was proven that genocide's took place against his own people of the other islamic sect. \n Women and children found in Mass Graves here: AND HERE: And here are 4 more pages of mass graves:\n \n Saddam was a paranoid ego maniacal dictator who was so enraged by the USAs first invasion to remove him from Kuwait, that he was dedicated to aiding any common enemy of ours in any way he could in order to get revenge for Bush 1s attack. That makes him a very real threat. Especially since he vowed to destroy us with his own words by his own mouth. I suppose we should just attribute those threats to him having a bad day huh? The solid evidence of his prior atrocities shouldn't have impacted how serious we took his threats at all, right?\n \n So there's a big difference between how Countries carry out corporal punishments according to Shariah Law, and the crimes against humanity that defined who Saddam Hussein was. \n \n \nWe didn't attack Iraq because we cared about stopping torture. We aren't in Iraq to stop fundamentalist islam either. Iraq was one of the least radically islamic countries in the middle east. Saddam wasn't even a muslim and only adopted muslim ideals to gain political favor from his constituents. Geez. After this many years you still haven't even upgraded from this lie?\n\n \n Interesting that you so boldly stated why we aren't in Iraq, but you never said why we are there. I'm positive I'll disagree with you, but feel free to say why you believe we invaded that Country if not for the reasons Bush gave. And btw, saddam was a moslem by birth, just not a very religious moslem at all. But he was a moslem no matter how you slice it.",

And that reasoning was followed for 35 years which just allowed radical islam to attack any country on Earth they chose to without fear of retaliation by anyone. They found a cowardly way to effectively do drive by anonymous shootings with bombs, and because they wore civilian clothes, no Nations could be held accountable. \n \n That is the principle upon which finally standing up to them is the only right thing to do.
