Every time he can actually stand with another canidate and debate issues, he comes out the clear winner. Even at the last major debate where Guliani took him to task about why 9/11 happened Paul ended up getting a major boost in the long run (even though his responses were met with BOOS at the debate itself). In polls taken a week after that debate Paul was the clear winner.\n \n Personally I think it is notable that both parties and the media have done all they can to discredit Paul and marginalize him, but he keeps coming up on top. It is almost like the people are finally realizing that we have some SERIOUS problems in the US that are not going to be solved by glib #######s with snappy sound bites. \n \n It is almost unfortunate that the financial failure that just started will not have had time to accelerate significantly before the primaries. Since it was almost entirely cause by the Fed and their partners on Wall Street, I think that as the economy fails and people realize how badly they were screwed by that little inbred family that Pauls views on the Fed system in general will gain a pretty major following within the voting public.",

The democrats could run a monkey against about any republican in those states and still win. The tragic thing is that it is not the GOP candidates themselves that have sunk them with the Hispanic voters, it is the GOP base that has done it.\n \n White males are not even considered a demographic group for the purposes of political planning because the groups is so big that there is no cohesion at all.

She scores about even with republican candidates when it comes to security and scores much lower when it comes to military matters.\n \n Ultimately, it probably does not matter who the Democrats end up running. The republicans are going to loose. That is why the republican candidates are such a joke this time around. Nobody good wants to run because they don't want to waste a shot at the presidency on an election that they already know they will loose. \n \n 5 years ago the country had a pretty deep political divide. Not so much anymore. The GOP has jsut lost the support of the people. Not only have they lost the moderates they have lost a lot of their base. What they have left are the religous right and ignorant rednecks. That is IT. They have lost the fiscal conservatives, they have lost the libertarians, they have lost the minorities that once supported them (most notably the cubans in florida). \n \n I also think you are attaching FAR too much importance to the strategic intentions of your average voters. Voters in primaries vote for who they like. They do not look into the distant future and strategize about who they think can win agains the other party because they assume that whoever they like the most, others will like the most.

The democrats are beating the republcans by over TEN points. That is HUGE, especially since those \"party only\" polls have proven to be the most accurate predictor of election results...far more accurate than polls that actually use names. \n \n This is one reason I am really hoping for a Ron Paul upset.

No matter what he thinks, or how revolutionary it may be, it comes off as boring because he just can't seem to spice it up.\n \n The problem with him staying in congress, or the idea that he is better in congress, is that he is COMPLETELY marginalized in congress and is not a good enough throat cutter to force people to follow him. \n \n This is part of the reason that I think he actually may have a chance.

Not only that, he can probably steal the entire anti war vote away from her. \n \n The other thing that I think goes in Pauls favor is that other politicians are afraid to attack him...or even disagree with him.

He was basically saying that NOBODY goes head to head with Ron Paul because they know that he does not open his mouth unless he knows he is right and he never gets upset and goes personal. Since his opponent is probably wrong (that \"does not open his mouth unless he is sure he is right\" thing), they have to go personal and they come off looking like a jerk who is wrong insulting a nice guy who is right. \n \n Newt Gingrich was afraid to go up against Ron Paul...even with the entire Republican political machine behind him...which is how we got the \"Ron Paul exemption\" in congress.

Keep in mind that Newt is the guy who shut down the government because he was unhappy with the seating arrangment when he and Bob Dole caught a lift on air force one.\nIt's the fact that he isn't assertive that is the problem with him being president. \n \n Neither him nor Huckabee will ever get the nomination though. Competent people don't get elected these days because they can't do the fake stuff to win...they have to be realistic. \n \n Speaking of Newt though, I've been listening to some of his speeches recently and I must say he actually has some good ideas and makes a lot of sense. He gives one example of how capitalizism works when after a bridge collapsed the state said it would be 2yrs before its back up. They offered the project to bid and stated a reward for finishing early (2,000 a day I think). Turns out the builders got it done in 2 months and made more money getting it done early. Point of the story was if you give the incentive in a capital market you will get results....I believed he related it to health care.",

He lacks credibility when it comes to actions, and you can bet those skeletons would come out of the closet if he actually ran.\n \n I also like the idea of LD style debates for the candidates. You are sure right about it never happening. No way candidates would be willing to actually get up there and make concrete stands on issues. They want to run the country with sound bites and to make sure that the sound bites are always vague enough that they can pretend later that we all just misunderstood their position when it turns out to be terribly wrong.",
