   "Agreed on all points, Broker. The biggest problem with our educational system is (IMHO) that everything is geared towards the slowest, dumbest person in the room.\n \n I also think that there should be programs in place to identify gifted kids and accelerate them. Not just give them advanced classes, but get them out of high school and into college. I dropped out of high school when I was 17, took my GED and was enrolled in college a month later. I wish I had done it sooner (like, uh, when I was 15). \n \n I also think that we need to look very seriosly at the education system as it is today and make sure that more of the money we spend is put towards actually educating the kids. Schools are for learning, not for playing sports. Sure, shop class is a good thing, teaches people how to use hand tools and do some simple wiring. Do they really need a $50,000 CNC mill?\n \n We have just built a couple of new schools around here, and they are monuments to education. They could have built a building that was just as functional for half the money. Kids don't need to be taught in a monument, they need to be taught in a school.\n \n Another example....My brother in law is a teacher in my area. I was reading the paper one day and the school district was whining about lack of funds. I almost felt sorry for them, until my brother in law walked in the door and said \"Look! They just gave all the teachers palm pilots!\". All the teachers and administrators got the nifty sony PDA's with the swivel screen and the keyboard (~$500 each). \n \n Personally, I think that the president of the board of education for your area sould b required to have a business degree before handing the board millions of dollars to spend.",

   "Yeah. Public school's greatest failing. Not dividing by ability. I've said all of this before, but I'll say it again...\n When the classes are grouped together\n 1) the \"faster\" kids seem bored, and I mean really bored (Like me, but no, they said it was ADD or some XXXX. righto. I'm screwed up because the class isn't interesting... so it's MY fault...)\n 2) the \"middle/medium\" kids are all right. Sometimes bored...\n 3) the \"slower\" kids are intimidated, and discouraged.\n \n so..... if you divide by ability we could have a win/win/win situation instead of loose/win/loose.\n \n They've done a good thing by coming up with the PSEO system, but unfortunately you can only access it at/after 11th grade. By then the people looking for a challenge have given up and fallen into the system.\n \n Oh! and now they want to come down on the awards ceremonies and stuff, because it makes others feel left out. What are they going to ban next? Get rid of advanced programs? (like they did at my sister's school). \n \n Then schools need more funding. For what??? more TV's in the lunch room?

My parents met with my algebra teacher who said \"he doesn't pay attention in class and doesn't bother to do his homework.\" They spoke to my guidance councilor who said \"After speaking with his teachers, I think that he has ADD.\" We went to a psychiatrist, who told them, \"He appears to have a firm understanding of quantum mechanics, I don't think that ADD is the problem, I think they are boring him to death.\" \n \n He told my parents that in an experiment, 70% of adults FAILED a basic math class (2+2=4 kind of stuff). Not becuase they couldn't do the math, but because they didn't do most of the coursework. \n \n I saw a report the other day about how ADD is \"on the rise\" in American youth.

   "Basically what we've done with education is gear every single class to the person moving at the slowest pace... the school system is responsible for the decrease in general intelligence.\n \n And it should make everyone feel better to know that this is happening everywhere, not just here. In Britain, for example, more than 50% of people surveyed couldn't give the year when WW II ended. Mind you... this is Britain. :-\\\n \n This is why I hate my elective classes. They're extremely boring... everything is slow. Last semester I basically had a free period because I finished the day's work in 20 minutes.... Accounting is better, but it still feels really, really slow.\n \n What I hated even more was middle school. They only offered advanced math and english... meaning everyone was taking the same science and the same social studies classes. So all of us intelligent people were quite bored and got through the classes with no problem... \n \n Makes me think of my American History class in 8th grade. I did all the assignments and everything, but I never took a set of notes, I never listened to what the teacher said, and I never read what he assigned. Yet on every test and assignment I had at least an A, usually 100%. I just read the textbook on my own... most of it, in fact. I went through probably three times as much as what was covered in the class.\n \n Even last semester in an Pre-IB World History class I felt bored. I read most of that texbook on my own too... \n \n Sometimes I think maybe they should just give me the textbooks for my classes and the assignments and let me run on my own... I'd probably leave school before 11:00.\n \n It's stupid to invest all of our money on the low scale of students. Almost all of them will never amount to anything.

   "I will use as an example one of the school districts around here I am familiar with (because my brother in law is a teacher there). Examples of waste:\n \n Palm pilots for all the teachers and administrators\n $150,000 on furniture expenses for the administrative offices at the high school\n HUGE expendetures for sports programs\n \n \n Lets look at those 3 examples. First off, I run a profitable business. I do not buy all my employees palm pilots. Why? Because, while they are nifty little gadgets, they are not needed to perform most job functions. The palm pilots they got are not actual \"palm pilots\", they are the $500 sonys w/ the swivel LCD and the little built in keyboard. Soon after, they announced that they were seeking more money to put a computer in every classroom. If they had not spent the $500 a pop on nifty little gadgets, they could have bought a computer for every classroom. \n \n I just spend $85,000 on office furniture. I got 40 cubicles w/ desks, chairs, etc... Furnished a confrence room, and furnished 3 private offices. The school district spent $150,000 to provide desks/ chairs for 3 secretaries and to furnish 3 private offices. That is nuts. Yes, it is nice to have really nice, really expensive office furniture. If you run a very sucessful law firm, you can get that furniture. If you are the CEO of GM, you can get that furniture. The administrative office at a high school does not need that furniture, nor do I think it is likely that they deserve $150,000 worth of furniture. \n \n As far as the sports programs go, I understand that some people feel these teach kids valuable skills like teamwork. Personally, I think it teaches the to shut up and do what their coach tells them. The studies on this have been divided. If a school wants a sports program and can recover the cost through ticket sales and fundraisers, fine. If they are taking money away from academic programs for sports, not fine. We send our kids to school to LEARN, not to play. I think that realistically corporate sponsorship programs could be instituted to pay for sports programs in schools where costs could not be covered by ticket sales.\n \n Another thing that burns me up is CNC mills and lathes in school wood shops/metal shops. These things are NOT CHEAP (to the tune of $50,00 and up). Why do they need these? First off, there is generally nobody at the school who actually knows how to operate them correctly. A good CNC operator starts at about $40,000 per year, and it goes up from there. If the shp teacher really knew how to program the thing, he would most likely be making 60-80K somehwere doing it. Learnign to work with a CNC machine is a skill that 99.9997% of those kids will never use again, just for the fact that there just aren't that many of them out there. The kids who do end up using one again will have to undergo specialised training, and what the learned in high school is basically worthless.\n \n As far as what tyo do about it.......First, I think we need to hold schools accountable. We need to end the philosophy of \"throw money at it until it works\". We need an open book policy when it comes to where money is going. I don't just mean being able to see the budget, I mean seeing exactly what was spent and where. Third, I think we need to abolish school boards as they are now. I realise the people ont hem usually have good intentions, but allowing any swinging dick out there to be the head of the school boar is nuts. If we are going to hand over tens of millions of dollars, and in some cases hundreds of millions of dollars, to a school board to use to run an organization efficiently, the board at LEAST needs to be headed by either somebody with a business degree or somebody with experience int he business field. Our local schoolboard is headed by a woman who has not had a job since 1972, when she was a waitress in high school. \n \n I believe the ideal solution would be privitization of the school system. If we turn each school district into a ittle company, kids would get educated. Companies run a lot more efficiently than the government does (I would challenge anybody to find me a case where this is not true). Private schols are already turning a profit, and they are doing it with less money per student, they are paying their teachers more, and they are turning out a better educated kid. What is the downside here?\n \n As far as obtaining ACT/SAT/standardised testing scores, if I remember correctly, I requested them from the principal of the schools. The scores are not public insofar as you can call up and say \"what did joe schmoe get on his sat\", bu the results are available, broken down by school, for statistical study if I rememebr right. Like I said, it had been a few years. If the administration of the school you are inquiring about wil not provide them, you might contact your states board of regents. They most likely have the numbers you need all nicely pre-packaged in their own studies. DONT TAKE THE PREPACKAGED STUDY. Tell them you want the raw data.",

Is the government just to pick up the tab for whatever it costs? If so, that wouldn't encourage competition, and effficiency, it wouldn't seem...\n\n \n I over simplified when I said \"privatize the districts\" What I believe woud be much better as far as scompetition and ensureing good educational standards is a cap on per-student expenditures, then a sliding scale as far as what the company actually gets based on standardised tesing scores. You could allow each school to be run by a seperate little company, or allow a single company to own a few different schools. Competition would be encouraged by giving kids/parents the right to choose what school they attend. The better schools would attract more students (increasing their revenue) and lesser schools would be forced to improve, or risk going out of business. \n \n I have not really seen much debate on the privitization of schools, my plan is one I thought up all by my lonesome. We have seen how government operates, they blow money right and left and \"screw the bottom line\". Government agencies know that if they don't spend all the money they get this year, they won't get a budget increase next year (my father was a firechief for a lot of years. This really IS how it works). Private corporations on the other hand, have an incentive (profit) to keep an eye on the bottom line and to find more efficient and more cost effective ways to do things. \n \n You can bet your butt that if a private corporation found that they could educate kids better, thus getting more money per student and improving their bottom line, by installing computers at every desk in every classroom, there WOULD BE a computer at every desk in every classroom. If they could attract better teachers by offering more money to start, they would (and in most cases private schools do offer higer starting salaries). \n \n I can see two big stumbling blocks to this.\n \n The first is that the government does NOT like to loose control of things. Although they have proven to be a big, lumbering, inefficient entity when it comes to education, I think that it would take a great deal of \"motivation\" to get this klind of measure passed.\n \n The second problem I can forsee is in places where people are used to electing their school board. I think that a lot of folks out there would see the privitization of schools as loosing control of their kids education. I think that if we could do a \"trial run\" somewhere, people would see that they weild a lot more power by being able to remove their child and put them in another school (costing the corporation money) that they do with thier school board vote. \n \n Unfortunatly, it seems that a lot of people end up on the school board who are very interested in trying to improve education, but have no realistic idea of how to do it. I also think that the vast majority of them have trouble with the concept of balancing a 100 million dollar (or in many cases more)budget. They look at that number and go \"WOW, that's a lot of money\" then they go on a \"spending spree\", approving funding requests that shouldn't be approved.\n \n It just seems to me that we have tried it this way, and it obvioulsy does not work.\n \n I had occasion a while back to see a State of Kansas board of regents GED practice test. I could have passed it in the seventh grade, no problem. According to the Board of Regents, they designed the test with the idea that a high school senior should be able to pass it with an 80%. They tested high school seniors with it, and the average score was 82%. \n \n The test had basic algebra on it, basic reading comprehension, basic science, and basic english (punctuation). If that is what high school seniors are expected to know when they graduate, I am going to encourge my kids to watch the discovery channel, teach them math on my own, and have them take the test in fourth grade. Why waste 8 years? \n \n You do have a valid point about schools being about more than just subject matter. They teach social interaction. Of course, they seem to be failing at this too (do a google search for \"columbine\"). Also, I think that \"subject matter\" should be in there SOMEWHERE.\n \n Draconis, take your SAT or ACT (whatever they use in your part of the country). If you score well, contact whatever college you want to go to and find out what their policy is as far as admitting people with a GED. If an acceptable GED score plus a good ACT/SAT score will get you in, go to your folks and tell them you want to go to college next year. Take them your ACT/SAT score, as well as the information from the college you want to go to, and see if they will let you take the GED and go on to college next year. \n \n Most colleges, as long as you have an acceptable ACT/SAT score and a GED have no problem with letting you in (I know MIT has no problem with it, no does Harvard). See if your folks will go for it.",

   "Couple of points:\n 1. Schools should divide the kids out, maybe through yearly tests or something (that's just preaching to the choir).\n 2. Schools are the biggest wasters of money in the world, especially public schools. I came from a private grade school and went to a public high school and the grade school actually taught me through freshmen, maybe sophomore year in math, science, 11th grade in English/Composition, etc, etc. Not only that, but the private school teachers complained every day about lack of funding, and you could see that they did lack it. The public school teachers? They complained about their pay but you could tell that they were getting more.\n 3. Privatize the school system but have a government code on what must be taught. This will eliminate that waste and will also make the schools teach to a higher level because they must keep their \"customers\" in their school, where they are challenged.\n 4. I believe boys have a higher number of ADD cases. That may be due to them actually having it, to them being smarter, or (most likely) to the fact that society wants everyone to sit down and shut up, and boys are a bit more rebellious/strong willed.\n 5. There are a number of courses in our high school that are complete trash. Who needs to know aquatics? Financial management? Keyboarding? If you want to teach kids a skill, start more tradeschools with all of the metal/wood shop equipment, cosmetics stuff, and mechanic areas. Leave the high schools to the intellectuals who don't really care about high school but want to get into a good college.\n 6. Have you ever noticed that if you don't give the \"book answer\" then you are wrong? I notice this particularly in AP English when we analyze short stories and poems. If I say that a character is flat because _____ and static because _____ I'm wrong because a main character is always emoticon_rolleyes emoticon_rolleyes round and dynamic. I'm using English as an example because it is one of the most BS classes in the world (I swear it allows you to master bureaucratese so that you can become a politician), but I'm sure others have experienced such things in history or science. And then all of the revisionist/feel-good history is taught that Columbus killed the Indians (oh, excuse me, Native Americans), that the white male is to blame for all of the problems in the world, etc, etc.\n 7. Maybe we should just go back to students living with a philosopher/scientist/whomever to learn their trade. More could get done though there would not be as much cross-referencing.",

I think it an attempt to offer too diverse a curriculum that is one of the great problems the schools have. \n \n Again, I will use the CNC machine in the shop class as an example. While this is a very nifty, and very expensive gadget, it does nothing as far as helpig prepare kids for the \"real world\". The skills they arguably gain from using the machine are basically worthless outside of shop class. I have debated this point often with a shop teacher from one of our local high schools. HE claims i teaches the kids to use autocad, and to program a CAM machine. I have seen the stuff they do, and as sombody who soends a good deal of time and money trying to find and hire CAM operators, I can say empatically that their experience is worthless. You simply cannot teach somebody the proper way to operate either a cad system OR a cam system in an hour per day, even if you do it for 4 school years. I would further note that if the shop teacher really knew how to properly operate a CAM system, he would be working for me, or somebody like me, and makng in excess of $60,000 per year (my cam operators top out at $115,000). \n \n IT can also be argued that it is more difficult to re-tain somebody who has been trained improperly than it is to train somebody from scratch, so their previous \"training\" is actually an impediment.",

   "I'll just voice what I think many people have been saying. Intelligence is useless without discernment (the ability to use it wisely when needed). Unfortunately, until we can figure out a way to better teach wisdom, I think that the whole intelligence debate is pointless. \n \n One way that we may be able to get kids to show better judgment is to require that they read a certain number of books each year. While many will say that that does not increase wisdom, I think that it will give kids exposure to more situations and the ability to recognize those situations when they experience them themselves. Either that, or they can transcribe the book of Proverbs six times emoticon_smile . But I move that we change the debate from how to increase intelligence to how to increase absorption, understanding, and application.",
