Males do not differ much from their primate counterparts, but females have such things as enlarged breasts and wider hips. What evoultionary advantage do they bring?\n\n \n Human babies have wider heads, I believe, therefore wider hips are necessary. I'm not sure about enlarged breasts but how enlarged are they anyways? Perhaps since human males put an emphasis on large breasts natural selection has done the job of carrying on this characteristic and overtime changed what the average breast size is.",

   "I think AMD4EVER has the answer. There isn't one reason that the female body is the way it is. Of course, wide hips allow for easier childbirth and thus both mother and child are likely to survive. Add to that the fact that men like the shape of women, breasts and all. Probably they are a bit larger than necessary and that may be due to sexual selection.\n \n However, if you think this is an A cup, then think again.\n \n http://www.visualsunlimited.com/images/watermarked/645/64579.jpg",

   "Most of the relevant points have already been mentioned, but I'd just like to point out that any male perference for a certain female body type is likely to be the *result* of its bearing on child-birth and fertility.\n \n For example, the hip-waist ratio seems to be a solid morphological indicator of the levels of sex hormones. Singh (1993) found that, for girls of the same body weight, those with a lower HWR were subject to earlier pubertal endocrine activity. More interestingly, Zaastra et al (1993) found that even tiny increases in HWR correlate with large decreases in probability of conception per cycle.\n \n There is bilateral symmetry, which Moller & Thornhill (1999) find universally important in mate attractiveness across cultures. There is an extensive literature (review by Moller & Swaddle, 1997) showing that asymmetry is caused by both environmental and genetic insults, suggesting it is an important phentypic marker of genetic quality (that is, freedom from detrimental alleles).\n \n And of course, there is age, but that should be obvious.\n \n My point is that female beauty is not some independent criteria, but a way our (read, \"male\") genes tell us we've stumbling upon a female who would be better than most at helping us pass them into the next generation.\n \n -GFA",

It seems that the bonobos, at least, do engage in homosexual behavior, both male and female. But they aren't in any danger of going extinct because of that. The biggest danger is that they will be wiped out by human hunters in search of bush meat.\n \n By the way, a highly likely source of the transmission of the SIV virus to humans is bush meat. Either a hunter was bitten by his prey, or someone ate inadequately cooked meat. But what the heck. We humans have dominion over the earth.

It just means the theory was based on the idea that major changes had to occur over a long period of time. I don't think the theory of evolution would be proven false if a dog gave birth to a dog that could fly in just one generation. In my opinion that would prove that the basic premise of the evolutionary theory was correct although the finer points were off. If the basic premise was shown to be correct in such a dramatic fashion then I think the theory of evolution would become widely accepted. Would you actually do the reverse and deny that the theory of evolution was valid at least in it's basic idea?",
