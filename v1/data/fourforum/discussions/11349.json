In 2006, only 38.9 percent of charter students scored at or above the proficiency level in English. \n \n This year it was 57.5 percent. &#8220;I think, overall, they&#8217;ve done extremely well,&#8221; said Robert M. Bennett, chancellor of the state Board of Regents. \n \n That&#8217;s not to say there aren&#8217;t examples where charters didn&#8217;t perform as well as expected this year, Bennett said. \n \n And on average, math and English proficiency at city charters is lower than it is for all schools statewide &#8212; 81 percent in math and 69 percent in English. \n \n Bennett, who has been a big advocate of charter schools, pointed to several city charters performing well and expressed his desire to see more of the schools across the state. \n \n &#8220;They&#8217;re no longer an experiment,&#8221; Bennett said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve proven themselves.&#8221; \n\n \n =snip=\n \n Well, well, well. It looks like the Charter Schools continue to hand the District schools their collective heads. Gotta love it.",

Absolutely no teacher accountability. My daughter attends the same school I did back in the 70s. I saw signifigant improvement there, but if I can, I would love to transfer her to a charter. The other thing that I find amazing is that these idiot Union reps and others who wish to maintain the Old Guard is their claim that \"Charters only take the best and the brightest\" Not true.

More recently the City has started phasing out large middle schools, also replacing them with smaller schools.\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx\n \n (1) Tell me that you'd send one of your own daughters to one of these public high schools, living in the South Bronx, too, before you'd send her to one of the three charters cited and described in articles here.\n \n You, too, Electrolyte.\n \n Chester:\n \n (2) Let's imagine we're in the eighties, and the schools haven't closed or downsized.

For the parents being commonsensical, their child's ability to put on elaborate 'constructivist' shows, but virtually illiterate, to their horror, with very basic problem solving. In other words, the constructivists weren't teaching problem solving. They were just teaching a type of performance that was disfunctional.\n \n The curriculum promised great fruits, many years later, down the road.\n \n Use your own lab rats, said the parents, of common sense and higher mathematical training.\n \n Now, the National Math Standards people are saying, indeed, we were wrong. The parents were right. Sorry you were up until midnights when you work in the fields all day in the sun. \n \n Whoops. \n \n The whole child, on top of that, could have been having quality family time.

We aren't supposed to police them and raise them. That's the parents' job. Sure, we'll play a role, we'll be role models, but we aren't ultimately responsible for your kid. Why? It's your kid. If we're having trouble with your kid, and our methods are not working, we need your help. In the vast majority of these cases, how much cooperation do you think we get from parents?\n \n antonia: We respect families' rights. We're obligated to do so. But there is family responsibility that's not up to snuff. It's usually when parents don't participate properly that problems escalate, and parents (of more than just that student) get all bent out of shape.\n \n antonia: You're right. If you want a good district, get parents who realize that the schooling of their kids doesn't stop when the last bell rings.\n Try bitching out the slacker parents for a change. Teachers have specialized education and training, certification, professional development, critique and observation; the only universal for parents is that they have sex organs.\n \n I think it's hilarious that you two are slapping each other on the back with big sh**-eating grins, saying these things that you swear up and down are true... and can't see that you're describing the problem with your position.",
