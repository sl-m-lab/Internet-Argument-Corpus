Trasnscript, please.\n \n \n2) Ethmi claims I was saying \"All McCain supporters are a bunch of greedy liars, no exceptions.\" ???\n emoticon_xdonno\n No.\n Again, I invite people to review the CONTEXT of what was said and you'll clearly see I did not say that.\n \n\n \n Since you seem to be a big fan of technicalities (as you demonstrated when you accused me of lying for using the term \"Osama\"),\n \n \n\n WHY can't we get a McCain supporter to HONESTLY discuss these issues?\n WHY can't we get a McCain supporter to HONESTLY discuss these issues?\n WHY can't we get a McCain supporter to HONESTLY discuss these issues?\n WHY??????\n\n \n \n3) I think this is essentially Ethmi's attempt to whine about me.\n If you look at the thread, you'll see that I last responded to Ethmi, and then Ethmi dropped the ball.\n If Ethmi has any REAL interest in discussing that issue, then Ethmi should respond to what was said IN that thread.\n But I don't think Ethmi has any real interest in that at all ...\n\n \n I know what was really said. What I want is transcript and sufficient evidence to prove that Obama had no intentions to bankrupt the coal industry. What I want to know is why you conclude that when Obama bluntly stated that his policies would bankrupt the coal industry. Is that so difficult?",

   "That's not the point.\n\n I think that is EXACTLY the point.\n You pop up on that GAY thread, whining about statements made in the ELECTION DEBATES thread, and now you want to insist that the \"election debates\" thread comments weren't what you were talking about?\n \n Take a look around. These \"challenge\" threads usually start out with a SPECIFIC ISSUE that involves what the \"challenge\" regards.\n This thread is opened up with the header \"elsewhere\", and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize what you want to do.\n You want to AVOID EXPLICITLY stating what you want this to be about, so you can bounce around all sorts of different comments, abandoning them if they prove inconvenient.\n You want to exclusively define the parameters of this debate on the fly.\n \n \n \nLink, please.

And you want to do it SEPARATELY from the already established discussion, so you will be less troubled by what we were ALREADY discussing.\n Jo Bennett just gave an excellent response to your complaint. You should start with that.\n \n And if you \"want\" that, can I say that I want the SAME from McCain, who was advocating SIMILAR RESTRICTIONS upon the coal industry???\n \n \n \nWhat I want to know is why you conclude that when Obama bluntly stated that his policies would bankrupt the coal industry.

New coal is a bad idea and a financial disincentive is perfectly sensible.\n\n And going a step further with an INTELLIGENT discussion...\n I think Obama's point was obvious. And this has ALREADY BEEN EXPLAINED to Ethmi.\n \n The coal industries EXISTING plants will go on. They will pump out energy. They will continue to supply the consumer, UNAFFECTED by the \"NEW\" coal fired power station restrictions.\n The coal industry will look at the situation and see it is not cost-effective to build a NEW plant, but they already have the EXISTING energy business with the EXISTING coal fired power stations.\n The coal industry stays in business, but it cannot build NEW plants.\n \n I would be curious how many new plants are built in a year...\n I went looking, and I found other interesting tidbits regarding what is CURRENTLY going on...\n Bleeding Heartland:: EPA ruling is blow to new coal-fired power plants (updated)",
