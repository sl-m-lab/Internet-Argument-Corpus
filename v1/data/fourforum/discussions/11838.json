   "Get ready for a rebound in gas prices as OPEC has just agreed to cut oil production by 1.5 millions barrels a day. It should be noted that Iran and Venezuela have led the charge to decrease production, as their economies depend on higher oil prices. I'm just waiting for energy independence... it is a shame I'll be waiting a very very long time...

   "I think you can see that oil prices are skipping irrespectively of oil production volume and it becomes painfully clear that situation around oil market is actually a plot! \n The main idea of this plot is to weaken if not ruin boosting economics of such countries as China, Russia e.g. I suspect they've been added by D.C. to the list of 'axis of evil' countries due to there recent successes exactly. Washington with its close ally Tel Aviv could resort to even more outrageous means to weaken or destroy the 'sworn enemies'. I mean current global crisis here. The global crisis is method of Washington and Tel Aviv fight against 'axis of evil' and oil is the weapon of it!\n What I think that now it's the right time to abandon dollar as major currency in oil trade so that to diminish American dominance in shaping oil prices on the market. \n Am I right guys?",
