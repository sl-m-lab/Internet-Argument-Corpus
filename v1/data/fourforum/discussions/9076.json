Remember 9-11 was never really investigated; it was whitewashed and covered up. This so-called president is involved up to his ears in treason; plain and simple. He never even wanted a 9-11 investigation. He put up the appearance of an investigation, and had to be compelled to do that. When two phantom aircraft hit two skyscrapers and three buildings implode we have a real problem. When the Bush administration claims flight 77 hit the pentagon, and no traces of the wreckage from this huge aircraft can be found in any of the photos we have treason. This Israeli P.R. man pretending to be an American president is not in anyway making America safer. 9-11 happened while he was in office; this twisted backward mind control logic which implies George Bush is making America safer is simply \"STUPID\".",

A wide range of instruments are under consideration, Zhou added. \n The dollar slumped to a two-month low against the euro following his comments. The Europe's shared currency is seen as the most obvious alternative as a reserve currency. See Currencies. \n\n \n \nA number of countries, including Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Russia all announced intentions this year to diversify their reserves away from dollars. \n\n \n Now, the truly horrifying part. In the past, China has just drawn down their currency reserves...literally cash. \n \n \nOfficials in Beijing have also repeatedly hinted that China might gradually reduce its purchases of dollar-denominated assets. China's reserves increased by a massive $850 billion in the past five years, said Crescenzi. About 72% of China's reserve assets were denominated in U.S. dollars. \n\n \n So, not only are they questioning the ultimate value of our currency, they are doubting the long term solvency of our government issued bonds. Apparently they have a dim view of the \"full faith and credit of the US government\".\n \n Why do yoiu suppose that is, since our economy is doing so well? \n \n With the \"soft landing\" scenario off the table for housing decline, the \"economic armageddon\" model seems to have taken center stage.\n \n There has been a perceptible change in forecasts based on the democrats takeover of congress, but not for the reason you might assume. Iraq war spending, with its commonly accepted flowthrough multiplier of 5.24%, is literally the only thing that has kept the US out of recession for the last several years. Economic entities are somewhat concerned that the democrats will slow war spending, thus sending us into recession. A friend (and the president of one of the largest banks in the nation) said \"You have to wonder if this is the one that will finally destroy America\".\n \n He is not kidding. We have been running an unsustainable economy for 30+ years, using various gimmicks and shell games to stay afloat. We are running out of neat tricks.",

Knwoing the proper name may help you find the report. \n \n Unfortunatly, if in looking for the report you accidentally learn something about the laffer curve, you are goign to feel pretty silly. The laffer curve/laffer curve theory does not state that lowering taxes will raise revenue...it is a theory related to taxable income elasticity and states that there is an optimal level of taxation, unique to current economic conditions, that will maximize government revenue.\n \n Unfortunatly, like so many othe basic economic concepts (and the laffer curve really is a basic one...it was first expalined not by laffer, but by an islamic cholar whose name escapes me in the 14th century), people who lack a basic understanding of economics fail to fully understand the laffer curve and how it works.\n \n There is a famous quote from David Stockman, Reagans budget director, that addresses the misconceptions of the Laffer curve:\n \n \n[T]he whole California gang had taken [the Laffer curve] literally (and primitively). The way they talked, they seemed to expect that once the supply-side tax cut was in effect, additional revenue would start to fall, manna-like, from the heavens. Since January, I had been explaining that there is no literal Laffer curve. \n\n \n Basically, in order for taxation to have an adverse effect on the economy, taxes have to be at a high enough level to interfere with the availability of expansion capital. \n \n Since the demand for expansion capital has been flat in the US for a number of years, the level of taxation is has obviously not been high enough to impact it.\n \n In the real world, our ghost good economy (relatively good numbers while the middle class slowly shrinks into oblivion) is the result of the Iraq war. The massive government spending and associated flow through has bolstered the US economy.\n \n When viewed in this light, a lot of the seemingly nonsensical things the Bush adminsitration has done make sense. For example, bringing in US contractors to do things in Iraq that could have been done MUCH easier, cheaper, and better, by foreign comapnies, or even Iraq companies. By massively overpaying haliburton to build bridges and deliver supplies, when there are thousands of out of work Iraq truck drivers and construction workers who are more than willing to work for 1/50 of what the imported American workers, the bush admninistraiont kept the cost of those projects from being recorded as capital outflow and being recorded as part of our deficit. Instead, they are counted as internal transactions and added to our GDP. \n \n In reality, this amounts to the US goverrment borrowing money and then giving it away since the net ebnifit of this spening is seen outside the US (new bridges, schools, etc... in Iraq), BUT, it is a neat accounting gimmick that leads economic dilettants to praise our strong economy.",

   "What youa re talkign about is the Laffer curve. Knwoing the proper name may help you find the report. \n...and the Great Carnac is mistaken...again. The report I'm looking for is in hard copy somewhere among the mounds of trees I have stored in my own private library. I don't recall the numbers presented in it, but I do recall no mention of a \"Laffer\" curve. What it does is compare the historical tax rates of various governments (worldwide...not just the USA) alongside the historical leading economic indicators for the same governments and shows that growing economies and increased government revenues generally follow decreased taxation.\n \n \n \n\n Unfortunately, if in looking for the report you accidentally learn something about the laffer curve, you are goign to feel pretty silly. The laffer curve/laffer curve theory does not state that lowering taxes will raise revenue...it is a theory related to taxable income elasticity and states that there is an optimal level of taxation, unique to current economic conditions, that will maximize government revenue. \nI won't be searching the web for it...and I am certainly aware that decreasing taxes too much will decrease the government's revenue. It's finding where the derivative of the economy curve is zero (at a maximized economy) that is important. It's akin to finding the Thevinin equivalent circuit for maximizing power transmitted by impedance matching...only the proper value will work...anything over or under will decrease the output.\n \n \n \n\n Unfortunatly, like so many othe basic economic concepts (and the laffer curve really is a basic one...it was first expalined not by laffer, but by an islamic cholar whose name escapes me in the 14th century), people who lack a basic understanding of economics fail to fully understand the laffer curve and how it works.\nUnfortunately, you are prematurely arguing a point that I will likely not attempt to cover.\n \n \n \n\n There is a famous quote from David Stockman, Reagans budget director, that addresses the misconceptions of the Laffer curve:\n \n \n \n Basically, in order for taxation to have an adverse effect on the economy, taxes have to be at a high enough level to interfere with the availability of expansion capital. \n \n Since the demand for expansion capital has been flat in the US for a number of years, the level of taxation is has obviously not been high enough to impact it.\n \n In the real world, our ghost good economy (relatively good numbers while the middle class slowly shrinks into oblivion) is the result of the Iraq war. The massive government spending and associated flow through has bolstered the US economy.\nYou attribute nothing to the tax relief we've experienced. Regardless of how slight, any tax increase causes more procrastination in releasing capital expenditures for small businesses. Allowing people to spend their money as they please instead of on whatever the government whims call for will increase cash flow and government revenues. When the liberals see that revenues have decreased as a result of higher taxes, their immediate response is to raise taxes even higher in a vain attempt to make up the difference. This causes even more holding onto of investment and expansion capital and decreases the government revenue even further.\n \n \n \n\n When viewed in this light, a lot of the seemingly nonsensical things the Bush adminsitration has done make sense. For example, bringing in US contractors to do things in Iraq that could have been done MUCH easier, cheaper, and better, by foreign comapnies, or even Iraq companies. By massively overpaying haliburton to build bridges and deliver supplies, when there are thousands of out of work Iraq truck drivers and construction workers who are more than willing to work for 1/50 of what the imported American workers, the bush admninistraiont kept the cost of those projects from being recorded as capital outflow and being recorded as part of our deficit. Instead, they are counted as internal transactions and added to our GDP. \n \n In reality, this amounts to the US goverrment borrowing money and then giving it away since the net ebnifit of this spening is seen outside the US (new bridges, schools, etc... in Iraq), BUT, it is a neat accounting gimmick that leads economic dilettants to praise our strong economy.\nWhat you don't seem to know is that Iraqi companies are participating quite heavily in the reconstruction efforts. There's a system similar to our own MBE program that forces most contracts for construction to include Iraqi and Women owned companies as major players, thus causing the same inefficiencies, cost overruns and communications problems we've experienced here with our Affirmative Action programs.\n \n I'm not denying the existence of inflated costs in dealing with the Haliburtons and Bechtels in Iraq. Just as Kofi Onan was ruthlessly corrupt in the Iraqi oil for food program sponsored by our impotent United Nations, there are two many \"hundred dollar toilet seats\" being installed in Iraq today. However, there are far more companies than the well-known, American giants working in Iraq. I am personally involved in a project using a French company as a sole source. My company is involved in other projects using nothing but Iraqi, Afghan and Kuwaiti contractors. You are merely regurgitating the liberal, Bush-basher talking points...as expected of you.",

Which is more beneficial to the economy? Duh!\n\n \n You seem to be blocking out the fact that none of that makes any difference if you're not injecting new capital into the system; profits from positive trade, war spoils, whatever you want to use. Without that positive injection all you're doing for expansion is printing new dollars that leave your system. Those deficits you want to ignore when discussing tax rates are creating your economic expansion through debt. Tax it anyway you want, low, medium or high, you have to continue printing money to expand your economy and face the consequences of monetary inflation. \n \n If the US still had a powerful industrial sector dominating world markets, we'd still be transferring wealth from other countries into our system for economic expansion. Then lowering capital gain taxes would stimulate the US economy by injecting more of those profits back into our system to build more factories to produce more volume and consequently produce more tax revenue. See many US factories being built? \n \n In a transaction economy driven by consumer and government spending such as we now have all lowering capital gain taxes does is produce lower taxation for a small percentage of the population who certainly aren't stupid enough to invest in US manufacturing industries.\n \n The general public does not invest, nor do they realize any long-term benefit from any capital gain tax reduction in the current economic climate as those tax savings are not invested in US industries that provide jobs producing value added exports to bring in new national wealth. You're taking the same dollar and taxing it out of existence in a service economy with no new source of income other than printing new money facilitated by debt. \n \n Accelerated depreciation for small business viewed as a tax cut without the ability to affect balance of payment for true economic expansion, regardless of how far down the food chain they are, is typical of short-term political BS. All that means is a few more trucks/equipment purchased now instead of later with the same result, an internal transaction economy eats the dollars up and you have to print new ones for economic expansion by selling debt at the point of a gun.\n \n You can put all the tax cuts you want into play within an internal transaction economy. Call them whatever you want. The general public eats up that concept. Fool yourself that because investors have more disposible income it'll be put back into the economy to generate economic expansion. It will, but not the kind of expansion that benefits anyone but the haves, pushing have-nots lower on the bottom side of a two-tiered society in a service economy. Welcome to a declining empire. \n \n You're neglecting the fact that as an investor I personally appreciate capital gain tax reductions. I'm just trying to point out to you what tax cuts do to the majority of people who work for wages for a living in a declining service economy. It won't be pretty for the uneducated or those with skills no longer in demand. And they are the majority.",

I do not attribute any good effects to the tax breaks....becuase there are none. With interest rates at record lows, and demand for expansion capital flat, there is simply no possible way that there was a positive effect there. Companies that have needed epxansion capital for the last several years have simply borrowed it. \n \n The largest increase in cash flows since the tax cuts has been....government spending. The war in Iraq is literally the only thing that has kept us from slipping into a severe recession, and in order to generate transactions at those levels, you have to spend money, and that money has to go somewhere. The tax cuts, coupled with increased federal spending, have literally pushed the Us to the point of insolvency. John snow LITERALLY stoon on the floor of the senate and told them that the US would be literally bankrupt in 8 weeks if we lost the ability to borrow money. We have foreign central banks dumping their dollar reserves . Considering the fact that nearly 60 percent fo all the worlds dollars are being held as currency reserves, and that 53%of our outstanding debt is being held by foreigners, most as part of theri reserves, this is a SERIOUS problem. These banks are playing chicken with the dollar while they try to figure out a way to dump it without destroying it completely, thus devaluing their remaining reserves. \n \n This is thanks to our expanding deficit, which is largely thanks to the Bush tax cuts.\n \n \nWhat you don't seem to know is that Iraqi companies are participating quite heavily in the reconstruction efforts. There's a system similar to our own MBE program that forces most contracts for construction to include Iraqi and Women owned companies as major players, thus causing the same inefficiencies, cost overruns and communications problems we've experienced here with our Affirmative Action programs.\n \n I'm not denying the existence of inflated costs in dealing with the Haliburtons and Bechtels in Iraq.

Halliburton has over 4000 American truck drivers in Iraq being paid between $125,000 and $250,000 per year, and they are billed to the DOD at twice that rate. \n \n I am ot laying out some left wing lunatic fringe anti bush theroy here. This has been openly discussed on several occasions. Under 20% of the money spent in Iraq has gone to non US companies and non US citizens, and it is becuase they want that money to bolster our economy and not show up as an expansion of our current account deficit. You can argue against it all you want, but youa re just going to make yourself look stupid. Dick Cheney was the one who originally expalined it. Call him up and tell him he is wrong if you want. when asked why we had US companies doing the work there instead of local or foreign firms who could do it much cheaper, he said \"Because money paid to US firms bolsters the US economy\".\n \n There is no trick or secret there. Our leadership is admittedly paying these US companies, and payin ghtem INCREDIBLY well, in order to bolster our economy, and all it takes is a calsualtor (or a piece of paper and a pen if you paid attention in math class) to figure out that wihtout all this debt based \"bolstering\", we would be in deep doo doo.",

Before you dismiss that, keep in mind that the depression was ended though massive federal spending going into WWII.\nI certainly don't disagree here. Massive government spending, especially when the money is spent at home, spurs cash flow. In order for the government to spend, the government must acquire, through taxes or borrowing with interest some monies through bond issues or loans, both of which must be repaid.\n \n In order for a tax-cut-pushed spending spree to happen, the government doesn't have to spend anything.

None was printed.\n \n What's wrong with this picture?\n\n \n Go buy virtually any consumer product and look at the manufacturing country of origin. Americans don't buy US made consumer goods and you know our BOP status. Look at vehicles (as goes GM goes the economy?), Toyo will be the #2 in the US this year. Look at the housing industry (especially material suppliers). Capital demand in the US has been flat for years. What products are going to be made here and who's going to buy them? Burgers and fat people?\n \n Here's an interesting thought to dwell on:\n \n Ford and GM total market caps are now around $35-billion. Thanks to current administration we burn through that amount of borrowed money in four months in Iraq. And you see US industry expanding and selling products other than death to other countries? No one wants our products and considers them junk. Even Americans aren't dumb enough to buy what few consumer products are still made here other than some specialty markets. We even became a net importer of food last year. \n \n Sorry, can't even imagine your scenario being possible until the US standard of living drops to where hungry crowds straighten out our thoroughly corrupted system.",

   "Dear daewoo, I thought you knew everything!\n \n It stands to reason that a low RATE of return dictates a long payout time. \n\n \n No, some investemtns just have a low rate of return regardless of the timeframe. The payout time is fixed and is based on the expected product life. The rate of return is based on production costs and investment. What you are really probably talking about here is recapturing costs.\n \n \n \nFirst you say tax cuts don't spur consumer spending, then you say the taxes are spent (I'm assuming you refer to the excess taxes that were cut from the consumer's tax burden. If not, what do you mean \"the taxes are spent?)\n\n \n The taxes are spent by the government on goods and services. This is not a complicated concept. What did you think happened to our tax dollars?\n \n \nDear daewoo, I thought you knew everything. Just because there is capital available doesn't mean the formula for profitable use of it is in place. Lowering the taxes skews the picture to be more favorable for expansion spending. There's a point where the bean counters say, \"Let's do it.\" In my scene, this comes after the tax cut, because of the tax cut. It may have been that the bean counters detected an increase in demend because of the increased spending by consumers because of the tax cut, but it still came about because of the tax cut. \n\n \n BS. This is what you are missing in your sophmoric scenario and thought process here. Lowerign the taxes DOES NOT INCREASE CONSUMER SPENDING. It never has. This is because you are essentially talking the SAME amount of money in the consumer pool, it is just being circulated differently. TAX CUTS DO NOT INCREASE CONSUMER SPENDING. They never have. The very idea is idiotic. In fact, if anything, there may be a slight increase in consumer spending due to increased government spending that you do not see in the private sector due to the fact that government jobs typically pay better than similar private sector jobs, and the fact that the flow through multiplier is higher on government spending. \n \n Now I see where our primary difference lies. You fail to understand that consumer is static regrdless of taxation level.\n \n \nDear daewoo, if you decrease taxes, consumers spend more...and are you aware that some companies moved overseas because of more lenient TAX LAWS?\n\n \n If you decrease taxes, those who ebnifit fromt he tax decreases MAY spend more. At the same time, you experience a net job loss because the governemtn is not spending as much, which results in a smaller numebr of potential consumers, which results in static consumer spending.\n \n \nI certainly don't disagree here. Massive government spending, especially when the money is spent at home, spurs cash flow. In order for the government to spend, the government must acquire, through taxes or borrowing with interest some monies through bond issues or loans, both of which must be repaid.\n \n In order for a tax-cut-pushed spending spree to happen, the government doesn't have to spend anything. Just lower the taxes. This causes more spending which carries more tax money (with the increased volume of spending) and the government cash register is filled.\n\n \n Except for the fact that consumer spendign is a product of both the size of your consumer base and per capita spending by that base, and in shrinking government spending you shrink the size of that base, which offsets any gainst you may have made in per capita spending.\n \n The exception to this owuld be in a truly healthy export economy where thsoe displaced government workers, or workers in government related fields, cna immedialy pick up jobs with similar pay and benifits in the private sector. That is CLEARLY not the case here, so ti is irrelevant.",

That concerns me too. It sickens me everytime I read of another American soldier killed. Bush has only a little more than 2 years left. I am not sure what he is going to do. The only way we can go after Iran is by bombing their nuclear plants. We can not invade. Iran is far too expansive. But bombing nuclear sites would be a way of going back on the offensive.

   "\n Originally Posted by flaja \n In other words he is naive enough to believe a report that prepared by politicians.\n \n This is pretty basic stuff...calculation of gain and calculation of cost. Not a whole lot of room for wiggle there.\n\n \n Have you ever heard the expression about lies, damned lies and statistics? Anyone who says tax cuts do not spur economic expansion which increases government revenue (all else being equal- meaning nothing like a war or 9-11 influences the economy), is obviously falling for the statistics. There is no accurate way to calculate future debt costs into tax cuts you enact today. The economy today is far more complex than it was in the 1980s. The internet alone proves that, and just what are the chances that we'd have the internet today if we had not had the tax cuts of the 1980s? Where else could all of the money for the home PC industry (that makes the internet possible) have come from? \n \n \n\n And just why did our work force expand? \n \n Well, when a man and a woman love each other very much (or are drunk or bored)......\n\n \n You are confusing the labor force with the job market. Just because we have the population for a labor force does not mean we have enough jobs to go around.\n \n It is true that federal revenue went up in the 1980s. And federal revenue went up because of economic expansion- we had more income and more commerce to tax. But, what caused the economic expansion if not the Reagan tax cuts?\n \n \n\n During the Great Depression our GDP reached pre-stock market crash levels in 1937. Our economy was as big in 1937 as it had been before the crash of 1929. But we still had double digit unemployment. So our workforce expanded during the Great Depression, but our job base did not. And I don't recall ever hearing about tax cuts in the Great Depression- in fact there was actually a tax hike- a tariff raised during the Hoover Administration. \n \n Nothing you have said in the above paragraph indicates work force expansion.\n\n \n Are you this dense? How can the economy be the same size in terms of GDP and unemployment be up if the labor force did not expand, i.e., we had more workers than we did jobs?\n \n \nFrom 1913-1938 this countries industrial production increased by 75%. That was the result of automation and improved production facilities, not an expanded labor force.\n\n \n Prove it. What kind of automation are you talking about? Which industries were automated? If unemployment was so high in 1937 wouldn't wages have been cheap? So where was the incentive to automate? Where did the money to automate come from?\n \n \n\n Your documentation for this is what? The economic recovery began about the middle of 1983. Inflation and interest rates were both down by then and unemployment was falling. But the budget deficit, i.e., all of the welfare spending did not become an issue until about the time of the 1984 Democrat national convention. \n \n LT handled that in another thread. did you not understand his links, or are you not honest enough to admit when you are very clearly wrong?\n\n \n I haven't looked at the links yet because I haven't had the time. But, if they say the opposite of what I have said, they are wrong. I actually lived through the Carter and Reagan presidencies. When inflation and unemployment went up and when they came down are things I remember.\n \n \n\n You seem to be missing the point there (and apparently do not remember the reagan prsidency if you are trying to push responsibility for that spending off on others). The point is, that 1.87 trillion has cost us well in excess of 4 trillion. That is why economic expansion based on deficit spending is a loosing proposition.\n\n \n Huh? Didn't Reagan try to slow down the rate of welfare spending- which would have brought the budget closer to being balanced? Didn't the Democrats increase welfare spending anyway?\n \n \n\n Originally Posted by flaja \n You really think 1-2% doesn't mean anything to a multi-million dollar company?\n \n 1-2% has never factored havily into production decisions for any company I am aware of.\n\n \n How many are you aware of? Common sense tells you that it would be foolish for any company to ignore 1-2% of their expenditures or income. How else would we ever have multi-million (and billion) dollar companies? What about the expression to the effect mind you pennies and the dollars will take care of themselves?",

   "Go buy virtually any consumer product and look at the manufacturing country of origin. Americans don't buy US made consumer goods and you know our BOP status. Look at vehicles (as goes GM goes the economy?), Toyo will be the #2 in the US this year. Look at the housing industry (especially material suppliers). Capital demand in the US has been flat for years. What products are going to be made here and who's going to buy them? Burgers and fat people?\n \n Here's an interesting thought to dwell on:\n \n Ford and GM total market caps are now around $35-billion. Thanks to current administration we burn through that amount of borrowed money in four months in Iraq. And you see US industry expanding and selling products other than death to other countries? No one wants our products and considers them junk. Even Americans aren't dumb enough to buy what few consumer products are still made here other than some specialty markets. We even became a net importer of food last year. \n \n Sorry, can't even imagine your scenario being possible until the US standard of living drops to where hungry crowds straighten out our thoroughly corrupted system.\nYou have cleverly injected the origin of goods into the argument. However, my point remains valid regardless of that side issue. People who are allowed more of their own money, spend more of their own money and pay more in taxes than do people who are deprived of their money. Some of those people who spend more money when they are allowed to keep more of what they earn invest more money in their employees and properties, creating taxable income that would otherwise not exist. This is independent of the origin of goods and does not change because of trade deficit.\n \n I do not buy from Citgo. I do not buy from Target. I do not buy Car and Driver magazine. I do buy American and Foreign vehicles. The American vehicles I buy have engines that were made in Mexico. The last new Ford product I bought was made in Canada. I still had to pay sales taxes along with the after tax money I used to buy each, putting smiles on the faces of two American car salesmen as they were able to buy new leaf blowers, making all the people at Lowe\"s happy and smiles on the faces two car dealer's wive's faces as they were able to purchase new fur coats, making their furriers happy, too.

Wealth is EARNED.\n \n While it is true that the earner's wealth must be taxed to provide infrastructure, maintenance and protection of public property and services, it is not necessary to take wealth from some people to provide support to able-bodied, lazy bastards who choose not to work because it's easier to let the government pay their way through life.\n \n Your \"redistribution of wealth\" smacks of pure socialism.\n \n There's a way to deal with criminals, looters (also known as criminals) and arsonists (AKA criminals). You enforce the criminal laws and put the bastards away for a long time and you don't let them out based upon their good behavior or overcrowded prisons. (You build more prisons, putting legal labor and licensed contractors to work thereby bolstering the construction market and helping to decrease unemployment.) But, no! We have to coddle the criminals and grant them more rights than they deserve and let them out early so they can commit more crimes...all because of the nature of the legal profession and the nature of liberal politics.\n\n \n Doesn't take much to get you wound up.

   "...and the Dems are about to raise the minimum wage. LOL! It won't matter much though. With our wide open borders, the soon-to-come blanket amnesty for illegal aliens and our current level of enforcement of Davis-Bacon, the cheaper, \"scab\" labor will still be available and the people who insist upon making legal minimum wage (the Union of Democratic Voters)will find jobs harder to land. The growing Republic of the North will soon be taken over by the Republic of Mexico and will cease to be a tax revenue area for the US. (That's okay with me..it's already a huge money sink from which a major portion of the 40 billion dollars a year sent \"home\" to Mexico by illegals working in the US flows out of this country.)\n \n I wonder why the foreign labor thing seems to work in some other countries.

It is the middle class. The worthless engineers who demand $70,000 per year to do what indian engineers do for $30,000. The minimum wage is pretty much reserved for non exportable jobs at the bottom of the food chain. It is a survival wage...just enough to keep the dirty masses from rioting.\n \n Second, we do not WANT all those illgeal workers to become legal. They would not pay taxes anyway (no lower class and very few middle class in this country actually pay real taxes). You take that mexican who has been making $7 an hour picking fruit, tax him, and at the end of the year he files his return and not onlygets back EVERYTHING he paid, but gets an EITC on top of that, so he has cost us MORE than if he had just been an illegal all along.

I have not done any commentary on Smith here, but have elsewhere.\n \n What I say above is true to the last letter. Not too long ago, I was a member of a consulting group brought into a mid sized manufacturing firm that badly needed to cut costs. As part of their manufacturing process, they cast some part (aluminum). Their big plan to cut overhead was to fire the 4 guys they had casting the parts and have the parts made in India and shipped here for finishing. \n \n We went in and did a comprehensive, company wide analysis, and came to a radically different conclusion. If they had fired the people doing their casting and pushed associated costs (maintenance, etc...) overseas, they would have seen an annual savings of roughly $140,000.\n \n What we recommended was that they fire their engineering department and outsource THAT to India. We calculated that doing so would save them in excess of $1 million per year. \n \n You could have heard a pin drop in that room. The middle class white collar dipshits in that room were so used to thinking of themselves and those of their social class/job class as \"important\" and the workers as greedy, subhuman, disposable trash that it did not even cross their mind that the \"important\" people are just as disposable, and their disposal may actually generate greater savings.\n \n For some \"unknown\" reason, white collar, middle class types point to anomalies in our labor market and latch onto those anomalies as the \"reason\" we are having problems. A good example is the auto industry. Are auto workers paid too much? You betca. They are the outlier, though, not representative of US manufacturing as a whole. \n \n Here is the BLS average wage for non supervisory workers data (current):\n \n http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t16.htm\n \n Even the noted wage there, $16.99 an hour, is not terrible. Remove the outliers like the auto industry, transportation (which is driven through the roof by the teamsters), and utilities (also all overpaid union workers), and that falls even further.\n \n Could we stand to see a drop in those numbers? Yes. Unquestionably. a 10-15% decline would help. A 50% declining white collar wages would help a LOT more and be a LOT More appropriate. \n \n The average hourly earning for production workers is only up FIFTY CENTS in real (inflation adjusted) dollars since the 1960's. If we were competitive in the 60's, but are not now, the problem is OBVIOUSLY not the production workers wages. \n \n One of the good things that we lost with the end of the corporate raiding age was the blood-in-the-halls mentality when it came to management and white collar staff. Many of those acquisitions did not result in any production layoffs or declines, but the raiders would slash and burn their way through the white collar workforce. This generally resulted in a more compact, more efficient company with the same output.\n \n Now, this is not to say that everybody, including production workers, does not need to learn to live within their means as opposed to a debt laden existence where you end up paying $700 for a tivo because you finance it on a credit card over 15 years at 20%.\n \n Trying to trim the fat in our economy by focusing primarily on production workers is akin to starting a liposuction by removing the heart.",

So how do illegals, who have fake SSNs, get away with not filing a tax return and thereby get caught as illegals? By law if you are employed (except by yourself) the only way you can legally not file an income tax return is to submit a form to the IRS saying that you paid $0 in income taxes last year and expect to not owe anything in income taxes this year.

   "Can you document this? And just what do you get if you accept a SSN that you know is fake? If you risk getting caught by hiring someone whom you know is an illegal, and you pay all the necessary taxes, what do you gain as an employer? \n\n \n Just my experience in the business world, and the fact that you almost never hear of somebody being busted for hiring an undocumented worker. \n \n You gain cheap labor. Prior to the practices at IBP changing, the average wage there was $14. Now it is $9. The illegals work cheaper.\n \n \n \nCorrect me if I'm wrong: If you make a certain amount of money, as determined by how much Social Security taxes are paid for your SSN, doesn't the IRS automatically send you an income tax return form? So how do illegals, who have fake SSNs, get away with not filing a tax return and thereby get caught as illegals? By law if you are employed (except by yourself) the only way you can legally not file an income tax return is to submit a form to the IRS saying that you paid $0 in income taxes last year and expect to not owe anything in income taxes this year. And I would assume that this form requires your SSN. But, getting out of filing an income tax return still alerts the federal government to your existence. So why can't illegals be easily identified, captured and deported or jailed (or preferably shot)?\n\n \n You are wrong. The IRS does not send you anything. Your employer shoudl provide you a W-2, but that is it. Another copy of that W-2 goes to the IRS, but it sits dead until a tax return that matches it comes in. \n \n \n \nI remember reading in either Fast Food Nation or in another book whose title I cannot remember that unions in the meat packing industry essentially do not exist anymore.

The last time meatpackers went on strike, IBP ramped up produciton to where they were killing every day and the price of meat only ended up increasing about 6% due to the strike. The fact that OBP is not union, and has that kind of surge capacity, cuts the legs out form under the union groups. They would LOVE to see a union sticker on the IBP window. \n \n When the guy from the union showed up and started pushing organization to the mexicans, IBP turned aorund and imported about 200 somolians. The message was pretty clear....you go union and we will find somebody else to do the job.\n \n Personally, I think it is good that the meatpackers have finally got their heads out of their butts and started allowing immigrant workers (illegal) to join. If you want to protect wages and benefits, thats the way to do it. If they had figured that out before IBP broke the union there, they might actually have a leg to stand on. When IBP broke the union, the meatpackers were refusing to allow illegals into the union. If they had allowed illegals in back then, IBP could have hired all the illegals they wanted and the union would still be in control",
