   "Saakashvili turned Georgia into terrorists' Mecca. But to tell the truth Georgia has been long acting as such. On USA nod Saakashvili invited to Georgia not only Chechen rebels but Arab, Afghani and other extremists' hirelings as well. \n As you know Georgia's americanization started with the construction of a bridgehead in Georgia in wake of war preparations targeted at Iran. Pentagon had planed to use Georgia but with Obama's coming to power everything changed drastically. CIA and Pentagon had to work solo.\n No doubts that financing of the Georgian leader hasn't been stopped since then but now major activities deal with the training of the commando-type reconnaissance teams of Muslim hirelings. It will be fight on Iran. It's possible that American instructors in Georgia were no strangers to that training.\n Last December Saakashvili organized the meeting of terrorists' warlords. And we got to know about it only due to the fact Saakashvili skirted Chechen rebels! In fact Chechen leader Zakaev made the leakage into mass media in sort of revenge!",
