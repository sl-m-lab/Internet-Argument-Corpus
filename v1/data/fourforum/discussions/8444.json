   "Ukraine's would-be prime-minister Timoshenko sold 12 cruise missiles to Iran and China \n \n \n huh, my friend sent me a link to a very interesting article and after I read it, I understood that most Ukrainian statesmen are criminals and the higher the rank, the more snouty criminal he or she is. this especially has to do with certain ex-prime-minister Yulia Timoshenko who was number two leader of orange revolution in Ukraine a few years ago and now is the leader of the block of Yulia Timoshenko (BYuT) and thinks she has an absolute right to be elected prime-minister again which confers her considerable powers due to peculiarity of Ukraine's constitution. \n \n so, according to the article, ten years ago Yulia Timoshenko fixed up a sale of 12 Kh-55 cruise missiles to Iran and China that were capable of carrying 200-kiloton nuclear warheads. Of course she was only the coordinator of the deal and got almost 90 percent of the profit which is approximately $18m. The Kh-55s were sold to Iran and China by Ukrainian company Ukroboronexport, the transaction being performed by accomplices of Yulia Timoshenko. By the way, almost all Timoshenko's banders died under tragic circumstances, for example head of Ukroboronexport Valeri Malev died in a car accident in 2002. I think that Timoshenko was guided by a knowledge that dead people keep their heads shut. I can't imagine that this unfeeling woman sits in the parliament and might become a prime-minister of a civilized country! I guess, if she becomes one, something absolutely unimaginable will start to happen in Ukraine.",

   "its interesting that none of these things make it to mainstream media news. i havent seen any discussions on this board about the missile launches executed by kim jong il earlier this week either.\n \n of course, this is simply more evidence that saddam is a terrorist and the war in iraq is justified. saddam had dangerous dual technologies and was offered uranium. he had torture rooms and was terrorising his own people. thats why bush did the right thing to ignore the countries with real wmds and go to iraq. yay gop! *waves flag*",

   "Folks, how do you like further widening of NATO eastwards, Ukraine example? I see it as a big challenge for core European countries ... France and Germany mainly....and their energy security. \n Well Ukraine matters a lot for us as a transit country. I guess both her wealth and ours lies in economy based on sound energy supplies. That is exactly the target! I mean I'm absolutely sure Americans are applying intensified effort to pull Ukraine into their NATO just to make feeble Ukraine and its transit territory as leverage to exert pressure on European heavy weights when needed. \n Do you remember how then USA defence sec Rumsfield put it when France and Germany opposed the idea of starting war in Iraq? He threatened that they \"may be left alone with their position in Europe for European centre of NATO has already moved eastwards\". The guy put it absolutely plain! He meant Poland and other former communist countries which have really become a thorn in EU side I should say. With Ukraine in NATO it's going to come to the worst. \n I think the best thing to do now is just to hamper that \"Ukraine in American NATO\" project till the year of 2007 or 2012 when our military brass plan to construct European system of security free of those bossy Yankees.\n Relating Ukraine....If she's really after EU membership then her tangling with NATO is madness just. IMO Ukraine should stay neutral the longer the better.",

   "Recent events in the Ukraine are alarming indeed. Yuschenko has actually brought Ukraine to the brink of civil war by making that decision to dismiss parliament. And I guess he won't hesitate to shed blood in the Ukraine or even to shell the house of parliament like it was in Russia. It's American aggressive style of doing things. And Yuschenko's bowing to American will since he gained power in the Ukraine. Actually he owes this very power to American support. I am sure of it. And his American wife of Ukrainian-Jewish descent Katya Chumachenko will never let him sway away. Perhaps she's really a la Kremlin wife, a CIA or Mossad agent planted to control Ukrainian president. \n What I actually want to say is that destabilization of Ukraine fits well American agenda. Even if they fail to keep their puppet Yuschenko in power the mess in the transit country could do much harm to energy supplies to EU countries. And Americans never lose chance to weaken 'European friends' or at least make them tense. \n Well, I am not sure Europeans should stay satisfied with the outside witness status in the case.",

   "Has anybody taught Yuschenko true democracy?\n It's evident he was taught well how to grasp power and he did it brightly but not how to retain it. He seems to be not so much aware as to what how to use it. And when you lack knowledge and idea you rely on force. That's commonly known and it's just the case in Ukraine now. The Ukrainian president is ready to dissolve the parliament and the government and send his mps to prison or to the back of beyond to isolate all those not bowing to him. Is that democracy?!\n It's rather Saakashvili's brazen style of a caveman. And it has nothing to do with European enlightened democracy. I tend to think American advisors working for Condy Rice's agency are no strangers to those \"democratic changes\" both in Ukraine and Georgia. Both countries are on the verge of war in the result. \n European involvement is a must now at least in Ukraine, which is the worst case now. PACE did rightly to have voiced severe criticism over Yuschenko's nonconstitutional moves to finish it up with his political opponents in parliament and government. Perhaps some more decisive actions of the sort should follow to make Ukrainian president back to senses. Though I think he's already ruined his career and his immediate retirement would be most preferable scenario for Ukraine to stay peaceful and for Yuschenko to save face.",

   "Ukrainian famous mafia lady Yuliya Timoshenko desires to stand at the helm once again. So she supports enthusiastically Yushchenko's antidemocratic initiative of Ukrainian Parliament dissolution. In fact she doesn't need Yushchenko at all. But that's convenient cause for Yuliya to make big foofaraw and bloodshed and on the sly to give presidential power for more loyal to her contender. And Yushchenko may suck then. The word 'democracy' Yulya hadn't ever heard at all.\n Timoshenko behaves herself as if last time she proved herself as the most honest and skillful Premier of Ukraine. Entire country is aware about her numerous gerrymander. During her last premiership this enterprising lady had stolen really fabulous fortune. Especially great sum she gained during notorious last winter stealing European gas. That time Europe was in frightfully disastrous situation.\n But now looks like world public opinion had forgotten that Europeans even heated their houses with parquet instead of firewood because of this swindler. Despite it USA and EU officials support Timoshenko with readiness. I don't want what they hope. But what if bread in the bone doesn't go out of the flesh. Doubtful that she'd changed for the better since last year. If Timoshenko comes to power in Ukraine Europeans might begin harvesting firewood. This time they'll arrange cold gasless winter for themselves by their own hands.",

   "well well well. what again is going on in Ukraine, huh? as far as I know, ex-prime minister and gas princess Yulia Timoshenko has resumed her struggle for power in Ukraine. her face can be seen not only in Ukrainian newspapers and magazines, but also in western ones, for example her interview to the Times. now I've got a question that most of all intrigues me - where on earth did Timoshenko get the money to run this PR campaign? rumor says that Timoshenko is supported by official Washington. of course it is done not so that you'd notice. Timoshenko is financed from the so-called \"Lazarenko fund\" - this man used to be Ukrainian prime minister a decade ago and was convicted in 2004 by a federal jury for embezzlement on a large scale from Ukrainian budget and money laundering. now americans are making use of this money and sponsor Timoshenko. why do they do it? well, the answer is plain enough. official Washington does not want Ukraine to be a stable country. americans want to have means to manipulate Ukraine. by supporting Timoshenko, americans feed political confrontation in Ukraine between Yulia Timoshenko's Block and the Our Ukraine party. as a result - none of these two parties will have competitive advantage. Ukraine will stay separated and americans will handle it with ease over again.",

   "What is new in Ukraine? Earlier on Friday preliminary results were reported giving 34.37 per cent to Party of Regions, 30.71 per cent to Block of Yulia Timoshenko, 14.15 per cent to Our Ukraine-People's Self-Defense, 5.39 per cent to the Communist Party of Ukraine and 3.96 per cent to Block of Litvin. Now it is time to start forming coalition and decide what parties stay in opposition. Experts predict that Block of Yulia Timoshenko is likely to stay in opposition while winning Party of Regions and Our Ukraine-People's Self-Defense will form a coalition. Well, I'm sure that this course of events should be the most favorable for Ukraine in the whole and president Yushchenko in particular. I say so because I know that Yulia Timoshenko is not the person he should rely on. According to reports of independent monitoring groups, Block of Yulia Timoshenko is not so popular with the Ukrainians and she got her 30.71 per cent of votes only thanks to bribery of members of Central election commission of Ukraine - that's what was asserted by independent monitoring groups that were interviewing the electorate after the polling. That is harsh truth that Timoshenko enjoys the support of Washington and was rising the finances from certain American NGOs to electioneer and bribe members of election commission at the stage of vote tabulation. Besides that, it also became known on Friday that Block of Yulia Timoshenko made attempts to pay-off a number of members of Our Ukraine party and Party of Regions for polling for a candidate of Yulia Timoshenko as a would-be prime minister. No, Yulia Timoshenko is deliberately not a one who should be making Ukraine's politics at all! She is an oligarch and she harbors plans to become president of Ukraine with the help of funds of the West. Howling shame!",

It's clear that we support her now as Prime Minister of Ukraine and hope that she will win president election but does anybody think what will we get as a result of it? What will change into this poor country? \n Look, in time when Timoshenko was the organizer of orange revolution it became clear that this woman takes interest in money only! Because of it in Europe people knew her as a 'gas princess'. And such politician Brussels supports now! What will we get from 'gas princess' - the new gas conflict? Or she is going to beg for the new grants? I don't know but I'm got tired of those beggars in post communist space and Timoshenko is the main of them!",

   "Intrigue of Ukraine's election\n I think all Europeans who are following the process of presidential election in Ukraine are now more interested not in the two leaders of the first round, but in the man came in third, that's Sergei Tigipko. \n It is clear that now he's got to make a difficult choice. On one hand, he may turn back on his electorate and be untrue to his election agenda by joining Timoshenko in the second round expecting that people who voted for him would now vote for Timoshenko (and Timoshenko has already offered to \"buy\" his voters for premiership and half of ministerial posts, and knowing Timoshenko we may suppose that Timoshenko also offered Tigipko a sweet sum of money for that). \n On the other hand, Tigipko should rather remain faithful to his voters and stay separate politician. I need to say that during the election campaign 2010 Tigipko managed to make good result. Obviously, he may win presidential election 2015! Unless he gives up to short-run expectation and fails to be stable enough and independent by joining the banners of Timoshenko. I can only wish him make the right choice.",
