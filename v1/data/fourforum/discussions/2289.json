   "I'm going to have to say it's genetic. But let me explain...\n I was in a debate with someone over this same topic and they brought up a point; the hypothalmus in homosexual men is the same size as that in women, meaning it is significantly smaller than that of heterosexual males. With this in mind, I changed my answer, but the undertone to that answer is still the same as it was before. If it is genetic, and it is caused by the size of the hypothalmus, then it is a genetic defect. That's not to say it's on the same level as say aspbergers syndrome or being mentally retarded, but it would still be in the same category. A hermaphrodite is born with two X chromosomes, as well as a Y, giving it male and femal characteristics as well as parts for both. It does happen naturally, but that doesn't mean that it isn't a defect and something abnormal. I'm not saying that this is the same thing, but I can see it as related. If you have something that isn't (I don't want to say natural, because it does occur naturally) normal and correct for your gender, such as the XXY problem, then wouldn't that be a defect?

You might consider that falling in and out of homosexuality, but the attraction is constant, their choice to act on it isn't.\n\n \n I find it interesting that you chose to open your position with the effeminacy of males issue. Maybe you weren't aware of it but there is such a thing as Gender Idenity Disorder. Where males associate an exhibit effeminate behaviors. Where do you think they get ideas of how to be fem? These individuals often not only become homosexually active but are ones most aquainted with tranvestitism and considering and or undergoing gender reassignment surgery.The issue of high lispy voices and femininity in male homosexuals can indeed be learned and manufatured. Did you not consider that feminine traits can be mimicked? I've seen more male homosexuals lash out against \"fems\" for their behaviors than straights to be honest. Even they believe it to be contrived in most circumstances. But let me play devils advocate with you. Supposed it wasn't just some affectation that a gay male or group of gay males has made part of their modus operandi like you assert. Could it be some men have experimented with hormones? Could it be that some have conditions that create non-genetic hormonal imbalances? How do you know that these affectations are just simply genetic derivations? Can you draw me a punnet cause I would like to see it. Another thing that makes me convinced its not genetic is the numbers of homosexuals in certain societies. You don't see alot of homosexuals in countries like Russia, China, and other Asian countries. If there was a genetic cause how did these cultures escape it. I'm not saying there aren't gays in those countries, it just appearss the concentrations are alot lower in them than in the Western European and American cultures where the attitudes run extremely liberal to tollerant. Getting on to activities and it possibly changing brain structure, you should reasearch this on your own before you shoot down the theory out of hand. It may sound silly but there is a body of scientific stiudy with compelling evidence that shows the brains structure can be influenced by use and experience. You need to find \"The Biology of Homosexuality: Science or Politics\" by Dr. Satinover explains the eitology better than I but it is relevant I suggest you enlighten yourself by checking it out.\n \n \nThere are many gay animals in nature...for an example, the Central Park Zoo in NYC has two gay penguins. They were raised under the same conditions as the rest of the penguins, so I dont see how it would be possible for their environment to make them gay.\n\n \n This point has been brought up before and is kinda useless here. Why? Because you are trying to equate penguins with human beings. We all know that homosexual behaviors exist in nature. Humans and penguins are quite a ways off genetically so how is a penguin's sexual proclivities anywhere remotely intrinsic to humans? You are trying to compare the biologial drives of penguins with those of mammals. Impossible. Instinct and perhaps physiological phenomenon innate to penguins may influence their behavior. Have you conclusive evidence of geneticly derived homosexuality in penguins? Probably not so how would you know conclusively that A. Penguins can have a genetic homosexual trait. B penguins cannot suffer from a non genetic physical or mental condition which induces homosexual behaviors and C. that they are not mimicking behavior perhaps seen in each other? Animals for the most part operate instinctually but they can mimick behaviors seen in others of their kind or other species. Perhaps this is what I am talking about when I say enviromental factors come into play. Its not that any animal or person is being taught or trained to perform a behavoir as if in a classroom lesson. Children imitate adult behaviors all the time. This is an environmental influence. Ever see kids sneaking off to smoke. There is usually no adult standing over the children teaching them how to smoke. They steal away with a pack and some matches and imitate how they see adults do it, until they get it right. Now this does not mean to say that chidren are imitating homosexual behavior because they see adults do it outright, though I am sure this might have happend to some individuals at some time. What is more thought to be the environmental factors of gender confussion and such which leads to developmental homosexual behaviors in the future. Its complicated but studies have shown causality in certain individuals. So basically when we talk of environmental factors we are talking of actions that others can imitate which are overt or preludes to homosexual activity. You need to look at the papers done by prominent scientists with the APA on this.\n \n \nI'm Bisexual, and im very comfortable admitting that homosexuality is a defect, It's obviously not the way life is supposed to operate, but it's strange that the defect is so common in nature. It might be possible that it's a way for nature to deal with overpopulation, or some environmental factor could have an effect on the fetus causing it to form homosexuality, however it is formed.\n\n \n Thats very forward thinking on your part. Its not conclusively deemed that homosexuality or any other sexual proclivities outside of heterosexual behavior is due to developmental defects. There is just one branch that sees this as a possibility. While the research looks solid so far there is still much more work to be done on this approach. What causes one to be gay may be a series of factors the only thing there is evidence it is not when it comes to humans and sexual proclivities is a genetic basis. There has been no genetic findings of gay genes or sequences in humans and with the complexity of the human body and psyche the answer could be anything. Remember we are the animal with the most developed brain though the actual percentage of tissue per use is quite small. I look at it this way. We cannot positively claim that one is gentically gay or genetically straight. This is good. Why? Because as we move towards an age where we will one day snip out genes that are deemed unhealthy or undesireable the idea that homosexuality or heterosexuality could wind up on the genetic chopping block is a bit too scary. And before you say it. I know, not all futures are necessarily dark. As I see it genetic engineering is a great technology just waiting to be abused like every other technology mankind creates. \n \n These are some offline links for more theories on how homosexuality may continue to flourish.\n \n Seutter, R.

Spitzer, Vol. 32, No. 5, October 2003, pp. 403-417 Dr. Spitzer was the doctor that singlehandedly got homosexuality removed from the APA's list of mental illnesses. This article by him evaluates and shows reorientation therapy can work.\n\n \n There are some issues with Spitzer's sample. He himself admits his sample was limited, and said he was not maintaining that a substantial number could change by so-called \"reorientation therapy\"....\n \n It had taken Spitzer more than 18 months to find just 200 or so people willing to describe themselves as successfully converted. He found his interviewees by advertising through ex-gay organisations. Almost half were recruited through ex-gay ministries, and nearly a quarter by Narth. Religion was \"extremely\" or \"very\" important to 93% of them. One in five was a mental health professional (Cohen, for example, is a high-profile reparative therapist) or director of an ex-gay ministry, and more than three-quarters had previously lobbied for sexual reorientation. These are people who get paid to say that therapy works. \n \n For many critics, this alone was enough to discredit the exercise. An article in the APA's Psychiatric News likened it to testing a drug on people recruited by the pharmaceutical company. But in addition, many of the participants appeared to have been not so much altered from gay to straight, as bisexual all along. Ten per cent of the men had never had gay sex before therapy, whereas half had already slept with a woman. Only a third of the women and half the men said that before therapy they were \"extremely\" bothered by homosexual feelings. How gay were they? \n \n As with most statistics, everything depends on how they are read. The percentage who were \"extremely bothered\" by homosexual feelings after undergoing therapy fell to zero. You could say zero was a sensational turnaround; or you might say they weren't so gay in the first place. Two New York psychologists carried out another study of reparative therapy at the same time as Spitzer, and reached the opposite conclusion. \"We interviewed 182 people who tried very hard to change,\" Dr Ariel Shidlo told Newsweek. \"The stakes were really high for them. Some really thought that if they didn't change, they would literally find themselves in hell... And they still failed.\" \n \n http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,1183596,00.html\n \n He was disappointed, however, that many reports overlooked his statements explaining that his sample was limited and that he was not maintaining that a substantial number of gays and lesbians could become straight if they sought reparative therapy. \"For the vast majority it is not possible for them to change their sexual orientation,\" he said. \n \n Spitzer also acknowledged that \"a lot of people will misuse\" his findings, which could cause pain for many individuals. \"It may help 5,000 people, but harm 500,000,\" he said. He is concerned, he added, that \"the Christian right,\" with its intolerance of and opposition to homosexuality, will use his findings in its campaign to prevent gays and lesbians from gaining civil rights protections. \n \n http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/36/13/20",

Nice dodge but my question remains.\n \n Now, in all fairness, I will answer your question. \n \n Behavior can certainly be changed by choice. I don't think that was ever in question. Priests and monks can choose to be celibate (that is, not engage in sexual activity) but that doesn't automatically make them asexual. I think that has been very clearly demonstrated over the history of the Roman Catholic Church.\n \n Likewise someone who previously engaged in homosexual relationships can desist if they so choose. This is not, of course, unique any group of people. Some heterosexuals make similar decisions for any number of reasons. Just because you are not in a relationship doesn't mean you are not homo- or heterosexual.\n \n I think it is clear our outward behaviors can be changed somewhat readily, I don't dispute that. What I am more interested in determining is how you changed what went on inside your head. Those feelings and thoughts that are very difficult to control when they happen--a first crush, being flustered around the object of your attraction, butterflies in your stomach, et. al. These types of feelings and actions seem almost impossible for most people to control.

If someone who was experienced in homosexual behavior came along and seduced you, then you probably felt at least some of the acceptance and connection that you'd been longing for. Attraction to men can also be intensified by a repulsion to women (bad mother or other female caretaker who may have been cruel to you, for an example, etc.).

   "\n from my perspective, homosexuality is not a hopeless or locked-in dilema, as many percieve it to be. this doesnt mean that homosexuals are wrong or anything, simply that there have been too many cases of people that dropped homosexuality or picked up homosexuality for me to see a genetic or built-in characteristic. furthermore, it could be that the power of the mind is so powerful that the mere fact someone believes they cannot change makes it so that they cannot change (until they change their mind, that is)\n \n\n People dropping out of homosexuality is proof that genes do not determine the behavior, but as I wrote in the other thread, genetic researchers never claim that the story is ever 100% biological. They argue that traits are influenced by genes, and usually they claim that biological is not going to be more than 50% of the story when explaining some behavioral pattern. By the way, one thing that may make you skeptical of genes is that you don't see any plausible casaul connection between gene and behavior. But really what we are talking about here is behavioral traits. An example might be violence. A sociobiological theory of violence might go something like this: several genes---<biochemistry(testosterone, norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin) and neurophysiology (brain wiring)--<moods, emotions, drives (temper, rage, jealousy)--<violent-prone personality--<environment (learning experiences, circumstances, situational factors, drugs/alcohol)--<violent behavior. \n \n \n\n by the way, galton, an interesting case is people that are vegetarians. some vegetarians have lost absolutely all desire for meat, to the point that they become sick and even vomit if they eat meat. has there been any research that links vegetarianism to genetics?\n\n I'll have to look that up. Actually, one puzzle is that women are more likely than men to be vegetarians, even though one of the most important reasons to eat meat is the iron, and women are more likley than men to be iron deficient, especially when pregnant. As an aside, I was vegetarian for a couple years, and always craved meat, and now I eat it like crazy.",

Having a desperate thirst for something--whether alcohol or homosexual sex--that others do not have seems like it could be somewhat biological to me. \n\n its not that the desire for alcohol is genetic, but the tendency of the body to become dependent on mind altering substances. i could understand a possible link between genetics and the likeliness of the body becoming physically dependent on alcohol, so that even if they dont like the taste of it, their bodies would go into a higher level of withdrawal trauma than someone else, making it more difficult for them to quit if they start. also, your physical properties have a lot to do with how much alcohol you can consume before you become impaired, and this can also by dictated by genes,\n \n \nBy the way, handedness is obviously genetically influenced--there is no way in hell that I could switch over from being left-handed to right-handed, and I was never encouraged by anyone to become left-handed.\n\n i disagree, since i have seen people that started off left handed and taught themselves to use their right hand, becoming fully ambidexterous. the most obvios case is that of people that lose their dominant hand; they learn to function just as efficiently with the \"weak\" hand.\n \n i have a 1 year old son. at around six month when his manipulative skills started getting more developed he would grasp objects with either hand, whichever was the closer hand to the object. i gradually kept placing the objects closer to his right hand so that he would use his right hand more, and if he started to neglect the use of his right hanf i would take the object out of his left and put in the right, making his right hand more adept.\n \n also, my mother and father admits to doing the same to me and my brothers and sisters as a child\n \n its not that you cant learn to use your other hand because its physically impossible. the limitations that we impose on our minds are more influential than you think.",

NO, there are no physical differences between straights and gays...except maybe for a sense of fashion. :) (OK, bad joke)\n\n \n The point of my argument was that all emotions and behaviors have a genetic component, plain and simple. Everything we do is rooted in genetics, absolutely everything. I do not, nor would I ever, argue that one's genotype is deterministic. I would also never, ever make the case that all human behavior is completely detached from genetic influences. Either of these extreme positions would be idiotic.\n \n If you read more carefully, I clearly state that people afflicted with either Trisomy 21 or Fragile X syndrome cannot control their physical attributes. Your suggestion that I am implying one can use physical appearance (not fashion style, it was kind of a funny joke though) is a false analogy on your part.\n \n Sexuality is a very complicated facet of the human existance.
