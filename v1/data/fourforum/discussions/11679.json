Laws act as a deterrent and establish consequences for infractions. Just because something is illegal, is no guarantee that people will not continue a behavior or action. As others have noted within this thread, there are laws currently that target straw purchases as well as many other firearms violations. \n \n Writing laws is by no means a simple task either, due to our legislative process. It is not uncommon for a bill to be introduced that is well thought out and that shows promise of being of benefit to society, only to be turned into an absolute disaster as \"riders\" are attached. These \"riders\" are frequently attached to otherwise good legislative efforts, because they would not pass on their own merits. By the time amendments to the bill and riders have been added, the benefits are many times not worth the adverse effects of the amendments and riders, and thus the bill fails to become law.\n \n While I am a supporter of gun rights, I would be in favor of quality legislation that has the ability to curb crime, as long as that legislation was not in contradiction with the right of the people. I have yet to see any such bill presented in our legislative process. I personally feel that many firearms crimes can not be legislated away, even with an all out ban. There will always be crime, and no law will ever eradicate it from our society. \n \n Justin",

But like I said, yall probably only care about getting your way on this issue.\n\n Another post about the wonders of guns. Looking at these numbers it looks like guns are hurting the economy-\n \n \nThe cost of firearm injuries in the US in 1990 was an estimated $20.4 billion. This includes $1.4 billion for direct expenditures for health care and related goods, $1.6 billion in lost productivity resulting from injury-related disability, and $17.4 billion in lost productivity from premature death. (Max and Rice, 1993) \n \n \n A recent study of inpatient medical care for firearm- related injuries at an university trauma center (UC-Davis Medical Center) estimated that the actual cost of providing direct health care for firearm-related injuries in the US in 1995 is projected to be $4.0 BILLION. (Kizer et al., 1995) \n \n \n Firearm injuries are the third most costly injury the US. Although they represent only 0.5% of all injuries, they account for 9% of the total US lifetime cost of injury. (Max and Rice, 1993) \n \n \n The average cost of hospitalization for a patient with a firearm injury was found to be $6915 in 1984 (Martin, Hunt and Hulley, 1988), which translates to $19,173 in 1993 dollars. Costs can range up to $500,000 per patient in some centers. (Wintemute and Wright, 1992) \n \n \n The average cost of treating a child wounded by gunfire could provide a student with a year of college education. Researchers surveyed hospital discharges from 44 children s hospitals and found that in 1991 the average hospital charges for gunshot wounds to children were $14,434, about the cost of tuition, room and board at a private college. (National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions, Inc.) \n \n \n At least 80% of the cost of firearm injuries are borne, directly or indirectly, by the taxpayer. (Wintemute and Wright, 1992) \n \n \n The cost of firearm injuries treated at major trauma centers are substantial and the increasing volume of unreimbursed care for such injuries has become an important factor in the decision of many hospitals to end their participation in organized trauma systems. (General Accounting Office, 1991)\n \n \n Considerable savings to society would accrue from an effort that decreased firearm injuries, even if the same level of violence persisted using other weapons. A recent study from one trauma center in Seattle (Mock, Pilcher and Maier, 1994) demonstrated a substantial financial benefit if all patients with firearm injuries instead had suffered only stab wounds. This would have resulted in an annual overall savings of $1,290,000 in that one institution alone and $500,000,000 nationwide.\n\n http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~ZJ5J-GTTL/freedom.htm",

Looking at these numbers it looks like guns are hurting the economy-\n \n \n http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~ZJ5J-GTTL/freedom.htm\n\n \n Well your figures are quite compelling I must admit, but most of those figures include criminal and victim costs. The numbers for victims healthcare costs would decrease little to none with a firearms ban, in fact healthcare for victims would increase due to people being unarmed and known sitting ducks by criminals. Criminals would now have no fear of entering any home, or robbing anyone at any time. Criminals are still going to turn people into victims, because criminals are still going to have guns. And as far as the cost of healthcare for violent criminals shot by law biding gun owners, if they were not breaking the law in the first place, they would not need healthcare for a gun shot wound, and I say if a violent criminal is shot while in commision of a crime, let him die. This would decrease healthcare costs a bunch for gun related wounds. As far as accidental shootings, laws need to be enacted making the gun owner liable if a child gets ahold of his gun. Accidental shootings involving adults would decline if people took gun safety courses and used a little common sense. As far as your post is concerned, it is a classic example of trying to mask the underlieing facts, and a feeble attempt to sway people to believe as you do by concealling those facts. I say if enough criminals are shot and killed by law biding gun owners, then most criminals still alive will consider carreer changes, and then crime will drop.",

In the 1980s the NRA asked President Reagan to abolish the ATF but this never happened because there was a big outcry from the law enforcement about the proposal.\n\n \n The ATF has far too much time, power and money to be useful, hence they abuse their authority and need to be reigned in. Or are you not familiar with the Ruby Ridge incident? The ATF moved in with a full strike force because a man allegedly had a shotgun barrel that was one quarter inch below legal length and wasn't registered, and they killed his wife, his son, his baby daughter and the family dog. Knowing that this is the kind of screw up they're known for, how can anyone say that the ATF should remain unchecked?\n \n \nI think gun registration could stop gun purchases. People would be more hesitant to purchase a gun for another if they knew the gun was legally registered in their name.\n\n \n Well then you'd be dead wrong! Look at California, New York, New Jersey, and all other states with gun registration, and the number of firearms-related crimes and stolen guns that they have.\n \n And just because you ticked me off with this post of yours I'm gonna prove to you that you're wrong. As it is now we already have a backdoor form of gun registration; the ATF has sales records for everybody that's ever bought a gun from a licensed dealer, so they know what serial number belongs to what name and what address. And this registration has never stopped straw purchases from taking place. Although if you stupid gun fearing liberals would stop pressing laws that would limit gun sales to one per month then maybe the ATF could use this registration system and locate potential straw purchasers through their bulk purchase records.\n \n \nOf course, the NRA would never support this because they want all records of gun purchases destroyed within 24 hours and they'd resort to spreading paranoia about the government to stop any system of gun registration.\n\n \n Gun registration doesn't work, hasn't worked, and never will work. Therefore it's absolutely unreasonable to require people to register their guns in order for them to be legal.\n \n \nWashington D.C., had a gun registration law for 30 years and nobody tried to use it to confiscate legally registered guns. People have been required to register machine guns for about 70 years and the government has never tried to take advantage of this to confiscate machine guns.\n\n \n How about in all the other countries where gun registration HAS lead to gun confiscation? Or how about in California where gun owners were told to surrender their SKS rifles when they were reclassified as \"assault weapons\"?",

I have previously outlined those and other firearm laws I deal with or a semi-regular basis here:\n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=315754#post315754\n \n These laws have proven adequate for me. The laws, however, are only as effective as the prosecutor makes them. As a rule I do not plea bargain cases. You would surprised how many cases across my state are plea bargained away for little or nothing. \n \n Let me address the topic of a reporting requirement for stolen firearms. I have never heard a serious proposal for such a law, and I would be curious to know where one might exist. It's constitutionality would be questionable for those prohibited from possessing firearms already. \n \n Let me address one other topic I have seen recently. We are already capable of tracing firearms recovered in a crime to their purchasers. We do not need a government maintained central database. \n \n The question of adding mental health information to our VCIN component of NCIC for background checks has been resisted for years. MH histories are after all private medical records. This changed as a result of what happened at Virginia Tech, and in state commitments are now logged into VCIN. Now things like involuntary commitments show up when that person tries to buy a gun. I think the time has come for a national standard of inclusion of these commitments into NCIC. \n \n I do not favor opening up NCIC records to individuals, particularly now that private MH information is beginning to be recorded. The potential for abuse is tremendous. Even now FFL dealers have no access to the database. They merely send in the transaction information via computer to the Virginia State Police, which runs the record information and issues either an \"approved\" or \"declined\" designation.

I would however, be more receptive to the idea of background checks being required for individual sale of firearms, as long as individual access to NICS, the system for determining illegibility for firearms purchase used by dealers at point of sales, rather than the transaction being forced to go through a dealer. While the two systems are indeed linked, they are distinctly different systems. \n \n As you pointed out, dealers are not granted any information, other than a determination of a persons illegibility for purchasing a firearm. The only problem that I foresee with opening this system to individuals is the cost associated with increased use of the system.

   "I don't have a problem with individuals wanting to sell a gun they bring to a gun show being required to conduct an NCIC check. The only practical way I could see it happen, however, is through requiring one or more FFL dealers at a gun show to conduct the checks for private individual sellers (and maintain the transaction records) for a nominal fee. The instant check system is premised upon working with FFL dealers who are fully compliant with all state and federal records management requirements. In my opinion a private individual wanting to sell a gun he owns would not agree to initiate the background check on his own and then be burdened with the never-ending record maintaining and ATF inspection requirements. He would instead reach a private agreement to leave the gun show and meet the buyer at a location down the street where they could conduct the sale in private. \n \n I'd still like to see where the law exists (or is proposed) that would give a prosecutor the ability to criminalize a victim's failure to report a stolen firearm.

   "To Flyboy:\n \n I do not advocate background checks for private, non-FFL dealer sales. I do not think we could make such a system workable. The record maintaining and inspection requirements we demand of FFL dealers as part of our background checks would not be followed by private individuals. \n \n To Omegamon:\n \n I understand the complaint that the FFL dealer transaction records comprise a registration system (dealers are required to record who buys and who trades in guns, and those forms you fill out are kept indefinitely by the dealer). These records are privately held by the individual dealers, and they are subject to inspection by ATF to ensure they are being kept properly. We use this dealer-maintained records system to trace firearms recovered in crimes. When we find, for example, a Glock 29 with serial number X used in a crime, we naturally want to know who bought it, and we ask ATF to trace it. ATF contacts Glock and provides it with the serial number. Glock checks its records and tells ATF when the gun was shipped and to what dealer. ATF then contacts the dealer and asks him who bought the gun and when. The dealer checks his records and tells ATF that info. This info is then passed to local LE who can make contact with the purchaser and investigate further. \n \n Absent a legitimate criminal investigation, I do not believe a government bureaucrat should be looking at a national database of these transaction records to satisfy his curiosity about who bought what lawful firearm when. The \"dispersed\" transaction recording system we use now allows LE to investigate guns recovered in crimes without giving some functionary the ability to randomly root though all these records at a whim. \n \n I know there are calls to enhance this system by requiring every person to individually register all guns they own, and to require everyone to constantly update the database by reporting all changes like new private purchases, sales, gifts, etc. This is what I mean when I say \"mandatory registration\", and it simply cannot be effective in America. \n \n Does California really have a law that requires everyone to report a stolen firearm? I would like to read it if you have a cite for it.\n \n To Lurch:\n \n Welcome.\n \n ---\n \n \"False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. The ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.\" Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764.",

You might as well expect a drug dealer who is robbed to call the police and say &#8220;Help, they stole all my crack and I want you to help me get it back!&#8221; (Oh they report robberies all right--it&#8217;s just put this way: &#8220;I had 5K in my pocket and they robbed me of my money.&#8221;)\n \n But setting aside the incredulity of expecting these persons to report a stolen firearm, there is a significant legal deficiency in the requirement that &#8220;all persons&#8221; must report a lost or stolen firearm. These statutes do not take into account what SCOTUS did in Haynes v. U.S.:\n \n &#8220;We hold that a proper claim of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination provides a full defense to prosecutions either for failure to register a firearm under \u00a7 5841 or for possession of an unregistered firearm under \u00a7 5851.&#8221; Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 100 (1968) [dealing with a self-incrimination privilege challenge to portions of the registration requirement of the NFA&#8212;which forced Congress to amend the NFA to correct this problem]\n \n Now if you want to have a mandatory reporting law for stolen firearms, then just bear in mind that you are forcing felons, persons convicted of domestic assault, and others who cannot lawfully own or possess firearms to incriminate themselves when you require them to report lost or stolen firearms. You may say who cares about felons? SCOTUS does, and it would rule they have absolute immunity from prosecution for failing to report a lost or stolen firearm. \n \n Of all the laws summarized only one&#8212;listed as 2007 Connecticut legislation&#8212;recognizes this problem. That statute summary words the reporting requirement this way: &#8220;any one who lawfully possesses a firearm that is lost or stolen, or an assault weapon that is lost, to file a police report within 72 hours.&#8221; (emphasis added) \n \n To put it another way, this statute says if you are a felon or could otherwise be prosecuted for having a gun in the first place then you don&#8217;t have to tell us your gun was stolen. This statute merely recognizes what SCOTUS would otherwise say for all of these laws: Lawful firearm owners would face fines or in some cases jail for failing to follow a law while felons receive a &#8220;full defense against prosecution.&#8221; \n \n In the first place it&#8217;s just bad public policy to create a law designed to threaten crime victims with prosecution. It&#8217;s even worse when you realize you must give felons immunity from the very prosecution you seek to impose upon the lawful victims of crime. Where else can you find a law which threatens you but grants complete immunity to the ten time felon?\n \n This is also why mandatory gun owner registration cannot work in America. The very people we want to track and keep firearms away from&#8212;the felons and others prohibited from having a gun in the first place&#8212;would be immune from having to report the guns they had.\n \n I&#8217;m not saying, however, that you should not report a lost or stolen firearm (assuming you can lawfully have one). I suggest you keep a record of all firearms you own, including their serial numbers. If they are ever stolen then you can report them to law enforcement which will enter them into a database of stolen property. When we raid drug houses, for example, we always check the guns, TVs, VCRs, etc. that are stacked on the floor to see if they are stolen. You would be surprised how many times we are able to return a stolen firearm or other property&#8212;sometimes years after the original theft&#8212;to its rightful owner by checking the database.",

How're they making it harder for courts to sentence a criminal to five years in prison just for being armed even if they never robbed anyone?\n \n \n \n WRONG!

Why?\n \n \"shall not be subject to subpoena or other discovery in any civil action in a State or Federal court or in any administrative proceeding other than a proceeding commenced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives\"\n The disturbing question is- why does the NRA want to protect gun traffickers against civil lawsuits? Why in the world is that one of their priorities? If someone is supplying guns to murderers then I have no sympathy for that person. They don't deserve any protection against lawsuits. I suspect that the NRA gets a lot of funding from their buddies in the gun industry and some of these buddies are gun traffickers. \n \n \n\n It says right there, gun trace data is to be given ONLY to police officers, and that it can only be used for official investigations.\n \n If I'm wrong then kindly provide the exact text of the exact legislation that says police are to have absolutely no access to firearms trace data for any reason.\n \n \n \n The ATF has far too much time, power and money to be useful, hence they abuse their authority and need to be reigned in.\n\n Not according to Robert Ricker, former Assistant General Counsel for the NRA and former Executive Director of the American Shooting Sports Council-\n \"RICKER: The ATF is overworked, understaffed and underpaid. And the [gun] industry knows that.\n \n \"ZWERDLING: And that's just part of the problem. The gun lobby has convinced Congress over the years to make it incredibly hard for the ATF to shut down crooked gun dealers. In fact, the NRA has called on Congress to abolish the ATF. And the NRA has an influential friend. Attorney General John Ashcroft is one of the NRA's most loyal supporters. Ashcroft just took over the ATF under the Homeland Security Plan. We wanted to interview ATF officials for this story, but Ashcroft's office said 'no.' \"\n http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript215_full.html\n \n \n\n Or are you not familiar with the Ruby Ridge incident? The ATF moved in with a full strike force because a man allegedly had a shotgun barrel that was one quarter inch below legal length and wasn't registered, and they killed his wife, his son, his baby daughter and the family dog. Knowing that this is the kind of screw up they're known for, how can anyone say that the ATF should remain unchecked?\n\n The NRA wanted to get rid of the ATF years before that incident. And the NRA just made things worse. They kept using to the Ruby Ridge and Waco incidents to show how the federal government was tyrannical and saying that people have a right to rebel against a tyrannical government. And then somebody did finally rebel against the government because of these incidents- Timothy McVeigh.\n \n \n\n Well then you'd be dead wrong! Look at California, New York, New Jersey, and all other states with gun registration, and the number of firearms-related crimes and stolen guns that they have.\n\n That's because criminals in those states tend to get most of their guns out of state. You have to have national gun registration for it to work. \n \n \n\n And just because you ticked me off with this post of yours I'm gonna prove to you that you're wrong. As it is now we already have a backdoor form of gun registration; the ATF has sales records for everybody that's ever bought a gun from a licensed dealer, so they know what serial number belongs to what name and what address. And this registration has never stopped straw purchases from taking place. Although if you stupid gun fearing liberals would stop pressing laws that would limit gun sales to one per month then maybe the ATF could use this registration system and locate potential straw purchasers through their bulk purchase records.\n \n \n \n Gun registration doesn't work, hasn't worked, and never will work. Therefore it's absolutely unreasonable to require people to register their guns in order for them to be legal.\n \n \n \n How about in all the other countries where gun registration HAS lead to gun confiscation? Or how about in California where gun owners were told to surrender their SKS rifles when they were reclassified as \"assault weapons\"?\n\n Aren't records of gun purchases required to be destroyed within a certain period of time? All you do is complain and offer no solutions. At least people on the pro gun-control side are offering solutions even if some of their solutions are questionable. With rights come resposibilities and I think one of the responsibilities that comes with gun ownership is to support reasonable gun legislation to reduce the risk that guns pose to innocent people. The NRA is certainly no model of responsibility.",

With rights come resposibilities and I think one of the responsibilities that comes with gun ownership is to support reasonable gun legislation to reduce the risk that guns pose to innocent people.\n\n \n Actually, no. Records of sales are required to be maintained by dealers. Should the dealer go out of business, they are required to submit all records to the ATF. Records on background checks are required to be deleted within a specified time (I think it is 72 hours, but I could be mistaken).\n \n As far as Pro-gun rights advocates contributing to efforts to reduce crime, many groups such as the NRA, GOA, and others, have always been active in giving suggestions and lending support to bills that have a demonstrated propensity to reduce crime, without trampling on the rights of the law abiding. Currently, the NRA is working with legislators to introduce legislation regarding reporting and information sharing within the background check system. \n \n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,269142,00.html\n Gun control activists love to point out any time the NRA or other organizations oppose any firearms restrictions, but often fail to point out when these same groups offer support. One of the biggest problems facing gun control proponents is the lack of understanding and reason among those with the loudest voice calling for more restrictions. Groups such as the Brady campaign have demonstrated many times in the past that they have no understanding of firearms, and continuously offer suggestions that have little or no chance at actually reducing crime. \n \n I think you would find very few pro gun people that would not support effective legislation, as long as they did not place undue restrictions on law abiding citizens. So far, I have yet to see any legislative advice from the Brady Campaign that I would consider reasonable. There is currently no evidence, that I am aware of, that demonstrates that a registration program offers benefits with regard to reducing crime or enabling law enforcement to conduct investigations, that justifies the cost of such a system. Downsides of such systems include everything from financing it to allowing the government easy access for those that wish to strip away rights of law abiding people. For those that would say our government would not do this, look to the events following Katrina in which firearms were illegally collected from citizens. It can and has happened, so this is not just some hollow paranoia seen by pro gun extremists.\n \n As a police officer, the largest problem I have seen with regard to firearms law, is the lack of prosecution to the full extent of the law when there is a violation. You would be amazed at how frequently I deal with the same people over and over again because of reduced sentencing or early release from incarceration. I say we start with strictly enforcing what laws are currently in effect, rather than simply write more that will be ineffective due to deficiencies in prosecution.\n \nWell, there are about 25,000 gun deaths per year in the USA and only about 500 are classified as legally justifiable self defense killings according to the FBI so I don't find the 43:1 ratio so hard to believe.\n\n \n I am not sure where you got your numbers or what types of deaths they include, but the FBI Uniform Crime Report shows an average of about 10,000 murders with a firearm for the years of 2003-2007. If you wish to include other types of firearms related deaths, such as suicide or accidental deaths, then there are other things that should be considered as well. Suicide can be completed many ways and to assume that stricter regulation would reduce the number significantly, is arguable at best. I will grant that a gun can make suicide easier, but this does not mean that preventing access to firearms by law abiding citizens would reduce the number. If you wish to consider accidental deaths, once again, it must be considered what effect stricter regulations for law abiding citizens would accomplish. This is, at best, difficult to even guess at. For laws to be reasonable, particularly when we are talking about laws that effect the rights of law abiding citizens, would it not be reasonable to require that the proposed laws have a demonstrated or at least very high chance of accomplishing what is intended? Should these laws not be effective, we have only limited rights of citizens with no benefit.\n \n As for defense with guns...The number you display only accounts for instances in which the perpetrator was killed. There are many more instances in which either no one was killed or no shots were even fired, yet a gun was still used in a legally justified defensive manner. An accurate number is difficult to arrive at. According to various studies, firearms are used for defensive purposes between 80,000 and 2.5 million times a year. Thats a pretty big spread. This is due partly to whether or not incidents were reported, as well as other data collection issues, but even the 80,000 number (reported by the National Institute for Justice) demonstrates that firearms are indeed a tool that is used in legal defense, more times than they are used to kill, even if you include suicides and accidents.\n \n When considering gun laws, should we not look at the overall net results, and should we not want those results to be a net positive for society? In other words, if a law reduces gun related deaths by 10% yet results in a much higher overall violent crime rate, say 40% just to throw a number out, or significant increase in injuries because firearms were not available for defensive use, is the law beneficial to society?\n \n Justin",

This makes their job much easier - and leaves less suspicion on you if you report that your gun has been stolen before it is used in a crime, rather than after.\n However, this information should not be made public. A few years ago in the UK a tabloid newspaper (I forget which one) got into big trouble because it posted the names and addresses of convicted paedophiles. The same should go for gun ownership lists.\n \n Oh, and Omega? Godwins law.

There are a lot less issues with the 65,000 figure - Ethmi spent a large proportion of 5 pages trying to make various problems stick, and failed every time.\n Furthermore, if you want to include all instances of gun defence then it is only fair that you use all instances of gun offence. According to the 80,000 survey: \"Civilian firearm ownership in the United States carries with it the cost of criminal violence. In 1990, gun-wielding offenders victimized 817 200 persons, killing 12 800 and nonfatally injuring 239,400.\"\n \n If you want to skip the thread and just look at the two surveys, they are here (65,000) and here (2.5 million).\n \n While I fully agree that gun control would be useless if the reduction in gun violence was beaten by a rise in other violence (ie the violence is still there, people just use non-firearm implements), I don't think that this would be the case. However, I can't find data that either confirms or denies this. Just in case anyone knows - I'm looking for the proportion of crimes that are 'crimes of passion' or 'crimes of opportunity', as these will be significantly reduced by gun control. I would imagine that some of the planned crimes would be cut out too - it's harder to go on a rampage through your local school if all you have is a cleaver.\n I'd also ask the same question that I've asked others before - would you rather be attacked by someone with a gun, or someone with a knife/bat/other implement?

I see no reason why the ATF shouldn't be brought into line with all other government agencies and held to strict scrutiny and oversight and limited to exacting guidelines that dictate every single one of their actions.\n \n I have nothing against letting the ATF do their job. However I don't believe that their job should be revoking a person's license over a paperwork error; especially when all relevant information on the buyer is there and the person can easily be found just by using the form. I don't believe a firearms dealer should be facing prosecution because a buyer put \"MS\" on their form instead of writing out \"Mississippi\" like they're supposed to.\n \n \nThat's because criminals in those states tend to get most of their guns out of state. You have to have national gun registration for it to work.\n\n \n So you admit that local laws are a failure that can't possibly stop a criminal from doing as they please.

So blaming us for armed criminals, and saying that we don't want to have any responsibilities just because we're not in favor supporting your ideas like bans on \"assault weapons\" and \"cheap junk handguns\" and \"bulk gun sales\" is a worthless attempt at making us look like the bad guys, because there's no proof that any of these proposed laws qualify as reasonable.\n \n In my opinion there's absolutely nothing reasonable about banning the sale of firearms with simple cosmetic features, declaring that only the rich and wealthy can own guns, and that rationing the exercising of a constitutional right.\n \n It wouldn't be reasonable to restrict someone to buying only one newspaper a month, or only one pencil and sheet of paper a month, or to even invoke their right against self-incrimination in only one of ten cases, so why is it when the discussion comes to gun owners it seems perfectly alright to say \"you can only buy one gun every 30 days\" and suddenly that's reasonable?",

   "Well, there are about 25,000 gun deaths per year in the USA and only about 500 are classified as legally justifiable self defense killings according to the FBI so I don't find the 43:1 ratio so hard to believe.\n\n \n Your misrepresenting the numbers and you know it. Less than half of the 25,000 are murders ( the FBI put the murder number at approx. 10,000), the rest are suicides and \"accidents\".

   "Ian, \n \n Good to hear from you again. While our opinions are certainly different, we have had some great discussion in the past and I always welcome your input. I am quite familiar with with many of the studies conducted on this subject, including those from Kellerman, Kleck, and others. My personal opinion is that they all have flaws, and that discovering the actual number of instances of firearms used for defense may prove to be chasing a red heron. \n \n While I have never tracked the number of instances that I am personally aware of in a given timespan, it would be multiple times per year. If I had to guess, I would say that it is between 8 and 15 in an average year. These are only instances in which I have personal knowledge through response to a request for police assistance and do not include police use of firearms for defense. While this is far from a scientific study, I do think that it indicates firearms may be used far more times for defensive use than many believe.\n \n \nI'd also ask the same question that I've asked others before - would you rather be attacked by someone with a gun, or someone with a knife/bat/other implement? As a police officer, I'd be especially interested in your answer on this.\n \n \n This is actually a very difficult question to answer. Since you specifically asked with regard to my profession, I will answer in that capacity. With regard to knife vs. gun, knife wounds are frequently more fatal than gunshot wounds. This is due to the nature of the two types of wounds. Gunshot wounds are typically smaller in size than knife wounds, thus have a lesser chance of disrupting major organs. Bullet holes also display a self sealing characteristic, due to the elasticity of human skin. It is actually quite easy to shoot someone and miss all major organs and simply poke a hole in them. Knife wounds, however, are typically slashing type wounds covering a larger area. When a blade of sufficient length to penetrate deeply is utilized, the wounds are truly horrific and frequently cause severe damage to multiple vital organs and arteries. The survivability of such a wound is far less than a single, and in some cases multiple gunshot wounds. \n \n There is also the issue of justification. Police officers are held more accountable for actions than about any other profession I am aware of. Not only do we have to answer to our superiors, but we also face criticism from a misinformed, or uninformed public. We frequently make life and death decisions in a fraction of a second, with little or incomplete information. Our decisions are frequently called into question by those with the luxury of retrospect and additional information that was not possessed at the time the decision was made. Many would cry foul with regard to an officer that shot an aggressor armed with a knife, because they believe that a less lethal means should have been used. Once again, look to the time frame in which we are frequently required to act, then take into account the lethality of knife wounds, our safety, and use of force laws. While it is legally justifiable to use lethal force against an assailant armed with a knife (and for good reason), it is difficult to survive public opinion and civil litigation resulting from such action.\n \n With all of this taken into account, I am not sure there is a viable answer to the question presented. While it sounds simple on the surface, like many other questions in life, it truly is a complex question based on many variables of individual circumstances. I guess my simple answer would be that I would prefer for the perpetrator to be armed with a gun, but not know how to use it well. LOL \n \n Justin\n \n \n \n I",

   "Flyboy: Thanks. I think I mis-phrased my question though - I wasn't talking about the actual moment of attack (as this assumes that an assailant has had time to get in range and fire/stab), but instead was asking in response to Ethmi's statement: that 'if someone wants you dead they will find a way'. A couple of ways of re-wording the question - if someone had a grudge against you, would you rather they had a gun or a knife? (or) Do you think that a 'school shooting' would be more or less lethal if the assailants had knives or guns? I wasn't particularly asking you to answer in your capacity as an officer, more I was assuming that you would have experience of both - and not just successful woundings, but attempted assault/manslaughter.\n \n If the answer is still 'knifes are worse' (as I imagine Omegas will be, at least) - why, then, are most killings in the US carried out by guns, and why is there such a big fuss about guns if knives are more lethal?\n \n I agree that gun defences are probably underestimated by the NCVS and overestimated by other studies, but based purely on those two I can see far more flaws in the 2.5 million figure survey than in the 65,000 survey...",

While ballistic gelatin does not model the structure of the body, including skin and bones, it works fairly well as an approximation of tissue and provides similar performance for most ballistics testing.

If you have no first hand experience with something, then you will never know very much about it. You can watch hunting shows and shooting shows, you can read books on it, but it still wont replace experience. Its kind of like me, I am in college right now, and upon graduation, I will enter into my job field as an entry level worker, even though I have been to school for the job, but I have no experience. This applies to anything in life, someone with experience will always know more about the subject at hand, and even with experience, there will always be someone with more experience than you and thus, more knowledgeable. So, if the subject is one in which I have no experience with, I tend to keep quite about it so as not to look like a fool. So in otherwords, if you have no firearms or hunting experience, I would hesitate about debating with someone who does, because you are probably outguned. But I guess if you read a book on how to fly an airplane, you would burst into the cockpit of the flight you are on and begin telling the pilot how to fly the plane.",

   "Alright enough of this stupid ####, let's get down to the facts here. I've never seen an account of bullets bouncing around inside the human body. There are only four occurrences I know of when a bullet enters the body; the bullet will either: completely penetrate with enough energy to punch through anything in its path, be stopped when it comes into contact with hard bone, be stopped by muscle tissue due to insufficient energy, or meet with bone at such an angle that it'll ricochet off and exit the other side without hitting anything else.\n\n \n Your first sentence is in direct conflict to the rest of the post.

   "Do you ever hear what you're saying? Why do police in one area have any justifiable need to know about crime data in an area way outside of their jurisdiction, where an entirely different police force has the jurisidiction? Are you saying that police in New York should be allowed to travel to Alabama to arrest a gun trafficker?\n\n No, I'm not saying that. But why shouldn't the police in New York be able to know that a gun dealer that has moved into their area was involved in gun trafficking in Alabama?\n \n \n\n You're a XXXXX. A civil action is different from a criminal action. Civil actions are like suing over unfair treatment, or small claims court. Criminal action is being charged for murder or robbery or rape. Therefore nobody should have access to firearms trace data for civil actions, as they pose absolutely no relevance of any sort to fighting crime, and are designed only for bankrupting firearms companies.\n \n Suing Bob's World of Guns just because a gun he sold 15 years ago was later recovered in a crime investigation isn't fighting crime, it's nothing more than pure harassment designed to bankrupt his business and amount to one less licensed dealer in the country. Hell, you might as well try and sue a drug dealer for knowingly getting you addicted to cocaine.\n\n Another strawman argument. I'm not saying that gun companies should be unfairly bankrupted or that somebody should be sued for selling a gun in a legal gun transaction that years later ended up being used in a crime. What I object to is such blanket protection against lawsuits that the NRA advocates. \n \n \n\n And the ATF has reported about how ATF agents will dishonestly harass innocent people over paperwork errors and treat them like genuine crimes. I see no reason why the ATF shouldn't be brought into line with all other government agencies and held to strict scrutiny and oversight and limited to exacting guidelines that dictate every single one of their actions.\n \n I have nothing against letting the ATF do their job. However I don't believe that their job should be revoking a person's license over a paperwork error; especially when all relevant information on the buyer is there and the person can easily be found just by using the form. I don't believe a firearms dealer should be facing prosecution because a buyer put \"MS\" on their form instead of writing out \"Mississippi\" like they're supposed to.\n\n If there are problems like that then they should be corrected, but that doesn't explain the NRA's history of opposing the ATF and making it harder for them to crack down on the bad guys. \n \n \n\n So you admit that local laws are a failure that can't possibly stop a criminal from doing as they please. You also admit that a little inconvenience won't deter criminals and convince them that it's not worth the effort to commit a crime.\n \n \n \n Unfortunately not.\n \n \n \n Uh, dude? The Supreme Court didn't determine which gun control laws qualify as \"reasonable\". So blaming us for armed criminals, and saying that we don't want to have any responsibilities just because we're not in favor supporting your ideas like bans on \"assault weapons\" and \"cheap junk handguns\" and \"bulk gun sales\" is a worthless attempt at making us look like the bad guys, because there's no proof that any of these proposed laws qualify as reasonable.\n \n In my opinion there's absolutely nothing reasonable about banning the sale of firearms with simple cosmetic features, declaring that only the rich and wealthy can own guns, and that rationing the exercising of a constitutional right.\n \n It wouldn't be reasonable to restrict someone to buying only one newspaper a month, or only one pencil and sheet of paper a month, or to even invoke their right against self-incrimination in only one of ten cases, so why is it when the discussion comes to gun owners it seems perfectly alright to say \"you can only buy one gun every 30 days\" and suddenly that's reasonable?\n\n The Supreme Court already did say quite a bit about which gun laws could be considered reasonable. So you think those gun laws that you mention are unreasonable. So what your what are your solutions or are you just going to keep complaining?

   "Actually, no. Records of sales are required to be maintained by dealers. Should the dealer go out of business, they are required to submit all records to the ATF. Records on background checks are required to be deleted within a specified time (I think it is 72 hours, but I could be mistaken).\n\n But only records of purchases from dealers, not records of private sales. \n \n \nAs far as Pro-gun rights advocates contributing to efforts to reduce crime, many groups such as the NRA, GOA, and others, have always been active in giving suggestions and lending support to bills that have a demonstrated propensity to reduce crime, without trampling on the rights of the law abiding. Currently, the NRA is working with legislators to introduce legislation regarding reporting and information sharing within the background check system.\n\n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,269142,00.html[/quote]\n That article is from April 2007 and refers to the NICS Improvement Act which has already been passed. Not all gun control advocates were happy with the bill and one referred to it as \"a pro-gun Trojan Horse\". \n http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-sugarmann/trojan-horse-gun-control_b_77754.html\n \n \n\n Gun control activists love to point out any time the NRA or other organizations oppose any firearms restrictions, but often fail to point out when these same groups offer support. One of the biggest problems facing gun control proponents is the lack of understanding and reason among those with the loudest voice calling for more restrictions. Groups such as the Brady campaign have demonstrated many times in the past that they have no understanding of firearms, and continuously offer suggestions that have little or no chance at actually reducing crime.\n\n I see more evidence of the unreasonableness of the NRA. \n \n \n\n I think you would find very few pro gun people that would not support effective legislation, as long as they did not place undue restrictions on law abiding citizens. So far, I have yet to see any legislative advice from the Brady Campaign that I would consider reasonable. There is currently no evidence, that I am aware of, that demonstrates that a registration program offers benefits with regard to reducing crime or enabling law enforcement to conduct investigations, that justifies the cost of such a system. Downsides of such systems include everything from financing it to allowing the government easy access for those that wish to strip away rights of law abiding people. For those that would say our government would not do this, look to the events following Katrina in which firearms were illegally collected from citizens. It can and has happened, so this is not just some hollow paranoia seen by pro gun extremists.\n\n And as I understand most of the guns seized by police were found in homes that were abandoned or had been stolen by criminals. It's not like they used a list of registered gun owners. It does show that guns could be confiscated whether they are registered or not so I don't see how it's an argument against gun registration. \n \n \n\n As a police officer, the largest problem I have seen with regard to firearms law, is the lack of prosecution to the full extent of the law when there is a violation. You would be amazed at how frequently I deal with the same people over and over again because of reduced sentencing or early release from incarceration. I say we start with strictly enforcing what laws are currently in effect, rather than simply write more that will be ineffective due to deficiencies in prosecution.\n \n \n I am not sure where you got your numbers or what types of deaths they include, but the FBI Uniform Crime Report shows an average of about 10,000 murders with a firearm for the years of 2003-2007. If you wish to include other types of firearms related deaths, such as suicide or accidental deaths, then there are other things that should be considered as well. Suicide can be completed many ways and to assume that stricter regulation would reduce the number significantly, is arguable at best. I will grant that a gun can make suicide easier, but this does not mean that preventing access to firearms by law abiding citizens would reduce the number. If you wish to consider accidental deaths, once again, it must be considered what effect stricter regulations for law abiding citizens would accomplish. This is, at best, difficult to even guess at. For laws to be reasonable, particularly when we are talking about laws that effect the rights of law abiding citizens, would it not be reasonable to require that the proposed laws have a demonstrated or at least very high chance of accomplishing what is intended? Should these laws not be effective, we have only limited rights of citizens with no benefit.\n \n As for defense with guns...The number you display only accounts for instances in which the perpetrator was killed. There are many more instances in which either no one was killed or no shots were even fired, yet a gun was still used in a legally justified defensive manner. An accurate number is difficult to arrive at. According to various studies, firearms are used for defensive purposes between 80,000 and 2.5 million times a year. Thats a pretty big spread. This is due partly to whether or not incidents were reported, as well as other data collection issues, but even the 80,000 number (reported by the National Institute for Justice) demonstrates that firearms are indeed a tool that is used in legal defense, more times than they are used to kill, even if you include suicides and accidents.\n \n When considering gun laws, should we not look at the overall net results, and should we not want those results to be a net positive for society? In other words, if a law reduces gun related deaths by 10% yet results in a much higher overall violent crime rate, say 40% just to throw a number out, or significant increase in injuries because firearms were not available for defensive use, is the law beneficial to society?\n \n Justin\n\n I don't see any evidence that gun control leads to an increase in violent crime. You compare gun murders to crimes prevented with guns. A more fair comparison would be between all gun crimes (not just murders) and crimes prevented with guns. Last time I checked it was about 400,000 gun crimes per year but that included only crimes that were reported to police. The true number could be far higher.",

You entire argument can be killed by such a stupid statement.\n \n The police in one state have no jurisdiction in another state, therefore they don't need the data of crimes outside of their own jurisdiction. If the police from one state want or need the help of police from another state, they'll let them know and share any relevant information. Until such time they should mind their own damn business!\n \n \nAnother strawman argument. I'm not saying that gun companies should be unfairly bankrupted or that somebody should be sued for selling a gun in a legal gun transaction that years later ended up being used in a crime. What I object to is such blanket protection against lawsuits that the NRA advocates.\n\n \n The Lawful Commerce in Arms Act specifically states that a firearms company can only be sued if they engaged in genuine criminal action or if they knowingly sold a defective product that was potentially dangerous and did nothing to correct the issue. For all other things, like providing firearms to dealers in \"bad\" neighborhoods no charges can be filed.\n \n \nIf there are problems like that then they should be corrected, but that doesn't explain the NRA's history of opposing the ATF and making it harder for them to crack down on the bad guys.\n \n \n Explain to me how the ATF trying to close down gun dealers guilty of paperwork errors could count as \"cracking down on the bad guys\". I haven't seen them using the data to go after the bad guy who actually purchased the gun, instead they harass the gun dealer for not having absolutely perfect records. That's not fighting crime, no matter how much you try to say that it is, it isn't.\n \n \nThe Supreme Court already did say quite a bit about which gun laws could be considered reasonable. So you think those gun laws that you mention are unreasonable.\n\n \n No they haven't. The Heller ruling was only about the handgun ban and trigger lock provision. They determined that these laws were unreasonable, they never said a ban on AR-15 rifles was reasonable. So until they determine what is and isn't reasonable, I'm not supporting a single piece of gun control that you propose. Because for the simple fact, gun control is NOT crime control.\n \n \nSo what your what are your solutions or are you just going to keep complaining? Try to be part of the solution not part of the problem.\n\n \n My solution is stop trying to add more legislation to guns and instead legislate the criminals. Arrest them, charge them, sentence them, lock them up and stop offering them any sort of deals. If somebody's trafficking guns I want them locked up for the rest of their lives and leave the rest of us alone! Rationing guns doesn't stop gun dealers, it makes them invisible to the police.\n \n Stop shielding criminals already!",
