   "When considering the claim that since DC is not a state, the Second Amendemnt does not apply to DC , one ought to seek to understand what the framers meant by \"a free state\".\n \n \n From Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance(1785):\n \"We the subscribers, citizens of the said Commonwealth, having taken into serious consideration, a Bill printed by order of the last Session of General Assembly, entitled \"A Bill establishing a provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion,\" and conceiving that the same if finally armed with the sanctions of a law, will be a dangerous abuse of power, are bound as faithful members of a free State to remonstrate against it, and to declare the reasons by which we are determined. \" (my emphasis in boldface)\n \n Was Madison referring to Virginia as \"a free state\" in the sense that the commonwealth was one of the states of the Union under the Articles of Confederation? Or was he characterizing Virginia as \"a free state\" meaning a non-tyrannical government in which citizens were able, and duty bound, to defend their rights against dangerous abuses of power by the government?\n \n The answer to that question is found in the list of reasons that Madison gives for opposing the Bill for establishing a provision for teachers of the Christian Religion -the first of which concerns the protection of an individual's right to worship as his own conscience directs and includes Madison's observation that the will of the Majority sometimes tresspasses on the rights of the minority. Thus the concern is not merely for the freedom of action of the \"state\" or the \"government\" but for the freedom of the individual in relation to government. \n \n \"Because we hold it for a fundamental and undeniable truth, \"that religion or the duty which we owe to our Creator and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence.\" The Religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man; and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate. This right is in its nature an unalienable right. It is unalienable, because the opinions of men, depending only on the evidence contemplated by their own minds cannot follow the dictates of other men: It is unalienable also, because what is here a right towards men, is a duty towards the Creator. It is the duty of every man to render to the Creator such homage and such only as he believes to be acceptable to him. This duty is precedent, both in order of time and in degree of obligation, to the claims of Civil Society. Before any man can be considerd as a member of Civil Society, he must be considered as a subject of the Governour of the Universe: And if a member of Civil Society, do it with a saving of his allegiance to the Universal Sovereign. We maintain therefore that in matters of Religion, no man's right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society and that Religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance. True it is, that no other rule exists, by which any question which may divide a Society, can be ultimately determined, but the will of the majority; but it is also true that the majority may trespass on the rights of the minority\"\n \n \n Returning to the Second Amendemnt, one could, as a thought experiment, try adding the words \"of the union\" following \"free state\": \n \n A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free state of the union , the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\n \n Is the meaning retained? \n What function would the word \"free\" have in that sentence? \n Would it act to limit security to only \"free\" states? \n Which states of the Union were not free?\n \n Did the framers believe that \"a well regulated militia\" was necessary only to \"free states\" of the union, or did they hold that belief as a general proposition, and assume that the Union was a \"free state\" in the sense that Madison earlier used the phrase in Memorial and Remonstronce ?",

   "I believe that the term \"free state\" in the militia clause of the 2nd. Amendment is synonymous with the term \"free government.\" The words are nothing more than a reference to a government free from the tyranny of domestic military rule. The entire militia clause itself is nothing more than expression of the fear of standing armies and the preference for relying on militias as a means to avoid the threat of a military tyrant. \n \n Out founders were raised in an era that placed great emphasis on education in the classical European tradition. Under this system of education, they were exposed to writers from ancient Greece and Rome as well as various European political theorists. A list of these authors would have included literary giants like Aristotle, Cicero, Machiavelli, Montesquieu, and others. Indeed, Thomas Jefferson referred to their works as comprising the \"elementary books of public right.\" Jefferson, Living Thoughts, p42. (J. Dewey edition, 1963). From these authors they would have heard the very real fear of standing armies and tyrants. Here are just a few examples of what they would have been exposed to concerning freedom and standing armies:\n \n \"For those who can possess and wield arms are in a position to decide whether the constitution is to continue or not.\" Aristotle, Politics, T. Sinclair Trans. 1962, p. 274.\n \n \"An armed republic submits less easily to the rule of one of its citizens than a republic armed by foreign forces. Rome and Sparta were for many centuries well-armed and free. The Swiss are well-armed and enjoy great freedom. . . .Among other evils caused by being disarmed, it renders you contemptible. . . . It is not reasonable to suppose that one who is armed will obey willingly one who is unarmed; or that any unarmed man will remain safe among armed servants.\" Machiavelli, The Prince, pp. 73 & 81 (L. Ricci, trans. 1952)\n \n Our founders also knew their Roman history, and what happened when tyrants refused to rely on a popular militia comprised of all citizens capable of bearing arms and instead relied upon professional long service soldiers to maintain their empire. As George Mason noted, these troops:\n \n \"no longer considered themselves the soldiers of the Republic, but as the troops of Marius or Sylla, or Pompey or of Caesar, of Marc Antony or of Octavius.\" 1 George Mason, Papers, p. 231 (R. Rutland edition, 1970).\n \n This educational background is significant because our founders felt that history was repeating itself and that they were suffering the oppression of a military imposed tyranny. Our founders did not fight against a foreign power. They fought their own government, which shunned a true citizen's militia and used a standing professional army to oppress them:\n \n \"Nothing will make a nation so unconquerable as a militia, or every man's being trained to arms. . . . And if the generality of housekeepers were only half disciplined, a designing prince, or ministry, would hardly dare to provoke the people by an open attack on their liberties. . . .But without the people's having some knowledge of arms, I see not what is to secure them against slavery. . . .The confidence, which a standing army gives a minister, puts him upon carrying things with a higher hand, than he would attempt to do, if the people were armed, and the court unarmed, that is, if there were no land-force in the nation, but a militia. Had we [England] at this time no standing army, we should not think of forcing money out of the pockets of three millions of our subjects. .[a long list of injustices suffered by the colonists is omitted here] . .There is no end to observations on the difference between the measures likely to be pursued by a minister backed by a standing army, and those of a court awed by the fear of an armed people.\" James Burgh, 2 Political Disquisitions, pp. 390 and 475-76. (London 1774)\n \n Burgh's observations on the struggles of what he deemed \"our brave American children\" were very popular in America. It is worth noting that when popular demand for his work led to the printing of an edition in America, Benjamin Franklin served as the editor. The subscription list for this edition included George Washington, John Adams, John Hancock, and John Dickenson. David T Hardy, Armed Citizens, Citizen Armies: Toward a Jurisprudence of the Second Amendment, 9 Harv. J. L. & Pub. Pol'y 587 (1986).\n \n Patrick Henry is famous for his \"give me liberty or give me death\" oration. He is less known for his proposal urging future avoidance of a standing army and relying instead on a militia:\n \n \"that a well regulated militia, composed of gentlemen and yeomen, is the natural strength and only security of a free government.\" Speech of Patrick Henry in R. Meade's Patrick Henry, p. 28 (1969).\n \n Virginia was the first state to adopt a Constitution (on June 12, 1776, before the Declaration of Independence). James Madison, who wrote the federal Bill of Rights, was one of 28 delegates chosen to draft the original Constitution of Virginia. The drafting committee was chaired by George Mason and included Patrick Henry. Here is the original Virginia Constitution's militia clause as adopted by that committee and later ratified as Section 13 of the Constitution: \n \n \"That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free State; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty; and that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\"\n \n The well-regulated militia clause of this constitution is a statement of principle about how best to avoid the tyranny of a military dictatorship. The principle was deemed so important that it was included by our founders in every other state constitution which followed independence. Here are some examples (note how some substitute \"free government\" for \"free state\"):\n \n CONSTITUTION OF PENNSYLVANIA (August 16, 1776)\n \n \"That the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and the state; And as standing armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; And that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\"\n \n DELAWARE DECLARATION OF RIGHTS (September 11, 1776)\n \n \"That a well-regulated militia is the proper, natural and safe defense of a free government.\n \n That standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up without the consent of the legislature.\"\n \n DELAWARE DECLARATION OF RIGHTS (September 11, 1776)\n \n \"That a well regulated militia is the proper, natural and safe defense of a free government.\n \n That standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought to be under strict subordination to and governed by the civil power.\"\n \n CONSTITUTION OF MARYLAND (November 3, 1776)\n \n \"That a well-regulated militia is the proper and natural defense of a free government.\n \n That standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up, without consent of the legislature.\"\n \n CONSTITUTION OF NORTH CAROLINA (December 14, 1776)\n \n \"That the people have a right to bear arms, for the defense of the State; and, as standing armies, in time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; and that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\"\n \n CONSTITUTION OF VERMONT (July 8, 1777)\n \n \"That the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and the State; and, as standing armies, in time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; and that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\"\n \n CONSTITUTION OF MASSACHUSETTS (October 25, 1780)\n \n \"The people have a right to keep and bear arms for the common defense. And as, in time of peace, armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be maintained without the consent of the legislature, and the military power shall always be held in exact subordination to the civil authority, and be governed by it.\"\n \n CONSTITUTION OF NEW HAMPSHIRE (June 2, 1784)\n \n \"A well-regulated militia is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a state.\n \n Standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up without the consent of the legislature.\"\n \n I believe this is the origin of the 2nd. Amendment phrase: \"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State....\" The militia clause is nothing more than a preamble which states the universally held belief of the time that \"standing armies are dangerous to liberty.\" This is why Madison uses (or rather lifts from the Constitution of Virginia) the words \"free state,\" and why they are interchangeable with the words \"free government.\" I for one am confident that SCOTUS will quickly dismiss the disingenuous argument that DC residents cannot claim 2nd. Amendment protection because it is their misfortune to live in a \"district\" and not a \"state.\" \n \n --- \n \n \"Winning the battle of Pallenis, he seized the government and disarmed the people; and now he held the tyranny firmly, and he took Naxos and appointed Lygdamis ruler. The way in which he disarmed the people was this: he held an armed muster at the Temple of Theseus, and began to hold an Assembly, but he lowered his voice a little, and when they said they could not hear him, he told them to come up to the forecourt of the Acropolis, in order that his voice might carry better; and while he used up time making a speech, the men told off for this purpose gathered up the arms, locked them up in the neighboring buildings of the Temple of Theseus, and came and informed Peisistratus.\" Aristotle, Athenian Constitution.\n \n \"It has been asserted by the most respectable writers upon government, that a well-regulated militia, composed of the yeomanry of the country, have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people. Tyrants have never placed any confidence on a militia composed of freemen.\" John DeWitt, The Anti-Federalist Papers, p. 75 (M. Borden ed. 1965)",

   "To answer the \"free country\" v. \"free state\" question, I believe the phrases are interchangeable. Each phrase would be appropriate and neither is inconsistent with the argument that the militia clause was meant to encourage the people to rely upon a militia as a means to preserve their government from the potential tyranny of a standing army. Similarly, the minority proposal to include the \"common defense\" language is likewise superfluous. If it were included it would still not alter the premise that the militia clause is a preamble warning against relying \"for the common defense\" on a standing army.\n \n Now let me address the re-emergence of the \"free state\" = \"right of the states\" argument in this thread, and its suggestion that the term \"free state\" was meant to confer a \"right\" on the states to be free from federal interference with the militia. I disagree with it, and I can find no historical evidence to support it. \n \n I want to draw attention to a fatal flaw in the \"free state\" = \"right of the states\" argument-namely, the failure to consider the preceding state constitutions. The Virginia Constitution, for example, was written in June of 1776. Madison, who wrote the federal BoR, served as a drafting committee member. With this document the people declared Virginia to be a sovereign state-an independent \"Commonwealth.\" Within this document you will find the following \"free state\" language:\n \n \"That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free state; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty; and that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\"\n \n Now in our current system of government we have three distinct entities: The federal government, the subordinate state governments, and the people. But when the preceding was written we had only two: the brand new government of Virginia and the people who created it. \n \n Here are my questions: Does the \"free state\" = \"right of the states\" argument also hold that the very same language in this Constitution was likewise meant to grant a similar \"right\" in 1776 to the government of Virginia to be free from interference with the organization of its militia? Why would these learned men create such a \"right\" for the government in this Constitution? There is no federal Constitution subordinating the sovereignty of Virginia to another government through a supremacy clause. There are not even Articles of Confederation yet. Who then does the infant Commonwealth of Virginia need protection against interference from? From an imaginary friend shadow federal government, or did Madison and the other committee members decide to grant the new government a \"right\" to be free from the interference of its own citizens? \n \n The \"free state\" = \"right of the states\" argument finds itself on the horns of a dilemma here: it must either adopt this absurd premise offered above for the sake of uniformity, or it must adopt a fluid and entirely Orwellian \"double think\" interpretation of the words \"free state\" which permits the meaning of the words to be changed for the sake of convenience. There is a third option, however, which is to ignore the problem altogether and pretend it does not exist. In my experience this is the option which is uniformly chosen, and I invite anyone who reads this to break with tradition and instead explain away the issue. \n \n I would also like to say this to \"Brady.\" I haven't seen you here before, so welcome aboard if you are new here and if not then I am sorry I have missed you until now. Let me ask you a question if I might: How do you explain the 2nd Amendment phrase \"the right of the people\"? I would dearly like to discuss that issue with you.\n \n ---\n \n \"On every question of construction let us carry ourselves back to the time when the Constitution was adopted, recollect the spirit manifested in the debates, and instead of trying what meaning can be squeezed out of the text, or invented against it, conform to the probable one which was passed.\" Thomas Jefferson, the Complete Jefferson, p. 322 (1957) [Letter to William Johnson, June 12, 1823].\n \n \"Mr. Madison has introduced his long expected amendments. . . .It contains a bill of rights [including] . . . . The right to keep and bear arms.\" Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 52-53 (1854) [Letter to Thomas Dwight, June 11, 1789].\n \n \"The rights of conscience, of bearing arms, of changing the government, are declared to be inherent in the people.\" Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 53-54 (1854) [Letter to F.

   "Nukes are arms too so your argument means you guys want people in DC to own nukes. Thats within shooting distance of the White House. Watch 9/11 happen all over again if you guys get your way. What is this country coming to?\n\n \n \n Absolutely not. I would recommend that you read what I have already posted on this topic within this forum. Do you really believe the \"arms must equal nukes\" argument? No wonder you state \"[w]hat is this country coming to?\" My hope, Brady, is we are coming to a better understanding of our constitutional rights, which begins with a demonstration of why the \"arms = nukes\" argument holds no logic. It has been a favorite sham argument marketed by gun control supporters for years. The argument suggests that since the Amendment contains no limitation we cannot dare interpret it to be an individual right. The result would be the horror of \"rednecks with nukes.\" The illogic of the absolutist argument is obvious when you attempt to apply it to other unqualified rights.\n \n Consider, for example, the equally unqualified expression of rights in the 1st. Amendment: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\n \n \"Religion\" is no more defined than \"arms.\" Does your argument mean that I can avoid a conviction for murder if I choose to exercise my freedom of \"religion\" by sacrificing my first born child on the winter solstice to appease the sun god and ensure a new spring and summer will follow? \n \n \"Speech\" and \"press\" are no more defined than \"arms.\" Does this mean that I can yell \"fire\" in a crowded theater? Does this mean that laws prohibiting libel, slander, and false advertising violate the 1st Amendment? \n \n The problem with the \"arms must also = nukes\" argument is that it chooses to ignore a fundamental rule of constitutional interpretation: No right, no matter how unqualified its expression in the Constitution, is considered absolute. \n \n There are many SOCTUS cases which address this point. I'll choose one-Konigsberg v. States Bar, 366 U.S. 36, 56 (1961)-as an example because it illustrated the point very clearly regarding the 1st. Amendment, and because it mentions in passing the equally unqualified language of the 2nd. Amendment. Here is a quote from that case which addresses your \"absolutist interpretation\" position: \n \n \"That view, which of course cannot be reconciled with the law relating to libel, slander, misrepresentation, obscenity, perjury, false advertising, solicitation of crime, complicity by encouragement, conspiracy, and the like, is said to be compelled by the fact that the commands of the First Amendment are stated in unqualified terms: \"Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble . . . .\" But as Mr. Justice Holmes once said: \"[T]he provisions of the Constitution are not mathematical formulas having their essence in their form; they are organic living institutions transplanted from English soil. Their significance is vital not formal; it is to be gathered not simply by taking the words and a dictionary, but by considering their origin and the line of their growth.\" Gompers v. United States, 233 U.S. 604, 610. In this connection also compare the equally unqualified command of the Second Amendment: \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" And see United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174. (bold emphasis added)\n \n Now I have argued for years that the 2nd. Amendment RKBA, like all other rights, is not absolute and is subject to rational limitations. I admit it is entirely possible that my view of our rights is wrong, however, and I welcome any attempt to prove such. Do you have any further evidence or argument to support your view? Can you find, for example, a single SCOTUS case which holds that any right within the BoR must be afforded an absolute literal interpretation? \n \n ---\n \n \"I do not at all resent criticism, even when, for the sake of emphasis, it for a time parts company with reality.\" Sir Winston Spencer Churchill, Speech in the House of Commons, January 22, 1941\n \n \"False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.\" Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting with approval 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764",

   "I remember a case where a lower district court decided that the Second Amendment only protected a right of the militia to be armed, and in response a state in that district passed a law declaring that every last man, woman and child of legal age, without a prohibiting record, was to be considered a militia member. It was also forbidden for any state or local entity to disarm any of the state's militia members, for any reason, unless they'd become prohibited.\n \n See Brady, that's one of the key issues that manages to destroy your entire logic. A state is well within its rights to declare its entire law-abiding population as its recognized militia, and declare that nobody may disarm them. If the Supreme Court were to decide that the Second Amendment only protects a right for states to have a militia, every single state could easily pass a provision stating that their militia is every last, legal, law-abiding citizen, and that would invalidate many, MANY gun laws, possibly giving ground for the production of new machineguns and short barreled shotguns and rifles.",

He who has nothing, and belongs to another, must be defended by him, and needs no arms: but he who thinks he is his own master, and has anything he may call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses, or else he lives precariously and at discretion. And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury; yet, by degrees, he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command. Our ancestors, by being always armed, and frequently in action, defended themselves against the Romans, Danes, and English; and maintained their liberty against encroachments of their own princes.\" Andrew Fletcher, Political Works, pp. 35 and 221 (1749).\n \n \"In Mississippi rebel State forces, men who were in the rebel armies, are traversing the State, visiting the freedmen, disarming them, perpetrating murders and outrages on them. . . .\" Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, at p. 40 (December 13, 1865) [Speech of Senator Henry Wilson (Republican-Massachusetts)]\n \n \"Make the colored man a citizen of the United States and he has every right which you or I have as citizens of the United States under the laws and Constitution of the United States. . . .He has a defined status; he has a country and a home; a right to defend himself and his wife and children; a right to bear arms. . . .\" Congressional Globe, 39th.

   "As Bryan's quotes show, slavery is a perfect example of the principle of the armed multitude securing for itself liberty from unjust governmental action (without a shot being fired). Nearly an entire population of people was subjugated and the most fundamental aspect of that subjugation was the deprivation of arms. \n \n Even after the ratification of the 13th Amendment free Blacks were not secure in exercising all the rights afforded white citizens. A government permitting such action certainly can not be called a 'free state\" when supposed equal members are not afforded equal rights. \n \n Even if the South had won its independence and reformed its own government there was a realization that slavery, as a widespread institution, was a casualty of the war. Just like Plato recognized a couple thousand years ago arming subjugated people has a consequence. If a war arises, the unjust rulers are faced with a dilemma: \"Either they must call out the common people or not. If they do, they will have more to fear from the armed multitude than from the enemy; and if they do not, in the day of battle these oligarchs will find themselves only too literally a government of the few.\"\n \n Such a realization was expressed in our government after the Civil War:\n \"Let proclamations be withdrawn, let statutes be repealed, let our armies be defeated, let the South achieve its independence, yet come out of the war with an army of slaves made freemen for their service, who have been contracted with, been armed and drilled, and have seen the force of combination. Their personal status is enhanced . . . They will not be returned to slavery.\" -- Rep. George A. Yeaman (Unionist, Kentucky.) from the ratification debates of the 14th Amendment, Cong.
