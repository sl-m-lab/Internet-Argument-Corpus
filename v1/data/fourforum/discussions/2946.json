Why don't you post some undeniable facts?\n\n \n ??\n \n I came across the website and liked the flashes.\n I also thought it would be nice to share them with folks that have not seen them. I think the Rush Limbaugh song is pretty funny, but it would have been funny if it were about anyone, really.\n \n And maybe you think that the depleted uranium one was made up?\n http://www.cadu.org.uk/\n http://www.iacenter.org/depleted/du.htm\n http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/faq_17apr.htm\n \n And I think most people agree about our history with Saddam Hussein, so thanks for the memories, ideed.\n \n So, it's form of presentation is pretty propaganda-ish, but it's not just pulling facts out of the air.\n \n But, if you would like flash animations and movies from more than one website you can find more here:\n http://amurka.com/en/gall_clips.htm (Really funny, but too long.)\n http://www.bluemoosefilms.com/\n http://www.whitehouse.org/\n http://www.whitehouse.org/media/rock_hi.wmv\n http://www.justiceisduckblind.com/\n http://www.moveonpac.org/warrecord/\n http://www.theanti-drug.com/\n http://gwbush04.com/ http://gwbush04.com/v.php?f=vidbushvbush\n http://www.misunderestimated.net/\n http://www.bushflash.com/wmf/Schwartzkopf.WMV (so it's the same site)\n http://www.scaryjohnkerry.com/moore.htm (satisfied?)\n http://www.whackabush.com/\n http://www.downloads.thebluething.com/Flash_files/othermovies/bush-x-ray.swf\n http://www.musicforamerica.org/misc/media_files/bush_fake_ad.mov\n http://www.kucinich.us/tv_ads.php (makes you want to vote for the little tyke don't it?)\n http://64.95.53.25/ctsg/progressive/blsp/Iraq/faithfulamerica_hi.swf\n http://www.democrats.org/kickbushout/index.html\n http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/kerryedwards.php (They're in love!)\n http://www.miniclip.com/knockout.htm\n http://www.dontvoteralph.net/index_ondeck.htm?1\n http://www.bi30archive.org/extras/Powell-Rice-Iraq_no_threat.asx\n http://www.moveonpac.org/warrecord/\n http://www.disgraced.org/\n http://bush.shafted.us/\n http://members.shaw.ca/harrisonflick/apemovie.htm (Pretty funny.)\n http://www.capedmaskedandarmed.com/\n http://www.capedmaskedandarmed.com/video/index.html",

But in fact, it is proven information, which =fact. However, much of the stuff some people link is propaganda. I never said anything about negative stuff about Bush being propaganda. If it's true, then use it. If it's not, I'll sure as hell let you know about i emoticon_xbye",

The little flash cartoons, like most anything, just take some information and present it in such a way as to favor one point of view. Propaganda is a merely sales pitch for a point of view, if you will. A bad form of propaganda is very deceptive, like when the news, which is supposed to be impartial, is biased to one point of view. \n \n If one would rather keep one's mind closed to certain things, that is one's prerogative. I don't see how one can complain about a silly cartoon or a movie that one has not seen. If one would like to complain about something, then maybe one should know what one is talking about. If one takes the time to complain about something, maybe one should see what one is complaining about. Or two, rather.\n \n But, maybe you didn't see the flashes about Kerry. They are harder to find than ones about Bush, mainly because the entire world (except 42% of those polled in the US) has been busy hating Bush for almost four years.",
