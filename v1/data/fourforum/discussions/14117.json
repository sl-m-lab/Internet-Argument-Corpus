   "War is ugly, sorry you don't get that. Of course though, America's version of war isn't nearly as ugly as the radicals we are fighting. They behead innocents just for the sake of terrorizing the world they broadcast their atrocities to for the shock value.

Except for the journalists of course, I agree that they shouldn't be killed. But again, hundreds of journalists have been killed during this conflict by both sides. That's the danger of being in a hot war zone. It's sad but a true reality of the situation they place themselves into.\n \n So please don't make me out to be someone who enjoys seeing innocents killed, EVER!

I think not; I know I would die before I exposed my children to enemy fire in a war zone.

   "Yeah, the dead ones are living such better lives. So are the ones now being subjected to sharia having previously lived in a secular state. The 200 000 Iraqi Christians who have fled the country are particularly loving you.\n\n \n Here ya go Jo, get a touch of truth and reality in your worldview just once in your life, if that is possible. TheReligionofPeace - Top Iraqi War Myths\n \n Here are the first 3 myths to get you started:\n 1) Americans have killed 650,000 Iraqi Civilians\n \n First, it is important to emphasize that nearly all of the civilians who are being deliberately killed in Iraq are dying at the hands of Islamic terrorists, the same demographic responsible for 9/11. For this reason, the percentage of civilians killed by collateral damage from US weapons is extremely small.\n \n During all of 2006, one of the worst years in Iraq, less than 200 Iraqi civilians were killed by American bombs and bullets. All but a tiny handful occurred in action that involved the terrorists, and many (if not most) of these civilians may have been killed by the terrorists themselves in firefights with the Americans.\n \n This actual number comes from news reports which are meticulously collected and tabulated by the anti-war web site IraqBodyCount.net. TheReligionofPeace carefully sifted through each incident to determine responsibility for 2006. (By contrast, about 16,000 Iraqi civilians were killed that year by Islamic terrorists).\n \n 2006 represents one of the more violent periods of the conflict, and it was intentionally set off by al-Qaeda when it destroyed the holy Shiite shrine in Karbala. Additional research ( from 11/28/05) shows that the number of civilians killed prior to this by collateral damage from coalition troops during the most intense period of conflict is probably about 1,000.\n \n IraqBodyCount.net believes the total number of civilians killed from \"the effects of war\" during the first four months to be around 7,000. Even this statistic is highly exaggerated, since the enemy there is not known to fight in uniform. In all probability, the immense effort of coalition forces to avoid civilian casualties was quite successful and the true number is between 2,000 and 3,000, perhaps lower.\n \n The ridiculous figure of 650,000 (which has since been upped to 1.5 million or more) was published by the same people who lumped victims of terror together with casualties of war to come up with the claim that 100,000 had been killed about halfway through the war (during the heaviest of combat operations). Apparently this didn't generate the sort of shock they were hoping for, so they went back to pull an even larger number out of their XXX for a new Lancet article in October of 2006.\n \n Iraq is not an inaccessible backwater. It has a modern communications infrastructure, as well as hospitals and morgues. It is simply unfeasible that 600 civilians could die everyday from violence without the morgues, news media, or the police knowing about it. One might also wonder why millions of others would decline to seek medical treatment for the serious injuries that they are alleged to have suffered (according to another part of the same report), since they never showed up in hospitals. Taken at face value, this would be about 1 in 3 residents of the Sunni triangle who are supposed to have been maimed.\n \n These published studies are not based on real numbers, however, but rather extrapolated from an extremely small statistical sampling in the most violent areas of Iraq. So woefully unreliable was the methodology of the first one that it actually begrudged a 92% margin of error - meaning that its conclusions could be closer to 8,000 deaths, which would have put it in line with reliable news sources. Again however, the vast majority of casualties would have been at the hands of Islamic terrorists. Cluster bomb mishaps, for example, were both rare and highly publicized.\n \n The figure of 1.5 million civilian deaths is not employed out of accuracy, but rather expediency. Public sympathy can be manipulated by arbitrarily inflating the number of civilians killed in the conflict. It also attempts to obscure the fact that nearly all of the deaths of innocents are occurring at the hands of the very people that coalition forces are trying to stop, as well as the fact that the actual civilian death rate was far higher under Saddam, and would be much worse in a future without a stable security force to support the democratic government.\n \n Ultimate responsibility for the carnage in Iraq lies with the supremacist ideology that inspires young Muslims to throw bombs into marketplaces, neighborhoods and rival mosques - and not with the Western values that impel good men to lay down their lives in defense of the victims.\n \n \n 2) Insurgents only want an end to the &#65533;Occupation&#65533;\n \n According to this myth, the insurgents are so repulsed by the presence of foreign troops in their country that they are forced by conscience to take up arms and kill fellow Iraqis by the hundreds each month. If the Americans were gone, then the &#65533;insurgency&#65533; would evaporate and these Iraqis would respect their democratically elected government.\n \n In the first place, these would have to be extremely dimwitted insurgents, since their own murderous rampage is the sole reason that American troops remain. The democratic Iraqi government is clearly working toward self-sufficiency, but its efforts are being undermined exclusively by the terrorists, hence the need for external support. Clearly, there are ulterior motives involved that are not as palatable to Western tastes.\n \n What does blowing up a revered Shiite mosque have to do with evicting foreign troops? What about tossing bombs into marketplaces or universities? Where's the logic in killing Iraqi shoppers and students, or in fomenting sectarian violence?\n \n The impartial observer will also note that the &#65533;insurgency&#65533; is conspicuously and curiously limited to 20% of the country (the so-called &#65533;Sunni Triangle&#65533;) even though all of Iraq is technically under &#65533;occupation.&#65533; Why isn&#65533;t the resistance spread evenly &#65533; if it is truly an Iraqi insurgency, and not merely a Sunni ploy to regain hegemony under the guise of freedom (or the banner of Jihad)?\n \n In fact, virtually all of the suicide bombers (who cause the most damage) are not Iraqi at all, but instead come from places like Saudi Arabia, where the lives of Iraqis are not highly valued.\n \n Although anti-war and anti-American propagandists search desperately for appealing terminology that will legitimize the violence, the fact remains that the vast majority of Iraqis have chosen to live peaceably under their own chosen democratic government\n \n \n 3) Fighting Terrorism Simply Creates More Terrorists.\n \n There is some merit to the argument that it doesn&#65533;t take much to inspire the holy warriors of Islam to suicide bombings and other acts of violence in the name of Jihad. The very fact that many of these misguided Muslims can be manipulated into leaving a country such as Syria, where the dictator has willfully slaughtered tens of thousands of suspected Islamic fundamentalists to retain power over the years, only to travel to Iraq and engage in the slaughter of innocent Muslims (most of whom haven&#65533;t completed the Hajj) speaks to just how gullible Islamic radicals are to the misinformation tactics of secular puppet masters.\n \n Still, al-Qaeda had no problem attracting thousands to its training camps well before America started fighting back in the war on terror, and it is a fact that such sociopaths have to live somewhere. If no country feels that it can safely harbor terrorists without facing severe consequences, then their numbers will naturally shrink.\n \n Since America made terrorism a national defense issue, rather than a legal matter, and began building allies in the battle, totalitarian regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq have been overthrown and replaced by democracies. The world is no longer threatened by Saddam Hussein, or forced into guessing games regarding his WMD programs. Syria has been pressured into ending a very brutal occupation of Lebanon, and elections have been held there, as well as in Egypt. Libya has given up its WMD program and surrendered its stockpiles. Islamic terrorists are under pressure across the globe now from Pakistan to the Philippines.\n \n There is no perfect solution to terrorism, but the passive approach taken in the 1990&#65533;s obviously has far harsher consequences for citizens in the West. The American policy of non-confrontation and appeasement was rewarded with successively bolder attacks against military, diplomatic, and civilian targets, culminating in the loss of 3,000 innocents on 9/11.\n \n For 1400 years, Islamic terrorists have always found reasons for hating and killing non-submissive infidels, in keeping with the teachings of their religion. No amount of appeasement will ever change this.\n ",

The American policy of non-confrontation and appeasement was rewarded with successively bolder attacks against military, diplomatic, and civilian targets, culminating in the loss of 3,000 innocents on 9/11.\n \n For 1400 years, Islamic terrorists have always found reasons for hating and killing non-submissive infidels, in keeping with the teachings of their religion. No amount of appeasement will ever change this.\n \n I don't deny that some troops are resonsible for murder, mostly in the heat of battle in which case they're not just cold-blooded murderers. But, for some reason, the leftist media has an agenda against American troops.",

   "It's way past time that the Pentagon stopped protecting the perps.\n \" The release last Monday of the US military video Collateral Murder by Wikileaks has already being dubbed a landmark equal to the Abu Ghraib pictures. It could not have come at a more appropriate time as global organisations of journalists commemorate today a similar slaughter of journalists that took place at the hands of the US army seven years ago. Just before noon on 8 April 2003, journalists billeted at the Palestine hotel in Baghdad watched in horror from their balconies as an M1A1 Abrams tank fired a heat round from nearly a mile away on the Jumhurya bridge toward the hotel. The shell hit a 15th-floor balcony, fatally wounding veteran Reuters cameraman Taras Protsyuk and Spanish cameraman Jos\u00e9 Couso of Telecinco. Three other Reuters staff were injured &#8211; Paul Pasquale, Samia Nakhoul and photographer Faleh Kheiber.\n \n ................................................................................\n \n For the last seven years, journalists' organisations have been urging US presidents &#8211; first George Bush, now Barack Obama &#8211; to meet their obligations and deliver justice and fair treatment to the victims of violence by its own soldiers. Their lack of response so far has been the same, showing their armed forces that criminal brutality or carelessness would not be punished. As John Simpson wrote: \"Since the first world war, every war in which the Americans have fought has been marked by unnecessary civilian deaths &#8230; Now, it seems, there may be a new distinguishing feature of American wars: the killing of journalists.\" \"\n \n \n US must deliver justice on friendly fire | Jim Boumelha | Comment is free | guardian.co.uk",
