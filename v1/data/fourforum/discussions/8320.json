Some of those ricers make some serious power and are pretty quick. Reminds me of when I was dragging motorcycles ..... I was spotting the Harleys inches and they were spotting me weight. The lesson I learned is inches are hard to beat. Good luck! Let us know how it went.\n Dono",

Will it come back down the return track under it's own power?\n\n \n Suspension is stock style F-body. It does have adjustable LCA's and torque arm, though. The rear is a 12 bolt Moser w/4.10 gear and full spool. And not only does it return under its own power, it's tagged, insured and occasionally street-driven. At $11/gallon for C16, he doesn't drive it on the street much, however. emoticon_wow \n \n As for handling down the 1320, it launches straight when the track is prepped but has gotten a little squirrelly at the big end a couple of times. At US131 on his first pass two weeks ago, the track hadn't been prepped yet, so the sand dragged down the first 100' by the street-driven ricers played hell on his launches. He had to lift or take out the center timing box. After they swept and re VHT'd the track, his launches were straight but top end was iffy. \n WE've yet to get close to full boost because track conditions prevented it.\n This Saturday we're heading to Chicago to race a full chassis 7 second race car that's giving him a handicap.emoticon_xgood",

Honestly, I'd rather drive my 10 second Z28 than his. His turbo exhaust dumps straight down in the engine compartment so there's some CO in the passanger compartment when it's idling.\n \n The full spool is surprisingly calm on the road, I don't understand why, though. My Detroit Locker makes more noise and clunks than his spool. \n He had a big racing radiator in it and custom air deflector. It cruises at <200F as long as you keep your foot out of the loud pedal. emoticon_xgood",
