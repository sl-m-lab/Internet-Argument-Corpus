   "and Mauls the Lions:\n \nPresident Obama traveled to a House Republican retreat in Baltimore on Friday and delivered a performance that was at once defiant, substantive and engaging. For roughly an hour and a half, Obama lectured GOP leaders and, in a protracted, nationally-televised question-and-answer session, deflected their policy critiques, corrected their misstatements and scolded them for playing petty politics.\n \n .... Standing on a stage, looking down at his Republican questioners, Obama assumed the role of responsible adult to the GOP children, or, at the very least, of a college professor teaching and lecturing a room full of students.\n \n He chastised Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.) for calling his economic agenda radical and poked fun at the GOP's own platform. \"I am not an ideologue, I'm not,\" he said. \"It doesn't make sense if somebody could tell me, 'You could do this cheaper and get increased results,' then I would say, 'Great.' The problem is, I couldn't find credible economists who could back up the claims that you just made.\"\n \n He rebuked a questioner who insisted that the monthly deficit is higher now than Bush's annual deficit. \"That's factually just not true,\" he said. \"And you know it's not true.\" He lampooned Republican lawmakers seated in front of him for portraying his health care legislation as \"some Bolshevik plot.\" He mocked Republicans for railing against the stimulus package and then showing up at \"the ribbon-cuttings for some of these important projects in your communities.\" And he did it all while calling for \"a tone of civility instead of slash and burn will be helpful.\"\n\n Sam Stein in Huffington Post:\n Obama Goes To GOP Lions' Den -- And Mauls The Lions\n \n And about time. They had it coming.",

   "I think it really showed up some in the GOP caucus as being hectoring nay-sayers. All they were trying to do was trip up Obama and try and throw enough mud that he can't evade all of it. The GOP were treating it like a round of Prime Minister's questions over here (look it up on the BBC website if you're curious, it's both entertaining and depressing), constantly trying to score points. Now sure Obama was looking to gain political capital out of this, but he seems to genuinely want a dialogue, and his points about how demonising rhetoric from both sides boxes them into confrontation because after that rhetoric, compromise makes people electorally vulnerable.",

They should have called him on lies more than they did. He got a few softballs thrown at him; that's about it. I was impressed by the level of civility he encountered, but they should have at least challenged him more on his failures and deceptions.",
