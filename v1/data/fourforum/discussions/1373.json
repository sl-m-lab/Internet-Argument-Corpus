My favourite Beatles track is \"A Day in the Life\" which was principally a Lennon song.\n \n However, it was Paul who moved them ahead, artistically. Lennon, you might recall was happily married and living a suburban existence with wife #1, whilst single Paul was with the arts scence with Jane Asher and family.\n \n Lennon never was sure where he stood, sometimes he was counter-culture, sometimes anti-left ('you can count me out' he said in Revolution).\n \n Musically, George was a mere shadow. His solo compositions, both post-Beatles and during, are easy to forget.\n \n A very good book to read is \"Revolution in the Head\" by Ian McDonald which goes through every one of the Beatles releases and tells you how they are structured, where mistakes were made etc.",

He was only going to do one lousy show in Melbourne, anyway, but then he cancelled. He claimed because it was so close to the Bali Bombing that it would be in bad taste. Instead, he went on to tour a few more shows in the USA.\n \n He used the Bali tragedy as a means of worming out. Other bands still came, and regularly do; U2, Rolling Stones, the Chilli Peppers etc. I was disgusted that he'd use this tragedy as an excuse - considering he did a concert in New York shortly after 9/11... concerts aren't the issue.\n \n He was due to come here in his 1989-90 tour, but cancelled to do a few more shows in the USA, so he's not changed.\n \n All up, he came here with the Beatles, once.\n With Wings, once.\n Then in 1992.\n \n We seem to be a part of the world he's not keen to re-visit.",
