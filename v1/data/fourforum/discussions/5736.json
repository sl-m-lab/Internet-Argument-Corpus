   "http://edition.cnn.com/2005/BUSINESS/06/21/ford.jobs/\n \n \nThe job cuts announced Tuesday amount to 5 percent of the automaker's North American salaried workforce and will take effect by October 1. They come in addition to a reduction of 1,000 salaried positions announced in April, Ford announced.\n \n The company said Tuesday that its full-year earnings guidance is now $1.00 to $1.25 per share, versus earlier guidance of $1.25 to $1.50 per share.\n\n \n the rumor is that these are engineering and R&D positions. If this is the case, has ford decided to go out of the aurto business? There will be no new product offerings without R&D and engineering staff.\n \n The decrease in earning projection is no surprise (I hope MM did nto buy that ford stock he was considering).",

   "This is actually something Ford has been considering for a while.\n \n Ford NA will concentrate on engineering and development of truck and truck based products.\n \n Ford Europe (Including Volvo) and Mazda will do the engineering for automobiles.\n \n As it stands the only car that was fully developed by Ford NA I believe has been the Lincon LS which lead to the Ford Thunderbird to the Ford Mustang. Every other car developed by Ford since the last Taurus has been either a Mazda or Ford Europe product adapted for Ford NA use.\n \n Even the Ford 500 was developed from a Volvo, the Focus from Europe, the Freestyle a Volvo",

   "GM is looking at a 20% across the board reduction and I think Ford's just getting their knife sharpened. Both are currently concentrating on white collar labor as there's little savings in cutting manufacturing labor until current union contracts expire (workers get paid almost full salary and benefits working or not). \n \n Ford has been selected by China to implement Chinese dealer financing (flooring) and then consumer financing and leasing. I haven't found any details of the corporate structure, but since China takes a 50% position on everything with controlling interest, one would think Ford has a separate entity constructed to shield it from declines in their N. American activities.",
