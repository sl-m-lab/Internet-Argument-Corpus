   "More than a thousand gay-rights activists gathered Thursday afternoon outside the Mormon temple in Westwood to protest the role Mormons played in passing Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in California.\n \n It was the latest in an escalating campaign directed against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for its role in marshaling millions of dollars in contributions from its members for the successful campaign to take away same-sex marriage rights.\n \n Members of the Mormon church, who were strongly urged by church leaders to contribute to the Proposition 8 campaign, had an undeniable role in the measure's victory. Opponents of Proposition 8 have accused the church of discriminating against homosexuals, but the backlash against the denomination has also sparked accusations of discrimination.\n \n During the campaign, a website established by Proposition 8 opponents used campaign finance data and other public records to track Mormon political contributions to the Yes-on-8 campaign. Opponents estimated that members of the church had given more than $20 million, but the amount is difficult to confirm since the state does not track the religious affiliation of donors.\n \n Critics of the website noted that the religious affiliations of other political donors are not generally researched.\n \n A commercial opposing Proposition 8 also drew criticism. In it, two actors portraying Mormon missionaries forced their way into the well-kept home of a married lesbian couple.\n \n \"Hi, we're here from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,\" one says.\n \n \"We're here to take away your rights,\" says his partner.\n \n The missionaries then rip the wedding rings from the women's fingers and ransack their house until they find the women's marriage license, which they destroy.\n \n \"Hey, we have rights,\" one of the women says.\n \n \"Not if we can help it,\" answers the missionary.\n \n The ad was produced by an independent group not affiliated with the official No-on-8 campaign and was shown on MSNBC and Comedy Central, according to Rick Jacobs of the Courage Campaign, a progressive political group.\n \n Jeff Flint, strategist for Yes on 8, called the ad \"despicable\" and said it \"crossed every line of decency.\"\n \n \"I am appalled at the level of Mormon-bashing that went on during the Proposition 8 campaign and continues to this day,\" he said. \"If this activity were directed against any other church, if someone put up a website that targeted Jews or Catholics in a similar fashion for the mere act of participating in a political campaign, it would be widely and rightfully condemned.\"\n \n Members and leaders of the Catholic Church and other Christian churches were also heavily involved in the campaign to pass Proposition 8. The Knights of Columbus, which is tied to the Catholic Church, gave $1 million, and several evangelical groups gave millions more. But they have not come under the same kind of attack.\n \n Leaders of the No-on-8 campaign said they did not believe they were engaged in Mormon-bashing. \"This is not about religion,\" said Jacobs. \"This is about a church that put itself in the middle of politics.\"\n \n Kate Kendell, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said she had grown up in the Mormon Church and thought it was \"very disappointing what the church has done and the alliances they have made with churches that don't even like them and have called the church a cult.\"\n \n Church officials made few public statements during the campaign. On Thursday, they issued a statement asking for \"a spirit of mutual respect and civility.\"\n \n \"The Church acknowledges that such an emotionally charged issue concerning the most personal and cherished aspects of life -- family and marriage -- stirs fervent and deep feelings,\" church spokeswoman Kim Farah wrote in an e-mail. \"No one on either side of the question should be vilified, harassed or subject to erroneous information.\" She did not elaborate.\n \n Outside the Los Angeles temple Thursday, dozens of protesters screamed \"Bigots\" and \"Shame on You\" at half a dozen men in button-down shirts and ties who looked out at the demonstration from behind the temple's closed gates.\n \n The men did not respond.\n \n Benjamin Wiser, 27, came to the protest dressed as a Mormon missionary, complete with black plastic name tag.\n \n It was not a costume, he said. He was a missionary and a member of the church until age 23, when he left because he was gay.\n \n Wiser said he did not feel the protesters were unfairly targeting the church.\n \n \"I don't think the Mormon church should be involved,\" he said.\n \n Some gay-rights activists said they plan to continue to question the church's involvement.\n \n Lorri L. Jean, chief executive of the Los Angeles Gay & Lesbian Center, which organized the rally outside the temple, announced the launch of a new website, invalidateprop8.org, which will raise money to fight for same-sex marriage rights in California.\n \n For every $5 donated, Jean said, a postcard will be sent to the president of the Mormon church condemning \"the reprehensible role the Church of Latter-day Saints leadership played in denying all Californians equal rights under the law.\"\n \n \"It is a travesty that the Mormon Church bought this election and used a campaign of lies and deception to manipulate voters in the great state of California,\" she said.\n \n David Loder, 40, a business manager from Corona and a member of the Mormon church, heard about the protest on the radio. He said he was saddened by the anger directed against the church.\n \n Loder said he had not given money to the Yes-on-8 campaign because finances are tight raising five daughters, but he did put a sign in his frontyard. It was vandalized, he said.\n \n \"As a member of the LDS church we have known [and still do] the feeling of being ridiculed and mistreated because of our faith,\" he said.\n \n Garrison and Lin are Times staff writers.\n\n \n Prop. 8 protesters target Mormon temple in Westwood - Los Angeles Times\n \n \n I find it sad that Mormons are being harassed so much, however I feel no sympathy. They did something very wrong. They supported Prop. 8, and now they have to pay for it. If I had the time, I'd be right up there with them.",

That is what our system of voting is for! Denying minority groups their rights, of course. Freedom is so unAmerican! How unpatriotic of me to suggest otherwise!\n \n Yea, archie. Unlike you we don't all live in the Republic of Gilead (look it up).\n \n \nHow dare you people think you have the right to punish or condemn anyone for exercising their right to vote their consciences regarding such a personal issue of defining marriage!\n\n \n Its not a personal issue at all. I say this when it comes to abortion, but if you don't like gay marriage, then don't marry a man. Simple as that. It is not personal to you at all, it is just the selfish bigoted desire to meddle with someone else's marriage. How would you like it if there was a proposition that would split up your marriage? Other's marriages is not your business. Period. It is flat out unconstitutional.

Prop 22 was not only legal it was [B]perfectly[B] legal.p\n\n \n It clearly violates the equal protection clause of the California constitution, hence their need to literally change it.\n \n \n \n \nYou are arrogantly and foolishly presuming others see homosexuals as a minority - good luck pulling that off... Shallow Hal. I've said it many times in other threads, you don't have a civil right to be gay... secondly, the US Constitution [therefore California's] doesn't not protect who are. It protects what you are - you seem dumb enough to confuse that though.\n\n \n So homosexuals are not a minority, there a majority? If you don't have a right to be the way you were born, then why do blacks have civil rights? Why do women have civil rights? Again, same argument used with Jim Crow laws. \n \n \n \n \nNo, you go against everything this country was founded on, and then vainly attempt to justify it with some idiotic and relativistic explanation. Don't you dare dare confuse American value's and virtues with that twisted derelict mindset you claim as American. It is vile and and debilitiating... and ultimately self destructive because it cannot settle on clarity... only convenience.\n\n \n I'm terribly sorry. I was under the false idea the America was founded on freedom, equality, and justice. My bad. I forgot that it designed to be a theocracy that denied its subjects and minority groups civil rights.\n \n \n \n \n \nTheir sexual choice has nothing to do with their sovereignty as citizens.\n\n \n When did you choose to be heterosexual? When did my sister choose to be a woman? When did my neighbor choose to be black?\n \n \nThe better good of the union comes before personal choice here - that is called the rule of law.\n\n \n Not sure what personal choice you're talking about.\n \n \nLaws that are clear enough for a self governing body politic to grow as a multi-ethnic, and culturally diverse union... not multi-cultural and politically correct but morally bankrupt, lawless and relativistic group of people doing what is right to them in their own eyes.\n\n \n I'm sure the Nazis said the same thing about the Jews and anyone else they didn't like.\n \n \nYou need to read the federalist papers, and then read the Preamble... as well as the Constitution, without interpreting it... but with the intent on understanding what it actually says - you'll walk away with a very different perspective, called truth to which you are no where in the radar range of.\n\n \n \"We the people in order to form a more perfect union establish justice and ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\"\n \n Liberty, eh? Looks like that preamble came to bite you in the butt. As for the constitution, Prop. 8 clearly violates \"Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Unless we do it the Conservative way and interpret \"liberty\" as \"lack thereof\".\n \n \n \nOf course reason and common sense are a joke to you... now it is I that is getting the chuckle you foolish individual. Minds like your only ensure lawlessness will remain a public saftey and national security issue for generations to come.\n\n \n Fortunately, I am having the last laugh on the basis that you forgot what country you life in, or at least the basic views of the founders.\n \n \"Liberty\" is not forcibly removing a minority group's civil rights, no matter which way you put it.",

This un-american intimidation is based on bigoted and heterophobic assumptions and prejudice.

   "You don't even know what side of the argument I am on with regards to this specific issue (proponents targeting church).\n\n \n Who cares but you...\n \n \n \nGay rights have majority support on every issue but one.\n\n \n By who? More propaganda from you.. but I don't' expect more. NO, you're wrong the majority has always shut down the virulent pro gay \"rights\" lobby.\n \n \nGay marriage is the only exception.\n\n \n Minds like yours had their legal day and lost... buck up buttercup.\n \n \nGay adoption? Majority support.\n\\\n \n Again... blanket conjecture here, many have [like I do] a problem with gay adoption. Children should not be subjected to fantasy games of people who in one way or another may mean well.. but no, no... family is what has been from day 1 - man and woman at the top.\n \n \nGays in the military? Majority support.\n\n \n The military is governed by a different set of codes, and understandably so... they are held to a higher standard because mortality is at the root of their service. The morays and values of the nation a military protects is well expected that their military observes... no gays means no gays, they don't have time for village people fantasy games.\n \n \n \nGay employment / housing protection? Majority support.\n\n \n Unless you are referring to the majority at your coffeehouse... I'd like to know who this phantom majority is? Employers don't have the right to discriminate - however, they have a perfect right to not hire anyone who does not fall in sync with their values, the 1st. Amendment protects them there and since we are talking a sexually behavior... and not a handicap or ethnicity... sorry pal, it doesn't not fall under federal protection and should never. People need to know and be confronted with the stigma of bad consequence that the state should not be protecting. Housing... is already protected whether I like it or not. Liberalism likes to erase consequences for lawless behavior, no wonder we are in the horrible shape we are in, they have boundary issues - the law makes clear, and was further reiterated by the popular vote by referendum by all Californian's... gay, straight, liberal or conservative, Prop 8 was a no brainer and had put down these mad rantings by social engineers, just deal with it.\n \n \n \nHate crime legislation covering sexual orientation? Majority support.\n\n \n No it doesn't and still is hot contested... you lied there. As evidence by the clarity of the yes vote on Prop 22 to Prop 8... no means no. They also understand why the left wants hate crimes legislation... as propaganda to further their agenda with normalization, which look like that may not be challenged by Yes on * poeple.. why? common sense... people are people gay or not and we already have laws on the books to protect people from assault or intimidation.\n \n \nAnd even on the \"gay marriage\" issue, your time is limited...\n\n \n No... you nutter, we just reveresed you time and thclock is ticking before we pull the rug out from under you nut bucket gay lobby folks. \n \n \n \nThe last time California had a \"gay marriage\" legislation, it passed by a much larger percentage than today.\n\n \n True, but Prop 22 had far more time to prepare to get on the ballot... given the same time, I dout you'd be voicing the same irreverent tone... no means no.\n \n \nAs the years pass by, you keep losing percentage points on gay marriage. There is a huge age gap on the issue. Your biggest support is in the oldest age group.\n\n \n \n OK Tokyo Rose... keep it up! More obfuscation from you... what emprical evidence provides is that you keep loosing the \"majority\" support you just claimed was on your side.. therefore the ACLU has to come in and find a court sypanthectic to their claims where they will get a favorable outcome [which is legally beyond questionable] and then have the court overstep their consitutional bounds all for a lifestlye. Prop 8 corrected errant judicial fiat... that was the right thing to do. Thw radical element of sycophants supporting this nonsense have boundary issues and have no business taking them out on our courts and wasting taxpayer money. \n The younger voters, 18-30, have majority support for gay marriage.\n As time marches on, you're going to lose. Just like time marched on and racism and sexism lost...[/QUOTE]",

   "ALSO, you radicals act like the extremism you spew is a universal perspective within the homosexual community, but it isn't. Here's an opposing view from a fellow homosexual. Now show me how unified you are as you trash her too, just for disagreeing with you. Note the bolded in the hope that you will actually learn something.\n \n Gays against Same Sex MarriageNot all same-sex attracted persons support same-sex \"marriage.\" Far from it! We've already blogged about the position of the philosopher Lee Harris. Reproduced below are the closing paragraphs from \"What Homosexuals Want,\" an insightful article by Eve Tushnet, a same-sex attracted Catholic woman struggling, like all of us, to live a Christian life. \n The same-sex marriage debate has focused on the question of what marriage is. But perhaps it's better to begin from a different angle: Why does society give marriage special honor? Because it's this honor that activists are really seeking. If homosexual couples could cobble together all the bureaucratic oddities and benefits (and penalties) that attend marriage but the law still refused to call their unions \"marriages,\" no one can pretend the activists would be satisfied.\n \n What they are seeking is not, or not primarily, the right to confer Social Security benefits on their partners upon their death or medical power of attorney. What homosexual activists seek is honor - a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. So we should start with the fact that our society exalts marriage over all other chosen relationships. Yet marriage is hardly the only important kind of relationship.\n \n Many women will admit their best friends are closer to them than anyone else. (This fact has spawned a whole genre of \"chick flicks,\" from beaches to Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.) Many men will acknowledge they are more open with their friends than with their wives and that they are fiercely loyal to their friends. We rely on friends in familial, romantic, financial and medical crises.\n \n Then there are siblings; uncles and aunts, nieces and nephews; beloved teachers; professional mentors; godparents; and models of faith. Most of us are blessed with at least one of these people in our lives - the person who was there for us, who believed in us, who guided us. We incur great debts to these people, and we live in loyalty to them. But we are not married to them, and no one is arguing that we should be. So clearly there is something more about marriage that merits our attention.\n \n Marriage does more for society than the other kinds of loving, dedicated relationships. These other relationships do less to nurture children by giving each child a mother and a father; to corral the often destructive forces of sexual desire into loving and productive channels; to bring people from youth to adulthood; and to align the interests of parents and children rather than forcing tragic choices between the two. Marriage gets honor from society because it does all these things more than any institution does or could.\n \n Marriage developed over centuries to meet several specific, fundamental needs: children's need for a father, a couple's need for a promise of fidelity (and consequences for breaking that promise), young people's need for a transition to manhood or womanhood and men's (and women's, but mostly men's) need for a fruitful rather than destructive channel for sexual desire - a way of uniting eros and responsibility. In other words, marriage developed to meet the needs of opposite sex couples.\n \n At this point, the most common question that arises is, \"So what? Okay, maybe marriage didn't develop in response to same-sex couples, but c'mon - how can Bob and Jim getting married really affect your marriage?\" There are three basic reasons to think same-sex marriage will damage, perhaps fatally, the institution of marriage - maybe not in this generation, but in the one that grows up with same-sex marriage as the norm.\n \n The first reason is simple: This is America. This nation is built on the idea that even minorities can shape the culture they enter. Racial and ethnic minorities have already done so; no honest author could write a history of American culture without noting how much of it began as black culture, Jewish culture, and Irish culture. And from TV shows like \"XXXXX Eye for the Straight Guy\" to subtler infusions of \"camp\" humor, homosexual culture is already affecting the majority culture.\n \n The second reason is that homosexual activists are merely picking up on a trend begun by and for opposite-sex couples. Same-sex marriage is just the next step in the divorce culture. The belief that marriage is merely the way that our culture expresses its approval of atomistic adults' sexual and romantic partnerships isn't new - it's the same \"me generation\" worldview that produced \"fatherless America.\"\n \n And finally, unlike easy divorce, same-sex marriage would change the fundamental ideal of marriage. Even the most ardent defenders of divorce today view it as a necessary evil, a response to the tragedy of marriage failure. Same-sex marriage by contrast, would say that the ideal marriage is gender neutral - not a way for boys to become men by marrying and pledging to care for women. It would say that the ideal marriage includes children only when they have been specially planned and chosen - children would become optional extras rather than the natural fruit and symbol of the spouses union. It would say that the ideal family need not include a father - a message that is especially pernicious in a country where one-third of births in 2000 were to unwed mothers. And it would say (because who can imagine that most homosexual couples would wed?) that marriage itself is optional, not the norm - that marriage is for heroes, and since you and I aren't heroic, we must not be called to marry. Any one of these changes would be destructive. Put together, they are a recipe for disaster, a recipe for revisiting and surpassing the harm done to families by the \"sexual revolution.\"\n \n Marriage has taken a beating. Americans cohabit, we divorce, we remarry, we split our resources between several sets of children. But we still have hope that we may recover the true meaning of marriage, because we still know the ideal: the lifelong, fruitful union that makes boys into husbands and fathers, and reconciles the \"opposite sexes\" to one another. Same-sex marriage would mean losing that ideal and losing our best hope for marriage renewal.StayCatholic.com - What Homosexuals Want",

We've already blogged about the position of the philosopher Lee Harris. Reproduced below are the closing paragraphs from \"What Homosexuals Want,\" an insightful article by Eve Tushnet, a same-sex attracted Catholic woman struggling, like all of us, to live a Christian life. \n The same-sex marriage debate has focused on the question of what marriage is. But perhaps it's better to begin from a different angle: Why does society give marriage special honor? Because it's this honor that activists are really seeking. If homosexual couples could cobble together all the bureaucratic oddities and benefits (and penalties) that attend marriage but the law still refused to call their unions \"marriages,\" no one can pretend the activists would be satisfied.\n \n What they are seeking is not, or not primarily, the right to confer Social Security benefits on their partners upon their death or medical power of attorney. What homosexual activists seek is honor - a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. So we should start with the fact that our society exalts marriage over all other chosen relationships. Yet marriage is hardly the only important kind of relationship.\n \n Many women will admit their best friends are closer to them than anyone else. (This fact has spawned a whole genre of \"chick flicks,\" from beaches to Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.) Many men will acknowledge they are more open with their friends than with their wives and that they are fiercely loyal to their friends. We rely on friends in familial, romantic, financial and medical crises.\n \n Then there are siblings; uncles and aunts, nieces and nephews; beloved teachers; professional mentors; godparents; and models of faith. Most of us are blessed with at least one of these people in our lives - the person who was there for us, who believed in us, who guided us. We incur great debts to these people, and we live in loyalty to them. But we are not married to them, and no one is arguing that we should be. So clearly there is something more about marriage that merits our attention.\n \n Marriage does more for society than the other kinds of loving, dedicated relationships. These other relationships do less to nurture children by giving each child a mother and a father; to corral the often destructive forces of sexual desire into loving and productive channels; to bring people from youth to adulthood; and to align the interests of parents and children rather than forcing tragic choices between the two. Marriage gets honor from society because it does all these things more than any institution does or could.\n \n Marriage developed over centuries to meet several specific, fundamental needs: children's need for a father, a couple's need for a promise of fidelity (and consequences for breaking that promise), young people's need for a transition to manhood or womanhood and men's (and women's, but mostly men's) need for a fruitful rather than destructive channel for sexual desire - a way of uniting eros and responsibility. In other words, marriage developed to meet the needs of opposite sex couples.\n \n At this point, the most common question that arises is, \"So what? Okay, maybe marriage didn't develop in response to same-sex couples, but c'mon - how can Bob and Jim getting married really affect your marriage?\" There are three basic reasons to think same-sex marriage will damage, perhaps fatally, the institution of marriage - maybe not in this generation, but in the one that grows up with same-sex marriage as the norm.\n \n The first reason is simple: This is America. This nation is built on the idea that even minorities can shape the culture they enter. Racial and ethnic minorities have already done so; no honest author could write a history of American culture without noting how much of it began as black culture, Jewish culture, and Irish culture. And from TV shows like \"XXXXX Eye for the Straight Guy\" to subtler infusions of \"camp\" humor, homosexual culture is already affecting the majority culture.\n \n The second reason is that homosexual activists are merely picking up on a trend begun by and for opposite-sex couples. Same-sex marriage is just the next step in the divorce culture. The belief that marriage is merely the way that our culture expresses its approval of atomistic adults' sexual and romantic partnerships isn't new - it's the same \"me generation\" worldview that produced \"fatherless America.\"\n \n And finally, unlike easy divorce, same-sex marriage would change the fundamental ideal of marriage. Even the most ardent defenders of divorce today view it as a necessary evil, a response to the tragedy of marriage failure. Same-sex marriage by contrast, would say that the ideal marriage is gender neutral - not a way for boys to become men by marrying and pledging to care for women. It would say that the ideal marriage includes children only when they have been specially planned and chosen - children would become optional extras rather than the natural fruit and symbol of the spouses union. It would say that the ideal family need not include a father - a message that is especially pernicious in a country where one-third of births in 2000 were to unwed mothers. And it would say (because who can imagine that most homosexual couples would wed?) that marriage itself is optional, not the norm - that marriage is for heroes, and since you and I aren't heroic, we must not be called to marry. Any one of these changes would be destructive. Put together, they are a recipe for disaster, a recipe for revisiting and surpassing the harm done to families by the \"sexual revolution.\"\n \n Marriage has taken a beating. Americans cohabit, we divorce, we remarry, we split our resources between several sets of children. But we still have hope that we may recover the true meaning of marriage, because we still know the ideal: the lifelong, fruitful union that makes boys into husbands and fathers, and reconciles the \"opposite sexes\" to one another. Same-sex marriage would mean losing that ideal and losing our best hope for marriage renewal.StayCatholic.com - What Homosexuals Want\n\n \n \n \n I was listening to a couple of talk radio shows and there were several gay and lesbian individuals who voiced their disgust at the protests... and \\all of them voted liberal, but they voted yes on 8 all of them.",

   "Nope. Sexual orientation is about much more than behaviour, according to psychology.\n\n \n Sorry... you cannot rest you laurels on psychology... it is n nothing more than the art of the mind. Philosophies and egomaniacal guessing games by bloated rhetoricians espousing all types of silliness other than basic accountability. They Therapize everything... nothing can be your fault, something had to be the problem... therefore, etc.. etc. I have 6 years of psychology under my belt, 4 years of clinical, 1 years of industrial, and 1 years of deviant studies and a year and a half of residence in a marital counseling clinic - you couldn't be further from the truth. Today it is nothing but subjective partisanship just like scientism. That is why left the study... and medicine has no respect for it. Listen.. I totally understand how you could to the conclusion that psyrchology could somehow answer this, and am not trying to rip you on this... it is just I know from experience that it isn't.\n \n \n \n \nHate us all you like, and rant about it to anyone who will listen. Constitutions exist to protect the minority, from unjustified discrimination. This is what will be argued in court.\n \n \n You are living in rebellion, you chose to believe what supports how you feel... no one has done one thing to me. I don't' \"hate\" anyone... I despise the behavior, I am supposed to. But you haven't done anything to me, and vise versa. Constitutions [in general] do nothing more what they were designed to, I am serious, you might consider relocating to France, they have a constitution that is the exact opposite of what we have here... their Constitution based on rights granted by the state... here they are by God, their philosophy is rooted in classic humanism, here it the rich tradition of Judeo Christian principles, which have done nothing but good for those who practice them, and benefited those who haven't. A sexually deviant proclivity is lawlessness, and deserves to be punished by law, and lewd act laws are still on the books - for both hetero and homosexual behavior. Sex is not a protected right sanctioned by the constitution, however it is regulated through marriage, the ACLU lawyers vainly trying to argue this knwo the truth of it. You know this too... which worries me because this nothing but a rant by you. \n \n \n \n \nThe fact in and of itself, that one person has presented an opinion, does not mean it speaks for the majority in the group, or even a sizeable minority. It doesn't indicate those who want the right in the group, shouldn't have it. That's all I was saying.\n \n \n \n You're attempting to trivialize the truth of the statements by expressing your personal denial of consensus arguments is a tactic, but at the same time you have posted arguments in this very thread doing the same thing, the only problem is... your point of view is not universsaly known to br right. So, no buddy... you're wrong on this.\n \n \n \n \nWell you said something about those who engage in it, don't feel they have a right to engage in it.\n\n \n That is the problem with doing the wrong thing, people feel perfectly justifid in doing it... doesn't make it right, now does it?\n \n \n \n \nHa, plainly and simply: condescending and meaningless. Get over yourself. I don't need or ask for your permission.\n\n \n \n I dont' know what that was all about but I am sure it was you smelling your own fumes. Like I said before... you don't have a right to be gay, you are survived thy the grace of those who live and let live, force their hand and you mind a social climate for more unfacilitating you have been brainwashed [because you have]\n \n \n \n \nThat's right, Yoda taught us well. May the force be with you.\n\n \n \n They were... they said resoundingly, Yes on 8!\n \n \n \n \nNo, there is no universal consensus on this. The ballot initiative was not a poll on that issue, specifically. It's problematic to call it a proper scientific poll on marriage itself. This is because it's only a poll of those election voters who felt strongly enough one way or another, to mark the ballot on this issue. \n\n \n \n Yes there is, and you are wrong to deny that. Only a fool looks in the mirror and denies the image relfected back at him merely for the escapist illusion of what they would prefer to see. The ballot issue was not a poll on the matter, it was the correction of an unethical and egredious eror on the behalf of the High Court of California.\n \n \nAccording to polls, there is majority support on most gay issues. Many have been posted at this site, several times. I'll see if I can find any to re-post perhaps. Now of course, not everyone who has gay sex feels guilty about it, as you claim. It's only those who protest so loudly against it, who are saying they hate themselves.\n\n \n \n Try as you may to scan the globe for any ray of light to give you the slightes modicom of hope that what you engage in somehow \"ok\" is the problem with today's homosexual, you \"feel\" as though you have a perfect right to do what you do, and you don't... but it has been made permissible within certain areas, b ut that isn't good enough. You're right in this... the one's completely given over to the lusts of their hearts - and you want the high court to support that? surely you jest...\n \n \n \n \nSee what I said above about polling, genius. Anyway, if you are doing to bring the DOMA, into the conversation, I can point to the fact that the California legislature passed equal marriage, with a majority. Yes, the present Governor, one person, did veto it.\n\n \n \n You need help, yes you could but you intentionally celebrate the fact that the \"majority\" was the state legislature... not the body politic. It was fiat legislation, not by the voters that is the problem. Yes, the state assembly and legislature are the most radically senseless group in the nation. They take taxpayer money with an unwarranted sense on entitlement and favor felling over facts everyday... of course you lobby that point... \"genius\" fact is... all this was just subterfuse, and sanctimonious sophistry. In this country.... not anywhere else, people are judge how they behave. There is and continues to be a lot of flexibility in that but there are boundaires and this radical set just doesn't get that.",

   "It is a perfectly just law, morally clear law... quintessential law. Law isn't that subjective valuation of what you need it to be for how you want to live.\n\n \n Again, I don't know how denying a minority civil rights is in any way \"moral\" or constitutional. It clearly violates California's equal protection clause, and I don't see how civil rights are a voting matter. This does not affect you in any way, therefore I don't see how you could consider voting on someone else's rights legal or just.\n \n \n \nHomosexuality is a morally indecent act, and your unjustified myopic expression and dismissal what is right and wrong is your eyes is highly subjective but socially inexcusable.\n\n \n Believe what you want, Phelps, but I have most of America behind me. America is ready to move to the future, and hate is the way of the past. Interracial marriage was also considered by some \"morally indecent\" and wrong. However, good will always prevail, as it will with gay marriage.\n \n \nThe behavior is reprehensible... shameful and confusing for children. Therefore in the pursuit of that which is just, and right in preserving what was right yesterday... right today, so the same values are passed on tomorrow \"equal protection\" or equal provision for the next generation is our responsibility today. The fact that it abrases your \"sensiblities\" is moot...p\n\n \n Please tell me how this is any different than interracial marriage. This exact same language that was used. It was called \"reprehensible\" and \"shameful\", yet people eventually came to their senses and gave human beings the rights they deserved. \n \n No matter how you put it, discriminating against someone for the way they were born. Its equally as wrong to call a genetic variation a \"choice\" in order to justify your hate. Homosexuality is merely a variant of heterosexuality. Like brown eyes to blue eyes, red hair to blond hair. We are not a truly advanced society until we accept that.\n \n \nThat is a lie and yes... it is our duty to regulate it because the behavior unchecked has huge negative implications on society, your denials are part of your delusion.

So... lets poke a hole [no pun] in that vapid bubble we'll call this abject denial of yours:\n\n \n You still have yet to prove to me that you are in any way above your garden variety bigot. You are discriminating against someone for the way they are.\n \n I am sure that in about 50 years people who thought homosexuality was in any way less than heterosexuality will be viewed like those who thought negros were inferior.\n \n \n \nThese are unbiased sources gathered by a conservative resource provide a concise picking apart of your vain assertions and needless incantations:\n \n Domestic Violence Statistics\n Homosexuality Statistics - Conservapedia\n \n Promiscuity & Health\n Homosexuality and health - Conservapedia\n \n Homosexuality and Crime\n Homosexuality and Murders - Conservapedia\n \n Mental Health\n Mental Health and Homosexuality - Conservapedia\n\n \n I am not going to even click on those until you can find me unbiased scientific studies to support your claim. Not \"conservapedia\".\n \n Did I also forget to mention that Christian heterosexual couples have the highest rates of divorce? I saw a good political cartoon once. It depicted a man and a woman half naked lying in bed. The man says \"Proposition 8 will protect the integrity of marriage between a man and a woman\", and the woman says \"You sound just like my husband.\"\n \n Did I also mention that Gay Marriage generally benefits society? The whole \"Gay marriage is a destructive behavior\" and \"Gay marriage destroys marriage, and is destructive society\" is a lie perpetuated by the wacky right to further their selfish bigoted agenda.\n \n With gay marriage, we will see a large scale decline of aids. It will also open more loving homes to children in need, and don't even try to pull the argument that gays are any less qualified than straights in raising children. The parents' race, gender, or sexual orientation are completely irrelevant. Its how much they love, care, and nurture their children. It sickens me that you would make the sweeping generalization that all gays are bad parents and all straights are good parents. A child coming out of a gay home can be much more successful and happy than a child coming out of a heterosexual home.\n \n \nShooter, your profound ignorance is stunning... \"logic\" - listen logic and you are like ends of a magnet, you repel each other. Infertility is a medical condition you narrow-minded jackal, sex had nothing to do with it. The fact that you would even imply that speaks volumes to the lengths a nutter will go to substatiate their behavior.\n\n \n \n Are you recanting? You clearly state that the only purpose of sex and marriage is to have children, but infertile couples are incapable of this. I obviously stumped you by this question enough for you to hurdle personal attacks at me like a 12 year old instead of answering a question.\n \n \n \nYou lie... in the worst of ways, conservatives have empirical evidence on their side, blind fools who have need to suppress the truth present only of history what may imply a \"sort of\" support for their empty arguments, but never pans in the light on intellectual honesty.\n\n \n Oh, I'm sure they do.

Supposedly, your Christian God gave you logic, yet you refuse to use it. You have still not answered the question on why anyone would choose to be gay. Instead, running out of options and your points losing validity by the post, resort to childish personal attacks like \"Shallow Hal\" and \"Narrow-minded Jackal\".

Were there people out there who just needed a few more months of convincing to vote against gay marriage?\n \n \n \nTruly a sign that the \"fairness\" you radicals project is only for your cause, but if the people truly speak up - well, that is just not acceptable. But if it the vote broke the other way in your favor... you'd singing a different song. Liars and hypocrites all of you radicals are.\n\n This is thoroughly ludicrous!\n The \"fairness\" regards treating two groups equally.\n \n By your approach, somebody talking about the inequality of the deep South and Jim Crow laws would be countered by you with claims of \"hypocrisy\" cause the public voted the discriminating laws into effect... emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nBut... there is a larger issue that needs to be addressed, what were unions such as the Californian Teachers Union... and top school board officials doing donating funds and taking taxpayer money to advocate no on Prop 8... a clear embedded bias and clearly unethical. They had no business offering taking member contributions for an open abuse such as this... a total outrage.\n\n \"unethical\"???\n By what standards?\n There is no law that says they have to swing one way or the other.\n If anything, the anti-gay marriage crowd made their involvement a necessity when the anti-gay marriage crowd started lying about what schools would do.\n \n \n \nThe donations from the Yes Vote came from sources that were a) non controversial and valid b) from authorized and ethical sources... \n\n emoticon_xdonno\n There are clear questions of violating tax exemption status of churches on this issue.\n Tax exempt churches are required not to get involved in political issues, but that is EXACTLY what the Mormons did. 2% of the population making up 33% of the funding...\n \n \n \nLastly, you can't some one a bigot for making the appropriate judgment for indecent behavior being equivocated as equally valid.\n\n It's funny you say that, but what you're talking about is nothing like that.\n And for the record, bigotry typically revolves around people who have \"judged\" something as \"indecent behavior\".\n With blacks, women, Jews, etc, etc...\n Somebody makes some \"judgment\", expressing their bigotry...\n \n The only real difference here is that YOU PERSONALLY view this as \"indecent behavior\", while the others have moved onto equal recognition.\n \n \n \nYou radicals co-opting of language to try to make your brainless arguments valid are more evidence of a depraved and deluded minded that cannot accept the reason, and justice... because justice not \"just us\" was served, and cannot be reversed - that is the beauty of it.\n\n Tell me.\n When women got the right to vote, \"who\" was \"served\"?\n Did the men benefit?\n \n When blacks got employment protection, \"who\" was \"served\"?\n Did the white man benefit?\n \n To complain about \"just us\" is ludicrous. It can be applied to every civil rights movement.",

   "Again, I don't know how denying a minority civil rights is in any way \"moral\" or constitutional. It clearly violates California's equal protection clause, and I don't see how civil rights are a voting matter. This does not affect you in any way, therefore I don't see how you could consider voting on someone else's rights legal or just.\n\n \n You behavior doesn't make you a protected class... I know you nut buckets like repeating that until you believe it, but it is simply false. Your basic premise is right... but your application grossly errant. \n \n \n \n \nBelieve what you want, Phelps, but I have most of America behind me. America is ready to move to the future, and hate is the way of the past. Interracial marriage was also considered by some \"morally indecent\" and wrong. However, good will always prevail, as it will with gay marriage.\n\n \n Well... keep clicking your heels Dorthy, maybe you'll find yourself back in that coffeehouse you seem have such an adoring majority. But your abject denial doesn't make your argument true. Fact is every voter initiated proposition nationally resoundingly puts your arguments in the trash where they belong, it is only through cajoling the courts or legislature to get their way... those are the only successes you have to report... wow, you must have lowered expectation because your view of \"majority\" falls short of the reality of what it actually is. \n \n \n \n \nPlease tell me how this is any different than interracial marriage. This exact same language that was used. It was called \"reprehensible\" and \"shameful\", yet people eventually came to their senses and gave human beings the rights they deserved.\n \n \n You tell me how it is the same? and times have always reflected a correction to biases based on ethnicity and gender, funny how homosexuality got left out of that. It is a baseless argument to even think you can compare your sexual choice to an innate ethnic or gender feature. It is grand foolishness to consider otherwise... regardless how you feel, you have no case.\n \n \n \nNo matter how you put it, discriminating against someone for the way they were born. Its equally as wrong to call a genetic variation a \"choice\" in order to justify your hate. Homosexuality is merely a variant of heterosexuality. Like brown eyes to blue eyes, red hair to blond hair. We are not a truly advanced society until we accept that.\n\n \n \n Discrimination against behavior is necessary, it is how we know right from wrong... that judgment faculty is a basic faculty of human reason. You like the moral relativists who argue this confuse the issue intentionally. There is no gay gene... so you can't go hanging you hat on that. It hat been thoroughly be-dunked by objective science... and don't childishly accuse people of hate because you don't' agree with them, it truly is at the height of childishness. Homosexuality isn't a variant of anything but self will... it is unnecessary, illogical, unreasonable and bio-illogical... you analyze those reasons... you have no intellectual argument other than fessing up to what it is, choice... and a bad one. You will never find that excuse you are looking for to hang your choice on buddy... so keep clcking them heels. \n \n \n \n \nYou still have yet to prove to me that you are in any way above your garden variety bigot. You are discriminating against someone for the way they are.\n\n \n I don't need to prove anything... you simply have no evidence to support your projections. Homosexuality is a behavior and nothing more... and we can openly chose to ignore those who make a claim that it is anything more than what it is... a deviant sexual proclivity.\n \n \nI am sure that in about 50 years people who thought homosexuality was in any way less than heterosexuality will be viewed like those who thought negros were inferior.\n\n \n Maybe... but I am quite sure they will be in the back of coffeehouses making the same bogus claims you are today. In effect... 1+1 will still equal 2... and therefore and I rest in the knowledge that as long that holds true... other empirical truths will hold as well - despite the gelatinous logic of the insane set.\n \n \n \n \nI am not going to even click on those until you can find me unbiased scientific studies to support your claim. Not \"conservapedia\".\n\n \n \n Of course you aren't... but you will anyway, because you just have to know [even for the mose sadistic reason] what all the evidence says. Conservapedia just posted the data... they post their sources.\n \n \n \nDid I also forget to mention that Christian heterosexual couples have the highest rates of divorce?\n\n \n That is true... I won't argue that, but it is for different reason that what exists in the data supporting homosexual promiscuity... I see you read it anyhow.\n \n \n \nI saw a good political cartoon once. It depicted a man and a woman half naked lying in bed. The man says \"Proposition 8 will protect the integrity of marriage between a man and a woman\", and the woman says \"You sound just like my husband.\"\n\n \n \n And all of that ws to say whay?\n \n \n \n \nDid I also mention that Gay Marriage generally benefits society?\n\n \n \n Ooooo, you little liar... here let me give you a source from one of your politically correct euro-nut countries... Sweden. Marriage is dying in scandinavia because... if gays get \"married\" and divorce or engage in rank adulutery - where are the lines for heterosexual couples... this has a tremdously negative impact on society... just keep drinking that Kool Aid buddy.\n \n The End of Marriage in Scandinavia Source: The Weely Standard\n \n \n \nThe whole \"Gay marriage is a destructive behavior\" and \"Gay marriage destroys marriage, and is destructive society\" is a lie perpetuated by the wacky right to further their selfish bigoted agenda.\n\n \n \n It is the exact opposite, the normalcy of of A bio-illogical behavior even remotely being propagated as good for society has been projected and rammed down the throat of mainstream society... note: they never had to force heterosexuality on anyone, it just kinda happened that way, ya know? Choice... buddy, you'll never escape that.\n \n \n \nWith gay marriage, we will see a large scale decline of aids.\n \n \n That is a flat out lie, the \"unions\" have higher rate of divorce than hetero marriages, that and besides, the nature of homosexuality is sex, it is all about sexual promiscuity - sleep with whomever for whatever reasons. Geez.. you're way out with that one, though I don't' like them... even modern psychologists admit that.\n \n \n \nIt will also open more loving homes to children in need, and don't even try to pull the argument that gays are any less qualified than straights in raising children. The parents' race, gender, or sexual orientation are completely irrelevant. Its how much they love, care, and nurture their children. It sickens me that you would make the sweeping generalization that all gays are bad parents and all straights are good parents. A child coming out of a gay home can be much more successful and happy than a child coming out of a heterosexual home.\n\n \n \n No one has made the argument that people who engage in homosexual acts are less qualified, it is the questionable nature of the relationship in the household that raises valid moral arguments, and they haven't gone away.\n \n \n \n \nAre you recanting? You clearly state that the only purpose of sex and marriage is to have children, but infertile couples are incapable of this. I obviously stumped you by this question enough for you to hurdle personal attacks at me like a 12 year old instead of answering a question.\n\n \n \n You couldn't stump a fetus... give me a break, I answered your question head on. I stated that the natural purpose of marriage is to procreate... sex even in marriage still is a choice. What did you stump? The unfortunate situation with infertile couples can be form many sources, heredity... lifestyle, work, medication... and no one attacked you, you are being treated at face value for how you come off - if you don't like... present something viable. \n \n \n \n \n \nOh, I'm sure they do. Hitler, your conservative poster boy, was totally intellectually honest.\n\n \n \n Well.. gee since you have to bring Hitler into it, he [like you] hated religion... but was heavily into the occult. He butchered homosexuals.... why? because if you bothered to read Mien Kampf... he makes no illusions about hi influence by Darwinian naturalism... that with Marxist social policies, there was no master race with homosexuals. So even you own mind sets don't have real warm welcome for you... you can cut the ####. You just hate what Christianity or religion stands for and hang you vile hatred of such on them with no cause... you're a rebel without a clue. No follower of Christ has done that to any gay. \n \n \n \n \nI really feel sorry for you and most conservatives. Supposedly, your Christian God gave you logic, yet you refuse to use it. You have still not answered the question on why anyone would choose to be gay. Instead, running out of options and your points losing validity by the post, resort to childish personal attacks like \"Shallow Hal\" and \"Narrow-minded Jackal\". This is a debate forum, not 8th grade gym class. \n\n \n \n The only child in this forum is the that can't see past their own clueless self indulgences, like they say... when you point a finger beware because you have three pointing right back you. Read... the above, I respond how I am responded too. Besides... you need to get lit up anyway. You haven't added one shred of anything but your own subjective valuation of your own behavior in this thread, be mindful... you are paddling across a vast ocean of logic and reason in a little dingy of self willed obstinance, you will drown in it.",

So I'll say it again! You thugs have no right to harass or intimidate any american for how they voted in a legal election, PERIOD!!! It is not only their right, but their responsibility to vote their conscience, not yours, so for you punks to then think you are standing up and fighting for your rights just exemplifies how twisted your moral compass is. \n \n Because what you are doing is disrespecting the democratic process which billions of people on Earth wish they could rely on as we have, but which you spit upon because the vote didn't go your way. You are terrorists who are fighting to destroy our system of governing. Your actions are larger than the issue you're protesting against. It is standing against a legally binding process for how the california constitution is amended. And that is not only reprehensible and un-american, it is criminal.\n \n So call me a homophobe all you like. But this isn't even about your homosexuality; it's about your sleazy tactics of attacking americans because you don't like how they voted as free americans in a legal election.\n\n \n \nActually, Archie, what they're doing is completely American. Its called the first amendmant, and it protects free speech. Furthermore, they're allowed to have peaceful protests all they like. \n\n No shooter, you are wrong! Protesting city hall or marching on Washington would be examples of directing your demands to the Government in one unified voice, but what these scumbags are doing is targeting and harassing churches specifically because they assume the people who attend them voted a certain way in a legal election. That is political terrorism and personal intimidation on another group of citizens. So, it's a perversion of the 1st amendment which aligns with every other aspect of your twisted world view, which is why you either can't see, or refuse to see that you are corrupting our democratic process by attempting to intimidate americans who didn't vote the way you think they should vote as free americans. \n \n \nThe unamerican bigots who vote for unconstitutional and hateful amendments which have NO AFFECT AT ALL ON ANYONE BUT GAYS are truly unAmerican. These American folk who are fighting for their rights are doing the right thing.\n\n \n You keep making this fallacious claim shooter, so it's about time you prove this amendment is UNCONSTITUTIONAL or stop making the claim. Because I'm calling you a blatant liar to make such a claim, so prove me wrong if you can.\n \n \nThe only thing that Prop. 8 passing has shows in how morally twisted 51% of California is. I fear that we have a long way to go before becoming a truly progressive and advanced society.\n\n \n You've got that statistic wrong. It's the 48% of californians who voted against prop 8 who are morally twisted reprobates. Redefining marriage for 96% of the population to satisfy the demands of 4% so they can have an unnatural sexual relationship is anything but progressive.",

Do you not understand that gays feel the same love for each other that hetero couples do?\n \n \n \n \nAnd all of that ws to say whay?\n\n \n Marriage is not about the physical qualities of its participants. Its about love, and its ironic that the people who screwed marriage up so badly (Hetero couples) are going to determine who can and can't marry. \n \n \n \nOoooo, you little liar... here let me give you a source from one of your politically correct euro-nut countries... Sweden. Marriage is dying in scandinavia because... if gays get \"married\" and divorce or engage in rank adulutery - where are the lines for heterosexual couples... this has a tremdously negative impact on society... just keep drinking that Kool Aid buddy.\n\n \n Don't use sources from other countries either. I've made this clear in the gun control forum, that there are cultural differences that destroy the controls of the study. Care to find evidence from another state that says gay marriage somehow harms society? In fact, while I'm at it, how does gay marriage harm society?\n \n \n \n \nIt is the exact opposite, the normalcy of of A bio-illogical behavior even remotely being propagated as good for society has been projected and rammed down the throat of mainstream society... note: they never had to force heterosexuality on anyone, it just kinda happened that way, ya know? Choice... buddy, you'll never escape that.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nThat is a flat out lie, the \"unions\" have higher rate of divorce than hetero marriages, that and besides, the nature of homosexuality is sex, it is all about sexual promiscuity - sleep with whomever for whatever reasons. Geez.. you're way out with that one, though I don't' like them... even modern psychologists admit that.\n\n \n I don't see how gays can be more or less promiscuous than straights.\n \n \n \n \nNo one has made the argument that people who engage in homosexual acts are less qualified, it is the questionable nature of the relationship in the household that raises valid moral arguments, and they haven't gone away.\n\n \n Morality has nothing to do with gay marriage. Morals are rules that apply to humans that says it is wrong for one human being to harm another. The Christian right have twisted the word \"morals\" so much that it sickens me to hear the word. Gay marriage hurts no one more than heterosexual marriage does, therefore morals are irrelevant. Furthermore, the relationships in homosexual couples are the same as those in heterosexual couples. I don't see how a homosexual couple raising a child is any less than a heterosexual, unless you are arguing for the lack of a male/female figure in the child's life, which is understandable, however this occurs with children with single parents as well.\n \n \n \nYou couldn't stump a fetus... give me a break, I answered your question head on. I stated that the natural purpose of marriage is to procreate... sex even in marriage still is a choice. What did you stump? The unfortunate situation with infertile couples can be form many sources, heredity... lifestyle, work, medication... and no one attacked you, you are being treated at face value for how you come off - if you don't like... present something viable.\n\n \n No, you did not answer my question. If the purpose of marriage is to procreate, and you're using the argument that gays can't procreate and therefore can't marry, then why should infertile couples be allowed to marry.\n \n \n \nWell.. gee since you have to bring Hitler into it, he [like you] hated religion...\n\n \n Of course he did:\n \n \"I believe today that my conduct is in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator.\"\n \n - Adolf Hitler\n \n \"Once again the songs of the fatherland roared to the heavens along the endless marching columns, and for the last time the Lord's grace smiled on His ungrateful children.\"\n \n - Adolf Hitler\n \n \nbut was heavily into the occult. He butchered homosexuals.... why? because if you bothered to read Mien Kampf... he makes no illusions about hi influence by Darwinian naturalism... that with Marxist social policies, there was no master race with homosexuals. So even you own mind sets don't have real warm welcome for you... you can cut the ####. You just hate what Christianity or religion stands for and hang you vile hatred of such on them with no cause... you're a rebel without a clue. No follower of Christ has done that to any gay.\n\n \n Jesus Christ, in himself, was a good man. He preached tolerance and love. Its his followers that really scare me. They twist his belief of being nice and love to bible thumping conservatism that discriminate against gays and women. If Jesus was alive, he'd be the most loving, giving, and overall good person ever. He'd be a liberal hippie holding up a peace sign.\n \n \n \nThe only child in this forum is the that can't see past their own clueless self indulgences, like they say... when you point a finger beware because you have three pointing right back you. Read... the above, I respond how I am responded too. Besides... you need to get lit up anyway. You haven't added one shred of anything but your own subjective valuation of your own behavior in this thread, be mindful... you are paddling across a vast ocean of logic and reason in a little dingy of self willed obstinance, you will drown in it.\n\n \n Be advised, you are guilty of the exact same negative debating tactics as I, however it is your job to provide evidence if you make accusations. I have provided plenty of logic, and you have provided none at all. My logic:\n \n Why would anyone choose to be gay?\n Homosexuality is merely a variant of heterosexuality. It is the same thing directed toward a different person. It appears this way in all aspects, and manifests itself in the exact same behavior as heterosexuality. You have yet to prove beyond the bible that there is anything wrong about homosexuality. You have also yet to prove to me who it hurts.",

   "Sorry... you cannot rest you laurels on psychology... it is n nothing more than the art of the mind. Philosophies and egomaniacal guessing games by bloated rhetoricians espousing all types of silliness other than basic accountability. They Therapize everything... nothing can be your fault, something had to be the problem... therefore, etc.. etc. I have 6 years of psychology under my belt, 4 years of clinical, 1 years of industrial, and 1 years of deviant studies and a year and a half of residence in a marital counseling clinic - you couldn't be further from the truth. Today it is nothing but subjective partisanship just like scientism. That is why left the study... and medicine has no respect for it. Listen.. I totally understand how you could to the conclusion that psyrchology could somehow answer this, and am not trying to rip you on this... it is just I know from experience that it isn't.\n\n \n If you belive this, where do you get that being gay is just behaviour? You are wrong. Psychology doesn't tell people nothing can be their fault, that they shouldn't take responsibility for their own actions. Anyway, you are assuming being gay is a fault I suppose. Why is it a fault? This is just your own higlhy subjective opinion. If I can't look at psychology, what do you want me to look at? Take your word for it? Conservative or religious talking points? \n \n \nYou are living in rebellion, you chose to believe what supports how you feel... no one has done one thing to me. I don't' \"hate\" anyone... I despise the behavior, I am supposed to. But you haven't done anything to me, and vise versa.\n\n \n So what do you care?\n \n \nConstitutions [in general] do nothing more what they were designed to, I am serious, you might consider relocating to France, they have a constitution that is the exact opposite of what we have here... their Constitution based on rights granted by the state... here they are by God, their philosophy is rooted in classic humanism, here it the rich tradition of Judeo Christian principles, which have done nothing but good for those who practice them, and benefited those who haven't. A sexually deviant proclivity is lawlessness, and deserves to be punished by law, and lewd act laws are still on the books - for both hetero and homosexual behavior.\n\n \n This is really just a rant. Earlier you criticized subjectivity in the psychological community, but you seem to be the worst offender of complete subjectivity. \"Deviant proclivity\", you say? It doesn't get much more purely subjective than that.\n \n \nSex is not a protected right sanctioned by the constitution, however it is regulated through marriage, the ACLU lawyers vainly trying to argue this knwo the truth of it. You know this too... which worries me because this nothing but a rant by you.\n\n \n No, but this isn't about sex acts. No one scrutanizes the private sex acts of married partners. You continue to focus on such acts, the gay ones. Why are you so conserned? It's none of your business, if you are not gay, and don't wish to engage in it.\n \n \nYou're attempting to trivialize the truth of the statements by expressing your personal denial of consensus arguments is a tactic, but at the same time you have posted arguments in this very thread doing the same thing, the only problem is... your point of view is not universsaly known to br right. So, no buddy... you're wrong on this.\n\n \n I didn't say it was unanimous.\n \n \nThat is the problem with doing the wrong thing, people feel perfectly justifid in doing it... doesn't make it right, now does it?\n\n \n Who says it's the wrong thing? Not everyone, not even most according to polls.\n \n \nI dont' know what that was all about but I am sure it was you smelling your own fumes. Like I said before... you don't have a right to be gay, you are survived thy the grace of those who live and let live, force their hand and you mind a social climate for more unfacilitating you have been brainwashed [because you have]\n\n \n Uh....it's protected by the right to privacy in the U.S., not by your supposed \"grace\". \n \n \nYes there is, and you are wrong to deny that. Only a fool looks in the mirror and denies the image relfected back at him merely for the escapist illusion of what they would prefer to see\n\n \n Rhetorical, subjective, just as you accuse others of being earlier. Look in the mirror.\n \n \nThe ballot issue was not a poll on the matter, it was the correction of an unethical and egredious eror on the behalf of the High Court of California.\n\n \n Why was it an error? \n \n \nTry as you may to scan the globe for any ray of light to give you the slightes modicom of hope that what you engage in somehow \"ok\" is the problem with today's homosexual, you \"feel\" as though you have a perfect right to do what you do, and you don't... but it has been made permissible within certain areas, b ut that isn't good enough. You're right in this... the one's completely given over to the lusts of their hearts - and you want the high court to support that? surely you jest...\n\n \n Ha, ha. All you have to go on is your own extremely subjective morality. You can't impose that, because it interferes with other rights. You want to over-simplify this, and obsess over private sex acts. That's not the issue. \n \n \nYou need help, yes you could but you intentionally celebrate the fact that the \"majority\" was the state legislature... not the body politic. It was fiat legislation, not by the voters that is the problem. Yes, the state assembly and legislature are the most radically senseless group in the nation. They take taxpayer money with an unwarranted sense on entitlement and favor felling over facts everyday... of course you lobby that point... \"genius\" fact is... all this was just subterfuse, and sanctimonious sophistry. In this country.... not anywhere else, people are judge how they behave. There is and continues to be a lot of flexibility in that but there are boundaires and this radical set just doesn't get that.\n\n \n You're wrong. Again, your back on your own fixation with private sex acts. Not what this is about. And if that's why you think people voted the way they did on Prop. 8, then they were wrong, and it may be overturned by the court. The reason I brought up the legislature in California, is because it was government, just as the federal government was resposible for the DOMA issue you originally mentioned.",

It is not only their right, but their responsibility to vote their conscience, not yours, so for you punks to then think you are standing up and fighting for your rights just exemplifies how twisted your moral compass is. \n \n Because what you are doing is disrespecting the democratic process which billions of people on Earth wish they could rely on as we have, but which you spit upon because the vote didn't go your way. You are terrorists who are fighting to destroy our system of governing. Your actions are larger than the issue you're protesting against. It is standing against a legally binding process for how the california constitution is amended. And that is not only reprehensible and un-american, it is criminal.\n \n So call me a homophobe all you like. But this isn't even about your homosexuality; it's about your sleazy tactics of attacking americans because you don't like how they voted as free americans in a legal election.\n\n \n \nActually, Archie, what they're doing is completely American. Its called the first amendmant, and it protects free speech. Furthermore, they're allowed to have peaceful protests all they like. \n\n No shooter, you are wrong! Protesting city hall or marching on Washington would be examples of directing your demands to the Government in one unified voice, but what these scumbags are doing is targeting and harassing churches specifically because they assume the people who attend them voted a certain way in a legal election. That is political terrorism and personal intimidation on another group of citizens. So, it's a perversion of the 1st amendment which aligns with every other aspect of your twisted world view, which is why you either can't see, or refuse to see that you are corrupting our democratic process by attempting to intimidate americans who didn't vote the way you think they should vote as free americans. \n \n \nThe unamerican bigots who vote for unconstitutional and hateful amendments which have NO AFFECT AT ALL ON ANYONE BUT GAYS are truly unAmerican. These American folk who are fighting for their rights are doing the right thing.\n\n \n You keep making this fallacious claim shooter, so it's about time you prove this amendment is UNCONSTITUTIONAL or stop making the claim. Because I'm calling you a blatant liar to make such a claim, so prove me wrong if you can.\n \n \nThe only thing that Prop. 8 passing has shows in how morally twisted 51% of California is. I fear that we have a long way to go before becoming a truly progressive and advanced society.\n\n \n You've got that statistic wrong. It's the 38% of californians who voted against prop 8 who are morally twisted, because 62%, not 51% voted for it. So get your statistics right for once. And redefining marriage for 96% of the population to satisfy the demands of 4% so they can have an unnatural sexual relationship is anything but progressive. This proposition passed by \"almost\" 2 to 1 so it wasn't even close statistically.",

   "I hate to be the citer of glaring hypocrisy... but your claim here is moot, irrelevant and baseless. It doesn't matter how many people voted... as I pointed out in an earlier post, if Prop 8 had and much time to prepare as Prop 22 did... it would have lost by a similar margin as before in not more because of the arrogant dismissal of the voice of the people if favor of the typical tactic you loving and inclusive bigots and hypocrites on the left are. Not content with the process working as it showed as it has... you are filled with rage, rancor, angst. Truly a sign that the \"fairness\" you radicals project is only for your cause, but if the people truly speak up - well, that is just not acceptable. But if it the vote broke the other way in your favor... you'd singing a different song. Liars and hypocrites all of you radicals are.\n \n But... there is a larger issue that needs to be addressed, what were unions such as the Californian Teachers Union... and top school board officials doing donating funds and taking taxpayer money to advocate no on Prop 8... a clear embedded bias and clearly unethical. They had no business offering taking member contributions for an open abuse such as this... a total outrage. The donations from the Yes Vote came from sources that were a) non controversial and valid b) from authorized and ethical sources... \n \n \n Lastly, you can't some one a bigot for making the appropriate judgment for indecent behavior being equivocated as equally valid. You radicals co-opting of language to try to make your brainless arguments valid are more evidence of a depraved and deluded minded that cannot accept the reason, and justice... because justice not \"just us\" was served, and cannot be reversed - that is the beauty of it.The people spoke up, you just are filled with hate yourself and lash out at what you view as the only voice that made it possible to pass Prop 8, in fact... it was all voters.\n\n \n Wrong DR. It was a rigged election funded by tax free money. And influenced by the religious right. And was spun as a fear campaign. I am not a radical. I can march and voice my opinion on any matter thats my right. I dont hurt people or threaten. When I say fight, I mean that I won't give up fighting for the issue in a peaceful way. So for you and Archie to go to both extremes because me and thousands of other people not only across america but the world are deeply upset by this faulty campaign. \n \n And to sit here and spew your dribble because I'm standing up for what I believe in is sickening. I'm a veteran DR. And if given the chance I would gladly give my life for the sake of democracy. So dont you sit here and BS and say I'm against democracy because you have no idea what the hell you are talking about!",
