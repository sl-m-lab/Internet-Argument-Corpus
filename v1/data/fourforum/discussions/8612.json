No gay people can reproduce with each other.\n\n It's not a matter of \"twisting\" what you said as much as what you said lacks any real relevant importance to anything.\n Gay couples cannot procreate solely within the confines of their relationship. I don't think anybody will argue with that.\n It's just whether or not THAT IS ACTUALLY IMPORTANT which is the point.\n \n No straight couple where the participants are past 60 can reproduce with each other.

Likewise, I assumed you were just playing and not being serious.\n If you were serious about guessing that I had an African elephant in my hand, then I \"guess\" I have seriously over-estimated your capacity.

You really think that?\n I thought I already explained this to you, whereby you came back with a lot of irrelevant observations.\n The key words you use here are \"will not reproduce\", which means you are making a prediction about what WILL happen.\n And quite frankly, you haven't a clue. What \"WILL\" happen is that gays will reproduce, with gay men impregnating gay women, and babies will be had. Gays DO reproduce currently via a variety of methodology, and there is nothing stopping us from reproducing via heterosexual sex. There is no reason why we would not reproduce via heterosexual sex if we were all marooned on an island.\n \n I'm sure you place a lot of importance on us having heterosexual sex, but quite frankly you place a lot of importance where it just doesn't belong.\n Like a white man being proud that he's not black.\n \n \n \nBecause gay is obviously a religion.\n\n Yeah.

In each episode, the bachelor will interact with the other men on group and one-on-one dates and gradually eliminate those he isn't interested in until one winner remains. While the actual sexual orientation of at least one contestant will be disclosed at the outset to viewers -- but not the bachelor -- the identity of some of the others will not be revealed until the bachelor himself finds out. The exact number of heterosexual suitors was not divulged by Bravo, nor was the sum the network paid. \n http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/bravo-air-boy-meets-boy-gay-bachelor-like-reality-series-1230.php",

   "What this post fails to reflect is that the Island of Heterosexuals would continue to produce more gays just like gays are produced now. SO what is your point. \n \n The Island of Heterosexuals would also produce more transexuals, more intersexed people (people who genectically have both male and female sexual organs).\n \n Would those gays then move to the gay island?\n\n \n \n What I've noticed is that the original post actually, and suspiciously, ignored lesbians. Would lesbians be included on the gay Island? Seeing as they are definitely NOT STRAIGHT, they wouldn't fit in on the \"straight\" island.\n \n I would have to say that with 50 gay males and 50 lesbian women all on one island and 50 straight males with 50 straight women would probably have the same reproduction rates as the other. \n \n What the original poster conveniently forgot is the same need to survive exists in ALL HUMANS regardless of sexual orientation. Therefore both islands would do just as well/or just as poorly as the other.",

As for a \"reality\" show, it had a slight advantage for me in that you could try and figure out who was gay and who was faking. At least that was interesting.\n \n There was another reality show about people trying to \"win\" a house in a neighborhood by winning a \"voting\" contest with the neighbors. And one of the contestant couples was gay...\n \n The resident neighborhood (self-appointed) leader was morally outraged and vowed they wouldn't get the house. The broadcasting company pulled the show after heavy complaints from BOTH sides.\n \n There was a special I saw later on about it. It turns out the gay couple WON as they won the hearts of everybody including the \"moral\" leader who didn't want gays on his block. Extreme irony also in the fact that this guy who didn't want gays on his block had a gay in his house-hold.\n \n His son was gay.\n \n I would never have watched the actual show, but the documentary done afterwards talking about it was great.",

   "I was just pointing it out in the hopes that you would recognize that you don't really know what you're talking about. No one who actually understood the concept would make the mistake you did. I explain how you were wrong more below.\n\n \n Well you failed. If I said \"Thou should not kill\", that doesn't mean I understand the idea of not killing any less than someone who says \"Thou shalt no kill\". trying to make me look bad because of a grammer technicallity is retarted.\n \n \nOk, since the concept of analogy obviously gives you so much trouble, lets put 200 straight men on your island. Ooops, they didn't make it either. By your logic straight men are no more fit than gay men. 200 straight women? Just as bad. Obviously any population that consists entirely of one gender won't make it. What does this prove? Nothing. Gays are humans. You can't take one small bit of humanity and judge it's fitness by whether or not it can survive on it's own. Take a bunch of physically weak geniuses; they wouldn't make it. Strong XXXXXX? Also doomed. The strength of humanity is in our diversity. Individually none of us could survive on our own. It's because we're all different, with different strengths and weaknesses, that we've done so well as a species. We're social animals, evolved to live in societies, not in little clusters. So your idea of extracting one small specific segment and seeing if it will do well on it's own is ludicrous. It shows nothing.\n\n \n Well then, since you are argueing based on the idea that everyone helps everyone else, then what do gays do that is helpful by being gay? Other than having abnoxiously colorful clothes and the guys wearing way too much make up while the girls where close to none at all. Straight people have children. BTW, hopefully the rest of the world has as much sense as I do. Obviously North Dakota does, as well as 10 other states. I also find it funny that the only way gays can get anything done is through the highest courts. If we had a nationwide vote, a lot more people would vote no then yes and gays would still not be allowed to marry. I guarantee you that if we put 50 gay guys and 50 gay girls on one island and 50 straight guys and 50 straight girls on another then the straight island will do way better. Being straight is way more beneficial to society then being gay. \n \n \nI wouldn't say that infront of a lesbian. The ones I know can kick some breeder butt and are stronger then many men I know.\n\n \n No woman culd kick my butt anyway, I'm 6' 7\" and built like a brick, so I'll say it in front of anyone I like. Besides, that is why I said in general. There are exceptionally manly women out there. In general though, men are stronger. Of course you just read what you want to hear that way you can twist it.\n \n \nJust like \"being gay\" is a source for a hypothetical argument on marooning people on an island.\n\n \n It is.\n \n \nIt's not a matter of \"twisting\" what you said as much as what you said lacks any real relevant importance to anything.\n Gay couples cannot procreate solely within the confines of their relationship. I don't think anybody will argue with that.\n It's just whether or not THAT IS ACTUALLY IMPORTANT which is the point.\n\n \n Exactly \"Gay couples cannot procreate solely within the confines of their relationship\". Their relationship doesn't do a dang thing for society. Being a surgeon, though it might be tougher to live alone than being a carpenter, does do beneficial things for society. That is why I make a distinction between career and gay.\n \n \nYeah right.\n And YOUR current debating trick that you are employing is referred to as \"ad hominem\".\n\n \n Ooohh. I bet you feel all high-and-mighty now. You can name a type of arguement. Something common among gays, they tend to take extra effort to learn specific terms so they seem smarter. But I am not \"appealing to feelings or prejudices rather than intellect\", I am pointing out something that I have noticed is very common among gays. Kind of like if I said more black people have spinners on their cars then white people. Most gay people I have met don't have much common sense, are quick to say \"you're prejudice\" over any issue, prejudice or not, and are highly abnoxious.\n \n \n\"Twisting words\" is pretending that I was saying gays were not human when I clearly said nothing of the sort...\n\n \n Once again you are twisting words. I obviously didn't think that is what you meant, common sense could have told you that, but I was pointing out how your arguement was flawed. It was my way of saying fix your arguement or don't use it, because it is a bad one.\n \n \nThe point is that you have none. No group is perfect. Everybody has issues which they depend upon others for.\n\n \n Nobody depends on gays because they are gay, that is the difference between gay and a career. People depend on doctors to help heal them. What would someone depend on a gay for?\n \n \nThe fact that you don't see this boggles the mind...\n The surgeon would \"have a chance\" by going OUTSIDE their occupation of being a surgeon and doing things that surgeons DO NOT TYPICALLY do.\n The gays would \"have a chance\" by going OUTSIDE their sexual orientation and doing things (like having heterosexual sex) that gays do not typically do.\n\n \n But going outside your sexual orientation is quite different than getting a new job. Theirs a difference between the words occupation and orientation. So goind outside of it would be quite different. \n \n And Ooman, no offense, but shut up. You condemn me for bringing up an idea you don't like and then joined in when everybody else brought up stupid show ideas. BTW, steriotypes tend to be true. Not always, but often. That particular one is true. Men do tend to be stronger than women.\n \n Jitobear, ye of little faith, you know nothing of me. I have spent time counseling a to a total of 56 gay people. 7 of them aren't even gay anymore. I don't do it as a job nor do I have a degree in psychology, but I still have talked with enough gays to back up my generalizations. And gays have nothing to contribute by being gay. You people fail to realize this. A doctor contributes by being a doctor. Straight people create children and therefore do have something to contribute. Gay people would have to go outside of doing what they normally do in order to create a child. Obviously nobody on this forums knows the difference between a career and a sexual preference. You people keep saying gays contribute to society in a way similar to people with different careers, but they don't.\n \n Jim's trucking, go away. Posting just to insult and call my thread pointless and silly without having any input is annoying and a waste of time.\n \n If anyone doesn't think this thread has any relevence, then stop posting and I'll assume I'm right, or successfully prove me wrong. You have done neither.\n \n \nWhat this post fails to reflect is that the Island of Heterosexuals would continue to produce more gays just like gays are produced now. SO what is your point.\n\n \n It would only produce more gays if the society was morally corrupt. No one has shown me the gay gene. It doesn't exist. Gay is a mental disorder, just like pedfilia and bestiality. If it wasn't, then those gays I helped convert would still be gay. They are still annoyingly feminine, but no longer gay. Many times guys will be very feminine and turn gay because they think they are born that way. I help them realize they are just pansies who are very girly.",

There are muscle cars in the garage and tools in the basement tho.\n \n \nStraight people have children. \n\n \n So do gay people.\n \n \nBTW, hopefully the rest of the world has as much sense as I do. \n\n \n I am hopeful that they have more.\n \n \nI guarantee you that if we put 50 gay guys and 50 gay girls on one island and 50 straight guys and 50 straight girls on another then the straight island will do way better. \n\n \n I will take that bet.\n \n \nBeing straight is way more beneficial to society then being gay. \n\n \n How?\n \n \nNo woman culd kick my butt anyway, I'm 6' 7\" and built like a brick, so I'll say it in front of anyone I like. Besides, that is why I said in general. There are exceptionally manly women out there. In general though, men are stronger. Of course you just read what you want to hear that way you can twist it.\n\n \n It was a JOKE. Matthew has already shown how he is more fabulous than you - cause funny beats growly any day.\n \n \nSomething common among gays, they tend to take extra effort to learn specific terms so they seem smarter. \n\n \n You just made that up, didn't you?\n \n \nBut I am not \"appealing to feelings or prejudices rather than intellect\", I am pointing out something that I have noticed is very common among gays. Kind of like if I said more black people have spinners on their cars then white people. \n\n \n MLK is turning in his grave.\n \n \nMost gay people I have met don't have much common sense, are quick to say \"you're prejudice\" over any issue, prejudice or not, and are highly abnoxious.\n\n \n There is no way they can be less sensible or more obnoxious than you.\n \n \nNobody depends on gays because they are gay, that is the difference between gay and a career. People depend on doctors to help heal them. What would someone depend on a gay for? \n\n \n What if the doctor was gay? \n \n \nJitobear, ye of little faith, you know nothing of me. \n\n \n Oh - I think you have been quite revealing. \n \n \nI have spent time counseling a to a total of 56 gay people. 7 of them aren't even gay anymore. I don't do it as a job nor do I have a degree in psychology, but I still have talked with enough gays to back up my generalizations. \n\n \n 56 gay people! WOW. Lord knows there are only about 75 - so that is a good sample. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nAnd gays have nothing to contribute by being gay. You people fail to realize this. \n\n \n And straights have nothing to contribute by being straight.\n \n \nA doctor contributes by being a doctor. \n\n \n And gay people can be doctors.\n \n \nStraight people create children and therefore do have something to contribute. Gay people would have to go outside of doing what they normally do in order to create a child.\n \n \n Gays also create children - whats it to you how? Nosy Parker.\n \n \nJim's trucking, go away. Posting just to insult and call my thread pointless and silly without having any input is annoying and a waste of time.\n\n \n Leave Jim alone or I will hire someone who is 6'8 and built like a bigger brick than you to kick your butt.\n \n \nIf anyone doesn't think this thread has any relevence, then stop posting and I'll assume I'm right, or successfully prove me wrong. You have done neither.\n\n \n Public forum - we can post as we like. And if you feel compelled to be as insulting as you have been - you are gonna get it and deserve it, sunshine.\n \n \nGay is a mental disorder, just like pedfilia and bestiality. \n\n \n Listen Counselor, you may want to check in with what EVERY SINGLE REPUTABLE medical and phsychological organization has to say about that matter before you take on another client. Those folks actually hold degrees and may know a couple of things you do not.\n \n \nI help them realize they are just pansies who are very girly.\n\n \n As a woman and having been a girl I take issue with the idea that the feminine is somehow lacking strength. It certainly takes more courage to be who you are than be someone who insults entire groups of people for being different than he.",

   "Please show us the evidence you have turned people straight. THis is a huge claim. Back it up\n \n\n \n You people always insist on saying prove it to everything. How could I prove it? By getting them to join and say it's true? Then you'll just attack the credibility of whether it is truely them or not and probably accuse me of making a second account, which I already read ahead and found that I'm being accused of.\n \n \n\n I don't even know where to start with you Cool Spot, but I will try. First of all, I want to mention that you are obviously quite inept beyond just this subject matter. You don't even get the irony of saying \"retarted\" even when someone points it out to you. I know this because you said it again. Sadly, I also know this means you probably won't get it this time either.\n \n Besides, no mature person calls anything \"retarted.\" That's just gay.\n \n\n \n You call me inept, and you are entitled to your opinion, however wrong it may be. And as far as retarted goes, I use that word a lot. It's my way of saying I disagree and think your arguement was dumb. I use it out of habit, so after somebody pointed out the irony of it all, I soon forgot about it. I'll try to remember not to use the word due to the irony of it if it will make you feel better, not that it really matters though.\n \n \n\n Oh lord. You did not really just say that did you? Are you trying to appear to have no intelligence? You claim you have been around many gay people, but you make it painfully obvious that this is not the case.\n \n\n \n The comment about the clothes was said as more of a joke. I don't seem to have a similar sense of humor as you do, but the point still stands. By being straight you have sexual relations with people of the opposite gender and create children. By being gay, there is nothing that gets done that is beneficial by being gay. Of course I should probably rephrase it as having hetero sex and having gay sex since having a preference doesn't accomplish anything, it is all about the actions. But straight people are more likely to participate in that whole creation of children action, so they are more beneficial.\n \n \n\n Why would straight people have any better shot at surviving? Are straight people better at making fire?\n Maybe in a nationwide vote about gay marriage people would vote that way. Maybe they wouldn't. But that really has no bearing on anything we are talking about.\n \n\n \n I think straight guys are better at physical things then most gay guys, and it's true. And since guys are the more physically dominant gender, they are the ones who would be building most things and doing most hunting. Since I don't care enough to start a survey to prove my opinion, I'll just let it go and say we disagree. \n \n \n \n\n I am so impressed Cool Spot. I think I just turned gay at the thought of a big brick of a man. Uh oh, now you'll have to fix me.\n You obviously have no sense of humor whatsoever. If you did you would have realized Ooaman's post was pretty funny.\n \n\n \n Funny is an opinionated statement. I wasn't laughing. Call me dull then, it doesn't bother me.\n \n \n\n What you have failed to address is that there are straight couples who either can't (either because of age or fertility issues or what have you) or choose not to have children. By your reasoning, these people's relationships are useless to society as well. Any infertile couple or couple who is past the point of reproductive capability should automatically receive an anullment from the state. Sounds good to me.\n \n\n \n You people bring this arguement up all the time as if it has any relevance. IF a straight couple had already had kids then they would have already contributed to society. FYI, I think birth control should be done away with. A sterile couple who could never have kids is like a retarted person. They are an exception and should be tolerated by society. Since I don't think gay is anything other than a psychological choice, I don't think we should tolerate it. That is where me and everyone else here disagrees though.\n \n \n\n I love that you criticize someone for actually having a brain and knowing what a legitimate argument is and then you proceed to look up ad hominem on the internet because you don't know what he is talking about. You can't buy this kind of entertainment. \n \n\n \n SO what if I looked it up? All I had was a vague idea of the meaning so I looked it up to be sure. Which is better than me assuming it meant something and hoping I was right. The average person wouldn't have a clue what ad hominem means. So it is likely that he studies this stuff often. You are obviously trying to make me look dumb by inferring that I have no brain and had to look up an uncommonly known word. That seems to be a close description of \"ad hominem\". Appealling to feeling by trying to make peopel see me as dumb.\n \n \n \n\n Again you show us your complete ignorance, prejudice, and the fact that you actually haven't spent all that much time around gay people.\n \n\n \n What do you base this idea off of? I could just as easily say the same about you. If a poll was taken it could be statistically proven that black people have spinners more often then white people. THat isn't prejudice, it's simply a matter of fact. At least give a reason for such a statement.\n \n \n\n \"A gay\"? Wow, you really can't buy this kind of entertainment. I can't quite tell if you are constantly missing the point, or ignoring it. In any case, what would anyone depend on \"a straight\" for either? I don't depend on anyone because of their straightness.\n \n\n \n Nobody depends on a straight person for being straight directly, but once again since straight people do the majority of creating children, they are more beneficial.\n \n \n\n Yes the words are different. Hence another word.....\"analogy.\"\n \n\n \n THey are not similar in enough of a way to make such an inferrence as you have. \n \n \n\n Cool Spot, no offense, but get a sense of humor.\n \n\n \n Where should I look?\n \n \n\n This just keeps getting better and better. I see. You're one of those \"counselors\" who makes gay people straight. Does that pay well? Maybe I should get saved. Do you get dental? I'd totally get saved for dental.\n \n\n \n You obviously doubt me.\n \n \n\n Yet again, no sense of humor and no civility either.\n \n\n \n What is so uncivil? I think making a post without any useful input is more uncivil. Is uncivil even a word? You get the idea though.\n \n \n\n Being a gay is a mental disorder like pedfilia eh? What's pefilia? I've never heard of it.\n Pansies. Oh goodness. It just gets better and better with you doesn't it.\n So, men become gay because they are feminine and think to themselves \"well, I'm kinda feminine, I think I'll start ing men?\" I guess there aren't any masculine gay men out there then. I mean, you would know. You've spent so much time with them and all. Does it work the same way for lesbians too? A woman starts using power tools and thinks \"gosh, I have carpenter pants, better get myself a girlfriend and start going to Mellissa Ethridge shows.\"\n \n\n \n Ever heard of a typo? And I don't say things in such a blunt, rude manor when dealing with people in person. There's nothing wrong with being feminine or wimpy, that is what I show them. They should accept themselves. And They don't just start thinking that since they are girly they'll be gay. THey are made fun of and told they are gay until eventually the believe it and then get an attitude like 'so what if I'm gay?' But once they realize they aren't gay it changes to 'so what if I'm girly or feminine?' \n \n \n\n This whole thread and topic come about because cool spot does not believe that gay people should exist. He as a heterosexual has deemed that we gay people are somehow defective. This attitude dehumanizes gay people and if taken to extreme leads to genocide. He has decided that his way of life is the correct way to live. Once again this attitude leds to oppression and taken to extreme genocide. Can you say heterosexual privledge.\n \n What you do not undertand it is called acting. They are still gay but they have learned to act as if they are heterosexual.\n \n\n \n \n Don't try and put words in my mouth. I never said gay people should be extinguished. Homosexuality should be extinguished. The people aren't the problem. It's the faulty mindset that is the problem. \n \n \n\n \nPlease show us the evidence you have turned people straight. THis is a huge claim. Back it up\n \n\n \n You people always insist on saying prove it to everything. How could I prove it? By getting them to join and say it's true?

Are straight people better at making fire?\n Maybe in a nationwide vote about gay marriage people would vote that way. Maybe they wouldn't. But that really has no bearing on anything we are talking about.\n \n\n \n I think straight guys are better at physical things then most gay guys, and it's true. And since guys are the more physically dominant gender, they are the ones who would be building most things and doing most hunting. Since I don't care enough to start a survey to prove my opinion, I'll just let it go and say we disagree. \n \n \n \n\n I am so impressed Cool Spot. I think I just turned gay at the thought of a big brick of a man. Uh oh, now you'll have to fix me.\n You obviously have no sense of humor whatsoever. If you did you would have realized Ooaman's post was pretty funny.\n \n\n \n Funny is an opinionated statement. I wasn't laughing. Call me dull then, it doesn't bother me.\n \n \n\n What you have failed to address is that there are straight couples who either can't (either because of age or fertility issues or what have you) or choose not to have children. By your reasoning, these people's relationships are useless to society as well. Any infertile couple or couple who is past the point of reproductive capability should automatically receive an anullment from the state. Sounds good to me.\n \n\n \n You people bring this arguement up all the time as if it has any relevance. IF a straight couple had already had kids then they would have already contributed to society. FYI, I think birth control should be done away with. A sterile couple who could never have kids is like a retarted person. They are an exception and should be tolerated by society. Since I don't think gay is anything other than a psychological choice, I don't think we should tolerate it. That is where me and everyone else here disagrees though.\n \n \n\n I love that you criticize someone for actually having a brain and knowing what a legitimate argument is and then you proceed to look up ad hominem on the internet because you don't know what he is talking about. You can't buy this kind of entertainment. \n \n\n \n SO what if I looked it up? All I had was a vague idea of the meaning so I looked it up to be sure. Which is better than me assuming it meant something and hoping I was right. The average person wouldn't have a clue what ad hominem means. So it is likely that he studies this stuff often. You are obviously trying to make me look dumb by inferring that I have no brain and had to look up an uncommonly known word. That seems to be a close description of \"ad hominem\". Appealling to feeling by trying to make peopel see me as dumb.\n \n \n \n\n Again you show us your complete ignorance, prejudice, and the fact that you actually haven't spent all that much time around gay people.\n \n\n \n What do you base this idea off of? I could just as easily say the same about you. If a poll was taken it could be statistically proven that black people have spinners more often then white people. THat isn't prejudice, it's simply a matter of fact. At least give a reason for such a statement.\n \n \n\n \"A gay\"? Wow, you really can't buy this kind of entertainment. I can't quite tell if you are constantly missing the point, or ignoring it. In any case, what would anyone depend on \"a straight\" for either? I don't depend on anyone because of their straightness.\n \n\n \n Nobody depends on a straight person for being straight directly, but once again since straight people do the majority of creating children, they are more beneficial.\n \n \n\n Yes the words are different. Hence another word.....\"analogy.\"\n \n\n \n THey are not similar in enough of a way to make such an inferrence as you have. \n \n \n\n Cool Spot, no offense, but get a sense of humor.\n \n\n \n Where should I look?\n \n \n\n This just keeps getting better and better. I see. You're one of those \"counselors\" who makes gay people straight. Does that pay well? Maybe I should get saved. Do you get dental? I'd totally get saved for dental.\n \n\n \n You obviously doubt me.\n \n \n\n Yet again, no sense of humor and no civility either.\n \n\n \n What is so uncivil? I think making a post without any useful input is more uncivil. Is uncivil even a word? You get the idea though.\n \n \n\n Being a gay is a mental disorder like pedfilia eh? What's pefilia? I've never heard of it.\n Pansies. Oh goodness. It just gets better and better with you doesn't it.\n So, men become gay because they are feminine and think to themselves \"well, I'm kinda feminine, I think I'll start ing men?\" I guess there aren't any masculine gay men out there then. I mean, you would know. You've spent so much time with them and all. Does it work the same way for lesbians too? A woman starts using power tools and thinks \"gosh, I have carpenter pants, better get myself a girlfriend and start going to Mellissa Ethridge shows.\"\n \n\n \n Ever heard of a typo? And I don't say things in such a blunt, rude manor when dealing with people in person. There's nothing wrong with being feminine or wimpy, that is what I show them. They should accept themselves. And They don't just start thinking that since they are girly they'll be gay. THey are made fun of and told they are gay until eventually the believe it and then get an attitude like 'so what if I'm gay?' But once they realize they aren't gay it changes to 'so what if I'm girly or feminine?' \n \n \n\n This whole thread and topic come about because cool spot does not believe that gay people should exist. He as a heterosexual has deemed that we gay people are somehow defective. This attitude dehumanizes gay people and if taken to extreme leads to genocide. He has decided that his way of life is the correct way to live. Once again this attitude leds to oppression and taken to extreme genocide. Can you say heterosexual privledge.\n \n What you do not undertand it is called acting. They are still gay but they have learned to act as if they are heterosexual.\n \n\n \n \n Don't try and put words in my mouth. I never said gay people should be extinguished. Homosexuality should be extinguished. The people aren't the problem. It's the faulty mindset that is the problem. And since you people are so obsessed with cold hard facts. Prove they are acting.\n \n [/QUOTE=thelmoose]\n This is a counselor?\n \n Did they teach you to be this non-judgmental in counselor school? No wait, you don't \"do it as a job\" or have one of them fancy book-larnin' degrees like those sissy college boys. You just take those \"annoyingly feminine\" homos and turn 'em into good Christjun straights. If you could only do something for the femmy part, you might be able to charge for this. I can only imagine the lives of the women who get together with those 7 that you \"turned\". I also bet the remainder are quite relieved they aren't homos, but merely pansies who are girly, not at all the manly man that you are. You really are a saint to help those poor men.\n \n I think you scream closet case to me.\n \n\n \n I already explained why I was so mean about it. I don't judge the person. I judge the actions which sometimes makes me irritated with the person. I always find it incredibly pathetic when people scream closet-case. So because I'm anti-gay you think I'm really gay myself? That makes no sense whatsoever. \n \n \n\n I am currently house-sitting for my son's dad and his partner and the only makeup in the house is MINE. There are muscle cars in the garage and tools in the basement tho.\n \n\n \n I've already explained that the makeup comment was said jokingly. THough gay guy wear makeup as part of their everyday life more then straight guys.\n \n \n\n So do gay people.\n \n\n \n Not with each other, and very rarely do they create kids with someone else other then their partner. They usually adopt.\n \n \n\n I am hopeful that they have more.\n \n\n \n Then you expect too much out of people like yourself.\n \n \n\n I will take that bet.\n \n\n \n If only there was a way to do it.\n \n \n\n How?\n \n\n \n I've already explained it.\n \n \n\n You just made that up, didn't you?\n \n\n \n NO. Gays as a whole don't do such a thing, but gays who argue often do. It could just be that they learn it through the process of argueing which is probably the actual case. I take back my former statement.\n \n \n\n MLK is turning in his grave.\n \n\n \n On his newly bought spinners.\n \n \n\n There is no way they can be less sensible or more obnoxious than you.\n \n\n \n Yeah, they can. It happens a lot. I am really a lot less obnoxious than this in real life, but I don't expect that you people will come to seeing things my way anyway so I don't sugarcoat anything on forums.\n \n \n\n What if the doctor was gay? \n \n\n \n Then they would depend on him for being a doctor.\n \n \n\n Oh - I think you have been quite revealing. \n \n\n \n As have you.\n \n \n\n 56 gay people! WOW. Lord knows there are only about 75 - so that is a good sample. \n \n\n \n Ha ha ha...\n \n \n\n And straights have nothing to contribute by being straight.\n \n\n \n I already explained this.\n \n \n\n And gay people can be doctors.\n \n\n \n Which would have nothing to do with his sexuality\n \n \n\n Gays also create children - whats it to you how? Nosy Parker.\n \n\n \n THey only do such be having sex with someone other then their partner. They don't create children with each other.\n \n \n\n Leave Jim alone or I will hire someone who is 6'8 and built like a bigger brick than you to kick your butt.\n \n \n Hire a Muay Thai master. I've always wanted to fight one.\n \n \n\n Public forum - we can post as we like. And if you feel compelled to be as insulting as you have been - you are gonna get it and deserve it, sunshine.\n \n\n \n It's only insulting because it's true.\n \n \n \n\n Listen Counselor, you may want to check in with what EVERY SINGLE REPUTABLE medical and phsychological organization has to say about that matter before you take on another client. Those folks actually hold degrees and may know a couple of things you do not.\n \n\n \n And I suppose that every one that disagrees with you is \"unreputable\". I've talked with quite a few and they tend to be extremely one way or the other. Obviously the famous ones are pro gay. THat is probably why they are famous. I recently read the best phrase ever. A foolish opinion held by thousands is still a foolish opinion.\n \n \n\n As a woman and having been a girl I take issue with the idea that the feminine is somehow lacking strength. It certainly takes more courage to be who you are than be someone who insults entire groups of people for being different than he.\n \n\n \n Courage and strength are two different things.\n \n \n\n Gays many times serve as the primary caregivers for their parents in their golden years. I think this is very important.\n \n\n \n That is about personal choice. I'll be taking care of my parent when the can't do it anymore. Besides, I see no proof for your statement.\n [/QUOTE]\n \n [QUOTE=jitobear]\n Because the originator of this post would have us believe that gays offer NOTHING. This is another example of that being refuted. Man you put on the kid gloves for those who choose to bash gays - and the boxing gloves when anyone protests their doing it.\n \n Don't tell me you think the original post has any kind of merit. If so, any amount of respect I may have had for you is toast.\n [/QUOTE\n \n Caring for parents has nothing to do with sexuality. \n \n \n\n \n This is a silly argument because if the ecosystem is unable to support one person, much less for 50 people, they will all die.\n \n No food, no fresh water, no life.\n \n\n \n Well if there are animals there are food. Australia started as a group of abandoned convicts and look at them now. Besides, nobody said they wouldn't have a fresh lake/river/etc. Who said there would be no life?\n \n \n\n Where are you critical thinking skills. If this was James dobson I could see you making agreement, but it is some guy who thinks he is a counselor and makes gays straight and yet he has proven he knows little about gays at all. \n \n\n \n You all have proven that you as well as many others on this forum think just like the steriotypical gay. You people call me obnoxious and then turn around and tell me things like \"go back to the Jerry Springer show where you belong.\" That is typical. Insult the insulter. You aren't any mature then I am. There are just many of you to support each other on this forum and act like I'm an idiot. It's called bullying. But it doesn't bother me. It show your true character.\n \n \n\n I can't say I'm surprised that Coolspot hasn't returned\n \n\n \n I've been busy. I get online in my free time. I have a life outside of the internet. This is one of the least important things I do.\n \n \n\n Has anyone noticed that as of yet, he's only made 4 post and they were all on this thread?\n \n By the way, did he ever mention his age or anything? Because I question it.\n \n\n \n I've already explained why I have few posts. And I don't see the point in joining multiple threads. I take it one at a time. Why do you question my age anyway? Just for clarification since you want to know, I'm not a young one, but I'm not elderly either. I try not to give out my specifics online.\n \n \n\n IMHO... and I could be wrong, but I throw it out there anyway... I believe some posters are on-the-cuff creations of other long-term posters to this forum who don't want to be tripped up by their already-established reputations as anti-gay and so instead create one-off \"stealth personas\" who come in, make their dubious point, and disappear again after being thoroughly bested. (Check out \"jackowens\" as well, on another thread. Same pattern.)\n \n\n \n That does happen from time to time no doubt. I won't bother trying to defend myself though, seeing as I really can't think of any way to prove my legitimacy.\n \n \n\n No one in particular. I've noticed, though, that there seems to have been a flurry of One-Thread Johnnies lately on another forum I frequent. Some people seem to have a lot of time on their hands this summer. \n \n Here's a tip: look for uncommon but persistent misspellings of the same word by two or more posters. If they match philosophically as well, dollars to donuts it's the same person.\n \n\n \n DO you really have enough time or care that much to look for spelling errors? Even if somebody was making new accounts, I wouldn't care enough to try and point it out. I'd just argue my point as I would have were they a new person.\n \n \n\n Ah yes, Bob Maddox......he was a counselor to! He told me I was no longer gay simply because my partner and I (26 years) haven't been having sex for years because of my partners 'circulatory problems.' Believe me, in my mind I'm still 100% gay.\n \n This cool spot guy is just yankin' us. Saying he is a counselor and cured gays while telling them they are worthless to society...oh yeah, that'll cure ya! Saying gay guys call him a bigot when all he does is say loving stuff about gays.....gays are so darn mean!!!\n \n Yep, it sounds like another creation of Chris Johnson of Union U in Tennessee.\n \n\n \n Once again, I don't think the people aren't worthless. The homosexuality is, and I don't think it is part of who they are. And who is this Chris Johnson? I'm a little curious.",

I'll try to remember not to use the word due to the irony of it if it will make you feel better, not that it really matters though.\n\n One thing that may help your cause (just maybe that is) is to call them retarded instead of retarted. Retarted read out loud reminds me of a trick played on me where I wound up reading something that said \"I am Sofa King Retarded.\"\n \n \n \nThe comment about the clothes was said as more of a joke. I don't seem to have a similar sense of humor as you do, but the point still stands. By being straight you have sexual relations with people of the opposite gender and create children.

I know ad hominem means - does that have something to do with the fact that I straight? 5'4''? or red headed?\n \n \nSo it is likely that he studies this stuff often. \n\n \n You mean, like, he studies, educates himself, gets informed opinions, checks his facts - stuff like that? What a gay bastard. How dare he! \n \n \nYou are obviously trying to make me look dumb by inferring that I have no brain and had to look up an uncommonly known word. That seems to be a close description of \"ad hominem\". Appealling to feeling by trying to make peopel see me as dumb.\n\n \n Nobody really has to try to hard to make you look dumb. Actually we really don't have to do anything at all.\n \n \nNobody depends on a straight person for being straight directly, but once again since straight people do the majority of creating children, they are more beneficial.\n\n \n Please explain how it benefits me if you ever reproduce. Wait - I take it back - please don't reproduce.\n \n \nYou obviously doubt me.\n\n \n Oh, I more than doubt you. I think you are straight up lieing. I don't think you know ANY gay people.\n \n \nEver heard of a typo? And I don't say things in such a blunt, rude manor when dealing with people in person. There's nothing wrong with being feminine or wimpy, that is what I show them. They should accept themselves. And They don't just start thinking that since they are girly they'll be gay. THey are made fun of and told they are gay until eventually the believe it and then get an attitude like 'so what if I'm gay?' But once they realize they aren't gay it changes to 'so what if I'm girly or feminine?' \n\n \n But what about the gay guys who aren't girly and were NEVER told they were gay. My kids dad was his high school's hunk. Dated and slept with plenty of women.\n \n \nDon't try and put words in my mouth. I never said gay people should be extinguished. Homosexuality should be extinguished. The people aren't the problem. It's the faulty mindset that is the problem. \n\n \n There certainly is a faulty mindset problem here.\n \n \nI already explained why I was so mean about it. I don't judge the person. I judge the actions which sometimes makes me irritated with the person. I always find it incredibly pathetic when people scream closet-case. So because I'm anti-gay you think I'm really gay myself? That makes no sense whatsoever. \n\n \n I don't think you are gay - just bigoted and mis-informed.\n \n \nI've already explained that the makeup comment was said jokingly. THough gay guy wear makeup as part of their everyday life more then straight guys.\n\n \n Bah - you need to hang with rockers more. \n \n \nNot with each other, and very rarely do they create kids with someone else other then their partner. They usually adopt.\n\n \n My friend's partner has BIOLOGICAL grandchildren. \n \n \nThen you expect too much out of people like yourself.\n\n \n You really think holding society to standard higher than ignorance and prejudice is too much to ask?\n \n \nOn his newly bought spinners.\n\n \n You really are a bigot. And you don't even get it. It's kind of cute how you think you aren't being an insulting jack XXX. \n \n \nYeah, they can. It happens a lot. I am really a lot less obnoxious than this in real life, but I don't expect that you people will come to seeing things my way anyway so I don't sugarcoat anything on forums.\n\n \n I promise never to see things your way. I have close to 40 years of life knowing all kinds of folks - many of whom were gay - my life experience has taught me that you are spewing garbage. I am just poking you for FUN.\n \n \nHire a Muay Thai master. I've always wanted to fight one.\n\n \n Maybe I will get my kids gay dad to do it. \n \n \nIt's only insulting because it's true.\n\n \n No - it's insulting because your comments are vile, cowardly, incorrect stereotypes.\n \n \nAnd I suppose that every one that disagrees with you is \"unreputable\". \n\n \n Not at all. But a big lug who can't spell holds a lot less credibility on this particular subject matter than trained professionals. If you think I am wrong here - go see your auto mechanic the next time you need brain surgery - I bet you would get a better rate.\n \n \nI've talked with quite a few and they tend to be extremely one way or the other. Obviously the famous ones are pro gay. THat is probably why they are famous. \n\n \n I am not talking about individuals. I am talking about THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION'S, THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION'S,THE AMERICAN PEDIATRIC ASSOCIATION'S, AND THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION'S OFFICIAL STANCES ON HOMOSEXUALITY. They ALL say you and you non degree holding XXX and whatever buddies you get to agree with you are WRONG. And yes - they have a LOT more credibility than you.\n \n \nI recently read the best phrase ever. A foolish opinion held by thousands is still a foolish opinion.\n\n \n And a foolish opinion held by you - is just that. \n \n \nCourage and strength are two different things.\n\n \n Indeed they are.",

   "You people ...blah, blah blah...\n\n \n \n \n WOW out of the 1,574 words in your MASS-response you managed to say a whole lot of NOTHING! \n \n Let's clear something up here once and for all, because I'm just a little sick and tired of hearing it from XXXXXX who don't know their basic biology lessons from freshman year in high school. \n \n ALL TOO OFTEN FORGOTTEN FACT: HOMOSEXUAL INDIVIDUALS ARE JUST AS PHYSIOLOGICALLY ABLE TO PRODUCE CHILDREN AS HETEROSEXUAL INDIVIDUALS! \n \n GOT IT? \n \n Good.\n \n Secondly, as a lesbian, I can assure you that my seventeen year old son is the necessary 50% biologically mine! \n \n Let's move on...\n \n ALL TOO OFTEN FORGOTTEN FACT: JUST BECAUSE A HOMOSEXUAL HAS SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH SOMEONE OF THE OPPOSITE GENDER IT DOES NOT RENDER THEIR \"GAY CARD\" NULL AND VOID! IT DOES NOT MAKE THEM BISEXUALS OR HETEROSEXUAL. IT SIMPLY MEANS THEY HAD HETEROSEXUAL SEXUAL RELATIONS. PERIOD! \n \n GOT IT? \n \n Good.\n \n Thirdly, there are over 6billion people on this little planet. All too many of them are homeless and starving. Why is it so necessary to stress having children being a priority of marriage? Aren't there enough mouths to feed, feet to shod, backs to clothe and bodies to house? Aren't our schools already over crowded, our jails and prisons over crowded, our highways and streets over crowded? \n Let's get our heads on straight and just stop, look at the big picture and make an assessment of reality before we start making completely erroneous accusations about how \"if everyone turned gay..\" and bogus red herrings similar to this. \n \n Fourth off, YES if you're going to criticize others grammar and/or spelling, you had better make sure you're above reproach. (I am guilty here as well..I'm only human)\n \n And...last but not least (by a long shot) HOMOSEXUALITY has ALWAYS been around...it's just in the last few decades that we've been fighting for our equality, equal access and basic HUMAN DIGNITY. \n GET USED TO IT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE! You can't \"Catch\" homosexuality. VERY FEW ACTUALLY DECIDE TO 'turn' GAY. AND THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN EX-GAY. ",
