   "Detecting design would not, at first glance, seem an unreasonable or even difficult task to undertake. I am typing these words on a keyboard that was quite clearly designed - as was the monitor from which you are reading them. Nevertheless, in the rest of this post I'm going to show you why our intuitive belief that design itself is an intrinsic and detectable quality or quantity can be misleading. Bear with me if I belabour the obvious; I just want to be thorough.\n \n What IS Design?\n \n For our purposes, a thing qualifies as 'designed' if it was first imagined and then realised. That's what ID is all about<b></b>: its adherents believe it's possible to reliably detect a history of conceptualisation and realisation by measuring some property of the finished article. \n \n A concept is a model; an abstraction. When we design something in our heads, we model both it and the purpose for which it's intended and see how well we think the two correlate. The design process is both creative and eliminative: we imagine options and reject those that don't work well in our model of the problem, retaining, permuting and refining those that do.\n \n In the end, though, the proof of the pudding is always in the eating. The ultimate test of a design is ALWAYS against reality itself: there is no more exacting standard. After all, our mental model of the problem may be incomplete; there might be real-life factors of which we're entirely ignorant. Empirical testing is the only way to see how our designed solution stacks up against whatever the REAL problem may be. In short, we outsource some of the eliminative part of the design process.\n \n This trivial observation becomes remarkable when you consider that there's no theoretical limit upon the degree to which we could outsource the eliminative role in that way. Instead of modeling a design in our head we could, in principle at least, try EVERYTHING and let the testing process establish the best option. This is remarkable because it would work even if our conscious understanding of the problem was zero.\n \n This raises an uncomfortable question: just who, in that scenario, is doing the designing? It doesn't seem to be us, blindly hosing out solutions with no idea of what the problem is, and it surely can't be the natural forces against which those solutions are pitted. Indeed, the finished article could achieve some additional effect of which its creators remain entirely ignorant, all the while appearing - to a more knowledgeable observer - to be designed specifically for that very purpose!\n \n I anticipate your reaction may be that 'trying everything' is monstrously impractical - if so, congratulations! You've hit upon the very thing we 'detect' when we look at a keyboard or a monitor and think we're seeing design.\n \n Plausible Narratives\n \n What we think of as detecting design is part of something fundamental to our nature: the creation of narratives to tie together individual things we see and experience. And amongst other things our environment contains an awful lot of human beings, all with their own purposes and goals, some of them friendly and some of them not. The ability to empathise with the intent of other creatures like ourselves and weave them into our mental narratives is essential to our success and survival.\n \n Unfortunately, this method of detecting design is useful but not infallible. Fairy rings are a simple natural example of this. People couldn't imagine how such a formation could be natural. The only mental narratives that seemed to make sense involved intentional design on the part of persons unknown. Thus fairy rings were long regarded with a great deal of superstition and suspicion. The same is true for the Giant's Causeway, a perfectly natural formation of basalt whose 'unnatural' regularity of architecture set off alarm bells. The same narrative-of-design that, functioning properly, tells us to beware of a tasty piece of fruit on the floor with a noose around it, is notoriously prone to throwing up false positives if our knowledge of the natural processes involved is incomplete.\n \n Our inference of design is considerably reinforced if we imagine that someone might be achieving something as a result - again, this tends to be the safest assumption to make in our day-to-day lives. Fairy rings tickled our narrative gland for that very reason: the idea of marking out an area for the purpose of ritual or revelry is a familiar one, and the resulting superstitions were unsurprisingly anthropomorphic. By contrast, observing the complexity and symmetry of a snowflake does not trigger a compelling design narrative (though it may appeal to children): we may not immediately understand what natural forces could shape such a thing, but even less can we imagine why anyone would bother to do it on purpose.\n \n Calling this innate ability 'detecting design', then, is something of a misnomer. What we're doing is observing a phenomenon - a coincidence or a pattern - and then seeing whether a design narrative (typically a highly anthropomorphic one) fits the gaps in our knowledge. And that's fine for everyday life, where erring on the side of design is better safe than sorry and anthropomorphic design narratives are entirely appropriate: if anyone's responsible for something unusual it's going to be one of us. The price we pay for that ability is superstition: imperfect knowledge and overactive imaginations wrongly pairing design narratives with natural phenomena.\n \n So is this the case with life? Are we seeing what life happens to do and mistaking it for the achievement of a goal? Are we telling ourselves the right stories? Or are we children looking at snowflakes?\n \n The Trouble with ID\n \n ID advocates claim to be able to cut through all this subjectivity and establish objectively and positively whether or not a given phenomenon necessitates a design narrative to explain its existence. However, as we've already seen, the physical generation, testing and selective elimination of alternatives can replace any amount of conceptual design - because in the end, conceptual design is that exact same process, only performed in the abstract. \n \n There's nothing about a single finished product in isolation that ID can measure to determine how much an intelligent agent contributed to the process. Instead, it must establish context: to what degree can the generation, testing, and selective elimination of alternatives reasonably explain said finished product? ID must look for a gap wherein intelligent conceptual modeling must have occurred.\n \n Now, we can contrive circumstances in which our knowledge is sufficiently complete to allow design to be detected. For instance, if you give a man a scrambled Rubik's Cube, lock him in a room for an hour, and find it unscrambled upon your return, you can be mathematically certain that he either already knew how the Cube works or figured it out. Although the Cube is never more than 26 moves away from completion the odds of hitting that sequence by accident in an hour are in the order of one in a million million million million. Even methodical rather than random exploration of the possible configurations doesn't bring the odds anywhere near acceptable limits.\n \n But imagine we make one small change to that scenario: we give another man a Rubik's Cube which constantly displays on it how many moves it is away from being unscrambled. We shut the door for an hour and when we return the cube is completed. This time we have no idea whether the man knows how to solve the cube or not: the additional step-by-step feedback means that a maximum of 598 twists of the cube are needed to solve it. No longer does the absence of knowledge make it necessary to literally 'try everything'.\n \n To its credit, ID recognises the power of stepwise feedback to overcome even the longest odds, which is why it focuses on 'irreducibly complex' structures. The reasoning goes thus: if a structure can't do its job until fully formed, no stepwise feedback is possible even if stepwise construction is itself conceivable. It would be like the first Rubik's cube scenario above: denied feedback the only way the man could unscramble the cube is if he knew what he was doing.\n \n To many people this reasoning appears convincingly sound. Here are five flaws that expose why it's not:\n \n 1. We might be wrong to believe that something is irreducibly complex.\n \n That belief is after all predicated upon our ability to imagine variations and how they might behave. The most famous failure of imagination in this respect is the human eye: creationists compared their preferred narrative of design against implausible scenarios in which either all the pieces simply fell together at once, or accreted over time but were useless until complete. Unsurprisingly, the design narrative won out in the plausibility stakes. Since then, what was an honest mistake on Paley's part took root and thrived in the creationist community, and is still echoing around to this day.\n \n Studies of nature have subsequently unveiled an entirely plausible sequence whereby the human eye could evolve stepwise, each minor adjustment making the whole a little more useful than before, and with ample opportunities for such adjustments to arise (amongst many neutral or detrimental changes, of course) in the absence of intelligent direction. The same fate has befallen other supposedly irreducibly complex ID poster-children such as the blood-clotting cascade, the immune system and the bacterial flagellum.\n \n 2. An irreducibly complex solution to one problem may in the past have been a reducibly complex solution to a different problem.\n \n Modern organisms are full of structures co-opted for secondary uses. Mammalian ear-bones are a classic example: in developing mammal and reptile embryos we can see the same bones end up serving different purposes, mirroring the fossil evidence of reptile/mammal divergence.\n \n 3. The most recent evolutionary step need not have been an increase in complexity.\n \n According to ID, a stone arch cannot be built one brick at a time. After all, if you wind back time and remove a single stone, the whole structure collapses - it is therefore irreducibly complex and not amenable to stepwise evolution. Of course, anyone who's seen an arch being built can spot the fallacy here: the last step in the process is not the addition of the keystone but the removal of the scaffolding.\n \n 4. We may be ignorant of a natural bias which makes a particular structure or pattern much more likely to appear than we would expect.\n \n Fairy rings are a good example of this, as are snowflakes and crystals of all kinds. Unlike the Rubik's cube scenario where randomness and design are known to be the only options, the laws of physics produce a world full of sometimes unexpected bias in favour of patterns and order - just as simple mathematics conceal the infinite complexity of the Mandlebrot set.\n \n 5. We have no idea how many other potential structures would serve the same or similar purpose.\n \n Imagine playing a card game, only you don't know the rules. You're dealt four aces and a king, and are told that you've won. At this point - if you're applying ID logic - you assume that specific hand was what you needed to win, and no other hand would do. Based on that assumption you calculate the odds of winning (1 in 48000) and conclude that this is so unlikely that the game must have been rigged in your favour.\n \n ID Probably Doesn't Care.\n \n To have any chance of contributing meaningful results, ID must at the very least reach a point where it can quantify the error margin introduced by these five factors. It has not done so. Moreover, since the ID movement is - by their own explicit admission - at best tangentially interested in contributing meaningful results, it's debatable how seriously the job of fixing those problems will be taken.\n \n I say this because in the war for hearts and minds that is the raison d'etre of the ID movement, creationism starts off with a tremendous inherent advantage, readily deducible from all the above: just as one can innocently invent fairies to populate an inexplicable ring of mushrooms in a field, so one needs to know a lot more facts about the natural world before evolution becomes a more plausible narrative than what, in the end, boils down to large bearded man making living creatures just as they are.\n \n The Real Agenda - As Publicly Stated By Creationists\n \n The goal is to prevent children learning unimpeded the facts they need to know in order to appreciate evolution's compelling elegance and make an informed decision. The hope is to foster an early commitment to a design narrative that human nature predisposes us to find appealing, especially when we're young and have yet to learn the value of withholding judgement. To facilitate this commitment, the ID movement seeks to give children and parents the false impression that even if they do withhold judgement, the controversy over evolution extends to the very limits of science - so they might as well give up and just pick the story they like best now.\n \n The obvious retort, that 'atheists' are trying to accomplish the same by keeping creationism out, is another false narrative, this one more easily rebuffed. \n \n For one, evolution is not intuitively understandable or appealing; it's bloody hard work even if it is worth it in the end. Fighting to retain the opportunity to present within the confines of a science class the current scientific consensus without distraction or interruption from religion is no more unreasonable than asking that people refrain from playing the drums in French lessons.\n \n For another, creationism already has powerful parallel forums to spread their word (churches), protected by law from the interference of outsiders with differing opinions, and it seems laughable besides for an organisation that baptises babies to complain about atheists 'getting to em young'.\n \n There's no question that evangelical atheists do exist: convinced not only of their beliefs but that it would be better for more people to share them. I'm not sure they're wrong, and I'm happy for them to make their case - but not in a science classroom. That does not mean, however, that we should refrain out of politeness from making statements of established scientific fact just because a listener might have been exposed to contradictory religious beliefs. It is not the job of science to fix or accommodate the inaccuracies of religion. Within science classrooms, science is and should remain pre-eminent, so that people can make informed decisions.\n \n ID doesn't want to play fair. Teaching the controversy is about preempting and disrupting the assimilation of scientific facts and theories that allows an evolutionary narrative a fair shot, making it seem like paying attention and withholding judgement isn't worth it because nobody really knows anyway. The truly remarkable fact is that this dissembling is even necessary: to think that evolution, its mechanisms and supporting evidence properly understood, is elegant and compelling enough to convince people in the face of human nature itself!",

We have no idea how many other potential structures would serve the same or similar purpose.\n  \n\n \n When you say \"to its credit\", and refer to stepwise feedback, the focus on irreducibly complex structures, reasoning, etc. it inspired me to do a quick search on \"science branches\" or \"science lists\" to try to get some idea on how broad the term \"science\" is, how other science branches might step their way through reasoning processes, etc. and if there are standards that they are held to. The detail of these lists can vary all over the place. There are fairly short lists;\n \n http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_are_the_branches_of_science\n \n And then long, detailed ones;\n \n http://phrontistery.info/sciences.html\n \n Do those who study other scientific branches step their way through processes, employ reasoning etc. in a way that's noticeably more complete and thorough than those who study ID? Without getting into detail of just what they do at this time, lets look at a few of the titles from the second, longer list. \n \n \n Aerophilately - the science of collecting air mail stamps\n \n Agonistics - the art and theory of prize fighting\n \n Algedonics - the science of pleasure and pain\n \n Arctophily - the study of teddy bears\n \n Aretaics - the study of virtue\n \n Coprology - the study of pornography\n \n Do other branches of science get held to comparable rigorous standards that ID is held to? Are flaws in other branches of science spelled out like you have for ID above, or is no one interested in opposing them? Evolutionists opposition to ID has to come from one of two areas; either (1) the belief is that ID doesn't have enough substance to be considered science, or (2) ID is a threat to contradict beliefs that are established in evolution. It's clear to me that it's the latter, because if it was the first, then lots of branches of science would be under fire in a similar way to ID, which they're not. (I don't think there is a single thread here that questions the science of Arctophily :))\n \n \n \nID Probably Doesn't Care.\n \n To have any chance of contributing meaningful results, ID must at the very least reach a point where it can quantify the error margin introduced by these five factors. \n\n \n If the answer to my question is that ID claims to have a possibility of contributing meaningful results, whereas Arctophily does not, or Coprology does not, that's partly a satisfactory answer, but not a complete one, because it destroys the (usually emotional) claim that ID is not science. If all those things in the second list above are science, then ID is science. \n \n If there's a lack of interest to do in-depth examinations of the scientific content of the above branches of science, again that's only partially understandable. Most sciences on these lists don't clash with each other, but some do. Aretaics vs Coprology for example, could possibly come to differing conclusions on related subjects. Does one seek to dissolve or disregard the other to the extent that it goes to court? Is evolution vs. ID the ONLY example of this in modern history? \n \n \nIt has not done so. Moreover, since the ID movement is - by their own explicit admission - at best tangentially interested in contributing meaningful results, it's debatable how seriously the job of fixing those problems will be taken. \n\n \n Every scientific branch has problems. I'll bet five flaws could be listed for every single one on the lists above. Using your list as a guide, how about five for evolution? \n \n 1)We might be wrong to believe that something evolved from nothing. \n \n 2)An evolutionary solution to some problems does not automatically make it a solution to every unanswered biological question. \n \n 3)Some evolutionary steps have to be an increase in complexity. \n \n 4)We may be ignorant of a natural bias that could stop most all of evolution (depending on how it's defined on any given day) in its tracks. \n \n 5)We have no idea exactly how empirically detectable a natural process is if we automatically rule out design without studying it. \n \n \nI say this because in the war for hearts and minds that is the raison d'etre of the ID movement, creationism starts off with a tremendous inherent advantage, readily deducible from all the above: just as one can innocently invent fairies to populate an inexplicable ring of mushrooms in a field, so one needs to know a lot more facts about the natural world before evolution becomes a more plausible narrative than what, in the end, boils down to large bearded man making living creatures just as they are. \n\n \n ID did not initiate a war for hearts and minds. Religion may have, hundreds of years ago. Getting the playing field level just doesn't seem to work in a world of imperfect humans - it seems we always have a king-of-the-hill. Religion had it yesterday, evolution leveled things out for a short time, before establishing itself as the king, and attempting to shout down opposition to itself, as religion used to do. The scales are drastically tipped again. \n \n ID seeks to address that problem once again - it attempts to counter a desire for hearts and minds that is evolution and all the politics and emotion that go with evolution in this day and age. Evolution has problems and it has baggage, Dawkins/ Harris baggage. It's not really debatable how seriously the job of fixing these problems will be taken, since most evolutionists don't even admit those problems exist. \n \n \nThe Real Agenda - As Publicly Stated By Creationists\n \n The goal is to prevent children learning unimpeded the facts they need to know in order to appreciate evolution's compelling elegance and make an informed decision. The hope is to foster an early commitment to a design narrative that human nature predisposes us to find appealing, especially when we're young and have yet to learn the value of withholding judgement. To facilitate this commitment, the ID movement seeks to give children and parents the false impression that even if they do withhold judgement, the controversy over evolution extends to the very limits of science - so they might as well give up and just pick the story they like best now.\n \n The obvious retort, that 'atheists' are trying to accomplish the same by keeping creationism out, is another false narrative, this one more easily rebuffed. \n \n For one, evolution is not intuitively understandable or appealing; it's bloody hard work even if it is worth it in the end. \n\n \n Not an easy rebuff, because that statement is highly controversial. From Spencer and Huxley in Darwin's time, to Dawkins and Harris of today, evolution has proven to be highly appealing. It appeals to people who don't care much to understand the details of it at all. They're buying up books by Harris and Stenger left and right. All they know is that it releases them from established behavior standards. Undirected development of life equals undirected behavior. \n \n \nFighting to retain the opportunity to present within the confines of a science class the current scientific consensus without distraction or interruption from religion is no more unreasonable than asking that people refrain from playing the drums in French lessons. \n\n \n In a perfect world, that is true. Unfortunately, there is plenty of distraction and interruption from atheism. The proof is, that within the confines of a science class, just about any discussion of evolution, or websites like talk origins, or 4forums, the bloody hard work fades, and is replaced with put downs of religion. I've shown, in another thread, how follow ups (second posts) to threads that open about evolution often aren't about any hard, thoughtful evolutionary work, they're effortless put downs of religion. \n \n \nFor another, creationism already has powerful parallel forums to spread their word (churches), protected by law from the interference of outsiders with differing opinions, and it seems laughable besides for an organisation that baptises babies to complain about atheists 'getting to em young'. \n\n \n The parallel forums arent all that powerful. Church is often one day per week, is mostly voluntary, and of course baptism of babies doesn't appeal to their conscious mind at all. The church has a difficult time competing with mandatory public education, combined with secular everyday life. \n \n \nThere's no question that evangelical atheists do exist: convinced not only of their beliefs but that it would be better for more people to share them. I'm not sure they're wrong, and I'm happy for them to make their case - but not in a science classroom. \n\n \n And if they do? Is that as big a crime as an ID advocate making his case in a science classroom? The fact is, the influence of evangelical atheists can't be kept out of the science classroom, because no consensus exists on just where the fact/philosophical line is drawn. If a teacher or a textbook cross the line in the slightest way, time consuming distracting religious/non religious discussions can follow. \n \n \nThat does not mean, however, that we should refrain out of politeness from making statements of established scientific fact just because a listener might have been exposed to contradictory religious beliefs. It is not the job of science to fix or accommodate the inaccuracies of religion. Within science classrooms, science is and should remain pre-eminent, so that people can make informed decisions. \n\n \n But it should be the job of science to establish a clear line between just where established fact stops and philosophy starts. There's no indication that they're getting it done. \n \n \nID doesn't want to play fair. Teaching the controversy is about preempting and disrupting the assimilation of scientific facts and theories that allows an evolutionary narrative a fair shot, making it seem like paying attention and withholding judgement isn't worth it because nobody really knows anyway. The truly remarkable fact is that this dissembling is even necessary: to think that evolution, its mechanisms and supporting evidence properly understood, is elegant and compelling enough to convince people in the face of human nature itself!\n\n \n The main reason it is elegant and compelling is because it contains a release from religious responsibility. That's the face of human nature that make it all too easy to accept without realizing that a controversy even exists, and it does exist. If it didn't, evolutionists wouldn't be afraid of challenges.",

   "I want to preface my response by distinguishing the seperate issues at stake here.\n \n 1. Can looking for intelligent design be scientific?\n \n 2. Is the work the ID movement has produced rigorous, and are its results significant?\n \n 3. Should ID be opposed as a scientific endeavour?\n \n 4. Should ID as it stands be taught as an alternative to evolution in science classrooms?\n \n As an aside I invite readers to observe, going forward, how these issues are often treated as interchangeable by those advocating ID in the classroom.\n \nWhen you say \"to its credit\", and refer to stepwise feedback, the focus on irreducibly complex structures, reasoning, etc. it inspired me to do a quick search on \"science branches\" or \"science lists\"\n\n You would have been better served researching the scientific method directly. A branch of science is any field of study to which the scientific method is applied.\n \n My OP critique of the work produced by the ID movement was deliberately philosophy-agnostic. After all, so long as the science done is rigorous, it matters not at all what inspires one to pursue a study in the first place. The religious motivation behind the ID movement is only significant in the larger context.\n \n What they've got right is their deduction that they need to find something that can't have evolved in order to infer design. What they get wrong almost immediately is their belief that irreducible complexity represents an impossibility for evolutionary processes.\n \nWithout getting into detail of just what they do at this time, lets look at a few of the titles from the second, longer list.\n\n None of which are taught or planned to be taught in science classrooms and none of which have the slightest relevance to ID, which must stand or fall on its own merits.\n \nEvolutionists opposition to ID has to come from one of two areas; either (1) the belief is that ID doesn't have enough substance to be considered science, or (2) ID is a threat to contradict beliefs that are established in evolution. It's clear to me that it's the latter, because if it was the first, then lots of branches of science would be under fire in a similar way to ID, which they're not.\n\n What you're saying, in effect, is that if there are three naughty children in a class and only one of them gets punished, he can't actually have been naughty, because if he had, the other two would have been punished too. Except that to support your deduction you're assuming that there are other naughty children in the class who aren't being punished. On top of which, you refuse to even discuss the plentiful evidence of misbehaviour, and flatly ignore what amounts to a signed affidavit by the child in question that he intended to misbehave in the manner of which he is accused. You will talk about quite literally anything from stamp-collecting to porn to avoid backing up your assertion that the ID movement is valid science and deserves a place in the classroom.\n \nIf the answer to my question is that ID claims to have a possibility of contributing meaningful results, whereas Arctophily does not, or Coprology does not, that's partly a satisfactory answer, but not a complete one, because it destroys the (usually emotional) claim that ID is not science. If all those things in the second list above are science, then ID is science.\n\n That doesn't follow. A field of study is scientific if it applies the scientific method, end of story. What is being studied - how significant or important or relevant - matters not in the least.\n \n The ID movement itself is not science; it's a PR exercise. That's the reality of what it is, as affirmed by those who organise and sponsor it. The work the ID movement has produced in service of that PR exercise is either bad science or not science at all depending upon how charitable you feel like being.\n \nMost sciences on these lists don't clash with each other, but some do. Aretaics vs Coprology for example, could possibly come to differing conclusions on related subjects. Does one seek to dissolve or disregard the other to the extent that it goes to court? Is evolution vs. ID the ONLY example of this in modern history? \n\n Evolution vs ID isn't being settled in the courts. Evolution vs ID is settled where it should be, in the cut and thrust of peer review. What the courts are adjudicating is the status of ID as a science and whether it should be taught in science class.\n \nEvery scientific branch has problems. I'll bet five flaws could be listed for every single one on the lists above. Using your list as a guide, how about five for evolution?\n\n Ok, let's give that a try.\n \n1)We might be wrong to believe that something evolved from nothing.\n\n Evolution doesn't require something to have evolved from nothing, so this isn't a valid criticism. Evolutionary theory seeks to explain the plain fact of common descent.\n \n2)An evolutionary solution to some problems does not automatically make it a solution to every unanswered biological question.\n\n True, but it does make evolution a known factor, and the scientific method requires that one prioritise exhausting the explicative power of known factors before inventing new ones. Moreover, evolution is such a good fit for known phenomena (in terms of statistical evidence, timescale, the ad-hoc nature of the solutions produced and so on) that it would remain the best explanation even if design were somehow to be detected elsewhere. Evolution is unquestionably happening.\n \n3)Some evolutionary steps have to be an increase in complexity. \n\n And they can be. Increases in complexity are readily achieved via incremental change.\n \n4)We may be ignorant of a natural bias that could stop most all of evolution (depending on how it's defined on any given day) in its tracks.\n\n I made no such equivalent criticism - which would have been along the lines of 'There may well be no designer, which would rule out design'. I don't want or need to invoke unknowable unknowns to criticise ID. You're speculating about just such a thing, the likelihood of which is unquantifiable, whereas we know that patterns arise in nature in the absence of design. Moreover, you're hypothesising a natural bias that prevents the most fit variants from proliferating - but that very bias would disqualify them as 'most fit' and make something else 'most fit' instead. \n \n5)We have no idea exactly how empirically detectable a natural process is if we automatically rule out design without studying it. \n\n It's not about ruling out design. Please, go back and read the OP, paying special attention to the parts you didn't address. Design is conceptualisation followed by realisation. It's impossible to rule it out - any old rock on a beach could have been crafted to look just the way it is. The problem is that you can't positively rule it in: empirical filtering of alternatives can replace any amount of conceptual design because, as I demonstrated at some length, conceptual design IS empirical filtering carried out in the abstract. All you can do is try to show that there's an inexplicable gap in the generation, testing and filtering of variants. How do you show a gap is inexplicable? By trying to explain it - which is what biological science is already doing. ID adds nothing to those efforts. \n \nID did not initiate a war for hearts and minds. \n\n So the creationists behind it are lying when they say that's exactly what it is?\n \nNot an easy rebuff, because that statement is highly controversial. From Spencer and Huxley in Darwin's time, to Dawkins and Harris of today, evolution has proven to be highly appealing. It appeals to people who don't care much to understand the details of it at all.\n\n Then why aren't you it's biggest fan?\n \nThey're buying up books by Harris and Stenger left and right. All they know is that it releases them from established behavior standards. Undirected development of life equals undirected behavior. \n\n First, the development of life has not been undirected (the creaky old creationist strawman that evolution is randomness and chaos).\n \n Second, however we got here, we clearly do have standards of behaviour. Realising their origin may not be divine does not absolve us of our responsibility to each other. Nor do these standards of behaviour vary appreciably in the presence or absence of religion. \n \nIn a perfect world, that is true. Unfortunately, there is plenty of distraction and interruption from atheism. The proof is, that within the confines of a science class, just about any discussion of evolution, or websites like talk origins, or 4forums, the bloody hard work fades, and is replaced with put downs of religion. I've shown, in another thread, how follow ups (second posts) to threads that open about evolution often aren't about any hard, thoughtful evolutionary work, they're effortless put downs of religion.\n\n And do you include me in that analysis?\n \n Perhaps you could link me to these threads so that we can see exactly how they 'open' :) I'm not saying I haven't seen put-downs of religion on this forum, but in my experience there's either personal history between the posters (the response is effectively continuing an on-going spat that transcends the thread), or the OP itself was laden with flame-bait.\n \nThe parallel forums arent all that powerful. Church is often one day per week, is mostly voluntary, and of course baptism of babies doesn't appeal to their conscious mind at all. The church has a difficult time competing with mandatory public education, combined with secular everyday life.\n\n Nevertheless, they have a forum, the ear of the parents, and constitutional protection for the propagation of their beliefs without any requirement for those beliefs to be justified. The science classroom, on the other hand, is duty-bound to present those facts and theories that have been justified. As Wiki says about the scientific method:\n \nThe purpose of the scientific method is to test a hypothesis, a belief about how things are, via repeatable experimental observations which can contradict the hypothesis so as to fight ... observer bias.\n\n You're laboring under the misapprehension that if the world really were a few thousand years old and we all sprang whole out of nothingness and we really were all descended from a single couple, scientific investigations wouldn't reveal that truth. But it would. It would be very, very easy to scientifically confirm a biblical earth. That hasn't happened because we're not living on one. Whatever problems that causes are yours to deal with, not mine.\n \nAnd if they do? Is that as big a crime as an ID advocate making his case in a science classroom?\n\n Whether either is a 'crime' is debateable, but they're inappropriate - for different reasons.\n \nThe main reason it is elegant and compelling is because it contains a release from religious responsibility.\n\n Evolutionary theory doesn't entail a release from anything. At most it suggests a natural origin for the sense of responsibility we have towards each other - which would mean that cooperation, empathy and civility are empirically good ideas, intrinsically valuable, even without a stand-in father figure to administrate them. Far from releasing us from our social responsibilities it reinforces how vital they are to our status as a species.\n \nThat's the face of human nature that make it all too easy to accept without realizing that a controversy even exists, and it does exist. If it didn't, evolutionists wouldn't be afraid of challenges.\n\n So what you're saying is that if ID really were worthless non-science, we'd be able to tell because everyone would be happy for it to be taught alongside evolution in science class? Yeah, that makes perfect sense :)\n \n Hopefully you can now see how far we've meandered around the disparate issues. Let's recap:\n \n 1. Can looking for intelligent design be scientific?\n \n One can apply the scientific method to any study. So far, the results of that application to ID (largely through peer review) indicate that it is not logically possible to positively infer the presence of design in a biological structure.\n \n 2. Is the work the ID movement has produced rigorous, and are its results significant?\n \n No. The fundamentally flawed assumption that irreducible complexity cannot be achieved by evolutionary means invalidates all derivative results, and Dembski's 'specified complexity' is neither consistent, measurable, nor meaningful. Several structures claimed to represent evidence of design have admitted to evolutionary paths (including, ironically, some of the analogies used in their literature in an attempt to illustrate things design alone can accomplish)\n \n 3. Should ID be opposed as a scientific endeavour?\n \n Of course not. We only ever learn by imagining; by striking out in unexpected and even seemingly absurd directions - just so long as we're rigorous in our logic and our testing. I don't think design science would ever bear useful fruit, but I would never oppose someone pursuing it. \n \n 4. Should ID as it stands be taught as an alternative to evolution in science classrooms?\n \n Absolutely not. It presently stands on a par with hypotheses about the 'electric universe', or firey comets flying out of the sun, or any number of inventive, potentially appealing, but utterly unsubstantiated notions. Its few published results have been obliterated in peer review and there's quite simply nothing there to teach.",

   "I want to preface my response by distinguishing the seperate issues at stake here.\n \n 1. Can looking for intelligent design be scientific?\n \n 2. Is the work the ID movement has produced rigorous, and are its results significant?\n \n 3. Should ID be opposed as a scientific endeavour?\n \n 4. Should ID as it stands be taught as an alternative to evolution in science classrooms?\n \n As an aside I invite readers to observe, going forward, how these issues are often treated as interchangeable by those advocating ID in the classroom. \n\n \n As I would invite them to observe interchangability in arguments by evolutionists. \n \n \nYou would have been better served researching the scientific method directly. A branch of science is any field of study to which the scientific method is applied. \n\n \n It often depends on who is doing the applying, and what their motivations are. The mere presence of the scientific method, invented and reinvented for a thousand years, isn't automatically proof that it won't be taken advantage of by one special interest to further its cause.\n \n \nMy OP critique of the work produced by the ID movement was deliberately philosophy-agnostic. After all, so long as the science done is rigorous, it matters not at all what inspires one to pursue a study in the first place. The religious motivation behind the ID movement is only significant in the larger context.\n\n \n There is a distinction between two motivations in ID, just as there are in the two motivations in evolution. \n \n 1)In ID, a design inference is a generic argument for identifying the effects of intelligence regardless of the intelligence's identification or particular characteristics, and regardless of where, when, how or why the intelligence acts. \n \n 2)In ID, a religious motivation would be a design argument that attempts to establish the existence and attributes of a certain intelligent cause. \n \n 1) In evolution, a generic argument is made for random mutation and natural selection etc. with no reference to a supernatural involvement. \n \n 2)In evolution, the atheist motivation attempts to establish or imply the non-existence of any supernatural.\n \n Number 1 can and does lead to number 2, equally in both cases. \n The religious motivation behind the ID movement is comparable to the atheist motivation behind evolution. ID is condemned for it - evolution gets a free pass on it. \n \n \nWhat they've got right is their deduction that they need to find something that can't have evolved in order to infer design. What they get wrong almost immediately is their belief that irreducible complexity represents an impossibility for evolutionary processes. \n\n \n What evolutionists have got right is their deduction that they need to find a source for origins, or shout down ID. What they get wrong is that some design doesn't necessarily threaten everything they hold dear about their beloved evolution. \n \n \nNone of which are taught or planned to be taught in science classrooms and none of which have the slightest relevance to ID, which must stand or fall on its own merits. \n\n \n Of course not, that's the reason I showed them. Several others there are more questionable. According to your link, the scientific method has been around a long time, (about 1000 years) probably safe to say longer than most sciences on that list. Yet they're still there, it seems that science has been around a lot longer than the latest versions of the scientific methods, yet we don't see careful revisions showing that some branch of science from the past no longer measures up. The ones I listed above obviously don't, but some may be comparable to ID (or evolution), in that there would be disagreement on whether or not they should be considered science - if the scientific method applies to them. \n \n Psychobiology - the study of biology of the mind\n Sociobiology - the study of biological basis of human behavior\n Semantics - the study of meaning\n Pisteology - the science or study of faith\n \n Should these be in science classes or shouldn't they? Can these be tested and repeated by the scientific method? How about a recent one that's not on the list; Global warming? Can it be tested and repeated that human activity is causing it? It looks like it is in science classes right now. \n \n http://news.rutgers.edu/focus/issue.2006-10-11.7407929537/article.2006-10-11.2417885395/articlepage.2006-10-11.6627496617\n \n \"Transforming the Global Environment\"? A SCIENCE class? Humans can transform the global enviornment? This is the scientific method, while ID is not? \n \n \nWhat you're saying, in effect, is that if there are three naughty children in a class and only one of them gets punished, he can't actually have been naughty, because if he had, the other two would have been punished too. \n\n \n No, I'm saying all three of them could have been naughty, but the other two were teachers pets. Let's name the children, let's call the one who was punished ~ID~, and we'll call the first of the two pets ~atheistic evolution~ and we'll call the other unpunished one ~global warming~. AE and GW have influential parents, they attend a lot of PTA meetings, and have influence on how the teacher is paid, or if the teacher is fired. \n \n \nExcept that to support your deduction you're assuming that there are other naughty children in the class who aren't being punished. \n\n \n No assumptions, I'm applying the scientific method to them. Unless the scientific method isn't perfect? Say it ain't so!!!!!!!\n \n \nOn top of which, you refuse to even discuss the plentiful evidence of misbehaviour, and flatly ignore what amounts to a signed affidavit by the child in question that he intended to misbehave in the manner of which he is accused. \n\n \n Yes, while the others were dishonest in not signing affidavits, their guilt was more obvious than ever, because they wrote books for other children about it, teaching them how to do it, and making big bucks in the process!!!!!\n \n \nYou will talk about quite literally anything from stamp-collecting to porn to avoid backing up your assertion that the ID movement is valid science and deserves a place in the classroom. \n\n \n It's a very clear way to expose the double standards. :) It's no worse than talking about misbehaving children in school, is it? The difference is, my comparisons work while your analogies backfire. emoticon_xangel\n \n \nThat doesn't follow. A field of study is scientific if it applies the scientific method, end of story. What is being studied - how significant or important or relevant - matters not in the least. \n\n \n ID can easily show that it applies the scientific method in some ways. It can be shown that almost all branches of science can wander away from the scientific method if anyone or any group cares to do it. So when you say \"end of story\" it's not the end of the story at all. Humans have to decide the extent of the scientific methods vs the wanderings. \n \n \nThe ID movement itself is not science; it's a PR exercise. That's the reality of what it is, as affirmed by those who organise and sponsor it. The work the ID movement has produced in service of that PR exercise is either bad science or not science at all depending upon how charitable you feel like being.\n\n \n You keep claiming that, but you never reference it. I'd like to see sources and names. Just because evolutionary sources don't claim to be engaging in a PR exercise doesn't mean they aren't doing it. There is plenty of evidence of it, even if they don't honestly admit it. \n \n \nEvolution vs ID isn't being settled in the courts. Evolution vs ID is settled where it should be, in the cut and thrust of peer review. What the courts are adjudicating is the status of ID as a science and whether it should be taught in science class. \n\n \n The \"cut and thrust of peer review\", in other words, a special interest. That special interest then goes on to influence the courts, and to make sure it is the courts that decide, not public opinion. As you noticed since you posted there, evolutionists are crying about Sarah Palin because she is a \"teach the controversy\" believer. There's not much question that the majority of Americans agree with her - it's a freedom thing. It IS being decided in the courts, because if it was decided by the voters, chances are there would be a different outcome. \n \n \n \nOk, let's give that a try.\n \n Evolution doesn't require something to have evolved from nothing, so this isn't a valid criticism. Evolutionary theory seeks to explain the plain fact of common descent. \n\n \n I know that. Evolution releases itself from its foundation at will. When it wants to speculate about things like abiogenesis and claim it to be science, it allows itself to do that. It's that interchangeability thing you spoke of above. \n \n \nTrue, but it does make evolution a known factor, and the scientific method requires that one prioritise exhausting the explicative power of known factors before inventing new ones. \n\n \n And evolution is exhausted. It can't do anything with origins, and recent discoveries of the complexities of the simplest forms of life exhaust it even more. \n \n \nMoreover, evolution is such a good fit for known phenomena (in terms of statistical evidence, timescale, the ad-hoc nature of the solutions produced and so on) that it would remain the best explanation even if design were somehow to be detected elsewhere. Evolution is unquestionably happening. \n\n \n I'm not sure evolution can prove to be a better fit concerning timescale, when compared to the written history of the Bible. I guess it can when it figures in its \"statistical evidence\". The importance of theories and statistical evidence and radiometric dating and all of that vs written history carries different weight with different people. It's a difference in worldviews. \n \n \nAnd they can be. Increases in complexity are readily achieved via incremental change.\n\n \n Then why did you find it important to claim that they don't have to be? \n \n \nI made no such equivalent criticism - which would have been along the lines of 'There may well be no designer, which would rule out design'. I don't want or need to invoke unknowable unknowns to criticise ID. You're speculating about just such a thing, the likelihood of which is unquantifiable, whereas we know that patterns arise in nature in the absence of design. \n\n \n Equally, we know that something cannot evolve from nothing. \n \n \nMoreover, you're hypothesising a natural bias that prevents the most fit variants from proliferating - but that very bias would disqualify them as 'most fit' and make something else 'most fit' instead. \n\n \n I'm hypothesising a natural bias that fill a gap that evolution can't explain anyway. It's no worse hypothesis than what sometimes goes on in evolution. \n \n \nIt's not about ruling out design. Please, go back and read the OP, paying special attention to the parts you didn't address. Design is conceptualisation followed by realisation. It's impossible to rule it out - any old rock on a beach could have been crafted to look just the way it is. The problem is that you can't positively rule it in: empirical filtering of alternatives can replace any amount of conceptual design because, as I demonstrated at some length, conceptual design IS empirical filtering carried out in the abstract. All you can do is try to show that there's an inexplicable gap in the generation, testing and filtering of variants. How do you show a gap is inexplicable? By trying to explain it - which is what biological science is already doing. ID adds nothing to those efforts. \n\n \n You show a gap to be inexplicable by trying to explain it from an atheist worldview? That's an objective, fair way to do it? So completely unfair and unbiased that ID's different methods of searching add NOTHING??\n \n \nSo the creationists behind it are lying when they say that's exactly what it is? \n\n \n Initiate was the key word. Show me a link where they say they initiated it. \n \n \nThen why aren't you it's biggest fan? \n\n \n Hmm, is this question a legitimate \"why isn't everyone it's biggest fan\" or the more condescending \"why am ~I~ not it's biggest fan since I \"don't care much to understand the details of it at all\"? I'll answer as if it's the former, though I suspect it's the latter. :)\n \n Different people have different worldviews. Evolution and the godlessness that often go with it can be appealing for a while, but events in a person's life can cause the appeal to fade, to turn into a cold grip of despair in a life without ultimate purpose. If I'm wrong, atheists would be a happier lot than they are. \n \n \nFirst, the development of life has not been undirected (the creaky old creationist strawman that evolution is randomness and chaos). \n\n \n Major interchangeability is baaaack! Sometimes evolution is natural and undirected, and sometimes it seems to become directed. (by \"nature\"?) Nature doesn't have a mind and it doesn't have a purpose, so it cannot direct anything. \n \n \nSecond, however we got here, we clearly do have standards of behaviour. Realising their origin may not be divine does not absolve us of our responsibility to each other. Nor do these standards of behaviour vary appreciably in the presence or absence of religion. \n\n \n They vary all over the place - they almost without exception take off in different directions. Political patternes in sizes and scopes of government, personal behaviors and responsibilities, etc. are very predictably based on whether we believe in a supernatural God, or if we are our own little gods. \n \n \n \nAnd do you include me in that analysis? \n\n \n Not necessarily. There are a lot of evolutionists I don't include in it. A few posters here (unkerpaulie) and a few famous guys (Ruse, Horowitz) But the percentages of those that are included in that analysis are high enough for it to be a problem, as attempts are made to establish their views in public policy. \n \n \nPerhaps you could link me to these threads so that we can see exactly how they 'open' :) I'm not saying I haven't seen put-downs of religion on this forum, but in my experience there's either personal history between the posters (the response is effectively continuing an on-going spat that transcends the thread), or the OP itself was laden with flame-bait. \n\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=316935&postcount=9\n \n You didn't participate in that one, and my participation there got away from me party because of computer problems, and partly because of the usual personal attacks against me, and I didn't feel like addressing a big pile of them at the time I got back. \n \n \nNevertheless, they have a forum, the ear of the parents, and constitutional protection for the propagation of their beliefs without any requirement for those beliefs to be justified. The science classroom, on the other hand, is duty-bound to present those facts and theories that have been justified. \n\n \n Churches are not motivated to oppose evolution, the way evolution is motivated to oppose religion. Evolution doesn't get in the way of churches to promote Christ's teachings, to the extent that Christ's teachings get in the way of evolutionists social desires. Christ's teachings (the Bible - the entire word of God) are based on the book of Genesis. The church \"forum\" doesn't oppose evolution to anywhere near the extent that the evolution \"forum\" opposes the book of Genesis. \n \n \nYou're laboring under the misapprehension that if the world really were a few thousand years old and we all sprang whole out of nothingness and we really were all descended from a single couple, scientific investigations wouldn't reveal that truth. But it would. It would be very, very easy to scientifically confirm a biblical earth. That hasn't happened because we're not living on one. Whatever problems that causes are yours to deal with, not mine. \n\n \n So evolution is anti-Biblical? Yet at other times, your interchangeability allows you to say that evolution is not atheistic. Your clear interchangeability is what really causes me problems, but I can handle it. emoticon_xangel\n \n \nWhether either is a 'crime' is debateable, but they're inappropriate - for different reasons. \n\n \n Are they equally inappropriate? Is it okay to block one with the heavy hand of government, and wink and nod at the other? How far do we allow all the interchangeability to go? \n \n \nEvolutionary theory doesn't entail a release from anything. \n\n \n Some famous atheists have claimed that it does. From becoming an \"intellectially fullfilled atheist\", to a \"release from sexual mores\". But what's a little more interchangeability? :)\n \n \nAt most it suggests a natural origin for the sense of responsibility we have towards each other - which would mean that cooperation, empathy and civility are empirically good ideas, intrinsically valuable, even without a stand-in father figure to administrate them. Far from releasing us from our social responsibilities it reinforces how vital they are to our status as a species. \n\n \n What it often does is suggest a worship of the earth, which would explain the double standard between the scientific method being applied to ID vs global warming. \n \n \nSo what you're saying is that if ID really were worthless non-science, we'd be able to tell because everyone would be happy for it to be taught alongside evolution in science class? Yeah, that makes perfect sense :) \n\n \n Uh, I didn't say anything about \"worthless non science\". But I'll leave the strawmen accusations to you and yours. It's up to the reader to decide who's actually making them.\n \n \nHopefully you can now see how far we've meandered around the disparate issues. Let's recap:\n \n 1. Can looking for intelligent design be scientific?\n \n One can apply the scientific method to any study. So far, the results of that application to ID (largely through peer review) indicate that it is not logically possible to positively infer the presence of design in a biological structure. \n\n \n If ID is not science, human caused global warming study is equally not science. Double standard confirmed. If the scientific method is applied selectively, (only to some branches of science and not others) then the motives of the selectors must be examined. Not by special interests, but by the public. \n \n \n2. Is the work the ID movement has produced rigorous, and are its results significant?\n \n No. The fundamentally flawed assumption that irreducible complexity cannot be achieved by evolutionary means invalidates all derivative results, and Dembski's 'specified complexity' is neither consistent, measurable, nor meaningful. Several structures claimed to represent evidence of design have admitted to evolutionary paths (including, ironically, some of the analogies used in their literature in an attempt to illustrate things design alone can accomplish) \n\n \n Are other branches of science held to equal rigorous standards as is ID? NO. Yet no others have been blocked from public study as has ID. \n \n \n3. Should ID be opposed as a scientific endeavour?\n \n Of course not. We only ever learn by imagining; by striking out in unexpected and even seemingly absurd directions - just so long as we're rigorous in our logic and our testing. I don't think design science would ever bear useful fruit, but I would never oppose someone pursuing it. \n\n \n As long as those poised to steamroll it and shout it down have a huge public advantage in education and funding? \n \n \n4. Should ID as it stands be taught as an alternative to evolution in science classrooms?\n \n Absolutely not. It presently stands on a par with hypotheses about the 'electric universe', or firey comets flying out of the sun, or any number of inventive, potentially appealing, but utterly unsubstantiated notions. Its few published results have been obliterated in peer review and there's quite simply nothing there to teach.\n\n \n As I said before, I can't come up with anything persuasive and new for ID. Everything on it has been steamrolled by lots of evolutionists in publicly funded institutions. But it is legitimate to hold other branches of science to the same standard as ID is held to. Worship of the earth is a religion just like anything else.",

   "As I would invite them to observe interchangability in arguments by evolutionists.\n\n You do this an awful lot, marc; you ought to be aware that simply repeating your opponent's arguments substituting different words doesn't guarantee the result will be meaningful. Moreover, it's like holding up a large sign saying \"I have absolutely no way to refute what's just been said, so I'll try to deflect attention away from it.\"\n \n1)In ID, a design inference is a generic argument for identifying the effects of intelligence regardless of the intelligence's identification or particular characteristics, and regardless of where, when, how or why the intelligence acts. \n\n Sure - which is one of the reasons it fails. It's logically impossible to recognise the effects of a force with no consistent or definable characteristics.\n \n2)In ID, a religious motivation would be a design argument that attempts to establish the existence and attributes of a certain intelligent cause. \n\n Incorrect. Rather, that's what archaeology does: recognises the hallmarks of a specific kind of intelligent agent. ID is stuck with number 1.\n \n The principle religious motivation behind the ID movement is not to find anything at all, merely to foster the illusion of scientific controversy in an attempt to justify meddling with the only forum of learning in which verifiability trumps fervour of belief.\n \nNumber 1 can and does lead to number 2, equally in both cases. \n The religious motivation behind the ID movement is comparable to the atheist motivation behind evolution. ID is condemned for it - evolution gets a free pass on it. \n\n ID is condemned on a scientific level because it's chock full of faulty reasoning and invalid results. It's contemptible on a political level because it's trying to sidestep the peer review process and wriggle its way into the science classroom on false pretenses. You're conflating seperate issues again.\n \nWhat evolutionists have got right is their deduction that they need to find a source for origins, or shout down ID.\n\n ID isn't being shouted down. It has been scientifically refuted. Normally that's the end of the matter with failed hypotheses. Things get ugly because ID's religious political agenda has forced scientists and educators to step in to defend the integrity of science in the classroom.\n \n If you want to see who's really trying to shout down whom, I invite you to inspect our own discussions. Who is trying to make the argument about the science, and who keeps trying to drag the issue away from science and into a tangle of moral and social strawmen?\n \nThe ones I listed above obviously don't, but some may be comparable to ID (or evolution), in that there would be disagreement on whether or not they should be considered science - if the scientific method applies to them. \n\n Evidence? Or are we still just assuming the existence of other naughty children?\n \nPsychobiology - the study of biology of the mind\n Sociobiology - the study of biological basis of human behavior\n Semantics - the study of meaning\n Pisteology - the science or study of faith\n \n Should these be in science classes or shouldn't they? Can these be tested and repeated by the scientific method?\n\n The way you phrase questions, sometimes... I can't tell if it's just imprecise use of language or evidence that you don't fully grasp what you're talking about.\n \n We don't 'test and repeat' Sociobiology 'by the scientific method'. The scientific method involves testable repeatable results. Do sociobiologists construct theorems on the basis of testable, repeatable results? Do they actively seek to falsify those results rather than only ever looking for confirmatory evidence? If so, then they're performing good science.\n \n Do you understand? Something like 'sociobiology' counts as good science if it consists of a body of work produced by people applying scientific methods rigorously.\n \n Before you get all excited, no: ID does not count as an attempt to falsify evolutionary results. You don't falsify a theory by coming up with an alternative one and only ever looking for confirmatory evidence of that instead. Rather, you make strong predictions based on the theory you have, and find ways to test those predictions.\n \n That's actually a further problem with ID: it's impossible to construct a test to falsify it, because ID doesn't actually require any given biological feature to be the product of design. It makes no predictions. It can - as it has done for hundreds of years now - always fall back upon the next convenient biological feature.\n \nHow about a recent one that's not on the list; Global warming? Can it be tested and repeated that human activity is causing it? It looks like it is in science classes right now.\n \"Transforming the Global Environment\"? A SCIENCE class? Humans can transform the global enviornment? This is the scientific method, while ID is not?\n\n Again, a really weird turn of phrase. If the class is teaching results gained by the application of the scientific method, that's fine by me.\n \nNo, I'm saying all three of them could have been naughty, but the other two were teachers pets.\n\n No, marc, you're weren't saying that. Allow me to remind you of what you actually said:\n \nEvolutionists opposition to ID has to come from one of two areas; either (1) the belief is that ID doesn't have enough substance to be considered science, or (2) ID is a threat to contradict beliefs that are established in evolution. It's clear to me that it's the latter, because if it was the first, then lots of branches of science would be under fire in a similar way to ID, which they're not.\n\n See? You explicitly said that you are inferring that ID does have enough substance to be considered science, because only one of the two scenarios above could be true.\n \n What you're doing now is changing your tune. Now you're saying that both 1 and 2 could be true: ID isn't proper science and it's a threat to beliefs established in evolution. But 1 makes 2 irrelevant: if ID isn't good science it has no place in the classroom. End of story.\n \nNo assumptions, I'm applying the scientific method to them. Unless the scientific method isn't perfect? Say it ain't so!!!!!!!\n\n Sorry, but that's just gibberish. Show me again where you made any headway towards showing that other 'naughty children' exist. \n \nYes, while the others were dishonest in not signing affidavits, their guilt was more obvious than ever, because they wrote books for other children about it, teaching them how to do it, and making big bucks in the process!!!!!\n\n I'm not even sure what we're talking about here. If it's Dawkin's books again, you're still missing the point. Evolutionary theory is scientifically robust. ID is not. That's what makes ID the naughty child in this analogy. What Dawkins or Behe believes philosophically is irrelevant.\n \nIt's a very clear way to expose the double standards. :) It's no worse than talking about misbehaving children in school, is it? The difference is, my comparisons work while your analogies backfire. emoticon_xangel\n\n You haven't made any progress towards showing double standards. All you've done is present a big list of sciences and made vague insinuations about their validity, with nothing to back you up. And I think my analogy has done its job just fine.\n \nID can easily show that it applies the scientific method in some ways.\n\n Or so you assume. You're wrong. ID is not falsifiable, even in principle, so it cannot perform the most fundamental task required of any science: make firm predictions that can be tested. Nor does it attempt to ensure that a new explanation is even needed for a phenomenon before inventing one.\n \nYou keep claiming that, but you never reference it.\n\n Presumably you missed it the last few times. The last link there is particularly illuminating.\n \nThe \"cut and thrust of peer review\", in other words, a special interest.\n\n No, in other words \"the cut and thrust of peer review.\" Where ID falls flat on its face. Stop trying to dress that up as some kind of underserved mugging; if you aren't prepared to understand and defend ID on a scientific level you aren't equipped to decide that it is being unfairly treated.\n \nAs you noticed since you posted there, evolutionists are crying about Sarah Palin because she is a \"teach the controversy\" believer. There's not much question that the majority of Americans agree with her - it's a freedom thing. It IS being decided in the courts, because if it was decided by the voters, chances are there would be a different outcome.\n\n Absolutely, and that's because it's wrongly perceived as a 'freedom thing'. There's no such thing as the 'freedom' to be taught something of no scientific merit in a science class.\n \nI know that. Evolution releases itself from its foundation at will. When it wants to speculate about things like abiogenesis and claim it to be science, it allows itself to do that. It's that interchangeability thing you spoke of above. \n\n No, marc, that's just your endless, relentless conflation of seperate issues. Evolution is not founded on abiogenesis, it is founded on the plain fact of common descent and the observable ongoing process It is an explanation for something that has unquestionably happened. I think I've made that clear enough to you on enough occasions now.\n \nAnd evolution is exhausted. It can't do anything with origins, and recent discoveries of the complexities of the simplest forms of life exhaust it even more.\n\n Evolution doesn't speak to the origin of first life, so that point is irrelevant. And repeating the 'theory in crisis' mantra, while undoubtedly comforting, starts to wear a little thin after a couple of hundred years of ever-increasing knowledge, accuracy and predictive capacity.\n \nI'm not sure evolution can prove to be a better fit concerning timescale, when compared to the written history of the Bible. I guess it can when it figures in its \"statistical evidence\". The importance of theories and statistical evidence and radiometric dating and all of that vs written history carries different weight with different people. It's a difference in worldviews.\n\n Sure: do we choose to believe one of a large number of conflicting ancient mythologies passed down and embellished through the chinese whispers of oral tradition, or the entire contents of the earth's crust and every photon of light incident upon its surface?\n \n I'm not going to argue with you that one has to subscribe to a substantially different worldview to believe in YEC. But that doesn't automatically convey equal validity. It depends: do you think that belief in something makes it true? Or do you believe that there is an objective, real history that exists regardless of our opinions one way or another? If the former, then I would respectfully disagree, and suggest that there's little point us ever talking again. If the latter, then we can bring weight of evidence to bear. On the one hand, there's the early bible, which we logically know could easily be the end product of innumerable revisions, reinterpretations, reimaginings and editings of what people imagined having happened. In short, an appealing story rather than genuine history. So, how do we decide? We look for corroborating evidence. Does anything back that story up? No. Genetics disagree: we can't be descended from a single human couple. Evidence of human activity disagrees: even the most fecund humanity imaginable could not have produced a population capable of building the structures ancient civilisations left behind. Radioactive isotopes disagree. The sun disagrees. Retroviruses disagree. Fossils disagree. Tectonic movement disagrees. Limestone disagrees. The stars disagree.\n \nThen why did you find it important to claim that they don't have to be?\n\n Ah, I understand the confusion. One of the reasons irreducible complexity of a structure is not a problem for evolution is that the most recent evolutionary step need not have been an increase in complexity. I wasn't trying to say that increasing complexity was never necessary, or implying that increasing complexity itself was a problem for evolution.\n \nEqually, we know that something cannot evolve from nothing.\n\n And just as soon as you can show that has any relevance to the discussion, I'll be happy to spend more time on it.\n \nI'm hypothesising a natural bias that fill a gap that evolution can't explain anyway. It's no worse hypothesis than what sometimes goes on in evolution.\n\n You talked about a 'natural bias' that would stop evolution in its tracks. You're going to have to be more specific about what 'stopping evolution in its tracks' means. Do you mean preventing inheritable variation? Preventing natural selection? Preventing gene flow? What?\n \nYou show a gap to be inexplicable by trying to explain it from an atheist worldview? That's an objective, fair way to do it? So completely unfair and unbiased that ID's different methods of searching add NOTHING??\n\n You show a gap to be inexplicable via natural forces by trying to explain it via natural forces. You can't do it by hypothesising supernatural forces, because that's just meaningless unfalsifiable speculation. ID doesn't have a different method of searching - all it does is give up quicker. That's how it 'detected design' in the eye; that's how it 'detected design' in blood clotting, the immune system - it just gave up looking for natural explanations and assumed design filled the gap.\n \nInitiate was the key word. Show me a link where they say they initiated it.\n\n Already provided above.\n \nHmm, is this question a legitimate \"why isn't everyone it's biggest fan\" or the more condescending \"why am ~I~ not it's biggest fan since I \"don't care much to understand the details of it at all\"? I'll answer as if it's the former, though I suspect it's the latter. :)\n\n Yeah, you were right, it's the latter :)\n \n You know how I said you were sometimes unthinkingly arrogant? Saying things like 'evolution appeals to those who don't care to understand the details' is what I was talking about.\n \nMajor interchangeability is baaaack! Sometimes evolution is natural and undirected, and sometimes it seems to become directed. (by \"nature\"?) Nature doesn't have a mind and it doesn't have a purpose, so it cannot direct anything.\n\n False alarm: General Misunderstanding is still calling the shots!\n \n There's no such thing as 'Natural and undirected'. Drop a rock and tell me how 'undirected' the results are for you.\n \nChurches are not motivated to oppose evolution, the way evolution is motivated to oppose religion. Evolution doesn't get in the way of churches to promote Christ's teachings, to the extent that Christ's teachings get in the way of evolutionists social desires.\n\n Oh come on, marc, you can't possibly expect me to swallow that one. Religion, which locked up astronomers? What atheist social policy was geocentrism getting in the way of, hmm? What makes that farce science's fault?\n \nChrist's teachings (the Bible - the entire word of God) are based on the book of Genesis.\n\n That's your belief, not shared by all christians - and in any case, it's your problem even if it's true.\n \nSo evolution is anti-Biblical? Yet at other times, your interchangeability allows you to say that evolution is not atheistic.\n\n That's not interchangeability. That's your conflation of 'genesis isn't literally true' with 'there is no god'. \n \nAre they equally inappropriate? Is it okay to block one with the heavy hand of government, and wink and nod at the other? \n\n Show me winking and nodding going on, marc. Stop insinuating bad behaviour and show me the evidence. Show me atheism being taught in the science classroom.\n \nSome famous atheists have claimed that it does. From becoming an \"intellectially fullfilled atheist\",\n\n Entailing a release from what moral imperatives, exactly?\n \n to a \"release from sexual mores\".\n\n Entailing a release from what moral imperatives, exactly?\n \n The only contribution evolutionary theory makes in these areas is to allow us to understand that regardless of whether it represents an intended purpose, morality empirically achieves something. Evolution entails the survival of that which works - so we know that morals are part of a working system. We can analyse them in that context, understand why they work, what they contribute. And this is all way off topic.\n \nWhat it often does is suggest a worship of the earth, which would explain the double standard between the scientific method being applied to ID vs global warming. \n\n There's no double standard. There's one standard, which ID fails to measure up against. Frankly, I don't see the point in indulging your theories about double standards until you can show that ID would pass 'correct' standards.\n \nUh, I didn't say anything about \"worthless non science\". But I'll leave the strawmen accusations to you and yours. It's up to the reader to decide who's actually making them.\n\n Yes, so let's give them a chance to examine what you actually said, all over again:\n \nThe main reason it is elegant and compelling is because it contains a release from religious responsibility. That's the face of human nature that make it all too easy to accept without realizing that a controversy even exists, and it does exist. If it didn't, evolutionists wouldn't be afraid of challenges.\n\n See? In perfectly straightforward terms, you claimed that there is a genuine scientific controversy, implying that ID is genuine, valid science. You then said that you know this to be true because if there weren't a genuine scientific controversy - if ID wasn't genuine, valid science - evolutionists wouldn't be afraid of it; they wouldn't be trying to block it from being taught in science class.\n \n No strawmen here, just your dreadful logic.\n \nIf ID is not science, human caused global warming study is equally not science. Double standard confirmed.\n\n What on earth are you talking about? You haven't done anything to show that the global warming material lacks scientific veracity. \n \nAre other branches of science held to equal rigorous standards as is ID?\n\n Yes.\n \nAs I said before, I can't come up with anything persuasive and new for ID. Everything on it has been steamrolled by lots of evolutionists in publicly funded institutions. But it is legitimate to hold other branches of science to the same standard as ID is held to.\n\n And they are. Happy?",

   "You do this an awful lot, marc; you ought to be aware that simply repeating your opponent's arguments substituting different words doesn't guarantee the result will be meaningful. \n\n \n It does when the pot calls the kettle black, as you do an awful lot. That time, you even went far beyond the usual pot-calling-the-kettle-black routine. You secretly noted a weakness in your argument, then proclaim that that weakness should be watched for in MY argument, as if that somehow releases you from having that problem. \n \n You said; \n \n \nAs an aside I invite readers to observe, going forward, how these issues are often treated as interchangeable by those advocating ID in the classroom. \n\n \n I can't think of another subject on this planet that has the interchangeability that evolution does. \n \n Dawkins;\n \n Darwin [with evolution] made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. \n\n \n Miller;\n \n Only those who embrace the scientific reality of evolution are adequately prepared to give God the credit and power he truly deserves. \n\n \n What makes it really interchangeable is the fact that Dawkins followers will freely quote what Miller said if it suits their argument, and Miller followers will freely quote what Dawkins said if it suits their argument. Then there's the word definition switches.......oh well, we've been through it all before. \n \n \n \nMoreover, it's like holding up a large sign saying \"I have absolutely no way to refute what's just been said, so I'll try to deflect attention away from it.\" \n\n \n Here's your sign. :p\n \n \n Originally posted by marc9000] 1)In ID, a design inference is a generic argument for identifying the effects of intelligence regardless of the intelligence's identification or particular characteristics, and regardless of where, when, how or why the intelligence acts. \n\n \n \nSure - which is one of the reasons it fails. It's logically impossible to recognise the effects of a force with no consistent or definable characteristics. \n\n \n Untrue. It all has to do with what we know about design (since we are designers) - and the related specification and information and necessity and other things that you aren't interested in. It's not complete yet, but you demand it to be. While giving evolution a free pass on origins. \n \n \nIncorrect. Rather, that's what archaeology does: recognises the hallmarks of a specific kind of intelligent agent. ID is stuck with number 1.\n\n \n I agree. I thought a big part of your argument was that ID looks for hallmarks of the Republican Christian God. I'm relieved. \n \n \nThe principle religious motivation behind the ID movement is not to find anything at all, merely to foster the illusion of scientific controversy in an attempt to justify meddling with the only forum of learning in which verifiability trumps fervour of belief. \n\n \n The principle religious motivation? Looks like word games - what percentage of the ID movement is controlled by the \"principle religious motivation\"? A big one? A small one? Proof? \n \n The principle atheist motivation of evolution is not to find anything at all, merely to foster the illusion of scientific discovery in an attempt to justify godless social engineering. \n \n My proof is reviews of recent best selling books by Dawkins, Stenger, Harris, Dennett, Hitchens, Huberman, Mills, Sagan, Ricker, etc etc. Not near as much content about evolution as about social engineering. But the worldview of evolutionism is the foundation. \n \n \nID is condemned on a scientific level because it's chock full of faulty reasoning and invalid results. It's contemptible on a political level because it's trying to sidestep the peer review process and wriggle its way into the science classroom on false pretenses. You're conflating seperate issues again.\n\n \n A \"peer review\" process isn't mentioned in the US Constitution, and probably not in your countries founding either, because decisions about what is scientific, aren't necessarily scientific! They should be done by people review, not special interest review. \n \n \nID isn't being shouted down. It has been scientifically refuted. Normally that's the end of the matter with failed hypotheses. Things get ugly because ID's religious political agenda has forced scientists and educators to step in to defend the integrity of science in the classroom. \n\n \n Things get ugly because atheism's political agenda has found it's way into thinly disguised \"science\" books. \"The Blind Watchmaker\" is one of many examples. \n \n \nIf you want to see who's really trying to shout down whom, I invite you to inspect our own discussions. \n\n \n That's a fantastic idea! Without researching them, I think it's safe to say that every single discussion that you and I have had (excluding the formal debate since its structure prohibited it) has resulted in you or one of your allies getting the last word on me every time. Check it out and correct me if I'm wrong. Getting the last word is a big part of \"shouting down\". \n \n \nWho is trying to make the argument about the science, and who keeps trying to drag the issue away from science and into a tangle of moral and social strawmen? \n\n \n Excellent question, that would be YOU. \n \n \nOriginally posted by Peeling] The principle religious motivation behind the ID movement is not to find anything at all, merely to foster the illusion of scientific controversy in an attempt to justify meddling with the only forum of learning in which verifiability trumps fervour of belief.\n\n \n \nOriginally posted by Peeling] The ID movement itself is not science; it's a PR exercise. That's the reality of what it is, as affirmed by those who organise and sponsor it. The work the ID movement has produced in service of that PR exercise is either bad science or not science at all depending upon how charitable you feel like being. \n\n \n Whenever I say anything about what scientific thing ID could do, you reply with the above, or something similar. So when ~I~ say something about the science, ~YOU~ drag in the tangle of moral and social strawmen, with your \"PR exercise\" comments, etc. \n \n \n \nEvidence? Or are we still just assuming the existence of other naughty children? \n\n \n I listed the evidence next, and you claimed you can't understand what I'm talking about, then blamed it on me. \n \n \nThe way you phrase questions, sometimes... I can't tell if it's just imprecise use of language or evidence that you don't fully grasp what you're talking about. \n\n \n \nWe don't 'test and repeat' Sociobiology 'by the scientific method'. \n\n \n Then sociobology is not science! Yet it is taught in universities, despite the controversy! \n \n http://peace.saumag.edu/faculty/Kardas/Courses/GPWeiten/C1Intro/Sociobiology.html\n \n University of Maryland? Harvard? E.O. Wilson, a controversial evolutionist? He gets to play around universities with it all he wants it seems. Why doesn't Dembski / Behe get the same privilige with ID? \n \n \nThe scientific method involves testable repeatable results. Do sociobiologists construct theorems on the basis of testable, repeatable results? Do they actively seek to falsify those results rather than only ever looking for confirmatory evidence? If so, then they're performing good science. \n\n \n Whoops - looks like they don't! From the above link;\n \n \nHe [Wilson] and sociobiology have been mired in the kind of controversy described above since the publication of that text. \n\n \n Looks like some \"sciences\" have controversy within the university, and some are kept out! The scientific-method-police don't seem to be doing a very good job. \n \n \nDo you understand? Something like 'sociobiology' counts as good science if it consists of a body of work produced by people applying scientific methods rigorously. \n\n \n And if ID consists of a body of work that you and an established special interest don't like, then its not good science? \n \n \nBefore you get all excited, no: ID does not count as an attempt to falsify evolutionary results. You don't falsify a theory by coming up with an alternative one and only ever looking for confirmatory evidence of that instead. Rather, you make strong predictions based on the theory you have, and find ways to test those predictions. \n\n \n You don't falsify a theory by looking at something different that may actually falsify it? \n \n \nThat's actually a further problem with ID: it's impossible to construct a test to falsify it, because ID doesn't actually require any given biological feature to be the product of design. It makes no predictions. It can - as it has done for hundreds of years now - always fall back upon the next convenient biological feature. \n\n \n Do classes on sociobiology do those things? Classes on \"Transforming the Global environment? \n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000 How about a recent one that's not on the list; Global warming? Can it be tested and repeated that human activity is causing it? It looks like it is in science classes right now.\n \"Transforming the Global Environment\"? A SCIENCE class? Humans can transform the global enviornment? This is the scientific method, while ID is not? \n\n \n \nAgain, a really weird turn of phrase. If the class is teaching results gained by the application of the scientific method, that's fine by me. \n\n \n But if they're teaching that global warming is caused by human activity, with no indication that they're rigourously using the scientific method, you're not paying much attention? The only policing of the scientific method is done by evolutionists against creationists/ID proponents? \n \n \n \nNo, marc, you're weren't saying that. Allow me to remind you of what you actually said:\n \n See? You explicitly said that you are inferring that ID does have enough substance to be considered science, because only one of the two scenarios above could be true.\n \n What you're doing now is changing your tune. Now you're saying that both 1 and 2 could be true: ID isn't proper science and it's a threat to beliefs established in evolution. But 1 makes 2 irrelevant: if ID isn't good science it has no place in the classroom. End of story. \n\n \n I never strongly said it could be only one. The bottom line is, ID is held to different standards than are several other branches of science. \n \n \nI'm not even sure what we're talking about here. If it's Dawkin's books again, you're still missing the point. Evolutionary theory is scientifically robust. ID is not. That's what makes ID the naughty child in this analogy. What Dawkins or Behe believes philosophically is irrelevant. \n\n \n How about Phillip Johnson? Though you're still not specific, it appears that you attribute everything he says as the sole definition of ID. Dawkins atheism is his personal opinion, and Johnson's views of what ID should be is the ENTIRE definition of ID? \n \n \nYou haven't made any progress towards showing double standards. All you've done is present a big list of sciences and made vague insinuations about their validity, with nothing to back you up. And I think my analogy has done its job just fine. \n\n \n Then we have to agree to disagree on that.\n \n \n Originally posted by marc9000] ID can easily show that it applies the scientific method in some ways. \n\n \n \nOr so you assume. You're wrong. ID is not falsifiable, even in principle, so it cannot perform the most fundamental task required of any science: make firm predictions that can be tested. Nor does it attempt to ensure that a new explanation is even needed for a phenomenon before inventing one. \n\n \n Would that be your formal (judged) debate resolution? \"ID cannot show application of the scientific method in any way.\" \n \n I'll do the negative on it. \n \n \n Originally posted by Peeling] The ID movement itself is not science; it's a PR exercise. That's the reality of what it is, as affirmed by those who organise and sponsor it. \n\n \n \n Originally posted by marc9000] You keep claiming that, but you never reference it. \n\n \n \n \nPresumably you missed it the last few times. The last link there is particularly illuminating. \n\n \n Hopelessly vague, how much time should I spend rooting through websites to find what you claim to have found? Specifics please, quotes from those who actually organizes and sponsor it. The last link isn't even an ID website. \n \n \nNo, in other words \"the cut and thrust of peer review.\" Where ID falls flat on its face. Stop trying to dress that up as some kind of underserved mugging; if you aren't prepared to understand and defend ID on a scientific level you aren't equipped to decide that it is being unfairly treated. \n\n \n So if I can't overcome the huge special interest that condemns ID, I'm not equipped to ask questions about the scientific validity of global warming or other questionable \"sciences\"? Not much on free speech, are you? \n \n \n \nAbsolutely, and that's because it's wrongly perceived as a 'freedom thing'. There's no such thing as the 'freedom' to be taught something of no scientific merit in a science class.\n\n \n So you're saying what is taught in schools is a scientific decision, not a political one? \n \n Should abortion decisions be made by science, not politics? After all, it's a medical science right? How do we decide what is a scientific decision vs a political one? \n \n You're considering \"no scientific merit\" to be an objective conclusion. It's not, since the scientific community has proven itself to be a very questionable judge of what is science and what is not. The scientific community is proven to have a worldview bias. \n \n \nNo, marc, that's just your endless, relentless conflation of seperate issues. Evolution is not founded on abiogenesis, it is founded on the plain fact of common descent and the observable ongoing process It is an explanation for something that has unquestionably happened. I think I've made that clear enough to you on enough occasions now. \n\n \n Yes you have, and as I said before, everything that can be said about ID has been said and there's nothing new I can come up with for ID. Evolutions main claim to being science is all the detail and variety involved in the common descent process. Evolution seems to have a bigger variety of detail than ID does. That's about it. \n \n \nEvolution doesn't speak to the origin of first life, so that point is irrelevant. And repeating the 'theory in crisis' mantra, while undoubtedly comforting, starts to wear a little thin after a couple of hundred years of ever-increasing knowledge, accuracy and predictive capacity. \n\n \n It's like a house without a foundation. We can constantly improve the windows, gutters, doors, roof, electric, plumbing etc. But they're all pretty unstable and useless without a foundation. \n \n \nSure: do we choose to believe one of a large number of conflicting ancient mythologies passed down and embellished through the chinese whispers of oral tradition, or the entire contents of the earth's crust and every photon of light incident upon its surface?\n \n I'm not going to argue with you that one has to subscribe to a substantially different worldview to believe in YEC. But that doesn't automatically convey equal validity. It depends: do you think that belief in something makes it true? Or do you believe that there is an objective, real history that exists regardless of our opinions one way or another? \n\n \n It is the latter of course, but it's important to consider a large variety of evidence. Evidence that may not be included in science. Science is not the only source of knowledge. \n \n \nIf the former, then I would respectfully disagree, and suggest that there's little point us ever talking again. If the latter, then we can bring weight of evidence to bear. On the one hand, there's the early bible, which we logically know could easily be the end product of innumerable revisions, reinterpretations, reimaginings and editings of what people imagined having happened. In short, an appealing story rather than genuine history. So, how do we decide? We look for corroborating evidence. \n\n \n We logically know that there's a big difference in how the Bible reaches us vs the way modern science reaches us. The original English version of the Bible, was very painstakingly and meticulously translated, from the well preserved original manuscripts. You can read about it here Compare that to the way that one of the biggest modern scientific marvels, the Apollo moon flights, were documented. \n \n One giant blunder for mankind\n \n The Bible says we aren't perfect. The Bible has some pretty good suggestions for managing money, applicable today. The Bible has some pretty good moral suggestions, behavior standards, all applicable today. The Bible gives us a version of origins, not a complete understanding, just the basics. \n \n I guess you could say I apply the scientific method to the Bible. If so much of it is obviously right, and evolution is clueless about origins, I hypothesize that the Bible's account of creation may very well be right. \n \n \nDoes anything back that story up? No. Genetics disagree: we can't be descended from a single human couple. Evidence of human activity disagrees: even the most fecund humanity imaginable could not have produced a population capable of building the structures ancient civilisations left behind. \n\n \n Is that a bigger strength for your position or mine? Does science have an explanation for how those structures came to be? \n \n \nRadioactive isotopes disagree. The sun disagrees. Retroviruses disagree. Fossils disagree. Tectonic movement disagrees. Limestone disagrees. The stars disagree. \n\n \n A worldview difference, yes. Do you consult the sun and the stars directly, or do you rely on others to report their findings to you?",

Again (I have to keep pointing it out because you never address it) the books by Harris/Dawkins and countless others are proof of it. Throughout these forums, it is often said and implied that creation /ID appeals to those who don't understand the details of evolution. I showed the link of my claims that evolutionists often don't show much understanding of evolution, because they are so busy personally insulting creationists. You never addressed it at all. They are showing a feeling of superiority towards creationists, a big part of arrogance. It's in the definition of arrogance.

And this is all way off topic. \n\n \n So evolution can be about godless morals? This isn't way off topic at all!\n \n \nThere's no double standard. There's one standard, which ID fails to measure up against. Frankly, I don't see the point in indulging your theories about double standards until you can show that ID would pass 'correct' standards. \n\n \n Suppose that I concede that ID doesn't pass correct standards. Do I then not have the right to question the fact that global warming doesn't pass correct standards? Because I can't overcome the huge special interest that attacks ID, I have to give a free pass to a worship of the earth that is global warming? \n \n You don't see the point in indulging my theories about double standards because you can't. End of story. \n \n \n \nYes, so let's give them a chance to examine what you actually said, all over again:\n \n See? In perfectly straightforward terms, you claimed that there is a genuine scientific controversy, implying that ID is genuine, valid science. You then said that you know this to be true because if there weren't a genuine scientific controversy - if ID wasn't genuine, valid science - evolutionists wouldn't be afraid of it; they wouldn't be trying to block it from being taught in science class.\n \n No strawmen here, just your dreadful logic.\n\n \n Not as dreadful as your logic. Because I can't show ID to be science, I have no right to question the validity of man made global warming as science. Because ID is not science, evolutionists get a free pass on making anything else they want to be science, no matter how ridiculous it is. \n \n \nWhat on earth are you talking about? You haven't done anything to show that the global warming material lacks scientific veracity. \n\n \n Not global warmings existence, global warmings CAUSE. Does it come as a shock to you that the cause of global warming is controversial? \n \n http://www.canadafreepress.com/2007/global-warming020507.htm\n \n There was also a piece of a formal debate about it on these forums. It was so lopsided, the global-warming-is-caused-by-man advocate fled the debate halfway through. \n \n \n \n Originally posted by marc9000] As I said before, I can't come up with anything persuasive and new for ID. Everything on it has been steamrolled by lots of evolutionists in publicly funded institutions. But it is legitimate to hold other branches of science to the same standard as ID is held to. \n\n \n \nAnd they are. Happy?\n\n \n No, because evidence says otherwise. From the link above;\n \n \n \nSo why is it that when scientists who have studied the Global Warming phenomenon for years say that humans are not the cause nobody listens? Why does no one acknowledge that the Emperor has no clothes on?\n Believe it or not, Global Warming is not due to human contribution of Carbon Dioxide (CO2). This in fact is the greatest deception in the history of science. We are wasting time, energy and trillions of dollars while creating unnecessary fear and consternation over an issue with no scientific justification. \n\n \n Nobody listens - it is the greatest deception in the history of science - because the only branch of science that has appointed itself the policeman of the scientific method has double standards. The political implications in the purposeless suggestions of evolution mesh with the politics of global warming. Here are 5 suggestions of what needs to be done to combat global warming;\n \n 1. Reduce the industrialized world's carbon footprint 80 percent by 2050. \n 2. Prevent the projected 3 billion increase in human population over the next 30 years and actually reduce population by 2110 without famine, disease or war while preserving human dignity. \n 3. Revise the scientific method so that it better balances the goal of discovery with moral considerations and precaution. \n 4. Switch our economy to sustainable energy: solar, wind, hydro. \n 5. Make that economy one in which happiness and success do not require increased consumption.\n \n http://www.alternet.org/environment/96519/5_steps_to_an_environmental_revolution/\n \n This can't be done under the current US Constitution. Pay close attention to number 5. It can't really even be done in socialism where people might have the slightest input in \"life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. It can only be done one way, under communism.",

   "It may not be scientific to begin at step two or step three. \n\n \n How many times do you have to hear it? I'll write it creationist so you might understand. THE TOE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT ORIGINS. IN FACT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE LIFE CAME FROM, BECAUSE THE TOE DESCRIBES HOW LIFE HAS AND IS CHANGING OVER TIME. NO MORE!\n \n \nThings like future proof of a young earth - evolution needs billons of years. \n\n \n No, it doesn't... See bacteria...\n \n \nOr proof of severe weather conditions that would destroy the evolutionary process. Life on earth dies completely if it gets out of a fairly narrow temperature range, any time during those billions of years. \n\n \n Wrong, see hydrothermic vents, extremophile bacteria and cave salamanders.\n \n \nEvolution is all about godlessness, yet it's not atheistic. I see.\n\n \n Oh for the love of heaven. EVOLUTION SAYS NOTHING ABOUT GOD. NOTHING AT ALL. IT PASSES NO COMMENT, IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM ON THE EXISTENCE OR NON-EXISTENCE OF ANY FORM OF SUPERNATURAL BEING.\n \n \nID gives up looking for natural explanations, evolution gives up looking for supernatural ones. ID hypothesizes supernatural, evolution hypothesizes natural origins. \n\n \n Are you trying to make the case why it shouldn't be in science class? Because you've just made it.\n \n \nYou know that there's no branch of science that is more smug and arrogant than evolution.\n \n \n Only because it uses hard facts to puncture the arrogant aura you creationists like to surround yourselves with. I believe you're projecting again...\n \n \nAgain (I have to keep pointing it out because you never address it) the books by Harris/Dawkins and countless others are proof of it. Throughout these forums, it is often said and implied that creation /ID appeals to those who don't understand the details of evolution.\n \n \n I wonder why? Could it be because you keep arguing the same vapid dreck without attempting to understand why it gets rejected? Ascribing said rejection to conspiracy or to evil godlessness? Or maybe because many of your (pl) arguments show that you really don't understand the principles behind the TOE? Or maybe all of the above...\n \n \nI showed the link of my claims that evolutionists often don't show much understanding of evolution, because they are so busy personally insulting creationists.\n\n \n You've got to laugh, or the stupid burns you to death....\n \n \nThey are showing a feeling of superiority towards creationists, a big part of arrogance.\n\n \n Actually we merely respond in kind. I know that's not the right thing to do, but it gives you a slice of the perspective we put up with.\n \n \nAs is becoming clear in this discussion, evolutionists seem to be the ONLY scientists who appoint themselves the superiority necessary to police the scientific method. And their feeling of superiority is greater than their actual superiority. \n\n \n Ignoring the last line ad hom, what do you mean? Every field of science is best understood by those who've studied it the longest, but there's no controling authority (except for ethics). Science is open to anyone who has something sensible and meaningful to contribute (and that doesn't include tired, old, much repeated lies by those terrified that thier world will collapse if it hits reality).\n \n \nTell me who directed it. \n\n \n The laws of physics in the case of the rock, the laws of chemistry in the case of nature (sometimes physics gets involved in that too, but speciation is at it's heart a biochemical phenomenon).\n \n \nChurches are not locking up astronomers today! emoticon_idea\n\n \n No, but I know several that would like to, along with anyone else not willing to peddle thier waffle.\n \n \nAtheism is becoming a worship of the earth. \n\n \n You what? Atheists don't worship anything! Do you understand the concept at all? I begin to suspect you can't cope with the idea of someone not bowing down to a higher power. Gaia theory is just another New Age fad, and is a religion of sorts.\n \n \nSo evolution can be about godless morals?\n\n \n The TOE can suggest why we have morals yes... Problem?\n \n \nSuppose that I concede that ID doesn't pass correct standards. Do I then not have the right to question the fact that global warming doesn't pass correct standards? Because I can't overcome the huge special interest that attacks ID, I have to give a free pass to a worship of the earth that is global warming? \n\n \n You always have the right to question. Just think of some real questions! Stop saying things that you've already been told about! Climate change is a fact. I'm still not 100% sure that it's all our fault, but the fact is that the climate is shifting. I don't know what effect that will have, but it won't just go away if we ignore it.\n \n \nNot as dreadful as your logic. Because I can't show ID to be science, I have no right to question the validity of man made global warming as science.\n\n \n You have the right to question. Just don't expect stupid questions to be given serious creedence.\n \n \nBecause ID is not science, evolutionists get a free pass on making anything else they want to be science, no matter how ridiculous it is. \n\n \n You really believe in the EAC don't you! You're convinced there's a cabal of black caped men out there directing the course of science to destroy religion! I don't know whether to laugh or cry. Where are these 'evolutionists' who dictate what is science then?\n \n \nNot global warmings existence, global warmings CAUSE. Does it come as a shock to you that the cause of global warming is controversial? \n\n \n No, but then I don't know how often you get to read proper scientific literature.\n \n \n \nNobody listens - it is the greatest deception in the history of science \n\n \n I thought that was evolution?\n \n \nbecause the only branch of science that has appointed itself the policeman of the scientific method has double standards.\n\n \n Yeah, all those evil met office employees...\n \n \nThe political implications in the purposeless suggestions of evolution mesh with the politics of global warming. \n\n \n What on earth are you on about? Are you trying to link nihilism and evolution again? You've already been thrashed on that one.\n \n \nHere are 5 suggestions of what needs to be done to combat global warming;\n \n 1. Reduce the industrialized world's carbon footprint 80 percent by 2050. \n\n \n Difficult, but not impossible...\n \n \n2. Prevent the projected 3 billion increase in human population over the next 30 years and actually reduce population by 2110 without famine, disease or war while preserving human dignity. \n\n \n Might happen anyway if places like India and China get thier populations under control, and if Africa can be helped out of poverty.\n \n \n3. Revise the scientific method so that it better balances the goal of discovery with moral considerations and precaution. \n\n \n What's that got to do with carbon emissions?\n \n \n4. Switch our economy to sustainable energy: solar, wind, hydro. \n\n \n I think you mean power production rather than economy, but I'd only worry about the first and last. Wind appears to be a bit of a bust.\n \n \n5. Make that economy one in which happiness and success do not require increased consumption.\n\n \n That's going to be a real kicker. But it's also not impossible.\n \n \nThis can't be done under the current US Constitution.\n\n \n So you're prepared to risk the planet to preserve the constitution. Aren't you a good little patriot!\n \n \nPay close attention to number 5. It can't really even be done in socialism where people might have the slightest input in \"life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.\n\n \n Amazing, a godly man demanding the right to mass consumtion. What happened to 'Lay your treasures upon the Earth' and 'It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven'?\n \n \nIt can only be done one way, under communism.\n \n \n That's it Marc!

In both my links of lists of sciences from post #2, the science of evolution doesn't appear. Is it a combination of sciences from those lists, or was it a later addition, too late to make those lists? \n \n If evolution has a religious (non-religious) motivation, and it obviously does to at least some degree, then I think it's common sense that someone besides the scientific community should determine if it deserves to be mentioned in science classrooms, especially if that decision has been made recently. (last few decades) \n \n \nIndeed, latterly you seem to have rather lost interest, preferring instead to use your presumption that ID is valid - and thus unfairly, politically hindered - as a springboard to launch into criticism of climatology. \n\n \n You may be confusing my \"losing interest\" with my being sidetracked with your accusations of arrogance and interchangeability. I see I demolished them thoroughly enough to keep you from bringing them up in this post - hopefully it will stay that way. \n \n Some credentialed people (however small their numbers are) believe that ID does have scientific merit.

Similarly, evolutionary theory attempts to explain the fact of common descent: life's evident history of changing, adapting and speciating. \n\n \n The existence of the first life forms aren't as simple as the apple in the tree. That the apple is there in one form that everyone agrees on is not the same as the differences in worldviews concerning the first life forms. That the apple is there cannot be wrong. If a common designer created different kinds of life immediately, common descent is wrong. It's not necessarily His fault if His method is mistaken as godless common descent. \n \n \n \nReplacing Peer Review with People's Review\n \n I can think of few better counterarguments to the notion that such a move would improve scientific objectivity than this discussion.\n\n \n I can't either, but in a different way. emoticon_xangel If evolution has any motivation, however small, of anti religion driving it, determinations of its scientific objectivity should go beyond any one special interest. \n \n \n \nGlobal Warming\n \n Big, fat, juicy red herring it may be, but since you're determined not to talk about ID we may as well talk about something.\n\n \n Dictionary.com has definitions for your term (red herring) and my term (double standard) Let's look at them together;\n \n \nRed herring; \"something intended to divert attention from the real problem or matter at hand; a misleading clue. \" \n \n Double standard; \"any code or set of principles containing different provisions for one group of people than for another,\" \n\n \n You referred me to the scientific method. It's \"a code or set of principles\" is it not? You use the scientific method as a BASIS for determining ID as not being scientific. It's the only basis you have, right? It's not a red herring to question why this basis may be disregarded concerning other sciences. It raises the question that there may be other motives for determining that ID is not science, over and above a basic desire to apply the scientific method, if the scientific method is not applied to some other branches of science. Why are they less important? \n \n \n \nI don't personally know enough about the science underpinning climatology to judge its validity. You've presented some links that are highly critical of it - fair enough. They don't actually contain any science, but I'm not going to presume there isn't any to be found. I may take an interest now that the ID/evolution forum has fallen quiet. \n\n \n Considering how much and how cleverly it is referred to in the news, one thing is for sure - IT IS A PR CAMPAIGN THAT DWARFS ANY PR CAMPAIGN PUT FORWARD BY ID PROPONENTS.\n \n On the 9-7 ABC evening news, there is commentary about how the increase in US hurricane activity can definitely be attributed to global warming. On the 9-8 ABC evening news, there is commentary about how increase in ragweed and other allergy promoting growth on earth can definitely be attributed to global warming. In both cases, the stern and sad faced newsman never says that an increase in LRRP (license, regulate, restrict, prohibit) by elitists could solve the problem, but it's clearly implied. \n \n With the worldview differences of a God/ purposeful life vs. a evolutionary/ purposeless life, it only makes sense that there are differences in how much LLRP should be imposed on us by powerful men or groups of men. These men are held in entirely different regard depending on ones worldview. They are GODS to some, and they are not gods to others. \n \n \nI do find it ironic that after (wrongly) lambasting evolution for entailing a release from moral or social responsibilities, you in almost the next breath choose beliefs that release you from any sense of responsibility for looking after the world in which you live, and allow you to wallow in consumption guilt-free. \n\n \n You're exaggerating on both counts. I never claimed evolution completely releases its followers from moral/social responsibilities, but it gives them a major political shift. It takes them away from unchanging scripture, and places them in the hands of ever changing earthly leaders - earthly gods, that some of us don't worship. \n \n Concerning \"responsibility for looking after the world in which you live\", please remember that I live in the US, a country with one of the most, if not THE most, powerful environmental lobbies in the world. Anyone in the US without their head in the sand sees it as something to fear. For example, the instability and political problems involving foreign oil is one of the greatest US economic concerns, yet we have one political party that is opposed to increased domestic oil exploration, simply because that party is controlled by environmental interests. \n \n \nThe difference between you and me is, I won't draw any silly inferences from that as regards the status of the underlying science. You might be right, you might be wrong. Equally, the fact that holier-than-thou ecologists might be sating their appetite for preachiness, or eco-companies might be simultaneously driving and cashing in on a consumer fad, or politicians might be furthering their careers by jumping on the bandwagon, doesn't prejudice my view of the science supporting human influence on climate change. \n\n \n Is there really any testable, repeatable, falsifiable science that supports it at all? Or is it exploratory and speculative - comparable to ID? Or maybe far worse than ID? \n \n \nA couple of points you tried to make are worth quoting at this point:\n \n If you concede that ID doesn't pass correct standards, the discussion's over, because the discussion is about whether ID belongs in the science classroom. If ID doesn't pass correct standards, then it's not a question of 'overcoming a huge special interest'. \n\n \n I'm still perplexed by the fact that evolution doesn't appear on some science lists. I'm wondering to what extent evolution is considered science. Is it considered science in the special-interest education community to a greater extent than the overall scientific community? In the overall scientific community to a greater extent than the general public who pays the bills? \n \n \nOf course you can question the validity of the science behind man-made global warming. We can go through the evidence together if you like and see where it takes us. What I won't go along with is a repeat of the stunt you pulled with ID: ignore the science and base a decision upon prejudices concerning the real or imagined political manoeuvrings that surround it.\n\n \n It's been gone through an awful lot on 4forums. In addition to the unfinished formal debate that I referenced earlier, it's been the subject of many discussions in the environmental forum. Nowhere here has man-made-global-warming, (anthropogenic global warming) been clearly shown to be good science, or shown to be held to the standards that ID is held to. If you want to get into it again, it needs to be kept basic to keep me involved, I don't have the time nor interest to keep up with too much detail. You decide if it should be in this thread or a new one. Then we can compare the intensities we see of real and imagined prejudices in anthropogenic global warming, evolution, and ID. Remember, there is a huge difference in anthropogenic global warming vs natural global warming. \n \n \nExtant Misapprehensions\n \n 1. \"We don't 'test and repeat' Sociobiology 'by the scientific method'. \"\n \n What I meant by this is that your turn of phrase was inept, not that Sociobiology is unscientific. It's like talking about 'the internets'. Rather, theories are tested, results are repeated, and that is the scientific method.\n\n \n You've not been very convincing that they're being equally applied among all sciences. \n \n \n \n\n 2. \"There's no such thing as 'Natural and undirected'. Drop a rock and tell me how 'undirected' the results are for you. \"\n \n 'Directed' does not necessarily imply a guiding intelligence. A rock formation can 'direct' a stream of water. Environmental pressures 'direct' evolution. I was calling attention to the false duality of 'intelligently guided' vs 'random'. A falling rock is not intelligently guided but it is naturally directed. It does not fly off in a random direction.\n\n \n \"Intelligently guided vs random\" may not be the best way to describe the difference, because it allows evolutionists to promote nature as a director, somehow elevating it beyond random. There is actually little difference between \"random\" and \"without guiding intelligence\".",

   "I enjoy going at it with you and I appreciate your time. \n\n Likewise :) That's actually the reason I let the 'arrogance' bit drop: it was needlessly personal and inappropriate, and I apologise for bringing it up in the first place.\n \nCan you show evidence that evolution &#8220;deserves to be mentioned in science classrooms?\"\n\n Yes, I can as it happens. If you want to explore evolution's scientific credentials I'm happy to do so, but they're not relevant here. As we already tacitly agreed, ID must stand or fall on its own merits.\n \n Now, if it's OK with you I'm going to continue the format I introduced above, with a minimum of direct quotes bogging things down.\n \n Scientists deciding what counts as science\n \n Scientists are not robots. They have personalities, they have egos - they're human beings. They are, however, highly trained human beings and accomplished critical thinkers, whose reputation and livelihood depends upon adhering to the standards by which they judge others. The scientific method is specifically designed to minimise the influence of personal bias by demanding rigorous justification and repeatability*. That crucial fact makes peer review - not perfect, but ultimately self-correcting. \n \n What you want to do is remove the responsibility for deciding what counts as science from those who must live by its rules, and place it in the hands of - who exactly? And how and to whom must they justify their decisions? We are drawn inexorably back to the status quo, lest we appoint as arbiter some person or group whose loyalty is not to the integrity of science.\n \n Creationist conflation of issues regarding ID\n \n At no point here have you ever denied, let alone demolished my observations to this effect :) I didn't mention it in my last post because, as I said at the time, you've rendered the whole subject moot by refusing to discuss the science. \n \n I agree that some credentialed people believe in ID. Their job is to convince their peers, by reasoned argument and meaningful, reproducible results, that their belief is justified rather than merely wishful thinking. Nobody is saying they shouldn't try to do that. Whether their efforts so far deserve representation in the science classroom, however, is an entirely seperate issue, and creationist activists and apologists do not treat it as such. The expulsion of ID from the classroom is spun as ID being 'shouted down', as unfair treatment, as censorship of ideas, when in fact the Discovery Institute is freely publishing its XXX off (by its own choice, targeting the layman rather than their peers). There is a concerted ongoing effort to conflate the issues facing ID and misrepresent them to the public as a single 'freedom' issue.\n \n The Foundations of Evolution, Part II\n \n The existence of worldviews that deny common descent does not make the slightest difference to the fact that common descent is the foundation for the theory of evolution. \n \n Analogously, we can determine that two bullets from two murders were fired from the same gun - and reconstruct events accordingly - purely by analysing the bullets. What you're saying is \"Well, my worldview compels me to believe that those two murders were unrelated, so unless you can produce the gun your version of events is without foundation.\" \n \n The Red Herring of Anthropogenic Global Warming\n \n This thread was entitled 'Difficulties with Design', not 'Concerns with Climatology' (or 'Problems with Porn', for that matter). It outlines a scientific case against the work produced by ID researchers thus far. The political and scientific status of anthropogenic global warming is utterly irrelevant to that argument. If global warming does represent a transgression of scientific integrity - and I reiterate that I'm presently in no position to pass judgement - that is obviously a bad thing.\n \n And bad things like the politicization of science do happen. If all this is an attempt to establish a precedent, we don't need to go rummaging around in global warming to do so. Remember Galileo? :) I'm right there with you: when politics gets in the way of advancing our scientific knowledge, that's bad. Which is precisely why I'm opposed to the ID movement's stated agenda.\n \n I'm happy to do research and compare notes on the subject of global warming. It would certainly make a refreshing change if nothing else. But I'm not prepared to do so on the premise that what we find in any way decides the issue of ID.\n \n The False Duality of Intelligence Versus Randomness\n \n&#8220;Intelligently guided vs random&#8221; may not be the best way to describe the difference, because it allows evolutionists to promote nature as a director, somehow elevating it beyond random. There is actually little difference between &#8220;random&#8221; and &#8220;without guiding intelligence&#8221;.\n\n Uh huh. So the natural forces responsible for the symmetry of a snowflake are 'little different' from the completely random accretion of ice molecules? The gravity that holds our solar system together produces results 'little different' from Brownian movement of a soup of particles? I rather think not :)\n \n &#8220;Intelligently guided vs random&#8221; is not the best way to describe the difference because it's not true. But it does make good creationist PR. It helps pre-empt rational consideration of the facts and the theory by inducing a gut-level aversion. The untruth of \"Intelligently guided vs random\" is propagated to prevent theists from becoming theistic evolutionists; it's part of an attempt by a (quite recently emerged) minority of theists to falsely polarise the issue, to gain moderate converts by denying the existence of a middle ground. You're either with us or against us. If you're not part of the solution you're part of the problem.\n \n *Repeatability is a term often misused by critics of science. If science must be repeatable, the argument goes, and we can't repeat (say) the speciation of humans and chimps from a common ancestor, then that theory is not scientific. But that's not what it means for science to be repeatable. It means that someone else must be able to follow the documented procedures by which the original author achieved his results, and by doing so repeat those results.",

   "Now, if it's OK with you I'm going to continue the format I introduced above, with a minimum of direct quotes bogging things down. \n\n \n It's OK, but you're doing that a lot - I can't help but wonder if you're not having some problems addressing some of my direct quotes. emoticon_xangel\n \n \n \nScientists deciding what counts as science\n \n Scientists are not robots. They have personalities, they have egos - they're human beings. They are, however, highly trained human beings and accomplished critical thinkers, whose reputation and livelihood depends upon adhering to the standards by which they judge others. The scientific method is specifically designed to minimise the influence of personal bias by demanding rigorous justification and repeatability*. That crucial fact makes peer review - not perfect, but ultimately self-correcting. \n\n \n The scientific community isn't the only one that (subliminally of course) claims to have the market cornered on critical thinking. Doctors, lawyers, and worst of all, politicians also can have that very serious problem. Not being from the US you may not know who Thomas Sowell is (economics professor, author) but a few of his \"random thoughts\" address how dangerous that can be;\n \n \n\"People who are very aware that they have more knowledge than the average person are often very unaware that they do not have one-tenth of the knowledge of all of the average persons put together.\" \n\n \n And\n \n \n\"Of all ignorance, the ignorance of the educated is the most dangerous. Not only are educated people likely to have more influence, they are the last people to suspect that they don't know what they are talking about when they go outside their narrow fields. \n\n \n One example concerning doctors, as briefly as possible; Though I've been out of touch with it for some time now, the subject of 'seat belts on school buses' has been a national political issue in the US. The buses didn't have them, and some tax-and-spend people with little knowledge of school bus transportation thought it's time had come. It was something that some doctors groups got involved with, and it illustrates what Sowell said above. Because they knew something about the trauma involved with accidents involving the human body with or without seatbelts, that was about all they concerned themselves with as they agreed with advocates who were in favor of seat belts for these specialty vehicles. Since doctors don't have a keen interest in so many other aspects of school bus transportation (boarding and departing deaths, entrapment deaths, and statistics on how they compare with collision deaths) they were oblivious to the fact that seat belts on school buses could very well cost lives, not save them. Their (very limited for this subject) medical knowledge was given more attention than it deserved, simply because they were \"educated\". School bus transportation directors with less education than doctors undoubtedly knew more than 10 times more about the wisdom of NOT having seat belts on school buses. Though I'm not concerned about it now, I'm pretty sure the tax-and-spend political correctness is winning the issue slowly, state by state. And when a busload of children all die when the bus plunges into a body of water, or catches on fire, the fact that they were found tangled up in their seat belts won't be reported to us. :)\n \n When we allow scientists to determine what is taught to school children, we could be making a similar mistake. Evolution is a process of thinking in natural terms that make it awkward to think in religious terms that many, or most children in the US are raised with. Theistic evolution is supposed to be the bridge between the two, but we're not seeing evidence that it works. When people are taught for years on end that good thinking is naturalistic thinking - that God can be involved but is not necessary, it can lead to thinking that God may exist more in the human mind than in reality. \n \n \n \nWhat you want to do is remove the responsibility for deciding what counts as science from those who must live by its rules, and place it in the hands of - who exactly? \n\n \n Everyone must live by its rules, if it's being taught in public science classrooms! It needs to be in the hands of the political process, with some brand new caution used concerning the judiciary, considering some of our recent judiciary experience (the OJ Simpson farce of 15 years ago comes to mind)\n \n \nAnd how and to whom must they justify their decisions? We are drawn inexorably back to the status quo, lest we appoint as arbiter some person or group whose loyalty is not to the integrity of science. \n\n \n The \"people\" as referred to in the US Constitution. The ones who raise the children and pay the bills. The ones least likely to be corrupt. \n \n \nCreationist conflation of issues regarding ID\n \n At no point here have you ever denied, let alone demolished my observations to this effect :) I didn't mention it in my last post because, as I said at the time, you've rendered the whole subject moot by refusing to discuss the science. \n\n \n I never claimed to. I correctly claimed to demolish your accusations of arrogance and interchangeability. Nothing more. \n \n \nI agree that some credentialed people believe in ID. Their job is to convince their peers, by reasoned argument and meaningful, reproducible results, that their belief is justified rather than merely wishful thinking. Nobody is saying they shouldn't try to do that. Whether their efforts so far deserve representation in the science classroom, however, is an entirely seperate issue, and creationist activists and apologists do not treat it as such. \n\n \n They can't because militant atheists don't treat their atheism as an entirely separate issue. In a world where philosophy and emotion mix with facts, that's the only way the ID proponents can counteract the atheist establishment, by 'fighting fire with fire'. \n \n \nThe expulsion of ID from the classroom is spun as ID being 'shouted down', as unfair treatment, as censorship of ideas, when in fact the Discovery Institute is freely publishing its XXX off (by its own choice, targeting the layman rather than their peers). There is a concerted ongoing effort to conflate the issues facing ID and misrepresent them to the public as a single 'freedom' issue. \n\n \n The layman, as a group, knows more than any special interest group, in political matters such as what their children should be taught. \n \n \n \nThe Foundations of Evolution, Part II\n \n The existence of worldviews that deny common descent does not make the slightest difference to the fact that common descent is the foundation for the theory of evolution. \n \n Analogously, we can determine that two bullets from two murders were fired from the same gun - and reconstruct events accordingly - purely by analysing the bullets. What you're saying is \"Well, my worldview compels me to believe that those two murders were unrelated, so unless you can produce the gun your version of events is without foundation.\" \n\n \n Am I not allowed to say that your worldview compels you to believe that the order and complexity in biology were not designed by an intelligent force, so ID is without foundation? Or that the existence of worldviews that deny God as creator don't make the slightest difference to the fact that God created? \n \n \n \nThe Red Herring of Anthropogenic Global Warming\n \n This thread was entitled 'Difficulties with Design', not 'Concerns with Climatology' (or 'Problems with Porn', for that matter). It outlines a scientific case against the work produced by ID researchers thus far. The political and scientific status of anthropogenic global warming is utterly irrelevant to that argument. If global warming does represent a transgression of scientific integrity - and I reiterate that I'm presently in no position to pass judgement - that is obviously a bad thing. \n\n \n ID vs evolution is an argument concerning scientific validity - anthropogenic global warming vs natural global warming also concerns scientific validity. If they both concern scientific validity, they are not entirely unrelated. General scientific standards must be consulted in both cases. It's more than just a bad thing if scientific policing is being done differently in one case than another. It goes back to your analogy of two different school children being treated differently for committing the same offence. It's a double standard to do it, no matter what the reason, influential parents, lopsided teacher preference, whatever. The teacher should be questioned, and suspected. It's a double standard, the same as if AGW gets less punishment than ID. In the case of the students, the teacher should be held responsible for his punishment double standard. In the case of ID or AGW, the scientific community should questioned - suspected - held responsible for its double standard. \n \n The first question about a teacher with double standards would be \"what's his problem\"? The question that should be asked about a scientific community with double standards would be \"what's its problem\"? Could the teacher have an emotional problem / could the scientific community have a corruption problem? \n \n Saying the global warming thing is utterly unrelated to ID is like saying the teachers different punishments of two students committing the same offence is utterly unrelated. They both come down to ONE AUTHORITY. \n \n My bringing up the global warming issue is not a straw man. To claim that it is may be equivilant to holding up a sign as you described at the beginning of post 6; having \"absolutely no way to refute what's just been said, [therefore trying] to deflect attention away from it.\"\n \n \nAnd bad things like the politicization of science do happen. If all this is an attempt to establish a precedent, we don't need to go rummaging around in global warming to do so. \n\n \n There's no better way to do it. It would be just like rummaging around in the above teachers discipline history. \n \n \nRemember Galileo? :) I'm right there with you: when politics gets in the way of advancing our scientific knowledge, that's bad. Which is precisely why I'm opposed to the ID movement's stated agenda. \n\n \n You don't appear to be opposed to the obvious atheistic agenda as it uses science. Probably because you don't see a danger in it. I'm not opposed to the ID movements stated agenda because I don't see a danger in it. The difference between us seems to be that I'd like to see the controversy taught - a balanced conflict, whereas you want it one sided, as if there is no controversy. No matter how convinced the scientific community is about common descent, there really is a controversy. Science isn't the only source of knowledge. \n \n \n \nI'm happy to do research and compare notes on the subject of global warming. It would certainly make a refreshing change if nothing else. But I'm not prepared to do so on the premise that what we find in any way decides the issue of ID. \n\n \n Then there's no sense in doing it. We disagree on whether they are related issues. Since they both concern science, they are both policed only by the scientific community, they are both quite likely to be political and therefore corrupt, then I believe they are more than \"utterly unrelated\". \n \n \n \nThe False Duality of Intelligence Versus Randomness\n \n Uh huh. So the natural forces responsible for the symmetry of a snowflake are 'little different' from the completely random accretion of ice molecules? The gravity that holds our solar system together produces results 'little different' from Brownian movement of a soup of particles? I rather think not :)\n\n \n I don't think so either, since I believe an intelligent God makes the determinations of how each happen - the 'purpose' thing. How can an atheist see a difference in symmetry of snowflakes vs random accretion of ice molecules if neither had a designer and neither had a purpose? One would just be a more amazing, more interesting event, wouldn't it? What would be the big difference concerning the evolution/ID controversy? \n \n \n\"Intelligently guided vs random\" is not the best way to describe the difference because it's not true. \n\n \n It IS true, \"random mutation\" is the evolution catch phrase! \n \n \nBut it does make good creationist PR. It helps pre-empt rational consideration of the facts and the theory by inducing a gut-level aversion. The untruth of \"Intelligently guided vs random\" is propagated to prevent theists from becoming theistic evolutionists; it's part of an attempt by a (quite recently emerged) minority of theists to falsely polarise the issue, to gain moderate converts by denying the existence of a middle ground. You're either with us or against us. If you're not part of the solution you're part of the problem. \n\n \n Middle ground? Either life was intelligently designed or it was not! There is no permanent middle ground. Evidence is showing that followers of theistic evolutionists like Kenneth Miller can easily lose their faith in God. Phillip Johnson puts it this way;\n \n \"As students grow more and more accustomed to assuming materialism and naturalism in their academic work, the concept of creation by God gradually tends to become less real to them. It is not so much that any single finding undermines their faith; rather, the day to day practice of thinking in naturalistic terms about academic subjects makes it awkward to think differently when it comes to religion. Young intellectuals may insist for years that they are still believers, but then one day they wake up to realize that their belief has been emptied of its content, and they either throw away the empty shelf or fill it with something else. That is why every mainstream Christian institution is beset from within these days by people who want the church to turn away from the old business of sin and salvation and devote its energies to whatever social causes are currently fashionable in the secular world.\"\n \n Atheists naturally love theistic evolution, the evidence of that is everywhere too. You noticed the \"Vatican: Guess what, Darwin? Evolution is OK\" thread, did you not? It wasn't started by a Christian. Should I post the above Johnson paragraph there? :)\n \n \n \n*Repeatability is a term often misused by critics of science. If science must be repeatable, the argument goes, and we can't repeat (say) the speciation of humans and chimps from a common ancestor, then that theory is not scientific. But that's not what it means for science to be repeatable. It means that someone else must be able to follow the documented procedures by which the original author achieved his results, and by doing so repeat those results.\n\n \n I understand that. And you think that there's no way possible that it couldn't be done with ID? My guess is, if evolutionists can't come up with something pretty concrete for naturalistic origins in....150 years, by then (2150) ID will have an established place in science. Do you agree, or do you think the controversy will be the same as today, or maybe with ID long forgotten?",

   "It's OK, but you're doing that a lot - I can't help but wonder if you're not having some problems addressing some of my direct quotes. emoticon_xangel\n\n And I can't help but wonder whether your desire to score cheap points like this betrays your appreciation of the fundamental weakness of your arguments ;)\n \n I don't think I've missed anything you've brought up; if I'm wrong I'm happy to correct that. Meanwhile:\n \n Scientists deciding what is science.\n \n How is the example of doctors advocating the fitting of seatbelts to buses apt? As you rightly pointed out, that was not their field of expertise. Should we deduce from that error that we must appoint bus drivers to decide how a crash victim should be treated in theatre?\n \n The work produced by ID has been dissected by people whose field of expertise is the subject of that work. That is the essence of peer review. Assuming for the sake of argument you have the right of it, it's what should have happened before seat belts were fitted to buses. So by all means, continue to point out how things go wrong when peer review is compromised :)\n \n On the other hand, you don't seem to have any actual evidence that seat belts cause more problems than they solve. You just assume that they do, and hypothesise a conspiracy to explain why you're not hearing about it. Where have I heard that before? :)\n \nWhen we allow scientists to determine what is taught to school children, we could be making a similar mistake. Evolution is a process of thinking in natural terms that make it awkward to think in religious terms that many, or most children in the US are raised with.\n\n No: science is a process of thinking in natural terms, and evolution is one product of that methodology. In that it is no different from theories of relativity or gravitation. You take a unique exception to evolution because your personal beliefs are entwined with a naturalistic history of earth that unfortunately didn't happen. But there's nothing special about evolution, only with what your beliefs require you to deny about reality. Browse on over to the Science forum right now and you can see exactly the same story played out against astronomy, meteorology and trigonometry, with all the same arguments being made.\n \nTheistic evolution is supposed to be the bridge between the two, but we're not seeing evidence that it works. When people are taught for years on end that good thinking is naturalistic thinking - that God can be involved but is not necessary, it can lead to thinking that God may exist more in the human mind than in reality.\n\n Or it can lead to thinking that god does not use reality to lie to us. If we did not evolve, then god deliberately and unnecessarily contrived the universe so as to make it appear that we did. To me, that's a far bigger and more unpleasant can of worms than is entailed by accepting the possibility that Genesis isn't literal narrative.\n \n<science judged by< The \"people\" as referred to in the US Constitution. The ones who raise the children and pay the bills. The ones least likely to be corrupt. \n\n And do we allow 'the people' to decide Avogadro's number? How much medication is safe for their children? Do we determine what constitutes a critical mass of enriched uranium by phone vote? Isn't it possible that you're a little too ready to ascribe to corruption a difference of opinion more readily explicable by competence? Evolution, climate change - it seems that whenever someone tells you something you don't like, you reach for corruption to explain the discrepancy. And a handy tool it is too: it absolves you of the need to prove yourself right or your opponents wrong! Now it's about morals - and naturally you always win by default because you're a Christian! It's not necessary to have a motive before one can be wrong.\n \nThe layman, as a group, knows more than any special interest group, in political matters such as what their children should be taught. \n\n And if they want their children to be taught science, that's what they should be taught. Bringing up ID in the classroom, singling evolution out from all of science as being 'only a theory', or 'teaching the controversy' does not reflect the current state of our scientific understanding.\n \n If you don't want your child to be taught science? Well, I wouldn't personally endorse a decision to remove your child from biology class because it involves the teaching of evolution (without which, as was famously noted, nothing in biology makes sense), but I would support your right to make that decision. In doing so you might deny your child a future in the biological sciences but he or she is, in the end, your responsibility. Similarly, if you took religious exception to the declination of certain French verbs I would support your right to exclude your child from language classes - but not to impose your beliefs about what French ought to be like upon those who do want to learn.\n \n Interchangeability, Arrogance etc.\n \n \nI never claimed to. I correctly claimed to demolish your accusations of arrogance and interchangeability. Nothing more. \n\n Again you claim to have demolished my observations that creationists treat the seperate issues surrounding ID as interchangeable, when you've never even denied it. You didn't deny being arrogant either, you just pointed the finger elsewhere. In any case, the latter subject is dropped; are you really so determined to revive it?\n \nThey can't <seperate the issues surrounding ID< because militant atheists don't treat their atheism as an entirely separate issue. In a world where philosophy and emotion mix with facts, that's the only way the ID proponents can counteract the atheist establishment, by 'fighting fire with fire'.\n\n Or, alternatively, in a world where science must be rigorous the only way ID proponents can force their work into the science classroom is to bypass peer review and make emotional appeals to those unacquainted with the facts. You have your story, I have mine. I can back mine up with a critique of ID that you are unwilling or unable to counter. It's also my story that the creationists' own documented agenda agrees with. \n \n The Foundations of Evolution\n \nAm I not allowed to say that your worldview compels you to believe that the order and complexity in biology were not designed by an intelligent force, so ID is without foundation?\n\n You can say that, but until you can counter my criticisms of the scientific validity of ID your accusation is baseless. You are merely creating a straw Peeling for your own amusement.\n \nOr that the existence of worldviews that deny God as creator don't make the slightest difference to the fact that God created?\n\n We're wandering off the original topic here. The theory of evolution seeks to explain common descent: thus common descent is its foundation, not any particular theory of abiogenesis. Am I to take it from this derail that you no longer dispute this fact?\n \n The Red Herring of Global Warming, and Double Standards\n \nID vs evolution is an argument concerning scientific validity\n\n No: ID is an argument concerning scientific validity. It fails on its own lack of merit. \n \nIt goes back to your analogy of two different school children being treated differently for committing the same offence. It's a double standard to do it, no matter what the reason, influential parents, lopsided teacher preference, whatever.\n\n Absolutely. Like I said, you don't need to go rummaging around in climatology to establish a precedent for politics or religion influencing science. But in order to correct matters and redress the imbalance one must return to the science and let that justify itself. And you don't want to do that.\n \n That's the core problem here: you're spending all your time trying to show that double standards might exist, but you're not prepared to do what it would take to find out for sure and correct matters if they did: go back to the science and make the right decision fairly. Instead you want to treat the hypothetical existence of double standards as a fait acomplis: that if you can find an example of politics influencing science - without even showing that the attached science is even wrong - ID must be a victim of bias. That simply doesn't follow.\n \n And in all this you forget the documented fact that ID is religiously and politically motivated. Thus, by your own mad logic, it must be invalid science! We need look no further - case closed!\n \nSaying the global warming thing is utterly unrelated to ID is like saying the teachers different punishments of two students committing the same offence is utterly unrelated. They both come down to ONE AUTHORITY.\n\n Climatologists aren't biologists. They aren't the same people.\n \nYou don't appear to be opposed to the obvious atheistic agenda as it uses science. Probably because you don't see a danger in it.\n\n I would disagree with anyone who performed bad science, whatever their motivation. Clearly, as an atheist, I think it's no bad thing to be one and that the world might be a better place with more of us in it - but I have no trouble seperating those two issues. Evangelical atheists can use science if they want to. Religion can use science if it wants to. My concern is the science itself.\n \nThe difference between us seems to be that I'd like to see the controversy taught - a balanced conflict, whereas you want it one sided, as if there is no controversy. No matter how convinced the scientific community is about common descent, there really is a controversy. Science isn't the only source of knowledge.\n\n I don't deny there's a controversy, but it's not a scientific one - you just admitted as much. The correct place to teach that controversy would be a philosophy class. What you're trying to do is force words from one side of that controversy into the mouth of the other side.\n \nThen there's no sense in doing it. We disagree on whether they are related issues. Since they both concern science, they are both policed only by the scientific community, they are both quite likely to be political and therefore corrupt, then I believe they are more than \"utterly unrelated\".\n\n I don't know what more to say: I'm not prepared to decide the validity of ID science by investigating climatology. If you believe me crazy for thinking like that, I can only apologise :)\n \n Intelligence vs Randomness\n \nHow can an atheist see a difference in symmetry of snowflakes vs random accretion of ice molecules if neither had a designer and neither had a purpose? One would just be a more amazing, more interesting event, wouldn't it? What would be the big difference concerning the evolution/ID controversy?\n\n I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.\n \n<false duality of intelligence vs randomness< It IS true, \"random mutation\" is the evolution catch phrase! \n\n ... and natural selection. My point is thus proven. That 'catchphrase', even taken whole, grossly oversimplifies the process - but that's not enough for you. You have to lop it in half and discard the guiding principles in order to pretend that it's a case of intelligence versus randomness.\n \nEither life was intelligently designed or it was not! \n\n Again my point is proved: you prefer to deny the existence of the middle ground in order to convert moderates. I refer you to my original post on the subject: empirical testing of alternatives can replace any amount of design but it need not replace it all. Most of today's products are the result of a combination of design and empirical pruning of alternatives. And then there is the question of who, if anyone, designed the system that generates the variation and prunes the alternatives, yielding those products.\n \n Common descent doesn't tell us there's no god, or no creator. It simply tells us that if he does exist, he worked this way rather than that.\n \nAs students grow more and more accustomed to assuming materialism and naturalism in their academic work, the concept of creation by God gradually tends to become less real to them. <snip<\n\n I'm sure this does happen, and I'm equally sure it's because organised religions have been so resistant to taking naturalism under their wing and giving it credence as a method of studying creation. Instead they throw up arbitrary lines that one is warned not to cross lest you become an unbeliever, leaving those whose intellectual curiosity compels them to cross those lines to feel outcast and detached.\n \nAtheists naturally love theistic evolution, the evidence of that is everywhere too.\n\n Sure, because atheists simultaneously want to convert everyone to godlessness and rejoice when scientific discoveries are given a spiritual interpretation. They're just so damn easy to please, aren't they?\n \n Repeatability Footnote\n \n \nI understand that. And you think that there's no way possible that it couldn't be done with ID?\n\n What I think is that the work done so far does not stand up to logical inspection, let alone repeated real-world application. \n \nMy guess is, if evolutionists can't come up with something pretty concrete for naturalistic origins in....150 years, \n\n ...it won't make the slightest bit of difference to the evidence for common descent, and thus evolution. Evolution is not founded on any particular theory of abiogenesis. The apple still falls, however it may have come to be in the tree to begin with.\n \n And if we're going to compare periods of history wherein what was initially expected right soon failed to materialise - how does 2,000 years stack up? To be fair, then, we should give science at least another millennium or so...\n \nDo you agree, or do you think the controversy will be the same as today, or maybe with ID long forgotten?\n\n I would hesitate to make any such long-range predictions. Perhaps ID will redeem itself. As I've said, I doubt it because it doesn't need to in order to push forward its political agenda - as evidenced by the lack of peer-reviewed material and abundance of popular pseudoscience published by the Discovery Institute. Denied the pruning rigour of peer review I see no reason why ID would enjoy the same cumulative improvement as science in general has accrued. It is imagination without justification, mutation without selection, and no good can come of such a process ;)",

To say that Johnson/Dembski/Behe ARE ID, while Dawkins/Harris/Stenger are just putting fourth their own personal opinions, is a blatant double standard. \n \n Again, if no definition exists on where the fact/philosophical line is drawn, how can philosophy be policed in science? \n \n Just a few more of many unaddressed paragraphs from above posts;\n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000 Do other branches of science get held to comparable rigorous standards that ID is held to? Are flaws in other branches of science spelled out like you have for ID above, or is no one interested in opposing them? \n \n If there's a lack of interest to do in-depth examinations of the scientific content of the above branches of science, again that's only partially understandable. Most sciences on these lists don't clash with each other, but some do. Aretaics vs Coprology for example, could possibly come to differing conclusions on related subjects. Does one seek to dissolve or disregard the other to the extent that it goes to court? Is evolution vs. ID the ONLY example of this in modern history? \n\n \n What we have in ID is a proposition for scientific study by qualified people (Behe, Dembski, Johnson, etc.) that has been politically opposed by other qualified people. In this discussion you claim ID is not rigorous. It's clear that the rigorousness that you demand of ID is not present in other sciences that are taught in science classrooms. ID has been taken to court in the US. Can you name any other thing proposed as science by one or more qualified individuals like Behe, that have been taken to court concerning their scientific status? If only one has been singled out for attack, considering all of scientific diversity, it's common sense that it raises questions about motives. \n \n \n \nScientists deciding what is science.\n \n How is the example of doctors advocating the fitting of seatbelts to buses apt? As you rightly pointed out, that was not their field of expertise. \n\n \n Seat belts have one purpose, to prevent or decrease injury. Doctors have one purpose, to treat and heal injuries. So it follows that some people would falsely believe that doctors were more qualified than anyone else to make the determination that the buses need them. I think it's comparable for people to falsely believe that the scientific community is more qualified than anyone else to determine what students should be taught in science class. There are as many variables in the societal implications of evolution that scientists aren't concerned with as there are variables in school bus transportation that doctors aren't concerned with. \n \n The difference between you and me is that you don't think the origins issue is a key issue for evolution. Many religious people believe it is. Who is qualified to determine that one is right and one is wrong, independent of a political process? No one, certainly not the scientific community. \n \n \nShould we deduce from that error that we must appoint bus drivers to decide how a crash victim should be treated in theatre? \n\n \n There's practically no chance of that - as Sowell said, the danger is with the educated. \n \n \nThe work produced by ID has been dissected by people whose field of expertise is the subject of that work. That is the essence of peer review. Assuming for the sake of argument you have the right of it, it's what should have happened before seat belts were fitted to buses. So by all means, continue to point out how things go wrong when peer review is compromised :)\n\n \n Many people considered doctors to be the sum total of peer review in the above seat belt case, when they were just one small part of it. Just like many people consider elitists like Dawkins, Harris Stenger, Provine to be the sum total of peer review concerning something with such deep societal ramifications as evolution. I know that you'll tell me there are thousands of other scientists besides those four who make up \"peer review\". Statistics show that their worldview is a stark contrast to the worldview of the general public, at least in the US. \n \n \nOn the other hand, you don't seem to have any actual evidence that seat belts cause more problems than they solve. You just assume that they do, and hypothesise a conspiracy to explain why you're not hearing about it. Where have I heard that before? :) \n\n \n I don't know where you've heard it before, but I'm not making assumptions. I have decades of real world experience with school busing in several different capacities. It was a genuine interest, more than just a paycheck. My supervisor, (his LIFE was school buses) as well as most of his superiors at the state and national levels, agreed with me on the seat belt issue. It really amazed me to see news reports featuring doctors claiming general knowledge on something they only had a very abbreviated knowledge of. The danger of the educated is very real, when allowed to have influence outside of their very narrow fields. Atheist scientists deciding what children should be taught in school is comparable not only to doctors making school bus decisions, but also to giving the political spotlight to actors such as Sean Penn and Barbara Streisand. Just because people are falsely taken in by something (prominent people / heros) doesn't make it any less wrong. \n \n \nNo: science is a process of thinking in natural terms, and evolution is one product of that methodology. In that it is no different from theories of relativity or gravitation. You take a unique exception to evolution because your personal beliefs are entwined with a naturalistic history of earth that unfortunately didn't happen. But there's nothing special about evolution, only with what your beliefs require you to deny about reality. Browse on over to the Science forum right now and you can see exactly the same story played out against astronomy, meteorology and trigonometry, with all the same arguments being made. \n\n \n Because atheism could be taking over those subjects as well, as Biblical prophesy continues to be fulfilled. It goes back to my claim that science - many branches of it - are being taken over by atheism. Thinking in natural terms is being taken too far, it is becoming philosophizing in natural terms, as your \"didn't happen\" assertion above proves. \n \n \nOr it can lead to thinking that god does not use reality to lie to us. If we did not evolve, then god deliberately and unnecessarily contrived the universe so as to make it appear that we did. To me, that's a far bigger and more unpleasant can of worms than is entailed by accepting the possibility that Genesis isn't literal narrative. \n\n \n Is that yours, or did you copy/paste a Kenneth Miller quote? (interchangeability?) It shows a lack of Christian knowledge.\n \n \nAnd do we allow 'the people' to decide Avogadro's number? How much medication is safe for their children? Do we determine what constitutes a critical mass of enriched uranium by phone vote? \n\n \n Different subjects are decided in different ways - some by the people directly, (local or national vote) some by politicians (local or national) subject to being voted out if they get it wrong, some by experts. But it's important to keep a special eye on experts who are likely to benefit personally (or as a group) from a decision they made. Here in the US, we have \"school boards\" at small and large levels. We don't have Avogadro boards, medication boards, or uranium boards. \n \n \nIsn't it possible that you're a little too ready to ascribe to corruption a difference of opinion more readily explicable by competence? \n\n \n Pot - kettle - black, again. A qualified ID proponent like Behe or Dembski can't say one word without thousands of very eager evolutionists being a little too ready to condemn. \n \n \nEvolution, climate change - it seems that whenever someone tells you something you don't like, you reach for corruption to explain the discrepancy. And a handy tool it is too: it absolves you of the need to prove yourself right or your opponents wrong! Now it's about morals - and naturally you always win by default because you're a Christian! It's not necessary to have a motive before one can be wrong.\n\n \n I don't reach for corruption any faster than you do ID's \"PR exercise\". This isn't just something I don't like, I'm taking one of two positions in a debate that has been and will be going on for a long time. I'm not the only one on earth who is amazed that ID is considered non-science because it may contain some philosophy, while evolutionary philosophy is freely allowed to run rampant in the scientific realm. \n \n \nAnd if they want their children to be taught science, that's what they should be taught. Bringing up ID in the classroom, singling evolution out from all of science as being 'only a theory', or 'teaching the controversy' does not reflect the current state of our scientific understanding.\n \n If you don't want your child to be taught science? Well, I wouldn't personally endorse a decision to remove your child from biology class because it involves the teaching of evolution (without which, as was famously noted, nothing in biology makes sense), but I would support your right to make that decision. In doing so you might deny your child a future in the biological sciences but he or she is, in the end, your responsibility. Similarly, if you took religious exception to the declination of certain French verbs I would support your right to exclude your child from language classes - but not to impose your beliefs about what French ought to be like upon those who do want to learn. \n\n \n Evolution is as simple as gravity and French, there is no atheism involved, I've heard it all before. Your \"famous noter\" was Theodosius Dobzhansky, a previous generation Kenneth Miller. I'll bet he knew more about biology than I do. How about this one from me; without creation, nothing in Christianity makes sense? I'll bet I know more about Christianity than him. Which of us is the most intolerant? Or is the intolerance equal? \n \n \n \nInterchangeability, Arrogance etc.\n \n \n Again you claim to have demolished my observations that creationists treat the seperate issues surrounding ID as interchangeable, when you've never even denied it. You didn't deny being arrogant either, you just pointed the finger elsewhere. In any case, the latter subject is dropped; are you really so determined to revive it? \n\n \n Only to completely clarify the pot-calling-the-kettle-black situation. You seem to think that because you accuse me of something that you do, that I am somehow guilty of it and you are not just because you accused me first. I can accuse you of being a poster on 4forums as if that's a bad thing, but it's a false argument for me to do that, since I am equally guilty of being a poster on 4forums. In the same way, it is a false argument for you to accuse me of using arrogance and interchangeability, when you and others of your position do the same. I claimed demolition because I showed equal or greater guilt on your part. (I do accept your previous apology for bringing up arrogance though emoticon_xangel) \n \n \n \nOr, alternatively, in a world where science must be rigorous the only way ID proponents can force their work into the science classroom is to bypass peer review and make emotional appeals to those unacquainted with the facts. You have your story, I have mine. I can back mine up with a critique of ID that you are unwilling or unable to counter. It's also my story that the creationists' own documented agenda agrees with. \n\n \n I counter it by showing a lack of comparable critique of other sciences. Whenever there is a double standard concerning critique, it raises suspicions concerning the motivations concerning those doing the criticizing. That's not a deep educational thing, that's common sense. \n \n \n \nThe Foundations of Evolution\n \n You can say that, but until you can counter my criticisms of the scientific validity of ID your accusation is baseless. You are merely creating a straw Peeling for your own amusement. \n\n \n Straw Peeling? (that darn fallacy list again) It seems that if a conservative Christian debater gets into much detail of a subject at all, going outside a very narrow line of discussion, the fallacy bell can be clanged. Your biggest criticisms of ID are that \"peer review\" dismisses it, without really naming the peers. Reminds me of a fallacy. Is there really a difference between a gang of people making a decision based on their worldview vs one person making a decision based on his worldview? Is peer review actually little more than a ganging up process? What's the peer reviewer to ID proponent ratio? 100 to 1? 1000 to 1? \n \n \nWe're wandering off the original topic here. The theory of evolution seeks to explain common descent: thus common descent is its foundation, not any particular theory of abiogenesis. Am I to take it from this derail that you no longer dispute this fact? \n\n \n No, because many evolutionists take a keen interest in abiogenesis. It's proof that evolutionists are still searching for their foundation, and that makes some sense. I thought science was a search for knowledge and truth. Am I to take it from your dismissal of origins that some evolutionists may not be interested in learning anything outside a certain box, if design by supernatural creation could be more plausible than abiogenesis? \n \n \nThe Red Herring of Global Warming, and Double Standards\n \n No: ID is an argument concerning scientific validity. It fails on its own lack of merit. \n \n Absolutely. Like I said, you don't need to go rummaging around in climatology to establish a precedent for politics or religion influencing science. But in order to correct matters and redress the imbalance one must return to the science and let that justify itself. And you don't want to do that. \n\n \n Because there is no distinction between where actual science stops and philosophy starts. I've pointed that out before - addressing it is something you don't want to do. \n \n \nThat's the core problem here: you're spending all your time trying to show that double standards might exist, but you're not prepared to do what it would take to find out for sure and correct matters if they did: go back to the science and make the right decision fairly. Instead you want to treat the hypothetical existence of double standards as a fait acomplis: that if you can find an example of politics influencing science - without even showing that the attached science is even wrong - ID must be a victim of bias. That simply doesn't follow. \n\n \n \"Go back to the science\"? Where would that be located? Where can I find science that everyone can agree is perfect and unbiased? It's common sense to some that if it's clueless about origins, it's not perfect and unbiased since it's incomplete. \n \n \nAnd in all this you forget the documented fact that ID is religiously and politically motivated. Thus, by your own mad logic, it must be invalid science! We need look no further - case closed! \n\n \n Do you believe that evolution is religiously and politically motivated? (hint; Dawkins, Harris, Stenger, Provine) And your answer, sure, but that's only those innocent little peoples personal opinion, and has nothing to do with evolution! Yet the personal opinions of those few at the Discovery Institute represent ALL of ID, theirs aren't their personal opinions at all! Talk about mad logic. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nClimatologists aren't biologists. They aren't the same people.\n\n \n But they're all scientists. Are you saying they may not have perfect agreement on what the \"scientific method\" is? In that case, how important is the scientific method? If one branch of science disregards it, is knowledge and truth being sacrificed? If it can be shown that anthropogenic global warming is not science, do we have serious disarray in the scientific community? \n \n \nI would disagree with anyone who performed bad science, whatever their motivation. Clearly, as an atheist, I think it's no bad thing to be one and that the world might be a better place with more of us in it - but I have no trouble seperating those two issues. Evangelical atheists can use science if they want to. Religion can use science if it wants to. My concern is the science itself. \n\n \n It would be nice if the world was that perfect. Here in the US we occasionally hear of a school teacher who gets in trouble for somehow using his/her classroom as a propaganda tool for one-sided politics. Common sense tells us that it also happens with evangelical atheism. It's hard for them to get in trouble when it's disguised as naturalism. \n \n \nI don't deny there's a controversy, but it's not a scientific one - you just admitted as much. The correct place to teach that controversy would be a philosophy class. What you're trying to do is force words from one side of that controversy into the mouth of the other side. \n\n \n A knowledge that is outside of science isn't necessarily a completely separate issue from science. It could show a scientific theory to be wrong, or philosophical. What I'd like to see is the atheistic philosophy out of the science class. It can't be done. The only balance is with ID. \n \n \nI don't know what more to say: I'm not prepared to decide the validity of ID science by investigating climatology. If you believe me crazy for thinking like that, I can only apologise :) \n\n \n You're not crazy at all, you just (hopefully) realize that the scientific method is subjective, bendable and shapeable by any scientific discipline to suit its needs, and as we seem to be learning in this discussion, with no accountability.",

   "Originally posted by marc9000 How can an atheist see a difference in symmetry of snowflakes vs random accretion of ice molecules if neither had a designer and neither had a purpose? One would just be a more amazing, more interesting event, wouldn't it? What would be the big difference concerning the evolution/ID controversy? \n\n \n \nI'm sorry, I don't understand the question. \n\n \n Let's start at the beginning. I said;\n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000 \"Intelligently guided vs random\" may not be the best way to describe the difference, because it allows evolutionists to promote nature as a director, somehow elevating it beyond random. There is actually little difference between \"random\" and \"without guiding intelligence\". \n\n \n Then you said;\n \n \nOriginally posted by Peeling Uh huh. So the natural forces responsible for the symmetry of a snowflake are 'little different' from the completely random accretion of ice molecules? The gravity that holds our solar system together produces results 'little different' from Brownian movement of a soup of particles? I rather think not \n\n \n That's when I asked the question above. You claimed that there is a difference between snowflake symmetry and ice molecules. What is the difference, if they are both undirected? You seem to be trying to show middle ground between intelligently guided purpose, and random non-purpose with the natural selection process. As if the natural selection process could strengthen a theistic evolutionists relationship with God / Christs teachings. There's no evidence that it does that. But as Johnson's paragraph outlines, and plenty of real world experience proves, a focus on the natural selection process can and does weaken a theistic evolutionists relationship with God / Christ's teachings. \n \n ___________\n \n <false duality of intelligence vs randomness< \n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000 It IS true, \"random mutation\" is the evolution catch phrase! \n\n \n \n \n \n... and natural selection. My point is thus proven. That 'catchphrase', even taken whole, grossly oversimplifies the process - but that's not enough for you. You have to lop it in half and discard the guiding principles in order to pretend that it's a case of intelligence versus randomness. \n\n \n And my point is proven - your guiding principles don't have a purposeful guide. Atheism likes it, how can it be middle ground for theistic evolution? \n \n \nAgain my point is proved: you prefer to deny the existence of the middle ground in order to convert moderates. I refer you to my original post on the subject: empirical testing of alternatives can replace any amount of design but it need not replace it all. Most of today's products are the result of a combination of design and empirical pruning of alternatives. And then there is the question of who, if anyone, designed the system that generates the variation and prunes the alternatives, yielding those products.\n \n Common descent doesn't tell us there's no god, or no creator. It simply tells us that if he does exist, he worked this way rather than that.\n\n \n One Benjamin Wiker of the Discovery Institute condenses a history of evolutionary philosophy neatly into just a few paragraphs. I won't copy/paste it all, but here are a few highlights;\n \n \n.....the first Darwinian was not Darwin, but a rather notorious Greek, Epicurus, born on the Island of Samos about 341 b.c. It was he who provided the philosophical underpinnings of Darwinism, because it was he who fashioned an entirely materialistic, god-proof cosmology, where the purposeless jostling of brute matter over infinite time yielded, by a series of fortunate accidents, not only the Earth, but all the myriad forms of life thereon. He fashioned the cosmology, not out of evidence but from his desire to rid the world of brooding deities. As with many a modern, Epicurus thought religion the source of all the world's woes. This common disdain for religion unites Epicureanism and mod-ernity because we moderns are the heirs of Epicurus. Through a long and winding path, a revived form of Epicurean materialism became the founding creed of modern scientific materialism-the very materialist cosmology that Darwin assumed in the Origin and that still grounds the materialist dismissal of design in nature (see my book, Moral Darwinism, for the complete account). \n \n Here, then, is an important lesson for those who believe that theology, and especially Christian theology, can be accommodated to evolutionary theory. Its ancient founder, Epicurus, and its modern father, Darwin, understood-and its contemporary champions, Dawkins and Provine, understand-that the implications of evolutionary theory are corrosive for theology. It should go without saying, then, that those buying wholeheartedly and uncritically into evolutionary theory, and who expect to survive with theology intact, had better heed the ancient warning, caveat emptor. \n\n \n Then we go to Johnsons modern warning, from my last post, which you quoted;\n \n \nAs students grow more and more accustomed to assuming materialism and naturalism in their academic work, the concept of creation by God gradually tends to become less real to them. <snip< \n\n \n \nI'm sure this does happen, and I'm equally sure it's because organised religions have been so resistant to taking naturalism under their wing and giving it credence as a method of studying creation. Instead they throw up arbitrary lines that one is warned not to cross lest you become an unbeliever, leaving those whose intellectual curiosity compels them to cross those lines to feel outcast and detached. \n\n \n So you're saying there are two truths - one can use naturalism to become an intellectually fulfilled atheist, or one can use naturalism as a method of studying creation. Wiker continues;\n \n \nThe two-truths approach, in its modern form, has been around at least since Benedict Spinoza (1634-1677) and was set forth most recently by the late Stephen Jay Gould. \n \n [snip]\n \n If we research the pedigree, we find that Spinoza put forth the two-truths approach as a way to neutralize religion.\n \n [snip]\n \n However attractive this d\u00e9tente might appear, if we dig more deeply, we find that Spinoza's reasons for allowing a few moral bones to be thrown to theologians was less than flattering. Simply put, for Spinoza, most people are too stupid to understand a purely rational account of ethics. For them, we have the nice moral tales in the Bible (as cleaned up and reformulated by the Enlightened intelligentsia, that is). Spinoza, therefore, allows theology to have the moral sphere, not out of respect but because it would be \"folly to refuse...what has proved such a comfort to those whose reason is comparatively weak.\" The real folly, however, would be rejecting religion as a way to control the stupid but restless masses, for \"there are but very few, compared with the aggregate of humanity, who can acquire the habit of virtue under the unaided guidance of reason.\" \n \n A less than comforting pedigree, to say the least. And now, we may view its falsity. It is false in two senses, moral and intellectual. By moral falsity, I mean that the two-truths approach is not being presented genuinely but duplicitously, for no such distinction between truth and morality is possible, and both materialists in general and Darwinists in particular know it. This should be obvious. The truth about human nature-what we are-is the foundation of moral truth, how we should act. As will soon become quite clear, Darwinism necessarily entails moral Darwinism. \n\n \n The whole thing should be read - I'm sniping to save space here. But it's all so obvious, atheists embracing middle ground (tossing out a few theistic evolution bones) is not in the interest of neutral science, it's in the interest of Biblical put-downs, and the politics that go with it. Your claims of ID being a documented PR exercise are no more profound than my proof that evolution is a documented a PR exercise. \n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000 Atheists naturally love theistic evolution, the evidence of that is everywhere too. \n\n \n \nSure, because atheists simultaneously want to convert everyone to godlessness and rejoice when scientific discoveries are given a spiritual interpretation. They're just so damn easy to please, aren't they? \n\n \n That's it, when scientific discoveries are given a spiritual interpretation, atheists can laugh and make fun of it and suggest that those who make those interpretations aren't near intelligent enough to be involved in decisions concerning abortion, morals, ethics, redistribution of wealth, etc. Dawkins and Harris would have yet more hot selling books to write. Spinoza would be proud, wouldn't he? \n \n \nRepeatability Footnote\n \n \n What I think is that the work done so far does not stand up to logical inspection, let alone repeated real-world application. \n \n ...it won't make the slightest bit of difference to the evidence for common descent, and thus evolution. Evolution is not founded on any particular theory of abiogenesis. The apple still falls, however it may have come to be in the tree to begin with.\n \n And if we're going to compare periods of history wherein what was initially expected right soon failed to materialise - how does 2,000 years stack up? To be fair, then, we should give science at least another millennium or so...\n \n I would hesitate to make any such long-range predictions. Perhaps ID will redeem itself. \n\n \n So you think there is a possibility that ID could come up with something that will inspire a calm, thoughtful look from the scientific community? If Irreducible complexity inspired nothing but panic and rage from them, I don't think there's anything else they could come up with that wouldn't do the same thing. \n \n \nAs I've said, I doubt it because it doesn't need to in order to push forward its political agenda - as evidenced by the lack of peer-reviewed material and abundance of popular pseudoscience published by the Discovery Institute. Denied the pruning rigour of peer review I see no reason why ID would enjoy the same cumulative improvement as science in general has accrued. It is imagination without justification, mutation without selection, and no good can come of such a process ;)\n\n \n Was the above Wiker link pseudohistory? :)",

   "I've left this post here for the sake of completeness, but the structure is a mess and it's going to be impossible to follow rebuttals. I'll put together a more concise post encapsulating these points ASAP, so you might want to hold off responding until then. Thanks!\n \n \n Addressing Missed Points\n \n \nThe fact is, the influence of evangelical atheists can't be kept out of the science classroom, because no consensus exists on just where the fact/philosophical line is drawn. If a teacher or a textbook cross the line in the slightest way, time consuming distracting religious/non religious discussions can follow.\n \n But it should be the job of science to establish a clear line between just where established fact stops and philosophy starts. There's no indication that they're getting it done.\n \n It's a key point that you haven't addressed. If evolutionists accuse ID of biased philosophy, it needs to be accountable for it's own biased philosophy.\n\n As I've reiterated multiple times, ID's scientific failure is methodological, not philosophical. Religion is the motivation for the work they produce, but it's not the reason their work is bad.\n \n \nYour accusing ID of a documented PR campaign, in light of all the Dawkins, Harris, Stenger, Provine, Sagan, publicity. To say that Johnson/Dembski/Behe ARE ID, while Dawkins/Harris/Stenger are just putting fourth their own personal opinions, is a blatant double standard. \n\n I've never said Dawkins isn't conducting an atheist PR campaign! \n \n I call ID a PR campaign because right now that's all it is, and that's what it was explicitly intended to be from the outset. As I've said all along, that fact merely contextualises the bad science done in its name; it's not what makes that work bad.\n \nWhat we have in ID is a proposition for scientific study by qualified people (Behe, Dembski, Johnson, etc.) that has been politically opposed by other qualified people.\n\n You keep reiterating that as if it were fact, but you won't go near the science to justify it! How can you hope to prove that their opposition is political when you can't put a dent in their logical criticisms?\n \nIn this discussion you claim ID is not rigorous. It's clear that the rigorousness that you demand of ID is not present in other sciences that are taught in science classrooms. \n\n \"Clear\"? Where did you make that clear, exactly?\n \nID has been taken to court in the US. Can you name any other thing proposed as science by one or more qualified individuals like Behe, that have been taken to court concerning their scientific status? If only one has been singled out for attack, considering all of scientific diversity, it's common sense that it raises questions about motives.\n\n Can you name any other science whose advocates have tried to bring it into the classroom before it has been peer-reviewed?\n \n You're absolutely right, though, it does raise common sense questions about motives. And since we have documentary proof of an agenda on the part of ID to subvert and replace scientific methodology with a theologically filtered Christian orthodoxy, it's not especially hard to answer those questions.\n \nSeat belts have one purpose, to prevent or decrease injury. Doctors have one purpose, to treat and heal injuries. So it follows that some people would falsely believe that doctors were more qualified than anyone else to make the determination that the buses need them.\n\n And did the doctors really decide? Or did they just supply information to those who did decide regarding the types and severity of injuries they observed, and whether or not they thought seat-belts would mitigate those injuries?\n \n I think it's comparable for people to falsely believe that the scientific community is more qualified than anyone else to determine what students should be taught in science class.\n\n Or they could be right to believe that. You haven't demonstrated otherwise.\n \n There are as many variables in the societal implications of evolution that scientists aren't concerned with as there are variables in school bus transportation that doctors aren't concerned with. \n\n So what? If we evolved, we evolved. What you do with that information is up to you.\n \nThe difference between you and me is that you don't think the origins issue is a key issue for evolution. Many religious people believe it is. Who is qualified to determine that one is right and one is wrong, independent of a political process? No one, certainly not the scientific community. \n\n I've already explained why origins are not a key issue for evolution. You haven't put a single dent in that rationale. Unless you can, we are forced to conclude that your claim that nobody can make that determination would appear to be incorrect.\n \nI know that you'll tell me there are thousands of other scientists besides those four who make up \"peer review\". Statistics show that their worldview is a stark contrast to the worldview of the general public, at least in the US.\n\n So? Is this a challenge to their professional integrity, their moral values - what exactly are you trying to say?\n \nI don't know where you've heard it before, but I'm not making assumptions. I have decades of real world experience with school busing in several different capacities. It was a genuine interest, more than just a paycheck. My supervisor, (his LIFE was school buses) as well as most of his superiors at the state and national levels, agreed with me on the seat belt issue.\n\n That's fine, but do you have any actual evidence that these seat belts do in fact cause the problems you anticipate? I'm not implying you don't, I'm just curious.\n \nBecause atheism could be taking over those subjects as well, as Biblical prophesy continues to be fulfilled.\n\n So Mars looks smaller than Earth because trigonometry isn't Christian enough?\n \nIt goes back to my claim that science - many branches of it - are being taken over by atheism. Thinking in natural terms is being taken too far, it is becoming philosophizing in natural terms, as your \"didn't happen\" assertion above proves.\n\n Not at all. There's nothing explicitly naturalistic about saying that our theories ought to cause our expectations to conform with reality. If the reality of creation were as it was described in Genesis, theories based upon the bible's axiomatic truth ought to engender expectations that accord with that reality, yes?\n \nIs that yours, or did you copy/paste a Kenneth Miller quote? (interchangeability?) It shows a lack of Christian knowledge.\n\n It's mine, thanks :) And your religious blinkers are on again: you can be wrong as a genesis literalist without being wrong as a Christian, and you can be wrong as a Christian without being wrong as a believer in god.\n \n If Jesus really was the son of god, then the truth or falsehood of any individual part of the bible is irrelevant. It's just a book, written by men, doing the best they could.\n \nDifferent subjects are decided in different ways - some by the people directly, (local or national vote) some by politicians (local or national) subject to being voted out if they get it wrong, some by experts. But it's important to keep a special eye on experts who are likely to benefit personally (or as a group) from a decision they made. Here in the US, we have \"school boards\" at small and large levels.\n\n Ok, so you concede that there is such a thing as expertise - that's good. But school boards clearly need a 'special eye' keeping on them too, should they unilaterally decide to violate the constitution by promoting a specific religion in science class.\n \nIsn't it possible that you're a little too ready to ascribe to corruption a difference of opinion more readily explicable by competence?\n \n Pot - kettle - black, again. A qualified ID proponent like Behe or Dembski can't say one word without thousands of very eager evolutionists being a little too ready to condemn. \n\n And, again, you fail to demonstrate any similarity between our arguments because you won't go near the science. I don't criticise Dembski or Behe for being corrupt, I criticise their work because it is flawed.\n \nI'm not the only one on earth who is amazed that ID is considered non-science because it may contain some philosophy, while evolutionary philosophy is freely allowed to run rampant in the scientific realm.\n\n ID is considered non-science because the work it's produced is bad. And what 'runs rampant' in the scientific realm, quite properly, is methodological naturalism, of which evolution is one product.\n \nHow about this one from me; without creation, nothing in Christianity makes sense? I'll bet I know more about Christianity than him. Which of us is the most intolerant? Or is the intolerance equal?\n\n Christianity doesn't have to make sense. Biology does.\n \n Arrogance etc\n \n \nYou seem to think that because you accuse me of something that you do, that I am somehow guilty of it and you are not just because you accused me first.\n\n Not at all. I merely pointed out an aspect of your behaviour. And I hardly think it was me who brought up interchangeability first!\n \nIn the same way, it is a false argument for you to accuse me of using arrogance and interchangeability, when you and others of your position do the same. I claimed demolition because I showed equal or greater guilt on your part. \n\n But you didn't :) You stated that evolution appeals to those who don't care to understand the details. In an attempt to justify that, you provided links to posts where people didn't demonstrate knowledge of the details, as opposed to posts where people demonstrated a lack of knowledge. When I get home from work I say hello to my wife without demonstrating a detailed knowledge of evolution - would it be appropriate for you to cite that conversation as evidence supporting your case?\n \nI counter it by showing a lack of comparable critique of other sciences. Whenever there is a double standard concerning critique, it raises suspicions concerning the motivations concerning those doing the criticizing. That's not a deep educational thing, that's common sense. \n\n And how do you discover whether you're right about this supposed double standard? You look at the science.\n \nAm I not allowed to say that your worldview compels you to believe that the order and complexity in biology were not designed by an intelligent force, so ID is without foundation?\n \n Straw Peeling? (that darn fallacy list again) It seems that if a conservative Christian debater gets into much detail of a subject at all, going outside a very narrow line of discussion, the fallacy bell can be clanged. \n\n Oh, give over already. You effectively accused me of lying about why I think ID is not valid science. My critique of that science is still waiting at the top of this thread for you to tackle. Either do so, or accept my explanation at face value.\n \nYour biggest criticisms of ID are that \"peer review\" dismisses it, without really naming the peers.\n\n Feel free to do a little research into the subject.\n \nNo, because many evolutionists take a keen interest in abiogenesis. It's proof that evolutionists are still searching for their foundation,\n\n No, it's evidence that scientists are still looking for the cherry on top of an already substantial cake. \n \nI thought science was a search for knowledge and truth. Am I to take it from your dismissal of origins that some evolutionists may not be interested in learning anything outside a certain box, if design by supernatural creation could be more plausible than abiogenesis?\n\n I don't dismiss origins. I say they're not the foundation for evolution, and I'm correct.\n \nBecause there is no distinction between where actual science stops and philosophy starts. I've pointed that out before - addressing it is something you don't want to do. \n\n I'm still waiting for you to substantiate it!\n \n\"Go back to the science\"? Where would that be located?\n\n At the top of this thread, for a start. We're talking about ID, remember?\n \nDo you believe that evolution is religiously and politically motivated? (hint; Dawkins, Harris, Stenger, Provine)\n\n I believe that evolution is a powerful, elegant and predictive scientific tool that closely matches our expectations to observable reality. Whether its development was motivated by politics, religion or a bad case of gas makes not the slightest difference to its proven value.\n \nYet the personal opinions of those few at the Discovery Institute represent ALL of ID, theirs aren't their personal opinions at all! Talk about mad logic. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n Of course it's their personal opinions. That's all it is.\n \nBut they're all scientists. Are you saying they may not have perfect agreement on what the \"scientific method\" is?\n\n No, I'm not, so stop putting words in my mouth. I'm saying that not all sciences are equally subject to political pressure all the time. It used to be astronomy. Now it's climatology.\n \nIf it can be shown that anthropogenic global warming is not science, do we have serious disarray in the scientific community?\n\n Better still, forget the hypotheticals and let's talk about what it means that ID has been shown to be not science.\n \n \nA knowledge that is outside of science isn't necessarily a completely separate issue from science. It could show a scientific theory to be wrong,\n\n How, exactly? \n \nWhat I'd like to see is the atheistic philosophy out of the science class. It can't be done. The only balance is with ID. \n\n I fail to see how teaching bad science 'balances' anything.\n \nYou're not crazy at all, you just (hopefully) realize that the scientific method is subjective, bendable and shapeable by any scientific discipline to suit its needs, and as we seem to be learning in this discussion, with no accountability.\n\n We're hearing all sorts of things from you, but there's precious little in the way of justification forthcoming. Maybe you'd like to critique some scientific papers, and show how and where the scientific method is being abused. No?\n \n The scientific method is accountable to reality. Planes really do fly. Microchips really do sums. Genetic engineering really does work. Independent dating methods really do agree. Fossils really are found where we expect them to be. Unlike politics, where ideas can find enduring purchase because of their emotional appeal to what ought to be, or religion, where our expectations are deferred until after the point we could demand a refund, science has to actually work.\n \n Second Post\n \n \nYou claimed that there is a difference between snowflake symmetry and ice molecules. What is the difference, if they are both undirected?\n\n Neither are undirected. Both are directed by physical forces, the difference being that under some circumstances those forces give rise to an abstractable pattern. That can only happen because there is an underlying consistency to the operation of those forces. In short, there is order in the universe and that order is integral to the process of evolution. It is not a question of intelligent design versus randomness.\n \nSo you're saying there are two truths - one can use naturalism to become an intellectually fulfilled atheist, or one can use naturalism as a method of studying creation.\n\n You presented a number of interesting quotes from other people giving their views on this subject. My views are as follows:\n \n If you are honestly resolved to study and learn from the natural world, what you find will inevitably inform your beliefs. If you choose to believe that special creation of humans is necessary in order for us to be special, the vast depth of evidence for evolution may look like the abyss. But wherein lies the failure? Not in the evidence, nor in our indisputably special nature as thinking, feeling organisms. If god is as real as you believe, you must be missing something fundamental to take such exception to his chosen methods.\n \n Which begs the question: why is it that a religious person who balks at the idea of reconciling a loving god with an evolutionary natural history has no trouble reconciling a loving god with the evident pain and suffering in the world? At some stage 'free will' will be brought up to justify god's tolerance of various atrocities or natural disasters or personal tragedies. We are each of us free to make of ourselves what we will. So why doesn't the free will argument apply to evolution? What greater freedom than the opportunity to shape your species unmolested?\n \n In the end, there's no reason for a big bang and an evolutionary history of life to be incompatible with a greater theological context or even the basic principles of Christianity. The problem for realising that scenario is not naturalism but the millenia of religious cries of 'Wolf'. The concept of god the creator or intervener is now so tangled up with myths and fairy-stories that it's easy to lose sight of the difference; to forget that god, if he exists, doesn't have to do so on your terms.\n \nSo you think there is a possibility that ID could come up with something that will inspire a calm, thoughtful look from the scientific community? If Irreducible complexity inspired nothing but panic and rage from them, I don't think there's anything else they could come up with that wouldn't do the same thing.\n\n Panic and rage? ID made barely a ripple as it sank.\n \n You're awfully keen to prejudge the issue. Not only do you have a story to explain why ID isn't being taken seriously now, you've got one ready to explain why it won't be taken seriously in future, and none of these stories involve the quality of ID's work :)",

   "As a brief but pertinent aside:\n \nThe current standard model of cosmology (&#923;CDM) postulates that 74 percent of the universe's total mass-energy is comprised of this dark energy, while the remaining 26 percent is dominated by dark matter (with normal matter comprising less than five percent of the total). The existence of dark matter is supported by a wealth of experimental evidence, though its makeup is unknown. Dark energy, on the other hand, has precisely one piece of experimental evidence: the accelerating expansion of the universe.\n \n Now, a paper set to be published in an upcoming edition of Physical Review Letters (arXiv pre-print available now) by a trio of Oxford astrophysicists suggests a different explanation for the accelerating expansion. In their proposal, dark energy does not exist at all and the supernovae data that led to scientists to propose it was improperly interpreted. In coming to this conclusion, however, the three researchers have to throw out a philosophical principle that has guided astronomy for over 450 years <that being the principle that the part of the universe we can see is generally representative of the whole<\n\n Now that's controversial. And it's also good science: the conclusions reached were tentative and the scientists have calculated in advance what the results of future studies would have to be to favour one explanation over the other.\n \nIn addition to the concepts put forth, this paper illustrates nicely how science works. Pseudoscience often argues that controversial or contrarian papers and ideas never get published, suggesting that the \"establishment\" won't listen to new ideas. But this paper puts forth a completely novel idea, and in the process overturns a long held philosophical pillar of astronomy, and yet it is set to be published in one of the top-tier physics journals.\n",

   "The Controversy Nobody's Talking About.\n \n I started this thread because I wanted to talk about design. A dozen or so sizeable posts later, it's conspicuously apparent that nobody else does. And that's pretty much the story of ID all over: nobody's talking about it. My original conclusion that ID is a political manoeuvre rather than a scientific endeavour remains effectively uncontested, even tacitly accepted.\n \n All Smoke and No Fire.\n \n What we've talked about instead, for the most part, are hypothetical double standards. This is an unusual proposition whereby we determine the guilt of a group of individuals based on whether we believe they have a motive to commit a crime, without bothering to ascertain whether or not a crime has in fact been commited.\n \n To further confuse matters, we haven't even focused on a hypothetical double standard that might actually be relevant. Perhaps the task of showing evolution has had an easy ride on its way to the science classroom proved too daunting :) All of which serves as a colourful but insubstantial hors d'oeuvre for the real meat of the agenda: replacing peer review and the ensuing trial-by-fire where other scientists attempt to replicate results with a popularity contest, on the grounds that 'the people' can't be wrong about what they want to be told.\n \n And if the randomly-flung double-standards mud fails to stick? The fallback position is even more ingenious: begin by assuming that ID really is valid science, from which premise we deduce the near-unanimous disagreement by the scientific community must be political rather than scientific or logical - thus proving that they are too corrupt to be allowed to make a decision! In other words, ID is valid science precisely because scientists are saying it isn't:\n \nEvolutionists opposition to ID has to come from one of two areas; either (1) the belief is that ID doesn&#8217;t have enough substance to be considered science, or (2) ID is a threat to contradict beliefs that are established in evolution. It&#8217;s clear to me that it&#8217;s the latter, because if it was the first, then lots of branches of science would be under fire in a similar way to ID, which they&#8217;re not.\n\n The reality is that any number of theories in any number of scientific disciplines are rejected by peer review, and those that pass still risk demolition by others attempting to replicate or expand upon the results. It's a trial by fire that never truly ends, and only those theories that have withstood considerable heat deserve to be presented in science class. Meanwhile, far from being 'shouted down', ID's advocates have on their own initiative stayed well away from the kitchen, with such work as has been dragged unwillingly into the glare wilting in short order. Nevertheless, they seem to believe their ideas deserve special treatment - and it is that belief that has been challenged successfully in the courts.\n \n If Science is Worth Doing, it's Worth Doing Properly\n \n I believe that science is not for telling people what they want to hear. Science's job is to be useful, by which I mean it should bring our expectations further and further into line with observation. I honestly don't care what inspires people to do good science, because at the end of the day we can still ask: is it useful? Does the theory we've formulated after looking under a thousand different rocks make us better at predicting what's going to be under the 1001st?\n \n The Red Herring of Dawkins et al\n \n Much has been made of Dawkins's evangelical atheism: a PR campaign for non-believers which quotes numerous scientific results to substantiate its claims. I've also described ID as a PR campaign. Double standards?\n \n Is it double standards to criticise one company for marketing a product that doesn't work while giving a 'free pass' to another company that markets one that does? I don't think so. Common descent and its derivative, evolutionary theory, have proved spectacularly useful. It really does make us better at predicting what's under that 1001st rock - or indeed which rock to look under to find what we're looking for. It's catapulted forward everything from paleontology to biology to agriculture. That doesn't happen when a theory is nothing more than the post-hoc rationalisation of a worldview; it only happens when we get something genuinely right. I've been challenged to show where philosophy ends and science begins: this is it. Where rubber hits road.\n \n We've gone back centuries before Darwin in an attempt to show that the roots of Darwinism are really atheistic (although no link has actually been made with Darwin himself). But in any case, so what? The utility and predictive success of evolutionary theory is what it is; regardless of the existence of god or any individual's belief to that effect, Darwin clearly was right about evolution. He would be just as right if he had seen a vision of the theory in a peyote fugue, in the throes of grand mal seizure, or if a stray monkey had battered it out on his typewriter. We know it's right because it works, not because it correlates with some arbitrary personal worldview.\n \n To return to the question of double standards: I have no problem with Dawkins, Dembski, or anyone else conducting a PR campaign to promote their personal beliefs. Dawkins believes evolution (amongst other things) supports his beliefs, which is why he invokes it. I happen to agree with his conclusions, but at the same time I recognise that there are theistic contexts within which common descent makes sense. The difficulty existing religions face is that those theistic contexts don't necessarily match what they've been telling people all these years, and they're having to either live in increasingly strident denial or reconcile presumptive statements of infallibility with having been, well, a bit wrong about a few things :) In that context, it's understandable for atheism to enjoy a transient period of looking like the cat that got the cream, if only by default. In short, Dawkins's campaign (which I actually think is somewhat impatient and ill-judged in nature) invokes science that demonstrably works, while Dembski's is predicated on selling a product that doesn't work to a market he knows is ill-equipped to recognise that fact. I detest homeopathy and mysticism for much the same reason.\n \n Two Truths is One Too Many\n \n The notion of 'two truths' was mentioned along the way. I reject that idea completely. There is one truth, albeit imperfectly and incompletely understood. I think everyone has a right to interpret - or equivalently 'model' - that truth however they want - but we don't have a right to be right. Some interpretations, some models, lead to expectations that are more in line with reality than others. Some gamblers believe in luck, and as they go through life winning and losing just like everyone else they will construct a narrative to explain their changing fortunes in which luck - a lucky charm, a lucky number, whatever - plays a part. But that narrative will not help them win more often, because however well or pleasingly it might 'explain' what has happened to them so far, it isn't true.\n \n I can't find any figures, but let's assume for the sake of argument the majority (or at least a significant minority) of Americans believe in luck. I would bet my shirt that the overwhelming majority of statisticians would disagree. Following the reasoning presented here in this thread, this is indicative that statisticians do not represent the prevailing 'worldview' of the country, and their determinations are therefore suspect. Examiners, marking the question \"Johnny tosses a coin three times. What are his chances of getting three heads?\" should presumably be instructed to accept the answers \"1/8th\", \"0.125\", and \"9/10, because he saw three red cars in a row on the way to school\". After all, the people have a right to be told what they want to hear, don't they? Perhaps maths lessons that implicitly teach there is no such thing as luck should be prefaced by a statement read out to the class, to the effect that statistics is only a theory, and that luckiness and unluckiness is an alternative explanation. Or is there, between ID and mathematics, a double standard in that respect?",

And that's pretty much the story of ID all over: nobody's talking about it. My original conclusion that ID is a political manoeuvre rather than a scientific endeavour remains effectively uncontested, even tacitly accepted.\n\n \n I responded to this thread because I wanted find out more about motives against design. It's been quite fruitful. :) Why in this world would you say nobody is talking about design (intelligent design)? Talk origins / noanswersingenesis have many hundreds of pages on it. It was a significant part of Millers book \"Finding Darwins God\" also, and other books by evolutionists as well. And I responded to this thread because I thought it needed to follow a different path than the standard one - one where you could simply go to one of the above sites and copy/paste responses to anything I said. \n \n Science is a useful tool, but it's also sometimes used as a weapon against religion. If it becomes an agressor, it should be able to handle agression against it. If it polices others, it should not be shocked if others ask it to police itself in the same way. \n \n We've established the fact that evolution is not non-controversial and perfect, it does have problems, gaps etc. So obviously a subject doesn't have to be perfect to be considered science. There seems to be a certain plateau that has to be reached, and the scientific community has many thousands of pages of explanations of why evolution has reached it and ID has not. I've asked you about controversy concerning other branches of science - conflicts that show attainment/non-attainment of reaching this plateau, and you've shown none, so I assume there are none, in spite of the diversity in science. For example, we haven't see Al Gore (a non scientist - Mr anthropogenic global warming) taken to court in any way similar to the way we saw ID taken to court in Dover Pa a year or two ago. It makes sense that it hasn't - why not let disagreement in science run its course in science, until there is no doubt in practically anyone's mind that one is false? As long as evolution draws a blank with origins, what harm would come to science or society by allowing ID room in the scientific realm, over and above the harm that comes to society by allowing Al Goreism room in the scientific realm, as we are doing? Would evolution be studied to a lesser extent, with ID more involved? Wouldn't evolutionists be more inspired to find something for evolutionary origins, rather than just exempt themselves from it as they seem to be comfortable doing? \n \n \nAll Smoke and No Fire.\n \n What we've talked about instead, for the most part, are hypothetical double standards. \n\n \n \n They haven't been hypothetical, they've been actual. I've proved several in this thread, there are many more of course. You asked me to hold off in responding to post #18 because its structure is \"a mess\" - I thought you were going to restructure it, not abandon it. I'll have to refer to it as the need arises. \n \n You've referred to ID as a PR campaign as if that is a reason to dismiss it, and I've shown that evolution has largely been a PR campaign also. You responded with;\n \n \nOriginally posted by Peeling____I've never said Dawkins isn't conducting an atheist PR campaign! \n \n I call ID a PR campaign because right now that's all it is, and that's what it was explicitly intended to be from the outset. As I've said all along, that fact merely contextualises the bad science done in its name; it's not what makes that work bad. \n\n \n Even if that were true (which it isn't), it's good enough for ID to enter the scientific realm, because it EXPOSES how much PR campaigning is done in evolution! If it's not science in ID, it's not science in evolution. Evolutionists aren't going to stop doing it. Why shouldn't it be equally countered? If we go to to one of the first pages that show up on an ID search at talkorigins, we find this;\n \n talkorigins;\n \nAny theory about design must somehow address the agent and purpose, or it is not really about design. \n\n \n If that's true, then any theory of evolution must somehow clearly address biological origins, or it is not really about evolution. The only real difference between ID and evolution is the complexity in detail that evolution has. \n \n \nThis is an unusual proposition whereby we determine the guilt of a group of individuals based on whether we believe they have a motive to commit a crime, without bothering to ascertain whether or not a crime has in fact been commited. \n\n \n \"Crime\" may not be a good word, it may just be your way to inspire ridicule and dismissal of the points I'm making. \n \n If we see evidence (statistics / today vs the past) that the concept of God is becoming less real to students of science - if we see evidence, (as we do since you haven't countered it) that ID is the ONLY THING thing officially dismissed as science by the scientific community, and if these two things correlate with the motives I have shown, along with the clear atheist PR campaign including books titled \"How Science Shows That God Does Not Exits\", and \"The Blind Watchmaker\", then we have more than hypothetical double standards, we have factual double standards. \n \n \nTo further confuse matters, we haven't even focused on a hypothetical double standard that might actually be relevant. \n\n \n Sure we have. We've watched anthropegic global warming welcomed into science classrooms with open arms, as we've watched ID emotionally shouted down. We saw not one, but both US presidential candidates this past Tuesday night speak of anthropogenic global warming as if it's undisputed fact. (they didn't use the word 'anthropogenic', but that's what they were talking about) I don't think McCain believes it, but he knows it's established in public thought by an erratic news media/scientific community, and it would be political suicide to not play along. \n \n Thomas Chalko is not a meteorologist, he is not a geophysicist, he is not a seismologist. But if he has scary talk about global warming, he's suddenly a scientist. Where are the scientific community policemen as both US presidential candidates embrace pseudo science? \n \n \nPerhaps the task of showing evolution has had an easy ride on its way to the science classroom proved too daunting :) \n\n \n It wasn't easy for it. But it had about 150 years to do it. Far longer than it will allow ID, and it didn't have uh, quite so much special interest time and money against it 100 years or so ago, when it was in the same stages of development as ID is today. \n \n \nAll of which serves as a colourful but insubstantial hors d'oeuvre for the real meat of the agenda: replacing peer review and the ensuing trial-by-fire where other scientists attempt to replicate results with a popularity contest, on the grounds that 'the people' can't be wrong about what they want to be told.\n\n \n Who is \"wrong\" about what happened thousands or billions of years ago cannot be empirically determined by humans. \n \n Ridiculing the people about \"what they want to be told\" sounds convincing, until it is compared with a popularity contest among a very (comparatively) small special interest who thinks it can't be wrong about what it wants to tell everyone, especially when it establishes and enriches its paychecks. \n \n \nAnd if the randomly-flung double-standards mud fails to stick? The fallback position is even more ingenious: begin by assuming that ID really is valid science, from which premise we deduce the near-unanimous disagreement by the scientific community must be political rather than scientific or logical - thus proving that they are too corrupt to be allowed to make a decision! In other words, ID is valid science precisely because scientists are saying it isn't: \n\n \n If my double standards PROOF doesn't stick, it exposes the fact that educated elitists can be just as biased, just as imperfect, just as untrustworthy, just as selfish, just as human as anyone else. NOT QUALIFIED to make education curriculum decisions. Open inquiry in science should be clearly uniform for everyone to see. \n \n \nThe reality is that any number of theories in any number of scientific disciplines are rejected by peer review, and those that pass still risk demolition by others attempting to replicate or expand upon the results. It's a trial by fire that never truly ends, and only those theories that have withstood considerable heat deserve to be presented in science class. \n\n \n Do you have evidence that anthropogenic global warming has been exposed to that heat? \n \n \nMeanwhile, far from being 'shouted down', ID's advocates have on their own initiative stayed well away from the kitchen, with such work as has been dragged unwillingly into the glare wilting in short order. \n\n \n The kitchen may very well require more power and money for entry than they can afford right now. Remember, the kitchen contains those who said yes,(concerning Behe's example of irreducible complexity, a moustrap) that it will work without one part; \n \n talkorigins;\n \nYep. The wooden base can be discarded. Where do you put a mousetrap? On the floor. What if I assemble the mousetrap by pounding the staples into the floor? Would I have a fully functional mousetrap? \n Of course I would. \n\n \n It's this kind of kneejerk stupidity, that makes some people question how quickly evolutionists dismiss something. He made \"the floor\" the base, and then claims he discarded the base!! Are you going to tell me that was thoughtful peer review? He continues;\n \n \nWould it be just as useful? Nope -- there is actually a selective advantage to having a typical mousetrap, rather than a kit. Not only do I have to assemble the mousetrap, but I can't put it on a stone or concrete floor, or a very irregular floor or a very soft one (such as soil). It's a nuisance to put behind or under appliances & furniture. I can kiss my security deposit goodbye. \n\n \n Security deposit? Is this kind of middle-school condescension common in peer review also? This kind of thing should trump public opinion? \n \n \nNevertheless, they seem to believe their ideas deserve special treatment - and it is that belief that has been challenged successfully in the courts. \n\n \n No more special treatment than Dawkins /Harris/ Stenger get. When they see reaction like the above from T.O., they have good reason to believe they're not asking too much. \n \n \nIf Science is Worth Doing, it's Worth Doing Properly\n \n I believe that science is not for telling people what they want to hear. Science's job is to be useful, by which I mean it should bring our expectations further and further into line with observation. I honestly don't care what inspires people to do good science, because at the end of the day we can still ask: is it useful? Does the theory we've formulated after looking under a thousand different rocks make us better at predicting what's going to be under the 1001st? \n\n \n What is really more useful - predicting what we'll see under certain, chosen rocks, or looking under other rocks that some of us don't want to look under, for fear of what might be found? If God did have something to do with the origins of life, and most evolutionists admit that it is a possibility, there could be physical evidence of it. Keeping science on completely materialistic paths could close other paths that could turn out to have materialistic observation. \n \n \nThe Red Herring of Dawkins et al\n \n Much has been made of Dawkins's evangelical atheism: a PR campaign for non-believers which quotes numerous scientific results to substantiate its claims. I've also described ID as a PR campaign. Double standards?\n \n Is it double standards to criticise one company for marketing a product that doesn't work while giving a 'free pass' to another company that markets one that does? I don't think so. \n\n \n No, it's double standards to give the free pass to another company whose product also doesn't work. Without origins, evolution doesn't completely work. And a lot of things on earth \"work\" much better in view of creation than in naturalism. Just because they may not be scientific things does not make them any less real. \n \n \nCommon descent and its derivative, evolutionary theory, have proved spectacularly useful. It really does make us better at predicting what's under that 1001st rock - or indeed which rock to look under to find what we're looking for. It's catapulted forward everything from paleontology to biology to agriculture. \n\n \n In addition to the impossibility of establishing the dividing line between evolution and philosophy, it's not hard to see that it can also be difficult to see the line between evolution and biology. A year or two ago, I had another poster here tell me that without belief in a billons-of-year-old-earth, we wouldn't be able to purify or distribute drinking water! I'm afraid it's quite possible for evolution to be given credit for some things that are discovered in basic biology. Philosophy about the prehistoric past can be given false credit for things we do in the present. \n \n \nThat doesn't happen when a theory is nothing more than the post-hoc rationalisation of a worldview; it only happens when we get something genuinely right. I've been challenged to show where philosophy ends and science begins: this is it. Where rubber hits road. \n\n \n You haven't touched it - it's not possible to do. If it were, someone by now would have done a concise breakdown of the books \"The Blind Watchmaker\" and \"How science shows that God does not exist\", and divided the scientific fact from the atheism, and would have been set for life with a bestseller like that. \n \n \nWe've gone back centuries before Darwin in an attempt to show that the roots of Darwinism are really atheistic (although no link has actually been made with Darwin himself). But in any case, so what? The utility and predictive success of evolutionary theory is what it is; regardless of the existence of god or any individual's belief to that effect, Darwin clearly was right about evolution. He would be just as right if he had seen a vision of the theory in a peyote fugue, in the throes of grand mal seizure, or if a stray monkey had battered it out on his typewriter. We know it's right because it works, not because it correlates with some arbitrary personal worldview. \n\n \n \"Evolution\" works, or biology works? \n \n \nTo return to the question of double standards: I have no problem with Dawkins, Dembski, or anyone else conducting a PR campaign to promote their personal beliefs. Dawkins believes evolution (amongst other things) supports his beliefs, which is why he invokes it. I happen to agree with his conclusions, but at the same time I recognise that there are theistic contexts within which common descent makes sense. The difficulty existing religions face is that those theistic contexts don't necessarily match what they've been telling people all these years, and they're having to either live in increasingly strident denial or reconcile presumptive statements of infallibility with having been, well, a bit wrong about a few things :) In that context, it's understandable for atheism to enjoy a transient period of looking like the cat that got the cream, if only by default. In short, Dawkins's campaign (which I actually think is somewhat impatient and ill-judged in nature) invokes science that demonstrably works, while Dembski's is predicated on selling a product that doesn't work to a market he knows is ill-equipped to recognise that fact. I detest homeopathy and mysticism for much the same reason.\n\n \n If something works beyond challenge, it must be complete. Without origins, evolution doesn't completely work. \n \n Life has not always existed. Biology is about information and order. To claim that a study of design in biology doesn't work, shows a worldview commitment, not open inquiry that seems to be present in EVERY FORM OF SCIENCE except for this one. \n \n \nTwo Truths is One Too Many\n \n The notion of 'two truths' was mentioned along the way. I reject that idea completely. There is one truth, albeit imperfectly and incompletely understood. I think everyone has a right to interpret - or equivalently 'model' - that truth however they want - but we don't have a right to be right. Some interpretations, some models, lead to expectations that are more in line with reality than others. \n\n \n What is reality? Only what science defines it as? It is reality that most of the world considers this the year 2008. 2008 years after what? Would it be a good idea for the scientific community to come up with their own scientific way to document the passing of the years? Something geological or biological? \n \n \nSome gamblers believe in luck, and as they go through life winning and losing just like everyone else they will construct a narrative to explain their changing fortunes in which luck - a lucky charm, a lucky number, whatever - plays a part. But that narrative will not help them win more often, because however well or pleasingly it might 'explain' what has happened to them so far, it isn't true.\n \n I can't find any figures, but let's assume for the sake of argument the majority (or at least a significant minority) of Americans believe in luck. I would bet my shirt that the overwhelming majority of statisticians would disagree. Following the reasoning presented here in this thread, this is indicative that statisticians do not represent the prevailing 'worldview' of the country, and their determinations are therefore suspect. \n\n \n And that makes perfect sense! Do you automatically assume that statisticians are right just because they have some kind of education? Would you continue to think that if the overwhelming majority of statisticians found RMNS evolution mathematically impossible? \n \n \nExaminers, marking the question \"Johnny tosses a coin three times. What are his chances of getting three heads?\" should presumably be instructed to accept the answers \"1/8th\", \"0.125\", and \"9/10, because he saw three red cars in a row on the way to school\". After all, the people have a right to be told what they want to hear, don't they? Perhaps maths lessons that implicitly teach there is no such thing as luck should be prefaced by a statement read out to the class, to the effect that statistics is only a theory, and that luckiness and unluckiness is an alternative explanation. Or is there, between ID and mathematics, a double standard in that respect?\n\n \n Do atheists have a right to be told what they want to hear? That evolution is \"robust\" with no foundation? That it's okay to start at step three?",

   "Why in this world would you say nobody is talking about design (intelligent design)? Talk origins / noanswersingenesis have many hundreds of pages on it. It was a significant part of Millers book \"Finding Darwins God\" also, and other books by evolutionists as well.\n\n Talk origins has 'hundreds of pages' of rebuttals to various creationist claims, some of which address the small amount of work produced by ID. So I suppose if we stretch the definition of 'about design' to include any claim on any topic made by a person who believes in design, then I was wrong :)\n \nAnd I responded to this thread because I thought it needed to follow a different path than the standard one - one where you could simply go to one of the above sites and copy/paste responses to anything I said.\n\n So.. you're saying I'm right! You thought that a thread entitled 'Difficulties with Design' shouldn't talk about design at all: it should become a soapbox from which to make unsupported insinuations of corruption and moral turpitude within science. But... how exactly does that differ from the norm?\n \nWe've established the fact that evolution is not non-controversial and perfect, it does have problems, gaps etc. So obviously a subject doesn't have to be perfect to be considered science.\n\n If you followed the link I provided, you'll have seen that there have been an continue to be a number of controversial issues in evolutionary theory, as there are in all branches of science. ID just doesn't happen to be one of them. Teaching the controversy requires a controversy to teach.\n \nThere seems to be a certain plateau that has to be reached, and the scientific community has many thousands of pages of explanations of why evolution has reached it and ID has not. I've asked you about controversy concerning other branches of science - conflicts that show attainment/non-attainment of reaching this plateau, and you've shown none, so I assume there are none, in spite of the diversity in science.\n\n Once again you conflate political controversy with scientific controversy. Whenever a paper is rejected for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, or its results are overturned by other scientists attempting to repeat or employ them, that's the rough-and-tumble in which good science proves itself and bad science is exposed, and thousands of papers go through this process all the time. Scientifically speaking, ID sank more or less without trace, which is why you don't want to talk about it on that level. There is no controversy. The bravely hyperbolic 'thousands of pages' of which you speak are generated by the ongoing political controversy; the need for rigorous science to publicly defend itself against a hollow creationist PR campaign, rather than any genuine scientific relevance. Here we are now, adding to that total.\n \nwhy not let disagreement in science run its course in science, until there is no doubt in practically anyone's mind that one is false? As long as evolution draws a blank with origins, what harm would come to science or society by allowing ID room in the scientific realm, over and above the harm that comes to society by allowing Al Goreism room in the scientific realm, as we are doing?\n\n ID has room in the scientific realm. What it doesn't have at the moment, and rightfully so, is a place in the science classroom.\n \n The general principle to be followed is that the more certain we are about something, the earlier it is appropriate to teach or reference it. Rarified and uncertain issues are rightly deferred until a student is closer to the cutting edge of science. We are as certain of the fact of common descent as we are of anything. ID, by contrast, consists of a small amount of logically broken and empirically debunked work; it is as tenuous and speculative as it gets.\n \nWould evolution be studied to a lesser extent, with ID more involved? Wouldn't evolutionists be more inspired to find something for evolutionary origins, rather than just exempt themselves from it as they seem to be comfortable doing? \n\n Marc, we've been over this already. Origin of first life is not the foundation for evolution. Common descent is. The clue is in the name: evolution. Change over time. Please stop talking as if this issue is still in doubt; you had no answer when I explained the first time and you have no answer now.\n \n<hypothetical double standards< haven't been hypothetical, they've been actual. I've proved several in this thread,\n\n Really? Let's see, shall we:Do those who study other scientific branches step their way through processes, employ reasoning etc. in a way that's noticeably more complete and thorough than those who study ID? Without getting into detail of just what they do at this time,\n\n Insinuating question; no proof.\n \nDo other branches of science get held to comparable rigorous standards that ID is held to? Are flaws in other branches of science spelled out like you have for ID above, or is no one interested in opposing them?\n\n Insinuating question; no proof. Also, this is where you begin to conflate the political controversy special to ID with the less public trial-by-fire all science undergoes.\n \nIf all those things in the second list above are science, then ID is science. \n\n Illogical and unjustified assertion.\n \nThe religious motivation behind the ID movement is comparable to the atheist motivation behind evolution. ID is condemned for it - evolution gets a free pass on it.\n\n ID is condemned for producing bad work and its advocates for breaching the constitution. No double standard.\n \nYet they're still there, it seems that science has been around a lot longer than the latest versions of the scientific methods, yet we don't see careful revisions showing that some branch of science from the past no longer measures up\n\n More insinuation, no proof of anything actually failing to live up to established standards.\n \nHumans can transform the global enviornment? This is the scientific method, while ID is not?\n\n Plenty of disbelief, no proof.\n \nAre they equally inappropriate? Is it okay to block one with the heavy hand of government, and wink and nod at the other?\n\n More evidence-free insinuation that ID has been unfairly treated.\n \nWhat it often does is suggest a worship of the earth, which would explain the double standard between the scientific method being applied to ID vs global warming. \n\n Keep saying it as if it's true, and maybe it'll become true.\n \nIf ID is not science, human caused global warming study is equally not science. Double standard confirmed. \n\n Another bald assertion - where's the logical justification?\n \nAre other branches of science held to equal rigorous standards as is ID? NO.\n\n I'm sure the proof is in here somewhere...\n \nBut it is legitimate to hold other branches of science to the same standard as ID is held to. \n\n No, that's not it...\n \nIt all has to do with what we know about design (since we are designers) - and the related specification and information and necessity and other things that you aren't interested in. It's not complete yet, but you demand it to be. While giving evolution a free pass on origins.\n\n I've never demanded ID be complete, only useful and logically consistent. I've shown a great deal more interest in specification and information than you have - as you proudly proclaimed when you admitted your intention to derail the discussion with your very first post. And evolutionary theory doesn't need a free pass on origins, because it explains common descent.\n \nThen sociobology is not science! Yet it is taught in universities, despite the controversy! \n\n Misreading of my correction of your grammatical non-sequitur.\n \nLooks like some \"sciences\" have controversy within the university, and some are kept out!\n\n More conflation of scientific controversy, which goes on all the time in all branches of science, with the purely political controversy special to ID. No double standard here!\n \nDo classes on sociobiology do those things? Classes on \"Transforming the Global environment? \n\n Rhetorical insinuation, no proof...\n \nBut if they're teaching that global warming is caused by human activity, with no indication that they're rigourously using the scientific method, you're not paying much attention? The only policing of the scientific method is done by evolutionists against creationists/ID proponents?\n\n And more...\n \nThe bottom line is, ID is held to different standards than are several other branches of science. \n\n Have we said it enough times for it to be true yet?\n \nYou're considering \"no scientific merit\" to be an objective conclusion. It's not, since the scientific community has proven itself to be a very questionable judge of what is science and what is not.\n\n Scientific merit is objective, because science has to work. Wishes are not horses :) We've also moved on from simply stating that double standards exist to saying that such has been proven.\n \nDo I then not have the right to question the fact that global warming doesn't pass correct standards?\n\n Rhetorical question, no proof...\n \nIf their beliefs are policed by the scientific method, then all scientific subjects should be policed by the same standards, and I may be getting close to some clear evidence that they are not.\n\n Now we back off the gas a bit. You may be getting close to some evidence for what you've been claiming.\n \nIt's not a red herring to question why this basis may be disregarded concerning other sciences. It raises the question that there may be other motives for determining that ID is not science, over and above a basic desire to apply the scientific method, if the scientific method is not applied to some other branches of science. Why are they less important?\n\n More hypothetical musing - if the scientific method is not applied to other branches of science. Still no evidence or proof.\n \nIs there really any testable, repeatable, falsifiable science that supports it at all? Or is it exploratory and speculative - comparable to ID? Or maybe far worse than ID?\n\n Rhetorical insinuation again, still no evidence...\n \nYou've not been very convincing that they're being equally applied among all sciences. \n\n It's your job to show evidence of double standards, not mine.\n \nID vs evolution is an argument concerning scientific validity - anthropogenic global warming vs natural global warming also concerns scientific validity. If they both concern scientific validity, they are not entirely unrelated. General scientific standards must be consulted in both cases. It's more than just a bad thing if scientific policing is being done differently in one case than another. It goes back to your analogy of two different school children being treated differently for committing the same offence. It's a double standard to do it, no matter what the reason, influential parents, lopsided teacher preference, whatever. The teacher should be questioned, and suspected. It's a double standard, the same as if AGW gets less punishment than ID. In the case of the students, the teacher should be held responsible for his punishment double standard. In the case of ID or AGW, the scientific community should questioned - suspected - held responsible for its double standard.\n \n The first question about a teacher with double standards would be \"what's his problem\"? The question that should be asked about a scientific community with double standards would be \"what's its problem\"? Could the teacher have an emotional problem / could the scientific community have a corruption problem?\n\n I would have thought the 'first question' would be to establish whether double standards actually existed, not what to do about them.\n \nWe disagree on whether they are related issues. Since they both concern science, they are both policed only by the scientific community, they are both quite likely to be political and therefore corrupt, then I believe they are more than \"utterly unrelated\".\n\n Likely to be corrupt. How many posts have I scoured now, and you're still talking about how scientists are likely to be corrupt. A tacit admission that you've made no headway towards supporting that accusation.\n \nWhat we have in ID is a proposition for scientific study by qualified people (Behe, Dembski, Johnson, etc.) that has been politically opposed by other qualified people.\n\n Yet still no proof is forthcoming. And in actual fact, the only political/legal opposition to ID has arisen because of the actions of unqualified people - who under oath could not demonstrate any knowledge of the subject!\n \nI'm not the only one on earth who is amazed that ID is considered non-science because it may contain some philosophy, while evolutionary philosophy is freely allowed to run rampant in the scientific realm.\n\n ID is considered non-science because its results are logically flawed and empirically wrong, not because it is the product of any particular philosophy.\n \nI counter it by showing a lack of comparable critique of other sciences. Whenever there is a double standard concerning critique, it raises suspicions concerning the motivations concerning those doing the criticizing. That's not a deep educational thing, that's common sense.\n\n Except you haven't shown a lack of comparable scientific critique. All you've shown is a lack of comparable political hoo-ha. I've never said evolution and ID aren't politically controversial, and I've never said that controversy shouldn't be taught. But ID does not represent a scientific controversy, so it should not be taught as one.\n \nIf one branch of science disregards it, is knowledge and truth being sacrificed? If it can be shown that anthropogenic global warming is not science, do we have serious disarray in the scientific community?\n\n If, if if... and in any case, no. As I've said all along, we don't need to look at global warming to find politics treading on the toes of science. When it happens, you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater (or for that matter declare a free-for-all and throw things that aren't babies in). You go back to the science and find what works.No proof of anything thus far. The one relevant piece of evidence you posted was an article critical of anthropogenic global warming: nothing whatsoever to do with evolution or ID.\n \n Most puzzling of all, though, is the inconsistency in your reasoning: you complain that AGW could be a politically motivated waste of time and money - and your solution is to give a free pass into the science classroom to ID: a politically motivated waste of time and money.\n \nYou've referred to ID as a PR campaign as if that is a reason to dismiss it, and I've shown that evolution has largely been a PR campaign also.\n\n Not at all. I referred to ID as a PR campaign because that's what it is. I and others logically refute the work published in its name. Two seperate issues. As for showing that evolutionary theory is 'largely a PR campaign' - where did that happen, exactly? We've talked about Dawkins et al utilising evolutionary theory, but at no stage have you even attempted to show that the theory itself is unsound.\n \nEven if that were true (which it isn't), it's good enough for ID to enter the scientific realm, because it EXPOSES how much PR campaigning is done in evolution! If it's not science in ID, it's not science in evolution. Evolutionists aren't going to stop doing it. Why shouldn't it be equally countered?\n\n For the reason I've given you over and over, and will continue to give until you acknowledge it: marketing bad science is not an 'equal counter' to marketing good science. We shouldn't let hustlers sell snake-oil just because some people like to believe that snake-oil really works. Even more ludicrous is your suggestion that we hand over the decision as to whether snake oil 'really works' to people who have neither the knowledge nor the inclination to establish its potency.\n \nAny theory about design must somehow address the agent and purpose, or it is not really about design.\n \n If that's true, then any theory of evolution must somehow clearly address biological origins, or it is not really about evolution. The only real difference between ID and evolution is the complexity in detail that evolution has. \n\n Are you saying that TO's statement is illogical (just like saying that evolution must address origins is illogical), or are you trying again to pretend that evolution - change over time - is founded on something other than the observation of common descent?\n \n if we see evidence, (as we do since you haven't countered it) that ID is the ONLY THING thing officially dismissed as science by the scientific community,\n\n Woah, woah - way to shift the goalposts, dude! I haven't countered a claim that ID is the only thing 'officially' dismissed as science because you've never made that claim. You presented a list of sciences and made evidence-free insinuations that they might not be rigorous. There was nothing for me to counter! Even if we suppose that I should have spent my free time learning the ins and outs of coprology to ascertain its rigor on your behalf, that would only mean that I have not directly shown every science to be worthy of the name. It says nothing at all about whether or not other studies have been deemed unscientific.\n \n Mysticism. Homeopathy. Crystal therapy. Alchemy and Astrology - once highly respected fields of research. Heck, I wish I'd known earlier that it was this easy to counter your claims that ID was being unfairly singled out! And those are just some of the big-name casualties - there are countless individual papers within all fields of science that have failed to make the grade. ID barely registers on the scale.\n \nSure we have. We've watched anthropegic global warming welcomed into science classrooms with open arms, as we've watched ID emotionally shouted down.\n\n That would be 'Dispassionately ruled against in a court of law' :)\n \n You can't support ID's science, and you seem unable to counter AGW. Why should I go along with your explanation for why they have fared differently in the science classroom?\n \nIt wasn't easy for it. But it had about 150 years to do it. Far longer than it will allow ID, and it didn't have uh, quite so much special interest time and money against it 100 years or so ago, when it was in the same stages of development as ID is today. \n\n ID can take as long as it likes. It just needs to produce something useful before it gets taught as if it were useful. And I'm sure you must be kidding about there not being any special interests opposed to evolution!\n \nWho is \"wrong\" about what happened thousands or billions of years ago cannot be empirically determined by humans. \n\n The same could be said about five minutes, or two seconds, or one picosecond ago. All we have are models that tell us what to expect, and if what they tell us to expect is borne out, the model is a good one. On those criteria Genesis is a very bad model, and the noachian flood even worse. \n \nRidiculing the people about \"what they want to be told\" sounds convincing, until it is compared with a popularity contest among a very (comparatively) small special interest who thinks it can't be wrong about what it wants to tell everyone, especially when it establishes and enriches its paychecks.\n\n I'm not ridiculing the people, I'm challenging your beliefs as to what it serves the people best to be told in a science classroom. You think that all preexisting beliefs should be pandered to equally (or perhaps you only think that your personal beliefs deserve to be pandered to; I don't know if you would extend the same egalitarian principle to rival faiths). Science isn't for pandering to preexisting beliefs, it's for finding what works. Inevitably, some beliefs are going to coincide with 'what works' better than others. You don't like that because your beliefs happen to come off rather poorly. I sympathise, but I can't agree with your proposed solution.\n \nIf my double standards PROOF doesn't stick, it exposes the fact that educated elitists can be just as biased, just as imperfect, just as untrustworthy, just as selfish, just as human as anyone else. NOT QUALIFIED to make education curriculum decisions. Open inquiry in science should be clearly uniform for everyone to see. \n\n There has been no proof, however boldface the type. And you continue to miss the point: it is not the infallible virtue of scientists upon which science relies for its veracity, but the methodology - the mechanism that demands science work - which irons out imperfections and personal bias. Philosophy, ego, humility and ideas of varying sanity and brilliance go in, functioning science comes out. As and when ID's researchers produce something that works, I will be the first to congratulate them. My concern is that they will not be motivated to do so because their output is - as evidenced by your proudly unquestioning consumption thereof - sufficiently effective as a placebo.\n \nDo you have evidence that anthropogenic global warming has been exposed to that heat? \n\n I think I do, actually - when I have time I'll put something together and start a thread to discuss it.\n \nThe kitchen may very well require more power and money for entry than they can afford right now. \n\n Evidence? Dembski and Behe were already qualified and respected in their fields - so why wasn't their ID work submitted via the same channels?\n \n<the reducible mousetrap< It's this kind of kneejerk stupidity, that makes some people question how quickly evolutionists dismiss something. He made \"the floor\" the base, and then claims he discarded the base!! Are you going to tell me that was thoughtful peer review?\n\n And it couldn't be 'kneejerk stupidity' on your part to discount that observation?\n \n The relevance of discarding the base and using the floor instead is that the floor is already there. It already serves some other function, yet can be co-opted for use in the mousetrap. He found a simpler intermediate version that Behe hadn't thought of - a parable for the state of ID if ever there was one.\n \nWhat is really more useful - predicting what we'll see under certain, chosen rocks, or looking under other rocks that some of us don't want to look under, for fear of what might be found?\n\n I was being quite literal, talking about evolutionary theory predicting what we will find under rocks :) You seem to be trying to make some unrelated abstract point about naturalism - may I take it from that you aren't planning to disagree with evolutionary theory's practical utility?\n \nIf God did have something to do with the origins of life, and most evolutionists admit that it is a possibility, there could be physical evidence of it. Keeping science on completely materialistic paths could close other paths that could turn out to have materialistic observation.\n\n Because, of course, science has never discovered anything previously unsuspected, has it? :)\n \nNo, it's double standards to give the free pass to another company whose product also doesn't work. Without origins, evolution doesn't completely work.\n\n This really is getting tiresome. Evolution speaks to common descent, not first life, and in terms of enabling successful, practical day-to-day science it works very well.\n \nAnd a lot of things on earth \"work\" much better in view of creation than in naturalism. Just because they may not be scientific things does not make them any less real. \n\n Such as?\n \nA year or two ago, I had another poster here tell me that without belief in a billons-of-year-old-earth, we wouldn't be able to purify or distribute drinking water! I'm afraid it's quite possible for evolution to be given credit for some things that are discovered in basic biology. Philosophy about the prehistoric past can be given false credit for things we do in the present. \n\n I recall that exchange myself. Simply believing in an ancient earth doesn't make it possible for us to purify or distribute drinking water. Being right about an ancient earth makes it possible for us to succeed when we try to manage acquifers as if the earth were billions of years old (ie, as if the dating methods used when modeling the formation and replenishment of acquifers were accurate). Analogously, it isn't belief that the middle pedal is the brake that brings the car to a stop when you press it, it's being right about the middle pedal being the brake :)\n \nYou haven't touched it - it's not possible to do.\n\n You may wish that were the case - your worldview is predicated upon the notion that truth is in the eye of the beholder - but you are wrong. Either the middle pedal is the brake or it is not; our opposing philosophical beliefs to that effect only shape our expectations of what will happen when the pedal is pressed, not what will actually happen.\n \n\"Evolution\" works, or biology works? \n\n Both.\n \nIf something works beyond challenge, it must be complete. Without origins, evolution doesn't completely work. \n\n Evolution explains common descent; that's what it tries to deal with and it succeeds. You want to complain because the spanner of evolution won't cut the two-by-four of abiogenesis. For all your talk of fancy guttering and missing foundations, you haven't actually presented one single argument - ever, to my recollection - to support the claim that origin of first life really is the foundation of evolutionary theory. You just keep saying it.\n \nLife has not always existed. Biology is about information and order. To claim that a study of design in biology doesn't work, shows a worldview commitment, not open inquiry that seems to be present in EVERY FORM OF SCIENCE except for this one. \n\n Once again, you insinuate that I am lying about my reasons for rejecting the results of ID. Please don't do that any more - either engage on a scientific level or accept my statements in good faith. I have explicitly clarified my position on the topic already: the work produced by ID so far doesn't work.\n \nWhat is reality? Only what science defines it as? It is reality that most of the world considers this the year 2008. 2008 years after what? Would it be a good idea for the scientific community to come up with their own scientific way to document the passing of the years? Something geological or biological? \n\n 2008 years after what, indeed! It was never anything more than a centuries-belated estimate, several times revised. Its value is in its present ubiquity as a reference point, nothing more. \n \n Again, you're trying to say that truth is in the eye of the beholder, that a thing counts as real if people believe in it. I disagree. I say a thing is real if, when you act in a way that depends upon it being real, your expectations are reliably met. I think that's a higher standard of reality than belief.\n \nAnd that makes perfect sense! Do you automatically assume that statisticians are right just because they have some kind of education? Would you continue to think that if the overwhelming majority of statisticians found RMNS evolution mathematically impossible?\n\n Statisticians are right if and when the mathematical models they produce work. The models that work - that make accurate predictions about reality - don't include luck. Ergo, statisticians don't tend to believe in luck. It's frankly terrifying to think that you would eagerly throw what is, amongst other things, the bedrock of medical science in the trash for the sake of better representing a popular worldview in the maths classroom.\n \nDo atheists have a right to be told what they want to hear? That evolution is \"robust\" with no foundation? That it's okay to start at step three?\n\n First life is not the foundation of evolution. The observation of common descent is what evolution explains, and hence is the foundation for the theory.",

So I suppose if we stretch the definition of 'about design' to include any claim on any topic made by a person who believes in design, then I was wrong :) \n\n \n \n I should have provided links to show that you were wrong, I'll do that now. If you type intelligent desgin into the talk origins archive search, you get 416 links, all, or almost all of them have \"intelligent design\" in the title. \n \n \n This is the link labeled \"intelligent design\" at noanswersingenesis - clicking on that provides pages and pages more, many with \"intelligent design\" in the title. \n \n For your \"small amount of work\" claim, I can only c/p part of my post #4, from our formal debate 1 1/2 years ago; \n \n \"The international Society for Complexity, Information and Design is also a representative for the concept of Intelligent design. It lists over 50 research fellows, including full-fledged senior faculty from schools like Oxford University in England, Princeton University in the U.S., the University of Sydney in Australia, the University of Auckland in New Zealand, Hanyang University in Korea, Helsinki University of Technology in Finland, and the State University of Applied Sciences in Frankfurt, Germany. These people cover the complete range of the natural sciences. One of them, Fritz Schaefer, the inventor of computational quantum chemistry, has been considered for the Nobel prize 5 times. I could go on, but suffice it to say this work cannot, and has not, been completely ignored by the scientific community. Atheists and evolutionists will continue to shout it down somewhat successfully, but true science has not yet come to terms with several of its discoveries, most notably the work of Michael Behe.\" \n \n That may not be much compared to all the detail of the evolution machine, but it's far more than a \"small amount of work.\"\n \n If evolutionists want to comfort themselves by saying no one's talking about it, that's fine - they do seem to be ignoring it as much as they possibly can. I think they may be realizing that pretending something doesn't exist tends to make it less of a threat. Example; The movie \"The Passion of the Christ\" got a lot of negative press and ended up doing very well, possibly because of curiosity of the negative, while the movie \"Expelled\" didn't seem to do nearly as well. It was largely ignored in the press. (for some reason \"Expelled\" seemed to disappear quickly from movie theaters in the US. Advertising was gone too, but now it's all back - coming out on DVD on the 21st. You should get a copy if you can in your country. Most everyone we talk about is in it, Dawkins, Dembski, Ruse, etc.)\n \n \nSo.. you're saying I'm right! You thought that a thread entitled 'Difficulties with Design' shouldn't talk about design at all: it should become a soapbox from which to make unsupported insinuations of corruption and moral turpitude within science. But... how exactly does that differ from the norm? \n\n \n I thought yet another attack on design by evolution could possibly be moved from the standard launch into a few very specific details into a more general look at an ideology that so often goes beyond the scientific evidence. From my earlier Benjamin Wiker link;\n \n \nThe problem with Darwinism is that it is not merely a scientific theory. As I argued in the first article, it is a full-blown materialist cosmology, an account of everything, a biological theory with presuppositions reaching all the way back to the origin of the universe and conclusions stretching all the way through nature and into every aspect of human nature. \n\n \n I guess it differs from the norm because I've never noticed it being done before on 4forums, and therefore have never seen an attempt to refute it before. The conflict between evolution and ID is far different than any other conflict in any other branch of science. It is a large part of a culture war - purpose vs non-purpose, ten commandments vs no ten commandments, liberty vs socialism, republican vs democrat. The \"war for hearts and minds\" - a phrase from your OP. Voters and future generations. \n \n \nIf you followed the link I provided, you'll have seen that there have been an continue to be a number of controversial issues in evolutionary theory, as there are in all branches of science. ID just doesn't happen to be one of them. Teaching the controversy requires a controversy to teach. \n\n \n Then why did you start this thread? Evolution has its victory in the courts - the peer-review special interest seems pretty good at ignoring it. Why does the subject often come up, with no recent definable provocation from some ID special interest? \n \n \nOnce again you conflate political controversy with scientific controversy. \n\n \n They are often conflated! I'm trying to separate detail in narrow paths (scientific controversy) from the full blown materialist cosmology (political controversy) - the one we see in books by Dawkins, Harris, Stenger, Dennett. \n \n It seems that you and others attempt to support Dawkins, Harris, Stenger, Dennett with small details (scientific controversy), while distancing yourselves from the overall picture they present (political controversy). \n \n \nWhenever a paper is rejected for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, or its results are overturned by other scientists attempting to repeat or employ them, that's the rough-and-tumble in which good science proves itself and bad science is exposed, and thousands of papers go through this process all the time. Scientifically speaking, ID sank more or less without trace, which is why you don't want to talk about it on that level. There is no controversy. The bravely hyperbolic 'thousands of pages' of which you speak are generated by the ongoing political controversy; the need for rigorous science to publicly defend itself against a hollow creationist PR campaign, rather than any genuine scientific relevance. Here we are now, adding to that total. \n\n \n It may not have sank scientifically speaking, it may have sank atheistically speaking. The best way for science to defend itself against the creationist PR campaign would be to turn off its hollow atheist campaign! Why can't it do that? \n \n \nMarc, we've been over this already. Origin of first life is not the foundation for evolution. Common descent is. The clue is in the name: evolution. Change over time. Please stop talking as if this issue is still in doubt; you had no answer when I explained the first time and you have no answer now. \n\n \n I don't recall you ever explaining it, you've only stated it. If evolutionists have a right over ID proponents to define what evolution is, then ID proponents have the right over evolutionists to define what ID is. When the talkorigins guy says this about ID;\n \n \nAny theory about design must somehow address the agent and purpose, or it is not really about design. \n\n \n What gives him the authority in ID to proclaim that? He shows no interest in design, what makes him an authority on it? \n \n \nReally? Let's see, shall we:[INDENT][INDENT]\n Insinuating question; no proof.\n \n Insinuating question; no proof. \n \n Illogical and unjustified assertion.\n \n ID is condemned for producing bad work and its advocates for breaching the constitution. No double standard.\n \n More insinuation, no proof of anything actually failing to live up to established standards.\n \n Plenty of disbelief, no proof.\n \n More evidence-free insinuation that ID has been unfairly treated.\n \n Keep saying it as if it's true, and maybe it'll become true.\n \n Another bald assertion - where's the logical justification?\n \n I'm sure the proof is in here somewhere...\n \n No, that's not it...\n \n I've never demanded ID be complete, only useful and logically consistent. I've shown a great deal more interest in specification and information than you have - as you proudly proclaimed when you admitted your intention to derail the discussion with your very first post. And evolutionary theory doesn't need a free pass on origins, because it explains common descent.\n \n Misreading of my correction of your grammatical non-sequitur.\n \n More conflation of scientific controversy, which goes on all the time in all branches of science, with the purely political controversy special to ID. No double standard here!\n \n Rhetorical insinuation, no proof...\n \n And more...\n \n Have we said it enough times for it to be true yet?\n \n Scientific merit is objective, because science has to work. Wishes are not horses :) We've also moved on from simply stating that double standards exist to saying that such has been proven.\n \n Rhetorical question, no proof...\n \n Now we back off the gas a bit. You may be getting close to some evidence for what you've been claiming.\n \n More hypothetical musing - if the scientific method is not applied to other branches of science. Still no evidence or proof.\n \n Rhetorical insinuation again, still no evidence...\n\n \n If you would try putting science out of your mind for just a moment and ask yourself if what I'm saying isn't obvious to some people in the real world. If you choose to live in a world where scientific detail rules everything from when you get up in the morning to when you go to bed at night, you're living a life that is out of touch with so much that is going on in the world. I don't see any evidence anywhere that indicates that anything else in science has come under attack like ID has. It's hard for a person to prove that something DIDN'T happen. Everything that doesn't happen isn't necessarily documented as not happening. If someone is making a point by saying that something didn't happen, it may not be provable, it may only be provable to be false by opposing proof / documentation that it DID happen. \n \n I could spend hours scouring the internet to try to find another case where one branch of science tried to block something from being taught in schools, by taking it to court. How long should I look? If, from my position in the real world, I see no evidence that other sciences are litigious as evolution has proved it can be, and you don't like it, your job would be to prove I'm wrong by showing another case of litigation by another branch of science. \n \n \nIt's your job to show evidence of double standards, not mine. \n\n \n I have done that. Evolutionists establish criteria for ID that they don't establish for evolution. You're allowed to say this;\n \n *Origin of first life is not the foundation for evolution.\n \n And ID proponents say this;\n \n *Agent and purpose is not the foundation for study of design. \n \n By agreeing with the first statement and not the second, evolutionists show a double standard. \n \n \nMost puzzling of all, though, is the inconsistency in your reasoning: you complain that AGW could be a politically motivated waste of time and money - and your solution is to give a free pass into the science classroom to ID: a politically motivated waste of time and money. \n\n \n It would tend to counter atheistic evolution, a politically motivated waste of time and money. Since evolution is not about origins, it doesn't necessarily mean that evolutionists aren't interested in naturalistic origins. Is it science for evolutionists to look for, or speculate about naturalistic origins in the science classroom? To use the words of your Panda's thumb link above, is abiogenesis ready yet for \"prime time\", is it \"still within it's sell date\"? Or are these condescending little chants reserved only for ID? \n \n If ID is also allowed in the science classroom, I would say that searches and speculation about abiogenesis are more legitimate than they are if ID is politically blocked. \n \n If ID is blocked, atheistic origins should also be blocked. If ID is not blocked, then open inquiry and truth would best be served if naturalistic origins were not blocked. \n \n \n \nFor the reason I've given you over and over, and will continue to give until you acknowledge it: marketing bad science is not an 'equal counter' to marketing good science. \n\n \n If good science is loaded with politics, it's not good science. \n \n \nAre you saying that TO's statement is illogical (just like saying that evolution must address origins is illogical), or are you trying again to pretend that evolution - change over time - is founded on something other than the observation of common descent?\n\n \n I'm saying TO's statement is a double standard! Are you trying to pretend that evolutionists don't take any interest in naturalistic origins? Can you understand how upsetting it is for ID proponents to see abiogenesis and primordial soup dreaming established in the scientific realm/ the science classroom? \n \n \n \nWoah, woah - way to shift the goalposts, dude! I haven't countered a claim that ID is the only thing 'officially' dismissed as science because you've never made that claim. You presented a list of sciences and made evidence-free insinuations that they might not be rigorous. There was nothing for me to counter! Even if we suppose that I should have spent my free time learning the ins and outs of coprology to ascertain its rigor on your behalf, that would only mean that I have not directly shown every science to be worthy of the name. It says nothing at all about whether or not other studies have been deemed unscientific.\n \n Mysticism. Homeopathy. Crystal therapy. Alchemy and Astrology - once highly respected fields of research. Heck, I wish I'd known earlier that it was this easy to counter your claims that ID was being unfairly singled out! And those are just some of the big-name casualties - there are countless individual papers within all fields of science that have failed to make the grade. ID barely registers on the scale. \n\n \n How does abiogenesis register on the scale? Since it's atheistic and doesn't threaten the Darwinism faith (just like anthropogenic global warming) I'll bet it's high on the scale. \n \n \n Originally posted by marc9000______Who is \"wrong\" about what happened thousands or billions of years ago cannot be empirically determined by humans. \n\n \n \nThe same could be said about five minutes, or two seconds, or one picosecond ago. All we have are models that tell us what to expect, and if what they tell us to expect is borne out, the model is a good one. On those criteria Genesis is a very bad model, and the noachian flood even worse. \n\n \n No it can't, we have something other than science to tell us what happened a few minutes, hours, or hundreds of years ago. Written history means something. Personal human experiences mean something. \n \n \nEvidence? Dembski and Behe were already qualified and respected in their fields - so why wasn't their ID work submitted via the same channels? \n\n \n The best way to answer you is to quote Dembski himself, from one of his books;\n \n \nCritics of intelligent design who want to maintain that the number of articles in the peer reviewed literature that support intelligent design is zero are playing a losing hand. That fiction is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. Even so, I expect it to be maintained for a time. The problem is that to get work that supports intelligent design published in the peer-reviewed biological literature, biologists who are design theorists have to play their cards very close to the vest. As Michael Behe pointed out in an interview with the Harvard Political Review, for a biologist to question Darwinism endangers one's career: \"There's good reason to be afraid. Even if you're not fired from your job, you will easily be passed over for promotions. I would strongly advise graduate students who are skeptical of Darwinian theory not to make their views known.\" \n \n By the way, you may be wondering why I don't here simply provide a list of peer-reviewed articles by design theorists from the biological literature that support intelligent design. The reason is that I want to spare those authors the harassment they would receive if I listed their work in this book. Overzealous critics of intelligent design regard it as their moral duty to keep biology free from intelligent design, even if that means taking extreme measures. I've know such critics to contact design theorists employers and notify them of the \"heretics\" in their midst. Once \"outed,\" the design theorists themselves get harassed and harangued with e-mails. Next, the press does a story mentioning their unsavory intelligent design associations. (The day one story appeared, a close friend and colleague of mine mentioned in the story was dismissed from his research position at a prestigious molecular biology laboratory. He had worked in that lab for 10 years) Hereafter, the first thing that an internet search of their names reveals is their connection with intelligent design. Welcome to the inquisition. \n\n \n One more thing from Dembski about your beloved peer review;\n \n \nLack of peer review has never barred the emergence of good science. Nor, for that matter, have peer reviewed journals been the sole place where groundbreaking scientific work was done. As I noted, the peer review process is inherently conservative, working nicely for filtering good incremental science from less rigorous work within an established paradigm, but it is lousy at opening its arms to a scientific revolution; they have too much invested in the old paradigm. The most important revolutions in science by-passed the peer review process entirely and appeared in books. Copernicus's \"De Revolutionibus\", Galileo's \"On Two World Systems\", and Newton's \"Principia\" are cases in point. None of these works were peer-reviewed. Nor was that book by a retiring English biologist from the nineteenth century - an unconventional work titled \"On the Origin of Species\". \n\n \n \nI was being quite literal, talking about evolutionary theory predicting what we will find under rocks :) You seem to be trying to make some unrelated abstract point about naturalism - may I take it from that you aren't planning to disagree with evolutionary theory's practical utility? \n\n \n I'd like to see some basic outlines of where evolutionary theory is practical. I'd like to compare it to areas where political application of evolutionary theory can be dangerous. \n \n \nBecause, of course, science has never discovered anything previously unsuspected, has it? :) \n\n \n Nothing that would disturb its faith in Darwinism, and it never will. \n \n \nThis really is getting tiresome. Evolution speaks to common descent, not first life, and in terms of enabling successful, practical day-to-day science it works very well. \n\n \n Briefly, what is practical day-to-day science, and how does common descent speak to it in ways that biology cannot? \n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000_______And a lot of things on earth \"work\" much better in view of creation than in naturalism. Just because they may not be scientific things does not make them any less real. \n\n \n \nSuch as?\n\n \n The Biblical claim that humans are distinct from animals. The Biblical claim that humans have behavior standards beyond those of animals. Things that cause political beliefs to take off in opposite directions from those who disregard Genesis, and subsequently the rest of the Bible. \n \n \nEvolution explains common descent; that's what it tries to deal with and it succeeds. You want to complain because the spanner of evolution won't cut the two-by-four of abiogenesis. For all your talk of fancy guttering and missing foundations, you haven't actually presented one single argument - ever, to my recollection - to support the claim that origin of first life really is the foundation of evolutionary theory. You just keep saying it. \n\n \n I believe futile searches for it are a big part of science. You don't agree? You would ask me to prove that? \n \n \nOnce again, you insinuate that I am lying about my reasons for rejecting the results of ID. Please don't do that any more - either engage on a scientific level or accept my statements in good faith. I have explicitly clarified my position on the topic already: the work produced by ID so far doesn't work. \n\n \n Sheesh, where did this come from? You've accused me of \"pretending\", of \"derailing\" your thread. I've been called a liar many times on these forums, (not necessarily by you) it doesn't bother me because I know that everything I say is sincere to my belief, my worldview. I've never called you a liar, I could say you're ~blinded by your worldview~. Is that fair? Remember, evolutions main leader Dawkins, says those who aren't evolutionists are \"ignorant, stupid, insane, or wicked\". You won't find rudeness like that from ID leaders. Did he engage in a scientific level with those words? \n \n I'd like for you to engage on a more philosophical level. I'd like to know your solution to the big problem of the \"extreme measures\" that Dembski described above. It's not scientific to harass people, to bombard them with emails, to get them fired from their job. \n \n \n2008 years after what, indeed! It was never anything more than a centuries-belated estimate, several times revised. Its value is in its present ubiquity as a reference point, nothing more. \n \n Again, you're trying to say that truth is in the eye of the beholder, that a thing counts as real if people believe in it. I disagree. I say a thing is real if, when you act in a way that depends upon it being real, your expectations are reliably met. I think that's a higher standard of reality than belief. \n\n \n I think the truth is in the pages of the Bible. It's had more peer-review than Darwinism. I act in a way that depends on it being real, just as I'm sure you a act in a way that depends on evolution being real. How did you learn about your beliefs? Probably the same way I did mine, by reading about them. \n \n \nStatisticians are right if and when the mathematical models they produce work. The models that work - that make accurate predictions about reality - don't include luck. Ergo, statisticians don't tend to believe in luck. It's frankly terrifying to think that you would eagerly throw what is, amongst other things, the bedrock of medical science in the trash for the sake of better representing a popular worldview in the maths classroom.\n \n First life is not the foundation of evolution. The observation of common descent is what evolution explains, and hence is the foundation for the theory.\n\n \n You're about to get what you seek most of all - the last word. I'll PM you when I'm ready to grant it. But not until I'm finished with what I have to say.",

   "\n \n \n http://www.discovery.org/a/2640\n \n\n \n On reading that link, I have to wonder how someone can think publciation to the discovery institutes own news letter, and papers to philosophy journals to be 'peer reviewed'.\n \n The other publication they are pushing as 'peer reviewed' is not a peer reviewed journal at all. Dishonesty reigns supreme.\n \n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinism,_Design_and_Public_Education \n \n \n\n It flopped? Are you a scientific peer reviewer? In only a few weeks, it had over 1 million viewers, making it the highest rated documentary in 2008, and the 12th highest rated documentary in history. It was apparently short-lived in the theaters because of a lawsuit by Yoko Ono, an evolutionist with a lot of money and very little else, including brains. Though I'd say she had plenty of encouragement and financial aid. The suit was eventually dismissed. \n \n http://www.expelledthemovie.com/News.php\n \n\n No, it had a short run in the theaters because of lack of interest. It grossed 3.2 million in it's first weekend, the producers claimed ahead of time that if it didn't gross at least 12, it was a failure.\n \n The lawsuit from Yoko Ono was dismissed, even though permission to use imagine was gotten on misinformation.\n \n I suspect what Yoko Ono disliked was having \"Imagine\" being linked with nazi clips.",

   "I should have provided links to show that you were wrong, I'll do that now. If you type intelligent desgin into the talk origins archive search, you get 416 links, all, or almost all of them have \"intelligent design\" in the title. \n\n Just to be thorough, I visited every one of those links. Although Google said there were 416, there were in fact only 283 with the rest omitted as 'very similar'. Here's a summary of what lay beyond them:\n [*]55 hits were of links within pages or contained the search words but no related content.[*]87 hits (mostly archived transcripts of correspondence with readers) debunked strawman arguments against evolution or science in general, presented evidence supporting it, or contained only passing references to ID or something being 'intelligently designed'[*]19 hits concerned general arguments about the necessity of design, or its emulation via variation and selection .[*]10 hits concerned the politics of ID[*]13 hits discussed the scientific status of ID or the supposed 'controversy', or creationist claims to that effect.[*]80 hits covered the Dover trial or other court proceedings[*]3 articles mentioned core ID principles in passing[*]3 articles directly addressed popular press ID publications[*]2 directly addressed popular press publications critical of evolution[*]1 articles directly addressed creationist responses to critiques of ID's work[*]10 articles were devoted to addressing core ID principles:\n Of these last, 4 of them overlapped in that they were brief and economical rebuttals to slightly different statements about supposedly irreducibly complex biological systems, with a fourth being a more in-depth treatment of the Mullerian two-step (a simple and obvious solution to the supposed 'problem' presented by IC biological systems) and a fifth being a followup with concrete examples. Another was a terse demolition of Dembski's 'conservation of information'. \n \n What was it I said again? Oh yes:\n \nTalk origins has 'hundreds of pages' of rebuttals to various creationist claims, some of which address the small amount of work produced by ID. So I suppose if we stretch the definition of 'about design' to include any claim on any topic made by a person who believes in design, then I was wrong\n\n Does 2.5% count as 'some'? :)\n \nFor your \"small amount of work\" claim, I can only c/p part of my post #4, from our formal debate 1 1/2 years ago; \n\n Yes, that's all you can do, because nothing's changed since then. You still don't list any work, only scientists (or rather the universities they came from).\n \nIf evolutionists want to comfort themselves by saying no one's talking about it, that's fine - they do seem to be ignoring it as much as they possibly can.\n\n So they're simultaneously furious and panic-stricken and 'still coming to terms' and hosing out a deafening cacophony of thousands of rebuttals to 'shout down' ID... and ignoring it as much as they possibly can. I see.\n \nI thought yet another attack on design by evolution could possibly be moved from the standard launch into a few very specific details into a more general look at an ideology that so often goes beyond the scientific evidence.\n\n So yes, you thought you'd change the subject and derail the thread. That's fine - I went along with it because there were no other takers and we might as well talk about something.\n \nI guess it differs from the norm because I've never noticed it being done before on 4forums, and therefore have never seen an attempt to refute it before. The conflict between evolution and ID is far different than any other conflict in any other branch of science. It is a large part of a culture war - purpose vs non-purpose, ten commandments vs no ten commandments, liberty vs socialism, republican vs democrat. The \"war for hearts and minds\" - a phrase from your OP. Voters and future generations.\n\n You're grossly oversimplifying. It's not a case of white hats vs black hats; there are many nuanced views about the direction societies should take. You're just one minority among many in that respect, as am I.\n \n That's one problem. The other is that you seem to think that the struggle for hearts and minds is all there is, and that by disagreeing with you I'm somehow claiming that there isn't a struggle for hearts and minds. I'm not claiming that at all. What I'm saying is that there is a standard of truth besides 'whatever people can be persuaded to believe' or 'what we would like to be true', and that common descent and evolutionary theory pass that standard while ID does not.\n \nThen why did you start this thread? Evolution has its victory in the courts - the peer-review special interest seems pretty good at ignoring it. Why does the subject often come up, with no recent definable provocation from some ID special interest?\n\n I brought it up because a recent discussion had got me thinking about design, about what it really was and what causes the 'common sense' detection of design we employ every day to misfire. I think it's an interesting topic which throws into sharper relief the task ahead of Dembski et al - which further inspired me to question whether or not that task is something they would even need to tackle.\n \nThey are often conflated! I'm trying to separate detail in narrow paths (scientific controversy) from the full blown materialist cosmology (political controversy) - the one we see in books by Dawkins, Harris, Stenger, Dennett. \n\n I confess I'm unable to see how any of the arguments you've made bear that out. All I've seen is flat rejection of any attempt to discuss scientific details. Is that what you mean by 'separate'?\n \nIt seems that you and others attempt to support Dawkins, Harris, Stenger, Dennett with small details (scientific controversy), while distancing yourselves from the overall picture they present (political controversy). \n\n Is there supposed to be something wrong with that? Should I profess to prefer the same flavour crisps as Dawkins as well, lest I invalidate my agreement with his scientific conclusions?\n \n This is what I mean when I say you show no interest in seperating issues, only conflating them. You have a very 'all or nothing' attitude. Genesis must be right, otherwise Christianity, and by extension all religion, falls. Evolution must be wrong, otherwise liberal socialist earth-worshippers (feel free to insert any perjoratives I've missed) must be right about everything. There's no room for nuance, for people to be right and wrong about different things and for different reasons.\n \nIt may not have sank scientifically speaking, it may have sank atheistically speaking. \n\n What does that even mean? Can you refute the evidence showing there's no scientific ID controversy, or not?\n \nThe best way for science to defend itself against the creationist PR campaign would be to turn off its hollow atheist campaign! Why can't it do that? \n\n Because in order to accomplish that in your eyes, science would have to throw out every result you've decided is 'atheistic'. You still don't get it: evolution and common descent aren't religious or atheistic; they're true. They've passed tests more stringent than 'can we persuade someone to believe this?' ID has not, so we shouldn't teach it as if it has.\n \n<Foundations of evolutionary theory not being abiogenesis< I don't recall you ever explaining it, you've only stated it. If evolutionists have a right over ID proponents to define what evolution is, then ID proponents have the right over evolutionists to define what ID is\n\n Why is it always about rights and never about being right? Doesn't that count for anything?\n \n Evolution isn't based on common descent merely because I say so and I'm an 'evolutionist', it's based on common descent because it's a theory aimed at explaining the observation of common descent. There's no subjective wriggle-room here. That's the phenomenon it explains.\n \nWhen the talkorigins guy says this about ID; <design theory needs to address the designer< What gives him the authority in ID to proclaim that? He shows no interest in design, what makes him an authority on it? \n\n Again, it's not about authority, it's about being logically right. Several fields of science involve design, and all of them exist for the specific purpose of learning about the designer - for the simple reason that that's all one can learn by studying design. Suppose you conclude that a thing was designed. What have you learned? Unless from that information you can begin to model the methods or motives of the designer, you have nothing with which to inform future research. You can't even use what you've found to recognise other examples of design, because that would entail making assumptions about consistent methods or goals. \n \n<with regards to your failure to prove double standards in science< If you would try putting science out of your mind for just a moment and ask yourself if what I'm saying isn't obvious to some people in the real world.\n\n It's deeply ironic that you think we have to set science aside to learn about the 'real world' :)\n \n Of course it's obvious that there's a struggle for hearts and minds. I'm not disputing that. And evolution and ID are caught up in it, no argument there either. But the story you're telling yourself about the roles they play is purely based on the 'sides' you think they favour, so your story is flawed.\n \n I don't see any evidence anywhere that indicates that anything else in science has come under attack like ID has.\n\n So no other scientific papers have ever been peer-reviewed, or failed those reviews? No other work in any other field has ever been debunked? Astrology and alchemy are still respected fields of research? Of course that's not the case. So why don't we stop pretending that ID has received special treatment in science, hmm?\n \n How about in the wider world? Certainly there's a degree of political controversy - I wonder why that could be? Who instigated the Dover trial? Dawkins, maybe? No: eleven parents - you know, 'real world' people - who were unhappy with their school board violating the constitution. ID plays a good victim, but it's far from the truth.\n \nI have done that. Evolutionists establish criteria for ID that they don't establish for evolution. You're allowed to say this;\n \n *Origin of first life is not the foundation for evolution.\n\n Yes, because it's logically correct. Gravity does not need to explain how the apple gets into the tree. You may personally feel that the apple getting into the tree is the more important or interesting question, but that doesn't make it gravity's responsibility to answer it.\n \nAnd ID proponents say this;\n \n *Agent and purpose is not the foundation for study of design. \n\n Actually, I think they say it's not the object of that study. But assuming it were possible to detect design 'in the raw', what would you learn from such an endeavour except knowledge about the designer? \n \nBy agreeing with the first statement and not the second, evolutionists show a double standard. \n\n Correct and incorrect do not a double standard make. One statement passes muster as logical, the other does not.\n \nIt would tend to counter atheistic evolution, a politically motivated waste of time and money.\n\n Except evolution hasn't been a waste of time and money. It's been very, very useful. Medical science depends upon it. Feeding the world depends upon it. Evolution is the key that unlocks biology.\n \nSince evolution is not about origins, it doesn't necessarily mean that evolutionists aren't interested in naturalistic origins. Is it science for evolutionists to look for, or speculate about naturalistic origins in the science classroom? \n\n As I think I said before (and if I didn't, I should have), the more sure we are about something the earlier it is appropriate to teach it. Right now, I think theories of abiogenesis are insufficiently mature to be taught early on in any but the most general terms.\n \nIf ID is also allowed in the science classroom, I would say that searches and speculation about abiogenesis are more legitimate than they are if ID is politically blocked. \n \n If ID is blocked, atheistic origins should also be blocked. If ID is not blocked, then open inquiry and truth would best be served if naturalistic origins were not blocked. \n\n ID isn't blocked. Its proponents are free to search and speculate all they like. What they haven't done is achieve anything worthy of the science classroom. You really must start distinguishing between the classroom and the cutting edge of science.\n \nIf good science is loaded with politics, it's not good science.\n\n And that's where we disagree. Politics is never desirable, but it's irrelevant to the veracity of a scientific result.\n \nI'm saying TO's statement is a double standard! Are you trying to pretend that evolutionists don't take any interest in naturalistic origins?\n\n Of course not. That still doesn't make gravity responsible for the apple being in the tree.\n \nCan you understand how upsetting it is for ID proponents to see abiogenesis and primordial soup dreaming established in the scientific realm/ the science classroom?\n\n It's not a dream that first life was microbial in nature; that's something we're very sure of. How did that first life arise? Well, we can say 'it was designed' and leave it at that, or we can say 'well, we've no particular reason to stop extrapolating backward at this stage, so let's just keep going and see how far we get'. That's the real reason naturalistic hypotheses of abiogenesis get airtime: there's nothing to say about supernatural hypotheses apart from expressing an opinion that they happened.\n \nHow does abiogenesis register on the scale? Since it's atheistic and doesn't threaten the Darwinism faith (just like anthropogenic global warming) I'll bet it's high on the scale. \n\n I think maybe you misunderstood. In terms of controversy generated, ID barely registers on the scale of debunked hypotheses.\n \n<The same could be said about five minutes, or two seconds, or one picosecond ago. All we have are models that tell us what to expect, and if what they tell us to expect is borne out, the model is a good one.< No it can't, we have something other than science to tell us what happened a few minutes, hours, or hundreds of years ago. Written history means something. Personal human experiences mean something. \n\n I didn't say science. I said models. The models we all use to guide our actions and expectations. Consider:\n \n When you talk about 'personal human experience', you're not actually talking about the past, you're talking about the data stored in your brain right now. In your day to day life you act as if that data accurately represents the real past and is a good guide to what the future holds. And if your brain is functioning properly that behaviour will work. The milk you remember buying really will be in the fridge when you get up in the morning. That's the acid test, and it applies every bit as well to biblical writings as it does to your shopping list. If I take certain parts of the bible at face value - as I once did, don't forget - my expectations differ wildly from reality. I don't expect to find literal mountains of evidence that the solar system is billions of years old. I don't expect to find fossils. I don't expect life to fall into a nested hierarchy of forms. I don't expect to find anything like as much limestone in the ground. I don't expect to find insect burrows riddling a zillion individual layers of shale that were supposedly all laid down in a single month. I don't expect human embryos to grow and then reabsorb gills and prehensile tails. I don't expect whales to have vestigial hind legs. On and on and on it goes. If Genesis were a memory of mine I would be forced to conclude, however my senses might revolt at the prospect, that I simply imagined it.\n \nThe best way to answer you is to quote Dembski himself, from one of his books;\n <snip<\n By the way, you may be wondering why I don't here simply provide a list of peer-reviewed articles by design theorists from the biological literature that support intelligent design. The reason is that I want to spare those authors the harassment they would receive if I listed their work in this book.\n\n There's always an excuse, isn't there?\n \nOne more thing from Dembski about your beloved peer review;\n\n \nWiki: Peer review has been a touchstone of modern scientific method only since the middle of the 20th century, the only exception being medicine. Before then, its application was lax in other scientific fields.\n\n \nI'd like to see some basic outlines of where evolutionary theory is practical. I'd like to compare it to areas where political application of evolutionary theory can be dangerous. \n\n Medicine. Agriculture. Paleontology. Genetics. Biology.\n \n If you're going to talk about social Darwinism or eugenics, bear in mind that that was the application of what a few people believed evolutionary theory had to say about the desirable structure of society. Such beliefs unfortunately preceded our understanding of the evolution of altruism.\n \nBriefly, what is practical day-to-day science, and how does common descent speak to it in ways that biology cannot? \n\n A brief response.\n \nThe Biblical claim that humans are distinct from animals. The Biblical claim that humans have behavior standards beyond those of animals.\n\n Neither of these observations require a biblical standpoint. Indeed, evolution helps us understand exactly why we are different from other animals in the ways we are, how our developing intellect and physical form and complex society are intertwined. We are the way we are because it works being that way. That's very, very good news: far from human life being a losing battle to overcome a 'natural' reversion to bestial savagery, our altruistic, caring nature is the winning formula. \n \n<abiogenesis again< I believe futile searches for it are a big part of science. You don't agree? You would ask me to prove that? \n\n So your answer to my challenge is the same as before: change the subject. Can I finally take it that you have no answer? You have nothing to substantiate your claim that abiogenesis underpins evolution? Great.\n \nSheesh, where did this come from? You've accused me of \"pretending\", of \"derailing\" your thread.\n\n You've explicitly stated your intention was to derail the thread. You've said at least twice now that you didn't think it ought to be about what I started it to be.\n \nI've never called you a liar, I could say you're ~blinded by your worldview~. Is that fair?\n\n Not if you can't substantiate it. I've given my logical reasons for not taking ID on board, yes? You're saying that I don't dispute ID for logical reasons but because of my 'worldview'. How is that not accusing me of lying?\n \nRemember, evolutions main leader Dawkins, says those who aren't evolutionists are \"ignorant, stupid, insane, or wicked\". You won't find rudeness like that from ID leaders. Did he engage in a scientific level with those words? \n\n 'Ignorant' is not an insult. If you feel insulted, you must be putting yourself in one of the other categories :)\n \n Seriously, though, like I've said before I don't agree with Dawkins about everything. Why do you feel I should? To his list I would add 'Motivated by something other than a desire to be correct'.\n \nI'd like for you to engage on a more philosophical level. I'd like to know your solution to the big problem of the \"extreme measures\" that Dembski described above. It's not scientific to harass people, to bombard them with emails, to get them fired from their job. \n\n Bring something other than hearsay to the table and I'll be happy to talk about it. I despise bullying in any guise. At the same time, ID creationism laid its cards very firmly on the table from the outset: it has a specific agenda which involves replacing science with Christianity. I seem to recall saying once upon a time that such behaviour risked making it harder for ID to be taken seriously as a discipline, in much the same way as catastrophism was for a time persona non grata thanks to the determination of its early adherents to prove biblical catastrophism specifically, rather than following the evidence with an open mind.\n \nI think the truth is in the pages of the Bible. It's had more peer-review than Darwinism. I act in a way that depends on it being real, just as I'm sure you a act in a way that depends on evolution being real. How did you learn about your beliefs? Probably the same way I did mine, by reading about them.\n\n Now you're getting the hang of it! :)\n \n There is truth in the bible, I'm quite sure of that. And you're not going to come to any harm in your day to day life being wrong about Genesis. But when you start telling science which way it should or should not go - that's tantamount to Eanassir being put in charge of sending probes to Mars. It's all going to go horribly wrong, because you're locked into a belief that is firmly at odds with reality, and no amount of AiG apologia is going to make that belief useful in terms of biology or medicine etc.\n \n You've tried to argue several times now that 'blocking' ID (which nobody is doing anyway) would compromise the likelihood of future revelations. In the enduring spirit of 'pot and kettle' demolition of that argument, I give you part of the closing arguments from the Dover trial:\n \n I showed Professor Behe more than 50 articles, as well as books, on the evolution of the immune system. He had not read most of them, but he confidently, contemptuously dismissed them as inadequate. He testified that it's a waste of time to look for answers about how the immune system evolved.\n \n Thankfully, there are scientists who do search for answers to the question of the origin of the immune system. It's the immune system. It's our defense against debilitating and fatal diseases. The scientists who wrote those books and articles toil in obscurity, without book royalties or speaking engagements. Their efforts help us combat and cure serious medical conditions. By contrast, Professor Behe and the entire intelligent design movement are doing nothing to advance scientific or medical knowledge and are telling future generations of scientists, don't bother.\n \n\n \nYou're about to get what you seek most of all - the last word. I'll PM you when I'm ready to grant it. But not until I'm finished with what I have to say.\n\n No, please, be my guest. I think I've made my case; if you want to finish up go right ahead.",

You still don't list any work, only scientists (or rather the universities they came from). \n\n \n With enough bombardment with emails (that Dembski referred to) - enough firings from jobs, nothing will probably ever change. Evolutionists are in the drivers seat. Harris and Dawkins crusade to eradicate religion is taking charge.

That's fine - I went along with it because there were no other takers and we might as well talk about something. \n\n \n I did not derail the thread. Your opening post contained some scientific observations, but it also contained some not-so-scientific statements, such as; \"ID probably doesn't care\", \"The real agenda - as publicly stated by creationists\", and \"ID doesn't want to play fair.\" These and others in that post were political statements. To compare your statements and accusations to other sciences politics wasn't derailing the thread. \n \n I suspect your accusation of derailing are probably because the thread didn't go as you intended. Evolutionists greatly outnumber creationists on 4forums. There have been lots of anti creation lovefests here - it appears you were seeking that more than anything else. Seeking to \"talk about' it, in a less than scientific way. \n \n \n \nYou're grossly oversimplifying.

Dawkins and Harris like the big religion eradicating advantage they now have in the science classroom. Some of what Dawkins and Harris does misfires, however. \n \n \nI confess I'm unable to see how any of the arguments you've made bear that out.

Evolution must be wrong, otherwise liberal socialist earth-worshippers (feel free to insert any perjoratives I've missed) must be right about everything. There's no room for nuance, for people to be right and wrong about different things and for different reasons. \n\n \n Both positions have those characteristics. In yours, evolution must be right, otherwise biology, and by extension all science falls. Genesis must be wrong, otherwise crazed flat-earthers or ID proponents will take over science classrooms!! It's alright for people to be right and wrong, for all the nuances to work their way through the political process, as long as the godless, global warming believers control science. As long as one major decision process is controlled by your side. I agree there are nuanced views, but the fact is that many are that way because of a lack of information or interest, and usually have to take a choice between the black or white hat. Political decisions that everyone in a society has to abide by are often black and white. \n \n \nBecause in order to accomplish that in your eyes, science would have to throw out every result you've decided is 'atheistic'. You still don't get it: evolution and common descent aren't religious or atheistic; they're true. They've passed tests more stringent than 'can we persuade someone to believe this?' ID has not, so we shouldn't teach it as if it has. \n\n \n \n Not my desicion, the general publics decision. I don't think a perfect standard of truth can be established by prehistoric events that were not directly observed, and I'm not alone. If evolutionists disagree with that, that's fine. But it doesn't make them \"right\". \n \n I agree that there is a standard of truth besides what people can be persuaded to believe, but that also includes being persuaded by science, or what atheists would like to be true. The 66 book Protestant Bible is the ultimate standard of truth IMO. It's stood the test of time. The best test for a standard of truth. \n \n You've made it clear that you believe that common descent is established fact, comparable to my belief that Christianity is established fact. \n \n I believe you and most other evolutionists arrived at your beliefs the same way I arrived at mine. Nobody starts studying these types of things with completely open minds, arriving at a conclusion only as the result of weighing all the evidence. I was told as a child that God created everything we see, and that when the time was right, he lived on earth for a short time in the form of a man. I'd bet you were told as a child that God may not or does not exist, and science holds answers to alternative views. Worldviews aren't the end result of years or decades of study, they're arrived at fairly quickly, and future evidence is molded to fit the predetermined conclusion. There are exceptions to every rule of course, some will convert from one belief to another later in life, but from what I see it's very rare, and rarer still when science has anything to do with it.\n \n \nWhy is it always about rights and never about being right? Doesn't that count for anything?\n \n Evolution isn't based on common descent merely because I say so and I'm an 'evolutionist', it's based on common descent because it's a theory aimed at explaining the observation of common descent. There's no subjective wriggle-room here. That's the phenomenon it explains.\n \n Again, it's not about authority, it's about being logically right. Several fields of science involve design, and all of them exist for the specific purpose of learning about the designer - for the simple reason that that's all one can learn by studying design. Suppose you conclude that a thing was designed. What have you learned? Unless from that information you can begin to model the methods or motives of the designer, you have nothing with which to inform future research. You can't even use what you've found to recognise other examples of design, because that would entail making assumptions about consistent methods or goals. \n\n \n Suppose you \"learn\" that something with order and complexity was NOT designed. What have you learned? Unless from that information you can begin to model atheism, and political methods and motives of atheists, you have nothing to offer insight into biological complexity. Things like detailed, testable, mechanistic models for the origin of life, the origin of the genetic code, the origin of molecular machines like the bacterial flagellum. Speaking of assumptions, there are gaps in evolution that haven't changed a bit since Darwins time. \n \n So again, as happens often, you accuse ID of problems that evolution has. \n \n \n \n \nIt's deeply ironic that you think we have to set science aside to learn about the 'real world' :)\n \n Of course it's obvious that there's a struggle for hearts and minds. I'm not disputing that. And evolution and ID are caught up in it, no argument there either. But the story you're telling yourself about the roles they play is purely based on the 'sides' you think they favour, so your story is flawed.\n\n \n You seem to see less of a threat in neutrality than I do. Less of a threat of politically determined upsets in the struggle. I see only two sides for the struggle for hearts and minds. If you think \"theistic evolution\" is neutral, check how well aligned they are politically and scientifically with atheists. I know, it's because they're \"right\". emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Evolution may be based on common descent, but seems to be sliding into the belief that biology is based on common descent. It seems that ALL biological change, from blood clotting to resistance to disease to genetic heritages - present-day here-and-now biology that 100 years ago were attributed by many scientists to the way God designed things - are now being molded into evolution in ways that previous scientists didn't do it. Is it a scientific molding, or an atheistic molding? \n \n \nSo no other scientific papers have ever been peer-reviewed, or failed those reviews? No other work in any other field has ever been debunked? Astrology and alchemy are still respected fields of research? Of course that's not the case. So why don't we stop pretending that ID has received special treatment in science, hmm? \n\n \n I think you need to stop pretending that peer review is some kind of perfect solution to every disagreement there is in science. It's clear to me that many, if not most evolutionist peer reviewers aren't even going to read anything presented by an ID advocate without rejecting it automatically. \n \n \nActually, I think they say it's not the object of that study. But assuming it were possible to detect design 'in the raw', what would you learn from such an endeavour except knowledge about the designer? \n\n \n Is it really \"open inquiry\" to have to explain every possible thing that a method of study could uncover? Do evolutionists do that? Do global warming advocates do that? \n \n \nCorrect and incorrect do not a double standard make. One statement passes muster as logical, the other does not.\n \n Except evolution hasn't been a waste of time and money. It's been very, very useful. Medical science depends upon it. Feeding the world depends upon it. Evolution is the key that unlocks biology. \n\n \n We'll have to get into detail some time in the future in other threads, about how important a belief in common descent is to things like medicine and world hunger in current times. If common descent would tend to make a move from science to philosophy in some cases. \n \n \nIt's not a dream that first life was microbial in nature; that's something we're very sure of. How did that first life arise? Well, we can say 'it was designed' and leave it at that, or we can say 'well, we've no particular reason to stop extrapolating backward at this stage, so let's just keep going and see how far we get'. That's the real reason naturalistic hypotheses of abiogenesis get airtime: there's nothing to say about supernatural hypotheses apart from expressing an opinion that they happened. \n\n \n There could easily be more to say about design hypothesis vs the clumsiness, incompetence, randomness of evolution. Some evolutionists have proved that they want to go so far as to find out why we laugh when we are amused, what causes obesity, anorexia nervosa, certain business negotiations, or a preference for tropical landscapes, roots of political rhetoric, maternal love, marriage, divorce, fenimism, greed, warfare, adultery, republicans, democrats, world hunger, the fact that men are really pigs, etc. etc. etc. A scientific application of randomness to these things isn't guaranteed to yield more useful results than an application of design to these things, even with no identification of the designer whatsoever. \n \n \nThere's always an excuse, isn't there? \n\n \n It's the truth - can I use that word just as confidently as you do? It is documented in \"Expelled\". I saw it once in a theater a few months ago - like drinking from a fire hydrant - not possible to perfectly repeat all the information it contained. I have a copy of the DVD on order, then I'll be able to stop, reverse, freeze, and repeat anything it has. (test /repeat / observe :p) I'll probably start a thread on it eventually. After the dust settles from the elections. \n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000___I'd like to see some basic outlines of where evolutionary theory is practical. I'd like to compare it to areas where political application of evolutionary theory can be dangerous. \n\n \n \nMedicine. Agriculture. Paleontology. Genetics. Biology.\n \n If you're going to talk about social Darwinism or eugenics, bear in mind that that was the application of what a few people believed evolutionary theory had to say about the desirable structure of society. Such beliefs unfortunately preceded our understanding of the evolution of altruism. \n\n \n Is the evolution of altruism present in ever increasing economic failure throughout the world? National debt, personal debt, ever increasing laziness and dependence on government? \n \n \nBring something other than hearsay to the table and I'll be happy to talk about it. I despise bullying in any guise. At the same time, ID creationism laid its cards very firmly on the table from the outset: it has a specific agenda which involves replacing science with Christianity. I seem to recall saying once upon a time that such behaviour risked making it harder for ID to be taken seriously as a discipline, in much the same way as catastrophism was for a time persona non grata thanks to the determination of its early adherents to prove biblical catastrophism specifically, rather than following the evidence with an open mind. \n\n \n Yet Dawkins and Harris - and all their readers - equally lay their cards on the table with equal firmness - they have a specific agenda which involves replacing religion with atheism, replacing tradition with science. It would be nice if such behavior risked making it harder for evolutionism to be taken seriously within science, to the same degree it has in the general population. \n \n \n \nNow you're getting the hang of it! :)\n \n There is truth in the bible, I'm quite sure of that. And you're not going to come to any harm in your day to day life being wrong about Genesis. But when you start telling science which way it should or should not go - that's tantamount to Eanassir being put in charge of sending probes to Mars. It's all going to go horribly wrong, because you're locked into a belief that is firmly at odds with reality, and no amount of AiG apologia is going to make that belief useful in terms of biology or medicine etc. \n\n \n It may help me out with money management, relations with other people, how to vote in the next 1 1/2 weeks, etc. It's a good trade off for me. :)\n \n \nNo, please, be my guest. I think I've made my case; if you want to finish up go right ahead.\n\n \n And I've made my case about double standards - variations throughout science concerning open inquiry, indications that human imperfection may compromise truth more than many realize, in ways that may surprise them later in this life, or in the life to come. \n \n Now I'm done with this thread - I appreciate your time. From your post #23 about \"anthropogenic global warming\"; \n \n \nI think I do, actually - when I have time I'll put something together and start a thread to discuss it. \n\n \n I'll keep watch for it, and I hope you'll watch for an \"Expelled\" thread in the coming months. emoticon_xbouncer",
