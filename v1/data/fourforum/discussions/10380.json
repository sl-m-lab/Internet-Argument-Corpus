   "I hold these truths to be self-evident and undeniable: all religions are man-made and self-centered (gimme prayers), self-seeking (\"eternal life\"), and self-glorifying (a shining soul). They all promise those who accept their dogmas \"life everlasting.\" They are all belief systems that deny death. All require belief in a magical transition to a paradise after death, besides believing in imaginary, invisible deities with whom they can talk directly.\n \n In a hospital, a person who believes in and talks to imaginary beings is considered mentally ill. Religious beliefs are a form of mental illness. Organized religion is the most dangerous, divisive, and destructive force in the world.",

   "If God were to perform maracles, how would we know that they were not a cheap magic trick? And God has authenticated himself through predictions made in the bible, all of which have come true. May I suggest reading the book \"Christianity: The Faith That Makes Sense\". It is a short read and only costs five bucks. It gives a decent overview of the reasons for investing your faith in Christianity.\n \n And as far as saying that anyone who has faith in anything that they cannot prove is insane... is insane.

   "Religion has more than its fair share of bad ideas. And it remains the only system of thought, where the process of maintaining bad ideas in perpetual immunity from criticism is considered a sacred act. This is the act of faith. And I remain convinced that religious faith is one of the most perverse misuses of intelligence we have ever devised. So we will, inevitably, continue to criticize religious thinking.\n \n Sam Harris",
