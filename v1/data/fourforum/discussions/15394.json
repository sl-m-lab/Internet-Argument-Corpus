   "The reason why gun bans are silly is simple.\n \n Criminals will get their hands on them no matter what you do. When civilians have them, it becomes drastically harder for criminals to do any thing. You go to hold up a store, with gun control, no one but the criminal has a gun. Without, you could be legally shot from any of the customers, from the store owner, at any time. The risk versus reward goes down, and so does crime.",
