   "I love the truth of this piece\n http://www.republicoft.com/2006/11/08/split-me-baby-one-more-time/#more-492\n \n esp. this quote\n \n \nBut Britney&#8217;s union does not make a mockery of marriage, nor are either of her marriages a &#8220;deep crisis&#8221; for society or &#8220;part of the new ideology of evil.&#8221; Mine, on the other hand, is shaking the very foundations of civilization, and weakening every marriage within a 100 mile radius, probably causing another divorce as we speak.\n\n \n and this one\n \nYet, in both of Spears&#8217; marriages she&#8217;s enjoyed benefits and protections that my husband and I are do not, even though the depth of our commitment to one another and our family is no less than Spears&#8217; commitment to hers. And though her first husband didn&#8217;t sign a pre-nup, while her second husband probably did, they both had rights and protections in the midst of divorce that same-sex couples do not, including custody and visitation rights. And it goes without saying that their children get all the benefits and protections of having parents who can legally marry. Ours do not. \n \n Someone, please, tell me &#8212; explain it to me like I&#8217;m four years old (or like I&#8217;m Britney Spears) &#8212; where is the justice in all of the above?\n\n \n I may use the former as a new tag line.",

Why do you think celebrities and their commonly short-lived marriages their marriage would have any bearing on the gay marriage issue?\n\n \n I know this is not my fight, but I gotta chime in. My guess would be that Matthew feels that it is rediculous that we allow XXXXXX like Spears and her retarded husband all the rights and privileges of marriage, even though they have a long historical track record of doing nothing more than making a mockery of the \"traditional values\" that the anti-gay crowd so happily screams about. These celebrities are in constant view and public spotlight, yet little condemnation is heard about their role in making a mockery of the \"sacred insitution of marriage\". It seems to be the contention of some that it is not OK to allow 2 gay people to marry, because this might send a signal to our children and society in general that it is OK to be gay. Yet, we hear no loud condemnation over people getting married on a whim, over the fact that 60% of our coupled households are unmarried, that there is a continuing decline in the number of people getting married in this country, and that the people who are getting married are getting divorced at alarming rates. These things go on in plain view of the anti-gay marriage crowd every day, but little if anything is ever really heard about it. \n \n Which sets a worse example for our kids:\n \n 2 gay men living in a stable and committed relationship\n -or-\n 1 man and 1 women getting married on a whim in Vegas and then getting divorced the next day, or getting married and getting divorced 2 years later while arguing about who keeps the kids and who gets the rights to the sex tape, and who gets to take the majority of the fortune...\n \n These \"defenders\" of traditional marriage and \"family values\" don't seem to see the hypocrisy in it, or perhaps don't want to see the hypocrisy in it. It seems as though they are ignoring the great plank in their own eye, while trying to pull the splinter out of the gay guy's eye. Sad.\n \n \nWOW no comments on this?

Or is that you all know that by allowing Britney and other heterosexuals to do just what Britney did it is hypocrisy not to let gay people get married?\n\n \n And I have to ask, did you mean sanctity or sanity? As a veteran of 8 years of marriage, I would have to say that marriage holds neither of these concepts. As I have always said, marriage is a great institution...if you like living in institutions.",

   "Sadly, most conservatives are not going to touch this post with a ten foot pole. The reason is that is blows off the \"sanctity\" of marriage stuff. It is tough to see or visualize Brittany's flings of marriage to be \"god given\" or \"granted by god\". It is that reason this subject is pushed under the carpet. It is the same with the \"las Vegas Elivis Marriages\". It is hard to see it as what they conservatives say it is...\n \n My marriage to my partner is 7 going on 8 years old. It is said in the press, even by our own president that gay marriages \"attack marriage\", yet Brittany is the example the conservatives want us to ignore. Who is the real threat to marriage? Gay couples who have really made a commitment or the hetero's who do it because \"they can\"??\n \n Daily in the press, the TV, movies etc...we see how marriage is abused by heterosexuals who then turn to gay couples who have been commited to each other for years and say that marriage is a god given, sanctified something or other.......if it is so sacred why are heterosexuals the only one who can't get it right?\n \n There are lots of gay couples in America, the 2000 census claimed something like 400,000. We are not see as couples, we are strangers in the eyes of the law. If my partner dies tomorrow I am screwed just by the taxes. I will loose the house! But Brittany is just fine......",

It's holding up some peoples' inability to maintain a commitment as an argument for gay marriage--a little strange, don't you think? None of these celebrity examples really has anything to do with the core issue here: that marriage is really an 2-person opposite-sex institution by it's very nature. The fact some celebrity couples can't maintain their commitment to each other has no relevance whatsoever to the issue of changing marriage to include more types of relationship arrangements.\n \n Furthermore, Matthew's argument about hypocrisy rings hollow because in fact, people who frown upon gay marriage usually also frown upon divorce as well, and on marriages like the sort of celebrity unions Matt is referring to.
