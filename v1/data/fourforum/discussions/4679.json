Brown's last book is titled, \"Answering Jewish Objections to Jesus - Volume Three - Messianic Prophecy Objections.\" He also did one titled, \"Answering Jewish Objections to Jesus - Volume Two - Theological Objections.\" I really recommend you read them to familiarize yourself with both sides of the issues, and to be fair please don't let any pre-conceived biases cloud your reading. \n \n \nEasyrider, as far as your feedback goes, it really didn't help me, but thanks for the input anyway.

If someone approaches me with a proposition, I can respectfully decline. However, I'd ask that you consider the following scenario: It's Saturday morning, and I'm interrupted by my doorbell. I open the door to find an individual (or maybe a couple) who introduce themselves and then inquire as to my religious beliefs. Right off the bat, this constitutes an unwarranted intrusion into my personal life. So, OK fine.

Presented with such manner of arrogant, insulting propositions, I confess that it's very difficult for me to retain my composure.

It makes little difference. This only supports my initial asseration that being condemned by such a group is good because it shows how weak that group is in understanding different beliefs. \n \n \n\n Fallacy # 2: \"..after all, it (Maxwell's own \"created scriptures\") have the same validity as his scriptures (the Bible). In your dreams, Maxwell.\n\n \n Considering how you constantly failed to address the same issue before, I expect you to run away like you did. You clearly believe that the scriptures are true, yet here you ignored the hard question. Hopefully this will shut you up like it did before.\n \n 2,000 years ago, billy, bob, ted, judy, and bart all wrote down that jim farted at 6 pm. there is no other evidence that he did. there is no evidence that any of these writers existed.\n \n Can we prove that jim farted at 6 pm with those soruces? Obvious answer: No we cannot. Therefore any such writing by ME would have the same validity as any such writing by people back in the ancient times that has no proof. Therefore, with such logic my scriptures have the same standing as yours. \n \n \n\n Jesus is Risen! And the Bible is the most widely read best seller in history. Your inventions haven't even made it on this board yet, much less established themselves as being the first bit credible. LOL!\n\n \n Apparently, if someone wrote it down, it is therefore true. Btw, that's the fallacy of majority, or bandwagon. Justify why we should consider your fraud or eject it yourself. Considering that many here consider you a fool, and a bad example of a christain, you should reconsider your crediblity first before attacking others for something you lack.",

Given that he appears to be allergic to authoritative scholarship, he's forced to obtain his arguments from 'other' sources.\n\n \n Liberal theologians \"breaking wind\" is always your grand idea of \"authoritative scholarship\". Let's see how one of your own liberal scholar hero's fared:\n \n What's Wrong with the liberal Bishop Spong?\n \n http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/1119.asp\n \n Spong the Greek scholar:\n \n Spong boasts that he spends hours studying the Bible and professes an acquaintance with Koin\u00e8 Greek, the language the NT was first written in. Therefore it is not surprising that in RMR, where he denies Jesus' bodily resurrection, that he turns to an analysis of the Greek text to see what the Bible really means. In RMR p. 53-55, Spong draws our attention to Gal. 1:15-16a which says:\n \n 15 But when He who had set me apart, even from my mother's womb, called me through His grace, was pleased 16to reveal His son in me ...\n \n From v. 16, 'to reveal His son in me', Spong claims: This was not a physical body recalled from the grave. The word for 'reveal' in this text is ophthe, the same word used in the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures to describe the appearances of God (theophanies) or angels of God (angelophanies) ... . What was the nature of a theophany? Was it really 'physical'? What was the means of hearing God's voice speak? Was it audible to any ear? Was it capable of being recorded or objectified?\n \n At first, we were impressed by this depth. But on checking a computerised concordance,81 we found that \u00f2phth\u00e8 is sometimes used of ordinary physical 'seeing' (Acts 7:26, 1 Tim. 3:16) - not surprising that we derive the word 'ophthalmologist' from a related word, and such a doctor definitely deals with physical sight. A logician would also note that Spong commits the fallacy of false alternatives, because he overlooks the possibility that seeing could be both physical and supra-physical, rather that either/or. We thought that it was strange that Spong should ignore this point. However, we decided to check a Greek NT82 to see if Spong had at least analysed the word correctly in this passage. But we could not find \u00f2phth\u00e8 in the passage. To give Spong a second shot, we checked a NT Greek Interlinear. The word was not there either. Instead, the Greek word for 'reveal' in Gal. 1:16 is actually apokalupsai, not \u00f2phth\u00e8! Apokalupsai is often used in the NT in an objective sense.83 \n \n It is shocking to see that Spong was trying to attack traditional Christian belief by appealing to a mistranslation of a Greek word which is not even in the passage he is explaining. Prof. O'Collins is undoubtedly referring to this blunder when he wrote: 'What is said about a key verb St. Paul uses in Gal. 1:15f. shows that the bishop [Spong] has forgotten any Greek that he knew.'79 Spong should heed O'Collins' kindly 'advice for his next book [which] is to let some real experts check it before publication.\n \n There's your \"Authoritative Scholarship\" Orion - the Liberal Bishop Spong breaking wind and getting nailed on it. LOL!!!\n \n You've got no juice around here, Orion.",

It says SEEK FIRST THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.\n \n In doing this we avoid hell. It is a by product. It is not the goal. The Goal in being christian is \"christ likeness\".

This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.\"  \n \n \nIf you're so impressed with the love of Jesus why aren't you preaching his Gospel?

What's your criteria for that kind of logic?\n\n \n He never taught about a place called hell. He made several warnings against losing yourself there. The actual word he used is Gehena. Gehena was a real place outside of Jerusalem where people were scarificed and refuse was burned. It was metaphor for destruction. He came to save us to life, he doesn't want us destroyed.\n \n I do believe there are those that will not see eternal life - and maybe their end will be fiery- but I don't believe that they will be tortured for an eternity. That isn't the act of a loving God. Would you do that to your child? How can you think the father in heaven would treat you as such? He did not grant free will to toy with it like a gangsta. I couldn't love God if he operated the way you seem to believe.\n \n There are two more words that have been translated into hell - one is the Hebrew sheol - it means the pit or the grave, the Greek haides replaced sheol, Jesus used Gehena as I stated above.\n \n Jews don't believe in hell - 3/4 of the Bible, not to mention our savior is Jewish. What they believe is relevant to me.\n \n I am aware of the Lazarus story and the passages in Revelation that are used to argue for hell. Neither are enough to convince that an eternity of torment awaits anyone.\n \n And nothing in the Bible that I have ever read (and I have read all of it) would condone the way you wish to represent God - with fear tactics.\n \n I don't want to love or please God for any reason other than he loves me. I know I wouldn't want to be loved for any other reason either. Would you put a gun to somebody's head and demand their love - and then believe it was sincere?",

   "\"I find no fault with this man\" Pontius Pilate\n\n \n I assume you took this from Luke 23:13-14. The date of this gospel (circa 90 CE) as well as its contents suggest that the author was not an eyewitness to the events he describes. Indeed, he tells us in his prologue that he compiled his gospel from the writings of others. However, the fact that Luke's genealogy of Jesus conflicts with that given to us by Matthew should tell you something. They can't both be correct. Apologists have attempted to get around this by claiming that, whereas Matthew's genealogy of Jesus runs through Joseph, Luke's genealogy of Jesus runs through Mary. This, despite the fact that Luke's account mentions Jesus' father Joseph, but not Mary. Luke traces Jesus' genealogy through Joseph. \n \n \nThere's simply no credible foundation for that hypothesis - that his disciples engineered all that.\n\n \n And what is your evidence to the contrary, EZ? The conflicting accounts given to us by non-eyewitness followers of the Jesus cult written decades after the fact? I thus introduce you to the idea of probability based upon historical study. You're not going to like this, but I hope that you'll at least consider it. Jesus was executed by the Romans (not the Jews) by virtue of the likelihood that the Romans considered Jesus to be both a troublemaker (temple incident on the eve of Passover) and seditionist (\"King of the Jews\"). A king was expected to liberate his people from foreign occupation. Am I going too fast for you? \n \n Thus, Pilate probably ordered one of his officers to get rid of Jesus in an expedient manner. There would have been no trial, given that Jesus was considered to be a nobody, lacking power, influence, or wealth. Thus, death by crucifixion. Following this, Jesus' body was probably thrown into a garbage dump, to be consumed by birds and dogs. This was part of the punishment inflicted by the Romans, denying the body a proper burial. Thus, in all probability, no tomb. Thus, no bodily resurrection of Jesus from a tomb. Thus, no bodily ascension of Jesus into the sky toward heaven.\n \n In all probability, Jesus's followers attempted to make sense of all this, and wove a story around it as justification for Jesus' untimely and humiliating death. And you've obviously bought into it. \n \n EZ, if you're going to attempt to defend the literalness of these gospel accounts, I suggest that you have your work cut out for you. You're going to have to defend, for example, NT accounts of demonic possession as a cause of disease, an account of a solar eclipse at Jesus' death (during a full moon!), Matthew's description of dead folks getting out of their graves at the time of Jesus' death, as well as various NT prophecies concerning Jesus' imminent second coming...\n \n Hebrews 10:37 - For in just a very little while, He who is coming will come and will not delay. \n \n James 5:7-9 - Be patient, then, brothers, until the Lord's coming. . . You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord's coming is near. \n \n 1 Peter 1:20 - He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake. \n \n 1 Peter 4:7 - The end of all things is near. \n \n Rev. 22:20 - Surely I come quickly.",

   " Educating Epaphras Faith\n \n \n \n FYI, Jesus and others in the New Testament warned or taught people about hell, etc., time after time, which is what I have done here on occasion. Need some examples?\n \n But except you repent, you shall all likewise perish. Luke 13:5 \n\n \n Allow me to add context so that people can see what is really being said and see the deciever that you are. Luke 13:4-5 says this (it is all one sentence by the way): Or do you suppose that those 18 on whom the tower in siloam fell and killed them were worse culprits than the men who lived in Jerusalem? I tell you, no, but unless you repent you will likewise perish.\" Jesus is not talking about hell he is talking about Physical death. He gave a similar story concerning some galileans in Luke 13:2-3.\n \n So if you are going to educate me I do wish you would not lie about what Jesus is saying by intentionally leaving out what is obviously there. You \"conveniently\" left out the part about others perishing and this being an answer to a question about physical death. Do not use the scriptures to your own end. Jesus did get angry at a few groups of people. The pharisees, the sadducees, and the money changers in the temple. Not because of their great sin, but because of how they, the religious leaders (read that EasyRider), were falsely representing God.\n \n \nNow EF, is that a THREAT, OR A WARNING?\n \n Does Love Speak the Truth on that? Jesus just did!\n \n 2 Thessalonians 1: 8 He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. 9 They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of his power .\n\n \n \nPhilippians 3:18 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: 19 Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.).\n\n \n This verse legitimately speaks of ultimate destruction. But it also is not a teaching to non believers. Paul is writing to the thessalonians who were undergoing a persecution at the time. It is writtent to BELIEVERS and intended to encourage them not to \"threaten\" others with their own destruction. Ultimate destruction is a reality. That has never been denied. What is wrong, yes wrong, is that you threaten people with what God does not threaten them. This does not happen in this scripture, no threat, instead we see the heart of Christ and Paul to encourage others to know that God is just and will do right by the persecutions suffered. Again you take the scripture out of context and make it fit your own twisted and warped sense of right and wrong. I have been patient and appealed to you as a brother, one who also knows christ, as I believe that is appropriate.\n \n \n\"And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.\" Matthew 25:46..\n\n \n Again, out of context. He is Speaking to His disciples. They are believers. He is not speaking as a warning but simply stating what is true and instructing His disciples on the things to come. Once again you have chosen to misrepresent God.\n \n Just so you know, none of what you quoted was Jesus or Paul or anyone else threatening anyone with ultimate destruction. They certainly teach of Hell. Never does Jesus warn anyone that they will be going there if they don't shape up.\n \n You see, the grace of God is what makes us able to shape up. If we have to shape up in order to be acceptable then we cannot possibly and are all doomed.\n \n By the way, telling someone they are headed for hell is, by definition, judgement. \n \n Romans 2:1-2 \"Therefore, you are without excuse, every man of you who passes judgement, for in that you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you who judge practices the same things. And we know that the judgement of God rightly falls upon those who practice such things.\"\n \n I would encourage you to continue reading the book of Romans until you discover the grace of God. I do not judge you, for only God can do that, although I have know doubt you will feel and act judged. I simply tell you that I will no longer accept your rantings and will fight you as you misrepresent God and Jesus. \n \n EF",

Energy never disapates, but grows or is used up (this goes for good energy and negative energy). Energy comes in many forms...humans, animals, living things...what we do with this energy is up to us...we can create gods, bow to them and give our free will up to them (a total waste of a life).\n \n We create stories or record history (i.e. Koran, Bible, Book of Mormon) about this energy.
