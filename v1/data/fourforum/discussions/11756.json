   "There are a lot of voices for support of European course in financial and other spheres which less depend of USA at the background of world's financial crisis. But it turned out that we depend not from Yankees only! Even Chechen terrorists settled in Europe try to give us orders and teach us life! In fact Norway policy showed itself feeble when 15 Chechens arrested in connections with mass scuffle among Kurds and Chechens were set free! Most interesting, the most strange decision was made after ultimatum of Chechen Diaspora leader who had threatened 'to punish all guilty in misconduct of arrest Chechens with using all the resources'!\n I think that time to solve problem not with Americans only but with Chechens who disturb us comes!",
