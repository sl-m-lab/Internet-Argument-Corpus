   "Normally on their knees for Israel and it's Western Allies, Turkey is actually opening its mouth to make a criticism. \n \n \"a country that would like to be treated with respect, should respect the rights of another country as well\". He told the Turkish parliament that \"Israel's actions encourage the growth of anti-Semitism around the world\" \n \n Now addressing the comment of respect, it only makes sense that a supposed democratic country would apply decency and morality into their military guidelines, but I guess that would just be asking for too much. It is quite odd to me that after 37 years of occupation the Arab and Middle East neighbors couldn't have done a bit more in achieving a Palestinian state. The continuation of unrest in the conflict is largely due to the neighboring states turning a blind eye to the situation and actually provoking and allowing it by becoming buddy buddy with Israel. Turkey as well as Egypt and Jordan have been selling out the Palestinians for decades, which makes it funny to hear a defense coming out of Erdogan's mouth. But I guess the balancing act of keeping close with the Arab community and selling its soul to Western states is a hard job indeed. While I'm always game for Turkey or anyone else to point out the brutality of Israeli/Palestinian conflict, in hopes that one day it will end, I think that Turkey should have been following its own advice when it comes to regards to Cyprus. But again what democracy or wannabe democracy ever really follows its own advice. \n \n Remi \n \n \n \n \n \n http://www.maarivintl.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=article&articleID=8607",
