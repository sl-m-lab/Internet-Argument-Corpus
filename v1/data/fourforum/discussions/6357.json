   "If a man isn't man enough to be beside his woman and partner in the delivery room, how dare he dictate to women whether or not they should be pregnant.\n \n Letters to the Editor in the NYTimes:\n \n http://query.nytimes.com/2005/08/30/science/30lett.html\n \n August 30, 2005\n Letters\n Correction Appended \n Trauma in the Delivery Room\n \n To the Editor: \n \n Maybe the Cases column titled \"A Perilous Journey From Delivery Room to Bedroom\" (Aug. 23) should have been called \"Man's Inability to Cope With Reality and the Inherent Pain Involved.\"\n \n The fact that my body produced, delivered and eventually recovered from the making of two glorious human beings should be life-affirming - even for the fragile male ego that needs a tidy package with a pretty bow to stay attracted.\n \n Thankfully, I am married to a more evolved man than the ones Dr. Ablow treats. His presence at both surgical births proved to bond us immeasurably, as it should for all. \n \n Elizabeth Lebid -- Yorktown Heights, N.Y.\n \n To the Editor:\n \n Re \" From Delivery Room to Bedroom\": My husband and I took the birthing classes at Lenox Hill Hospital 40 years ago. \n \n My husband was given a certificate allowing him to participate in the delivery room, even though he had chickened out of the course before completion. (A man who had spent seven years in graduate school!) \n \n He admitted he did not want to be there. I told him I understood, as I didn't want to be there either! We had no problems with recriminations or lack or warmth then or after the birth of our two other children or ever. \n \n Anita Kaufman -- Scarsdale, N.Y.\n \n To the Editor:\n \n Oh, great. Women already limit their diet and lifestyle, do Kegel exercises, carry around an ever increasing girth for nine months and then spend excruciating hours in labor to give birth (\"From Delivery Room to Bedroom\"). \n \n Now, it seems, there's one more chore: \"the risks as they invite their partners to watch them bring new life into the world.\" Cry me a river. It's too bad some men suffer from learning that their partners' genitalia has a function other than sexual.\n \n In the end, if guys think they might be uncomfortable with a certain view, they should figure that out themselves. Their partners, see, are just a wee bit busy. \n \n Lisa Phillips Mead -- Woodstock, N.Y.\n \n To the Editor:\n \n \"From Delivery Room to Bedroom\" shortchanged readers: it examined the potential for emotional trauma only in the male witness, leaving out any discussion of the impact on the woman, arguably the most involved adult in the delivery room. \n \n As a mother of three I must tell you that this \"intensely beautiful moment\" can have a profound impact on sex and sexuality for women. Especially after the birth of the first child, I felt both my husband and I needed time and distance to move from delivery room to bedroom. \n \n I could only roll my eyes at the well-intentioned nurses who kept reminding me of the importance of using birth control when resuming our sex life \"in a few weeks.\" Abstinence was going to work just fine, I told them. \n \n Jennifer Lanthier -- Toronto\n \n To the Editor:\n \n Re \"From Delivery Room to Bedroom\": From a young age when women learn the facts of life, they are astonished at how unfair pregnancy and birth are. Women are left to experience the physical process entirely on their own.\n \n Sympathetic partners can do little to help (and there are plenty who aren't even sympathetic), the very least of which is being present if the woman requests it.\n \n Women have enough to worry about without having to consider whether their significant others will leave them after the birth of their children. These men should be thankful that someone loved them enough to want to have their babies.\n \n Betsy Garman -- Fairfax, Va.\n \n To the Editor:\n \n Re \"From Delivery Room to Bedroom\": I'm not a parent, so correct me if I'm wrong, but does any couple have great sex in the first few days after their baby is born? I imagine most people don't, because of exhaustion, not because of the father's \"trauma.\" \n \n Kayla Soyer-Stein -- New York\n \n To the Editor:\n \n Re \"From Delivery Room to Bedroom\": It is understandable that some men may feel turned off by witnessing birth. But having a partner for support in this sometimes grueling experience is invaluable. \n \n Some women may prefer that their mates stay up at their heads offering emotional support. This way, the partners can participate, but can maintain the image of the partners that they prefer. Even in the best of relationships, people sometimes want privacy regarding bodily functions. \n \n Candy Markowitz -- Towaco, N.J.\n \n To the Editor:\n \n Most American fathers find that attending births is rewarding and that it strengthens their marriage or partnership (\"From Delivery Room to Bedroom\"). The writer is correct that the experience is traumatic for some and that American medicine exacerbates the problem.\n \n As an anthropologist studying birthing fathers in the United States and around the world, I have found that no other society expects new fathers to set aside their own emotions to be neutral labor coaches and delivery attendants.\n \n American dads benefit from sharing this life-changing experience with mothers, but both need support and reassurance through the process. \n \n Richard Reed -- San Antonio \n The writer is a professor of anthropology at Trinity University and the author of \"Birthing Fathers.\"\n \n To the Editor:\n \n As a woman who has struggled to maintain the mystery of her marriage in a \"politically correct\" era and society that devalue it, I would like to thank Dr. Keith Ablow for his column \"From Delivery Room to Bedroom.\"\n \n My womb has not yet been blessed, but I know that when it is, I will be happy to sacrifice the menial assistance or support my husband might provide for the essential, long-lasting reward of maintaining his innocent conviction that my vagina is made of diamonds. \n \n Carrie Lebigre -- New York\n \n To the Editor: \n \n \"From Delivery Room to Bedroom\" recalled the strict instructions my pregnant mother received in the 1950's. She was told to hide from her husband all signs that labor was painful, to avoid accidentally making him feel guilty. \n \n The writer suggests that we turn the clocks back and return to those dark decades when male comfort reigned supreme even in women-centered endeavors like childbirth.\n \n It is regretful if childbirth complicates his patients' views of their sexual partners, but perhaps participating in an experience as meaningful as the birth of a child is worthwhile nonetheless. \n \n Susan Mayer -- Lexington, Mass.\n \n To the Editor:\n \n Re \"From Delivery Room to Bedroom\": Perhaps the men ought to just wait down at the gentlemen's club. There, they can maintain their fantasy of women as sexual objects and not concern themselves with the conflicted feelings women often have about sex and their bodies after childbirth. \n \n Kate Robinson -- New York\n \n Correction:  \n \n A letter to the editor in Science Times on Tuesday responding to the Aug. 23 Cases column, about men's ambivalent reactions to watching their wives give birth, misspelled the writer's given name. She is Kayla Soyer-Stein, not Karla.",
