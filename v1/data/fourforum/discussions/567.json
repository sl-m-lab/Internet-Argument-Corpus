   "the reason why is so the government can have more control. If they can get the supposed \"Assault Weapons\" out of the hands of the public, then thatll make it that much easier for their complete ban of guns. Pretty soon almost all guns will be considered assault weapons by the government, it seems to cover more and more each day.",

It is only taking away weapons from people who will not use them in a crime. \n \n You can't be certain about that. This link that I found indicates that you might be wrong. Read below.\n \n \n According to a study of short-term trends\n since the 1994 assault weapons ban became law, the ban may be\n linked to declines in the criminal use of assault weapons, violent\n crime and the number of enforcement officers killed by assault\n weapons. The study, prepared by the Urban Institute for the\n Justice Department's National Institute of Justice (NIJ), was\n required by statute to be conducted within 30 months following the enactment of the assault weapons ban as part of President Clinton's 1994 Crime Act. The report's authors warned that more time was needed to determine the long-term impact of the ban. http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/1997/March97/130nij.htm\n",
