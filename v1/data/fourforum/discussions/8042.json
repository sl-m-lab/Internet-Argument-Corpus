Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but",

Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm",

Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them",

   "Dear Lisa,\n \n I want to tell you you're hot. Hot as in every way possible. In fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool. But really, he's a jerk. I mean, who enjoys quantum physics? Only the most intelligent of men, and the craziest, would seriously consider quantum physics as a respectable hobby.\n \n Allow me to offer you a concert ticket for Woodstock. I know you would love Rocking Out with dead people since",

The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool. But really, he's a jerk. I mean, who enjoys quantum physics? Only the most intelligent of men, and the craziest, would seriously consider quantum physics as a respectable hobby.\n \n Allow me to offer you a concert ticket for Woodstock. I know you would love Rocking Out with dead people since you look like a Dead Head. Want some hooch? Well that's beside my computer. Don't touch it or it will explode. That's what mamma says. But I like when daddy",

   "Dear Lisa,\n \n I want to tell you you're hot. Hot as in every way possible. In fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually.

   "Dear Lisa,\n \n I want to tell you you're hot. Hot as in every way possible. In fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you?

   "Dear Lisa,\n \n I want to tell you you're hot. Hot as in every way possible. In fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool. But really, he's a jerk. I mean, who enjoys quantum physics? Only the most intelligent of men, and the craziest, would seriously consider quantum physics as a respectable hobby.\n \n Allow me to offer you a concert ticket for Woodstock. I know you would love Rocking Out with dead people since you look like a Dead Head. Want some hooch? Well that's beside my computer. Don't touch it or it will explode. That's what mamma says. But I like when daddy shouts \"KA-BOOM\" like a stick of dynamite in my right pants pocket. Yes, I have bombs there too. As you can see, I'm well armed. I'm well endowed so watch me do this. Isn't it cool?! Or even Awesome?! So what if I did it again? Oops I spilled coffee on your head. That must hurt. Would cream help? Or sugar perhaps? Is sugar good for the soul?\n \n I mentioned endowed: an intriguing word. But how can it compare to a sword? I measured from the hilt to my head, shaft to the tip of the footgear I wear while engaging in using my endowment fund that grandpa",

If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually.

I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool. But really, he's a jerk. I mean, who enjoys quantum physics? Only the most intelligent of men, and the craziest, would seriously consider quantum physics as a respectable hobby.\n \n Allow me to offer you a concert ticket for Woodstock. I know you would love Rocking Out with dead people since you look like a Dead Head. Want some hooch? Well that's beside my computer. Don't touch it or it will explode. That's what mamma says. But I like when daddy shouts \"KA-BOOM\" like a stick of dynamite in my right pants pocket. Yes, I have bombs there too. As you can see, I'm well armed. I'm well endowed so watch me do this. Isn't it cool?! Or even Awesome?! So what if I did it again? Oops I spilled coffee on your head. That must hurt. Would cream help? Or sugar perhaps? Is sugar good for the soul?\n \n I mentioned endowed: an intriguing word. But how can it compare to a sword?

Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool. But really, he's a jerk. I mean, who enjoys quantum physics? Only the most intelligent of men, and the craziest, would seriously consider quantum physics as a respectable hobby.\n \n Allow me to offer you a concert ticket for Woodstock. I know you would love Rocking Out with dead people since you look like a Dead Head. Want some hooch? Well that's beside my computer. Don't touch it or it will explode. That's what mamma says. But I like when daddy shouts \"KA-BOOM\" like a stick of dynamite in my right pants pocket. Yes, I have bombs there too. As you can see, I'm well armed. I'm well endowed so watch me do this. Isn't it cool?! Or even Awesome?! So what if I did it again? Oops I spilled coffee on your head. That must hurt. Would cream help? Or sugar perhaps? Is sugar good for the soul?\n \n I mentioned endowed: an intriguing word. But how can it compare to a sword? I measured from the hilt to my head, shaft to the tip of the footgear I wear while engaging in using my endowment fund that grandpa created for sexual hamsters to mate. Grandma screamed, \"My Foot Is Asleep!\" We chopped it to arouse circulation. More than just feeling returned. So, I quickly left with a dozen starved, crazed weasels on my face.

   "Dear Lisa,\n \n I want to tell you you're hot. Hot as in every way possible. In fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool. But really, he's a jerk. I mean, who enjoys quantum physics? Only the most intelligent of men, and the craziest, would seriously consider quantum physics as a respectable hobby.\n \n Allow me to offer you a concert ticket for Woodstock. I know you would love Rocking Out with dead people since you look like a Dead Head. Want some hooch? Well that's beside my computer. Don't touch it or it will explode. That's what mamma says. But I like when daddy shouts \"KA-BOOM\" like a stick of dynamite in my right pants pocket. Yes, I have bombs there too. As you can see, I'm well armed. I'm well endowed so watch me do this.

   "Dear Lisa,\n \n I want to tell you you're hot. Hot as in every way possible. In fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool. But really, he's a jerk. I mean, who enjoys quantum physics?

   "Dear Lisa,\n \n I want to tell you you're hot. Hot as in every way possible. In fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool. But really, he's a jerk. I mean, who enjoys quantum physics? Only the most intelligent of men, and the craziest, would seriously consider quantum physics as a respectable hobby.\n \n Allow me to offer you a concert ticket for Woodstock. I know you would love Rocking Out with dead people since you look like a Dead Head. Want some hooch? Well that's beside my computer. Don't touch it or it will explode. That's what mamma says. But I like when daddy shouts \"KA-BOOM\" like a stick of dynamite in my right pants pocket. Yes, I have bombs there too. As you can see, I'm well armed. I'm well endowed so watch me do this.

   "Dear Lisa,\n \n I want to tell you you're hot. Hot as in every way possible. In fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool. But really, he's a jerk. I mean, who enjoys quantum physics?

I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool. But really, he's a jerk. I mean, who enjoys quantum physics? Only the most intelligent of men, and the craziest, would seriously consider quantum physics as a respectable hobby.\n \n Allow me to offer you a concert ticket for Woodstock. I know you would love Rocking Out with dead people since you look like a Dead Head. Want some hooch? Well that's beside my computer. Don't touch it or it will explode. That's what mamma says. But I like when daddy shouts \"KA-BOOM\" like a stick of dynamite in my right pants pocket. Yes, I have bombs there too. As you can see, I'm well armed. I'm well endowed so watch me do this. Isn't it cool?! Or even Awesome?! So what if I did it again? Oops I spilled coffee on your head. That must hurt. Would cream help? Or sugar perhaps? Is sugar good for the soul?\n \n I mentioned endowed: an intriguing word. But how can it compare to a sword? I measured from the hilt to my head, shaft to the tip of the footgear I wear while engaging in using my endowment fund that grandpa created for sexual hamsters to mate. Grandma screamed, \"My Foot Is Asleep!\" We chopped it to arouse circulation. More than just feeling returned. So, I quickly left with a dozen starved, crazed weasels on my face. Do you have any bear claws? Wait a minute and thirty-six seconds, I'll go check. \n \n Later that day I met someone who made you think twice before taking a bite of Big Macs. Big Macs make me do strange things, like once, I turned into a large piece of pizza with cheese on my stomach. It sucked the Big Mac and large Coke right out of my belly, which I'll show you after I send you a picture with this message. I'm almost done; half way there, my bulbous, purple, animated dinosaur friend. Do sentence fragments fragment sentences? I think so. I don't know if my pockets can fit fragments. Not with all the other stuff pushing against my pocket's gravitational balance. Lisa Lisa Lisa. You're three times as fast as my last gerbil, who got in",

   "Dear Lisa,\n \n I want to tell you you're hot. Hot as in every way possible. In fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you?

   "Dear Lisa,\n \n I want to tell you you're hot. Hot as in every way possible. In fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool. But really, he's a jerk. I mean, who enjoys quantum physics? Only the most intelligent of men, and the craziest, would seriously consider quantum physics as a respectable hobby.\n \n Allow me to offer you a concert ticket for Woodstock. I know you would love Rocking Out with dead people since you look like a Dead Head. Want some hooch? Well that's beside my computer. Don't touch it or it will explode. That's what mamma says. But I like when daddy shouts \"KA-BOOM\" like a stick of dynamite in my right pants pocket. Yes, I have bombs there too. As you can see, I'm well armed. I'm well endowed so watch me do this. Isn't it cool?! Or even Awesome?! So what if I did it again? Oops I spilled coffee on your head. That must hurt. Would cream help? Or sugar perhaps? Is sugar good for the soul?\n \n I mentioned endowed: an intriguing word. But how can it compare to a sword? I measured from the hilt to my head, shaft to the tip of the footgear I wear while engaging in using my endowment fund that grandpa created for sexual hamsters to mate. Grandma screamed, \"My Foot Is Asleep!\" We chopped it to arouse circulation. More than just feeling returned. So, I quickly left with a dozen starved, crazed weasels on my face. Do you have any bear claws? Wait a minute and thirty-six seconds, I'll go check. \n \n Later that day I met someone who made you think twice before taking a bite of Big Macs. Big Macs make me do strange things, like once, I turned into a large piece of pizza with cheese on my stomach. It sucked the Big Mac and large Coke right out of my belly, which I'll show you after I send you a picture with this message. I'm almost done; half way there, my bulbous, purple, animated dinosaur friend. Do sentence fragments fragment sentences? I think so. I don't know if my pockets can fit fragments. Not with all the other stuff pushing against my pocket's gravitational balance. Lisa Lisa Lisa. You're three times as fast as my last gerbil, who got in my left pocket with the cunning use of flags. A Russian flag, a British flag, and a French horn, wait a French toast too.",

   "Dear Lisa,\n \n I want to tell you you're hot. Hot as in every way possible. In fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me.

   "Dear Lisa,\n \n I want to tell you you're hot. Hot as in every way possible. In fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool. But really, he's a jerk. I mean, who enjoys quantum physics? Only the most intelligent of men, and the craziest, would seriously consider quantum physics as a respectable hobby.\n \n Allow me to offer you a concert ticket for Woodstock. I know you would love Rocking Out with dead people since you look like a Dead Head. Want some hooch? Well that's beside my computer. Don't touch it or it will explode. That's what mamma says. But I like when daddy shouts \"KA-BOOM\" like a stick of dynamite in my right pants pocket. Yes, I have bombs there too. As you can see, I'm well armed. I'm well endowed so watch me do this. Isn't it cool?! Or even Awesome?! So what if I did it again? Oops I spilled coffee on your head. That must hurt. Would cream help? Or sugar perhaps? Is sugar good for the soul?\n \n I mentioned endowed: an intriguing word. But how can it compare to a sword? I measured from the hilt to my head, shaft to the tip of the footgear I wear while engaging in using my endowment fund that grandpa created for sexual hamsters to mate. Grandma screamed, \"My Foot Is Asleep!\" We chopped it to arouse circulation. More than just feeling returned. So, I quickly left with a dozen starved, crazed weasels on my face. Do you have any bear claws? Wait a minute and thirty-six seconds, I'll go check.\n \n Later that day I met someone who made you think twice before taking a bite of Big Macs. Big Macs make me do strange things, like once, I turned into a large piece of pizza with cheese on my stomach.

The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool. But really, he's a jerk. I mean, who enjoys quantum physics? Only the most intelligent of men, and the craziest, would seriously consider quantum physics as a respectable hobby.\n \n Allow me to offer you a concert ticket for Woodstock. I know you would love Rocking Out with dead people since you look like a Dead Head. Want some hooch? Well that's beside my computer. Don't touch it or it will explode. That's what mamma says. But I like when daddy shouts \"KA-BOOM\" like a stick of dynamite in my right pants pocket. Yes, I have bombs there too. As you can see, I'm well armed. I'm well endowed so watch me do this. Isn't it cool?! Or even Awesome?! So what if I did it again? Oops I spilled coffee on your head. That must hurt. Would cream help? Or sugar perhaps? Is sugar good for the soul?\n \n I mentioned endowed: an intriguing word. But how can it compare to a sword? I measured from the hilt to my head, shaft to the tip of the footgear I wear while engaging in using my endowment fund that grandpa created for sexual hamsters to mate. Grandma screamed, \"My Foot Is Asleep!\" We chopped it to arouse circulation. More than just feeling returned. So, I quickly left with a dozen starved, crazed weasels on my face. Do you have any bear claws? Wait a minute and thirty-six seconds, I'll go check.\n \n Later that day I met someone who made you think twice before taking a bite of Big Macs. Big Macs make me do strange things, like once, I turned into a large piece of pizza with cheese on my stomach. It sucked the Big Mac and large Coke right out of my belly, which I'll show you after I send you a picture with this message. I'm almost done; half way there, my bulbous, purple, animated dinosaur friend. Do sentence fragments fragment sentences? I think so. I don't know if my pockets can fit fragments. Not with all the other stuff pushing against my pocket's gravitational balance. Lisa Lisa Lisa. You're three times as fast as my last gerbil, who got in my left pocket with the cunning use of flags. A Russian flag, a British flag, and a French horn, wait a French toast too. French toast is overrated. You wanna try something new? Okay, I lied about their ratings. I only lied to hide the fact that I love them stuffed. Stuffed with all that junk inside an IHOP French mime. Mimes just drive trucks and wear way too many underpants for just one mime. It's sick really. Why anyone would",

If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool. But really, he's a jerk. I mean, who enjoys quantum physics? Only the most intelligent of men, and the craziest, would seriously consider quantum physics as a respectable hobby.\n \n Allow me to offer you a concert ticket for Woodstock. I know you would love Rocking Out with dead people since you look like a Dead Head. Want some hooch? Well that's beside my computer. Don't touch it or it will explode. That's what mamma says. But I like when daddy shouts \"KA-BOOM\" like a stick of dynamite in my right pants pocket. Yes, I have bombs there too. As you can see, I'm well armed. I'm well endowed so watch me do this. Isn't it cool?! Or even Awesome?! So what if I did it again? Oops I spilled coffee on your head. That must hurt. Would cream help? Or sugar perhaps? Is sugar good for the soul?\n \n I mentioned endowed: an intriguing word. But how can it compare to a sword? I measured from the hilt to my head, shaft to the tip of the footgear I wear while engaging in using my endowment fund that grandpa created for sexual hamsters to mate. Grandma screamed, \"My Foot Is Asleep!\" We chopped it to arouse circulation. More than just feeling returned. So, I quickly left with a dozen starved, crazed weasels on my face. Do you have any bear claws? Wait a minute and thirty-six seconds, I'll go check.\n \n Later that day I met someone who made you think twice before taking a bite of Big Macs. Big Macs make me do strange things, like once, I turned into a large piece of pizza with cheese on my stomach. It sucked the Big Mac and large Coke right out of my belly, which I'll show you after I send you a picture with this message. I'm almost done; half way there, my bulbous, purple, animated dinosaur friend. Do sentence fragments fragment sentences? I think so. I don't know if my pockets can fit fragments. Not with all the other stuff pushing against my pocket's gravitational balance. Lisa Lisa Lisa. You're three times as fast as my last gerbil, who got in my left pocket with the cunning use of flags. A Russian flag, a British flag, and a French horn, wait a French toast too. French toast is overrated. You wanna try something new? Okay, I lied about their ratings. I only lied to hide the fact that I love them stuffed. Stuffed with all that junk inside an IHOP French mime. Mimes just drive trucks and wear way too many underpants for just one mime. It's sick really. Why anyone would stuff french toast in their hair? Why don't they put gel in and some earwax to help moisten",

If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool. But really, he's a jerk. I mean, who enjoys quantum physics? Only the most intelligent of men, and the craziest, would seriously consider quantum physics as a respectable hobby.\n \n Allow me to offer you a concert ticket for Woodstock. I know you would love Rocking Out with dead people since you look like a Dead Head. Want some hooch? Well that's beside my computer. Don't touch it or it will explode. That's what mamma says. But I like when daddy shouts \"KA-BOOM\" like a stick of dynamite in my right pants pocket. Yes, I have bombs there too. As you can see, I'm well armed. I'm well endowed so watch me do this. Isn't it cool?! Or even Awesome?! So what if I did it again? Oops I spilled coffee on your head. That must hurt. Would cream help? Or sugar perhaps? Is sugar good for the soul?\n \n I mentioned endowed: an intriguing word. But how can it compare to a sword? I measured from the hilt to my head, shaft to the tip of the footgear I wear while engaging in using my endowment fund that grandpa created for sexual hamsters to mate. Grandma screamed, \"My Foot Is Asleep!\" We chopped it to arouse circulation. More than just feeling returned. So, I quickly left with a dozen starved, crazed weasels on my face. Do you have any bear claws? Wait a minute and thirty-six seconds, I'll go check.\n \n Later that day I met someone who made you think twice before taking a bite of Big Macs. Big Macs make me do strange things, like once, I turned into a large piece of pizza with cheese on my stomach. It sucked the Big Mac and large Coke right out of my belly, which I'll show you after I send you a picture with this message. I'm almost done; half way there, my bulbous, purple, animated dinosaur friend. Do sentence fragments fragment sentences? I think so. I don't know if my pockets can fit fragments. Not with all the other stuff pushing against my pocket's gravitational balance. Lisa Lisa Lisa. You're three times as fast as my last gerbil, who got in my left pocket with the cunning use of flags. A Russian flag, a British flag, and a French horn, wait a French toast too. French toast is overrated. You wanna try something new? Okay, I lied about their ratings. I only lied to hide the fact that I love them stuffed. Stuffed with all that junk inside an IHOP French mime. Mimes just drive trucks and wear way too many underpants for just one mime. It's sick really. Why anyone would stuff french toast in their hair? Why don't they put gel in and some earwax to help moisten your soft, sensuous French Maid appearance.

The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool. But really, he's a jerk. I mean, who enjoys quantum physics? Only the most intelligent of men, and the craziest, would seriously consider quantum physics as a respectable hobby.\n \n Allow me to offer you a concert ticket for Woodstock. I know you would love Rocking Out with dead people since you look like a Dead Head. Want some hooch? Well that's beside my computer. Don't touch it or it will explode. That's what mamma says. But I like when daddy shouts \"KA-BOOM\" like a stick of dynamite in my right pants pocket. Yes, I have bombs there too. As you can see, I'm well armed. I'm well endowed so watch me do this. Isn't it cool?! Or even Awesome?! So what if I did it again? Oops I spilled coffee on your head. That must hurt. Would cream help? Or sugar perhaps? Is sugar good for the soul?\n \n I mentioned endowed: an intriguing word. But how can it compare to a sword? I measured from the hilt to my head, shaft to the tip of the footgear I wear while engaging in using my endowment fund that grandpa created for sexual hamsters to mate. Grandma screamed, \"My Foot Is Asleep!\" We chopped it to arouse circulation. More than just feeling returned. So, I quickly left with a dozen starved, crazed weasels on my face. Do you have any bear claws? Wait a minute and thirty-six seconds, I'll go check.\n \n Later that day I met someone who made you think twice before taking a bite of Big Macs. Big Macs make me do strange things, like once, I turned into a large piece of pizza with cheese on my stomach. It sucked the Big Mac and large Coke right out of my belly, which I'll show you after I send you a picture with this message. I'm almost done; half way there, my bulbous, purple, animated dinosaur friend. Do sentence fragments fragment sentences? I think so. I don't know if my pockets can fit fragments. Not with all the other stuff pushing against my pocket's gravitational balance. Lisa Lisa Lisa. You're three times as fast as my last gerbil, who got in my left pocket with the cunning use of flags. A Russian flag, a British flag, and a French horn, wait a French toast too. French toast is overrated. You wanna try something new? Okay, I lied about their ratings. I only lied to hide the fact that I love them stuffed. Stuffed with all that junk inside an IHOP French mime. Mimes just drive trucks and wear way too many underpants for just one mime. It's sick really. Why anyone would stuff french toast in their hair? Why don't they put gel in and some earwax to help moisten your soft, sensuous French Maid appearance. What's a French maid compared to a Spanish maid? Well, one has a feather duster and the other uses a Dustbuster. Dustbuster or Ghostbuster? I love Spanish fly and Hungarian",

   "Dear Lisa,\n \n I want to tell you you're hot. Hot as in every way possible. In fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool. But really, he's a jerk. I mean, who enjoys quantum physics? Only the most intelligent of men, and the craziest, would seriously consider quantum physics as a respectable hobby.\n \n Allow me to offer you a concert ticket for Woodstock. I know you would love Rocking Out with dead people since you look like a Dead Head. Want some hooch? Well that's beside my computer. Don't touch it or it will explode. That's what mamma says. But I like when daddy shouts \"KA-BOOM\" like a stick of dynamite in my right pants pocket. Yes, I have bombs there too. As you can see, I'm well armed. I'm well endowed so watch me do this. Isn't it cool?! Or even Awesome?! So what if I did it again? Oops I spilled coffee on your head. That must hurt. Would cream help? Or sugar perhaps? Is sugar good for the soul?\n \n I mentioned endowed: an intriguing word. But how can it compare to a sword? I measured from the hilt to my head, shaft to the tip of the footgear I wear while engaging in using my endowment fund that grandpa created for sexual hamsters to mate. Grandma screamed, \"My Foot Is Asleep!\" We chopped it to arouse circulation. More than just feeling returned. So, I quickly left with a dozen starved, crazed weasels on my face. Do you have any bear claws? Wait a minute and thirty-six seconds, I'll go check.\n \n Later that day I met someone who made you think twice before taking a bite of Big Macs. Big Macs make me do strange things, like once, I turned into a large piece of pizza with cheese on my stomach. It sucked the Big Mac and large Coke right out of my belly, which I'll show you after I send you a picture with this message. I'm almost done; half way there, my bulbous, purple, animated dinosaur friend. Do sentence fragments fragment sentences? I think so. I don't know if my pockets can fit fragments.

   "Dear Lisa,\n \n I want to tell you you're hot. Hot as in every way possible. In fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool.

The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool. But really, he's a jerk. I mean, who enjoys quantum physics? Only the most intelligent of men, and the craziest, would seriously consider quantum physics as a respectable hobby.\n \n Allow me to offer you a concert ticket for Woodstock. I know you would love Rocking Out with dead people since you look like a Dead Head. Want some hooch? Well that's beside my computer. Don't touch it or it will explode. That's what mamma says. But I like when daddy shouts \"KA-BOOM\" like a stick of dynamite in my right pants pocket. Yes, I have bombs there too. As you can see, I'm well armed. I'm well endowed so watch me do this. Isn't it cool?! Or even Awesome?! So what if I did it again? Oops I spilled coffee on your head. That must hurt. Would cream help? Or sugar perhaps? Is sugar good for the soul?\n \n I mentioned endowed: an intriguing word. But how can it compare to a sword? I measured from the hilt to my head, shaft to the tip of the footgear I wear while engaging in using my endowment fund that grandpa created for sexual hamsters to mate. Grandma screamed, \"My Foot Is Asleep!\" We chopped it to arouse circulation. More than just feeling returned. So, I quickly left with a dozen starved, crazed weasels on my face. Do you have any bear claws? Wait a minute and thirty-six seconds, I'll go check.\n \n Later that day I met someone who made you think twice before taking a bite of Big Macs. Big Macs make me do strange things, like once, I turned into a large piece of pizza with cheese on my stomach. It sucked the Big Mac and large Coke right out of my belly, which I'll show you after I send you a picture with this message. I'm almost done; half way there, my bulbous, purple, animated dinosaur friend. Do sentence fragments fragment sentences? I think so. I don't know if my pockets can fit fragments. Not with all the other stuff pushing against my pocket's gravitational balance. Lisa Lisa Lisa. You're three times as fast as my last gerbil, who got in my left pocket with the cunning use of flags. A Russian flag, a British flag, and a French horn, wait a French toast too. French toast is overrated. You wanna try something new? Okay, I lied about their ratings. I only lied to hide the fact that I love them stuffed. Stuffed with all that junk inside an IHOP French mime. Mimes just drive trucks and wear way too many underpants for just one mime. It's sick really. Why anyone would stuff french toast in their hair? Why don't they put gel in and some earwax to help moisten your soft, sensuous French Maid appearance. What's a French maid compared to a Spanish maid? Well, one has a feather duster and the other uses a Dustbuster. Dustbuster or Ghostbuster? I love Spanish fly and Hungarian pancakes. Mmmmm, yummy. Pass the syrup. I hate syrup. KILL THE SYRUP! It tastes like XXXX. No, really it does. Do do actually, leaving the rear.\n \n Anyway, now that I'm finally cutting loose, footloose, kick off the diving board and don't crash into the water. That can really hurt, sort of",

   "Dear Lisa,\n \n I want to tell you you're hot. Hot as in every way possible. In fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool.

   "Dear Lisa,\n \n I want to tell you you're hot. Hot as in every way possible. In fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool. But really, he's a jerk. I mean, who enjoys quantum physics? Only the most intelligent of men, and the craziest, would seriously consider quantum physics as a respectable hobby.\n \n Allow me to offer you a concert ticket for Woodstock. I know you would love Rocking Out with dead people since you look like a Dead Head. Want some hooch? Well that's beside my computer. Don't touch it or it will explode. That's what mamma says. But I like when daddy shouts \"KA-BOOM\" like a stick of dynamite in my right pants pocket. Yes, I have bombs there too. As you can see, I'm well armed. I'm well endowed so watch me do this. Isn't it cool?! Or even Awesome?! So what if I did it again? Oops I spilled coffee on your head. That must hurt. Would cream help? Or sugar perhaps? Is sugar good for the soul?\n \n I mentioned endowed: an intriguing word. But how can it compare to a sword? I measured from the hilt to my head, shaft to the tip of the footgear I wear while engaging in using my endowment fund that grandpa created for sexual hamsters to mate. Grandma screamed, \"My Foot Is Asleep!\" We chopped it to arouse circulation. More than just feeling returned. So, I quickly left with a dozen starved, crazed weasels on my face. Do you have any bear claws? Wait a minute and thirty-six seconds, I'll go check.\n \n Later that day I met someone who made you think twice before taking a bite of Big Macs. Big Macs make me do strange things, like once, I turned into a large piece of pizza with cheese on my stomach. It sucked the Big Mac and large Coke right out of my belly, which I'll show you after I send you a picture with this message. I'm almost done; half way there, my bulbous, purple, animated dinosaur friend. Do sentence fragments fragment sentences? I think so. I don't know if my pockets can fit fragments. Not with all the other stuff pushing against my pocket's gravitational balance. Lisa Lisa Lisa. You're three times as fast as my last gerbil, who got in my left pocket with the cunning use of flags.

I only lied to hide the fact that I love them stuffed. Stuffed with all that junk inside an IHOP French mime. Mimes just drive trucks and wear way too many underpants for just one mime.

   "Dear Lisa,\n \n I want to tell you you're hot. Hot as in every way possible. In fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool.

   "Dear Lisa,\n \n I want to tell you you're hot. Hot as in every way possible. In fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. The way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: If you'll remove that top button I would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. Do you like warts? I hope so. There's this longing--call me Horndog--touching the wart will make you crave a corndog. Corndogs aside, I fantasize about you in a sexual way, but not an infexible lay. I want to stretch my muscles and excite you. Hopefully you will notice my humongous eyeball on my shoe.\n \n But what do massive, humongous warts have to do to impress a lady like you, even if they are as big as bears? If you don't like big warts tell me, and I'll find something bigger for you to look at. Like my monster in my pocket that is fighting to get out of the oven. Why do I have an oven in my pants? It's so I can cook a baked potato for the president of Mr. Potato Head. But why would you care? Because, french fries are disgusting. Want some nachos? I have cheese for nachos. It's in my pocket too, I have big pockets. I keep all my stuff in them as well as a giant car. It's pretty amazing how much pocket space I have considering that for years I've worn short shorts.\n \n Well, I hope an impression was made on you. I wanna pounce, sound pretty dumb to you? I think you might want some of my prune juice. It's sweet for having been in my mouth all last month. It's full-bodied, yet fruity-bouqueted, and I ask not what your measurements are but what you can do with your measurements. Well....what can you do? I really want to see you bounce up and down twenty-five times. Because twenty-four just doesn't cut it. Although, 24 is on tonight. I think it ends tonight actually. It's good, but guess what's better. The West Wing! In fact, I love moronic liberals, but I especially want to ask why you haven't spoken to me. I just think you might enjoy talking with a genius for once. That's right, I'm really a closet quantum physicist. Does strange quark mean anything to you? I hope so: it's Star Trek meets Quantum Leap. Quarks are my best friends. But I can't have them for breakfast. I love them like they're family. Charming stranger up there thinks he's cool. But really, he's a jerk. I mean, who enjoys quantum physics? Only the most intelligent of men, and the craziest, would seriously consider quantum physics as a respectable hobby.\n \n Allow me to offer you a concert ticket for Woodstock. I know you would love Rocking Out with dead people since you look like a Dead Head. Want some hooch? Well that's beside my computer. Don't touch it or it will explode. That's what mamma says. But I like when daddy shouts \"KA-BOOM\" like a stick of dynamite in my right pants pocket. Yes, I have bombs there too. As you can see, I'm well armed. I'm well endowed so watch me do this. Isn't it cool?! Or even Awesome?! So what if I did it again? Oops I spilled coffee on your head. That must hurt. Would cream help? Or sugar perhaps? Is sugar good for the soul?\n \n I mentioned endowed: an intriguing word. But how can it compare to a sword? I measured from the hilt to my head, shaft to the tip of the footgear I wear while engaging in using my endowment fund that grandpa created for sexual hamsters to mate. Grandma screamed, \"My Foot Is Asleep!\" We chopped it to arouse circulation. More than just feeling returned. So, I quickly left with a dozen starved, crazed weasels on my face. Do you have any bear claws? Wait a minute and thirty-six seconds, I'll go check.\n \n Later that day I met someone who made you think twice before taking a bite of Big Macs.

Isn't it cool?! Or even Awesome?! So what if I did it again? Oops I spilled coffee on your head. That must hurt. Would cream help? Or sugar perhaps? Is sugar good for the soul?\n \n I mentioned endowed: an intriguing word. But how can it compare to a sword? I measured from the hilt to my head, shaft to the tip of the footgear I wear while engaging in using my endowment fund that grandpa created for sexual hamsters to mate. Grandma screamed, \"My Foot Is Asleep!\" We chopped it to arouse circulation. More than just feeling returned. So, I quickly left with a dozen starved, crazed weasels on my face. Do you have any bear claws? Wait a minute and thirty-six seconds, I'll go check.\n \n Later that day I met someone who made you think twice before taking a bite of Big Macs. Big Macs make me do strange things, like once, I turned into a large piece of pizza with cheese on my stomach. It sucked the Big Mac and large Coke right out of my belly, which I'll show you after I send you a picture with this message. I'm almost done; half way there, my bulbous, purple, animated dinosaur friend. Do sentence fragments fragment sentences? I think so. I don't know if my pockets can fit fragments. Not with all the other stuff pushing against my pocket's gravitational balance. Lisa Lisa Lisa. You're three times as fast as my last gerbil, who got in my left pocket with the cunning use of flags. A Russian flag, a British flag, and a French horn, wait a French toast too. French toast is overrated. You wanna try something new? Okay, I lied about their ratings. I only lied to hide the fact that I love them stuffed. Stuffed with all that junk inside an IHOP French mime. Mimes just drive trucks and wear way too many underpants for just one mime. It's sick really. Why anyone would stuff french toast in their hair? Why don't they put gel in and some earwax to help moisten your soft, sensuous French Maid appearance. What's a French maid compared to a Spanish maid? Well, one has a feather duster and the other uses a Dustbuster. Dustbuster or Ghostbuster? I love Spanish fly and Hungarian pancakes. Mmmmm, yummy. Pass the syrup. I hate syrup. KILL THE SYRUP! It tastes like ####. No, really it does. Do do actually, leaving the rear.\n \n Anyway, now that I'm finally cutting loose, footloose, kick off the diving board and don't crash into the water. That can really hurt, sort of like the time I hang-glided naked over the icy tundra in Siberia. Talk about frozen, I could feel nothing smaller than my big head, which if you had one yourself, you'd know that big heads hurt. When you bang on the drums, ice from my left pants pocket chills my left leg. But I'm such a he-man when I'm cold that I feel it all the time to keep rythmn with my heart. It beats in a strange location, like my knees and my throbbing, huge...nose. What's that smell? My goodness it's",
