   "\n Iraq to 'give preference' to French firms\n By EMMA VANDORE - AP Business Writer - Associated Press\n Wednesday, November 18, 2009\n \n France has \"a special place\" in Iraq, and French businesses will get preference if they invest and do business in the country, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani told The Associated Press on Wednesday.\n \n The Iraqi leader used the third day of his state visit to France to push for greater French investment in his country that has been ravaged by war since 2003 at a meeting with the main French employers' association, Medef.\n \n \"We are also encouraging American and British companies,\" he told AP on the sidelines of the meeting. \"But at the same time we are encouraging French companies because they are very experienced in Iraq, and we want to have a strategic relation with France.\"\n \n \"We are encouraging many countries in the world, from China to the United States of America to Brazil, but France has a special place,\" Talabani added.\n \n France wants to rebuild commercial ties with Iraq that all but collapsed after U.S.-led invasion to oust Saddam Hussein. Iraq is building its international ties before a pullout of American forces that is scheduled to end by 2011.\n \n France had significant economic and commercial links to Iraq historically - notably during the Saddam era.\n \n\n \n In a typical French move, they wait until the fighting's over and then jump in.\n What surprises me is that the French voted against UN actions to remove Saddam Hussein because he had been bribing them during the Oil for Food Program, yet the Iraqis want to do business with these snakes. \n \n Another example: The French joined the Brits and the US to patrol the No-Fly Zone after the first Iraq War, but France bailed out when Saddam Hussein began shooting at the planes.",

However, they did support with great bravery the American action in Afghanistan:\n \nAs the grieving families of the 10 soldiers killed in Afghanistan looked on, French President Nicolas Sarkozy honoured France's fallen heroes at a solemn ceremony in Paris Thursday.\n \n Speaking at a ceremony at Les Invalides, the golden-domed monument in Paris where France's war dead are commemorated, Sarkozy hailed the \"valour, courage, comradeship and solidarity\" of the soldiers.\n \n \"All of the French nation pays tribute to 10 of its sons who paid the ultimate price, who laid their lives down for their country,\" said Sarkozy.\n \n The 10 paratroopers were killed in a battle with Taliban militants that began late Monday and continued into Tuesday, in the Sarobi area at the edge of Kabul province in Afghanistan. Twenty-one soldiers were injured, eleven of whom were brought back to France Wednesday. The attack was the deadliest for the French army in more than 20 years.\n\n http://mobile.france24.com/en/20080821-france-pays-tribute-fallen-troops-france-afghanistan-0",

   "So why did Osama bin Laden get away at Tora Bora?\n\n \n From a Newsweek interview in a Delta Force member's recently released book:\n \n\n Tell me about the first major break you got regarding bin Laden ' s location.\n On the night of [Dec. 10], the CIA came into the room and passed me an eight-digit grid location, which is good down to 10 meters. You have to understand that there are various methods in obtaining this information. Some are real time; some are dated several hours and even half a day. But we took it and loaded 33 Delta operators in nine pickup trucks and took off to the battlefield. We had three guys up there already with the mujahedin on a frontal attack. We did intercept a radio transmission that said, \"The father is trying to break out of the siege,\" which gave us cause to believe that it might be bin Laden himself that was under attack by the mujahedin with our three guys up there directing bombs. General Ali had called saying he had bin Laden surrounded. We met him halfway from the battlefield. He was coming away from the battle with about 20 pickup trucks of mujahedin. He led me to believe he was going to turn around with us. He did not. On the way to the mountains we learned that our three guys were abandoned by the mujahedin because the mujahedin was afraid of Al Qaeda at night. I had to make a decision. Do we rescue our three Americans or go after bin Laden? I decided to recover our guys. We were successful in that. Then we had to determine whether we should go toward the grid location without the mujahedin. [The U.S.] certainly wanted to put an Afghan or Muslim face on taking out bin Laden. With our orders of the mujahedin taking the lead and making it look like the Afghans were doing this by themselves, we were basically stuck.\n \n Why is that?\n In my opinion, it was just the political sensitivity of it. [They didn't want it to look like it] was a Westerner that killed Osama bin Laden. They wanted it to look like it was a Muslim who killed him because he was an extremist, and not necessarily consistent with the peaceful, loving Muslim community at large.\n \n What happened after that?\n The afternoon of Dec. 11, 2001, elements of both Ali and his subordinate warlord attacked hilltop 2685, the strongpoint for Al Qaeda's defenses where we believe bin Laden was held up. They overran Al Qaeda up there and when it was over that evening the subordinate was up there, not Ali. That night, negotiations began with an Al Qaeda lieutenant about surrendering. When my guys showed up the next morning, they learned that the mujahedin were not going to move forward or let us move forward because they had told Al Qaeda that they would negotiate for a ceasefire and surrender. [The ceasefire] basically allowed, if not bin Laden himself, certainly his fighters the ability to reload and reposition.\n \n When did you catch up with him again?\n On Dec. 14, we heard a real-time voice from bin Laden. He apologized to his fighters for getting them into this mess and allowed them to surrender. The next day, our guys up in the mountains spotted roughly 50 Al Qaeda fighters moving into a cave. The mujahedin allies up there said they spotted a tall man in a camouflage jacket. We put two and two together. There were five cave openings in the mountain they went into, and we struck all openings for about two and a half hours.\n \n Months later, a group of American and Canadian forces returned to Afghanistan to figure out what happened to bin Laden. What did they find?\n That was later in July of 2002. A team of the 101st Airborne, some Canadian engineers and a U.S. forensic team moved in the mountains with some mujahedin. They went to specific locations that were targeted from the air and tried to dig through the rubble to do DNA sampling on the various bodies. They went to the location where we bombed for two and a half hours, but the terrain is so daunting that it was hard to bring heavy equipment or enough explosives to open those caves. They made an attempt but had to give up and never entered the caves in question. What they did do was move around the battlefield to all the [Al Qaeda] graves. They removed the remains, took DNA samplings, reburied them and departed. They found no evidence that he was buried there.\n \n What do you think happened to him?\n I think after the night of the 11th he started to see the writing on the wall, and his own personal survival became more important than the jihad. We think he started moving to the east toward the main valley that goes into Pakistan. At some point, we're pretty sure he was wounded through bomb shrapnel in his shoulder, which has been discussed in custodial interviews at Guant\u00e1namo Bay by other fighters that were at Tora Bora. We think he received medical attention at a local village and we're pretty sure he was put into a vehicle and moved south across the border into Pakistan somewhere between the 17th and 19th of December 2001.\n \n Q&A: Inside the Hunt for Bin Laden in Tora Bora | Newsweek National News | Newsweek.com\n \n",
