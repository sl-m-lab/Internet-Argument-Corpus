There is nothing illegal about that.\n \n In fact...\n \"As of 1990, 6 million to 14 million children in the United States were living with a gay or lesbian parent. (National Adoption Information Clearinghouse, a service of the U.S. Administration for Children and Families.)\"\n http://www.colage.org/research/facts.html\n \n Gays CURRENTLY are engaged in having families on the scale of millions.\n So preventing us from marrying IS NOT going to prevent us from having families.\n \n \n And furthermore, you can have a family WITHOUT getting married. Single people adopt all the time. A lot of states do not restrict adoption between parents who are not married.\n \n So, not only are these standards you talk about \"new\", a lot of the standards you just described are non-existent.",
