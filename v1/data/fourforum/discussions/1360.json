Second, a national system would be more helpful in tracking crimes after they have happened, to bring the perpetrators to justice. \"\n \n You mean like the Canadian system? I don't recall it being successfully used yet.\n \n \n \"Hand grip ID tagging. This is technologically probably still in the future, but it would be a good goal to work for. The theory is, each gun is \"registered\" to one's person palm prints (the legal purchaser of the gun), and only that person can fire that gun. \"\n \n So if a cop loses their gun in a fight, and tries to pick up a buddies, they can't shoot it. So if a home is invaded, and the legal owner of a firearm is incapacitated, then no one else can defend themselves with the gun. \n And do you believe that a skitchy electronic system could not be disabled? Do you believe that a reliable system that can make instant IDs\n in adverse conditions is possible? Do you not think that home-manufactured firearms without the system would crop up on the black market? Or that foreign imports, exempt from the laws, could become popular? An ID system would cause far more havoc than not. As for the problem of kids shooting themselves-which this idea may prevent the occasional case of-it can be solved through education, an ideal that you support.\n \n \n \"",

Yes you right that the people who import and traffic those illegal weapons into New York DON'T FEAR the law. They are already breaking existing firearm laws. Another firearm law is no deterence to someone who is breaking the first existing law. \n \n First degree murder will get you life in prison. Once you commit the first murder then there really is nothing from holding you back from killing a second person, is there? That is exactly what will happen with new gun control, the people who break the existing laws will mere just scoff at the new ones.\n \n Before the anti-gunners think that keeping track of firearms nation wide is a cure all, please check this:\n \n http://www.khyber.org/pashtopictures/replicas.shtml\n \n These people make modern military weapons with nothing more advanced than what is available at highschool metal shops.",

   "Pro-gunners are fond of saying things like \"we don't need more gun-control laws, we need tougher punishments and longer prison sentences.\" Yet America has capital punishment and the world's highest incarceration rate and still we have very high rates of gun violence compared to other developed nations like Australia and the UK.\n \n \"More than 5.6 million Americans are in prison or have served time there, according to a new report by the Justice Department released Sunday. That's 1 in 37 adults living in the United States, the highest incarceration level in the world.\"\n http://www.worldrevolution.org/article/984 \n \n So I certainly have doubts about the plan of pro-gunners to reduce gun violence.\n\n \n Maybe you could enlighten me as to how and why a CRIMINAL would obey any of your proposed 'solutions' to 'gun violence'? \n \n Compared to UK and Austrailia? You better quit looking at 'dated' information from Sarah Brady. Last time I checked, both UK and AU have seen an alarming increase in 'home invasions', for one, thanks to their 'registration/confiscation' of almost every firearm in both countries. Guess what? The CRIMINALS didn't turn theirs in! Imagine that? Incredible! Silly criminals.\n \n Sorry, you propaganda is just that.. PROPAGANDA.",

These countries banned guns because these countries did not have aright like the 2nd amend! Basically what this means is you cannot compare America to any country unless that country has a right like the 2nd amend.\n \n Make your mind up! Is there the number you claim in prison or is there the number that have served time in prison?\n \n Right now it appears the people that get the longest prison term are people that commit drug crimes. Well are most gun crimes committed where drugs are present? If so then maybe drugs are a root cause of gun crime. Maybe it is a good reason that drugs are illegal if drugs cause gun crime.\n \n By the way I will pay whatever it takes to keep dangerous criminals off of the street of America!\n \n It appears anti gun/gun control advocates feel allowing dangerous criminals out of prison then trying to get these dangerous criminals to obey the law will stop these dangerous criminals from getting guns! All gun control laws do is stop law abiding citizens from having guns!",
