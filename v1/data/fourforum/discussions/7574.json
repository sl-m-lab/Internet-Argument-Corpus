Hand guns which are held in one hand and everything else is a rifle.\nI can imagine the Marine DS having trouble teaching you the difference between your weapon and your gun.\n \n For your edification, a rifle has a long barrel that has been scored (machined, engraved, scratched, etched, whatever you want to call it) on the inside so that the lines spiral toward the end of the barrel. The spirals inside the barrel are called rifling. This causes the projectile (bullet) to spin one way or the other and adds stability to the projectile as it flies toward the target. It keeps the bullet from tumbling through the air.\n \n A shotgun is a smooth bore gun and has no rifling inside the barrel. A shotgun is NOT a rifle. (Because it is a smooth bore firearm.)\n \n Modern cannons usually have rifling. Modern pistols have rifling but are not considered rifles. I don't know how long the barrel (or stock) has to be before a pistol becomes a rifle, but I have seen pistols with extremely long barrels...one that had been fitted with a shoulder stock and forestock (still had the pistol grip and the revolving chamber) so I suppose there's a point at which the name would change.",

If a police officer draws his weapon, it is always reported as a revolver. My morning paper said that the wounded man was hit by buckshot pillets. Of course everything is bigger in Texas, but we still use birdshot for quail.\n Dono\n\n \n I think I heard tonight the shotgun used was a 28 gauge and indeed the shells were loaded with tiny birdshot. I have never hunted a small bird like quail nor fired a shotgun smaller than a 20 gauge but it makes sense that one would use such a gun so as not to blow half the bird to smithereens.\n \n I gotta agree wholeheartedly at the hilarious news reporting when it comes to anything involving a firearm. A personal pet peeve is everything ends up being described as \"a high-powered weapon\". It's a toss up between that and headlines like \"SUV hits and kills a man\" for giggles.\n \n Well, it was bound to happen:\n \n http://dickcheneyquailhunt.cf.huffingtonpost.com/",

Around here, most shoot 20 gauge or 12 guage. Whether you blow the bird to smithereens or not is a function of pellet size, choke, and range. A 12 guage firing 7 1/2 shot through a modified choke at 20 yards will kill your quail without severe damage. A .410 with a full choke and firing #6 shot will pulverize the bird at that range.",

I have known personally of several hunting accidents, and in none of the cases was anyone charged with a crime. \n \n And Cheney has taken responsibility for his actions. He accepts full responsibility for the shooting. I am not aware of any law or statute requiring that if the vice president shoots someone that he is required to personally notify the media within a certain amount of time...are you?\n\n \n Yes has but he was late as hell in saying he was sorry. And as far as I'm concerned I will not give Cheney sympathy. If he can't tell what the hell he is shooting at he should not even have a gun. Or a water pistol as far as that goes.\n \n Now if a Democrat ever did what Cheney did the Republicans would want that Democrat shoot.",

From what Cheney said in the interview with Fox, it even appears that he appologized to Whittington while he was still lying on the ground, before they put him into the ambulance. He followed up with the hospital the same day on Whittingtons condition, and appears to be in close contact with him since the incident. \n \n And sorry to burst your ego-bubble, but I don't think I heard Cheney ask for sympathy from the American public.

And to down play this off like nothing is pretty stupid.\n\n So you are saying that Whittington needs to sue Cheney? Thankfully, not everyone is a litigious in thought as you seem to be. What Whittington does is his business, not yours. Perhaps you would sue your friend over an accident, but it does not appear that Whittington wants to. In fact, he just spoke to the media for the first time today, he seemed to speak favorably of Cheney. So as far as I can see, the exchange over the last few days sums up to this:\n Accident-apology-forgiveness. Wow, what a concept...forgiveness.",

   "Hate to burst you bubble but Cheney owes Whittington more then an apology . After all if Cheney shot you. You would want to be compensated for injurys and pain and suffering. And to down play this off like nothing is pretty stupid.\n\n \n I owuld imagine they view it as both parties fault (Cheny and Whittington anyway). Both violated important, well understood, safety rules for hunting. \n \n I have been thinkign about this a lot lately, mostly because I am an avid hunter and there are lessons to be learned here. I think that for the most part, the fault here lies with Whittington. While it is true that you theoretically should never fire unless you know for sure what is behind your target, As others have pointed out, in brush hunting this is not realistic. You know the lay of the land, and where your hunting buddies are. If domebody else wonders into the field, especially in somebodies field fo fire, they run the risk of being accidentally shot. \n \n Whittington should have approached the group from the rear, and announced his approach the minute he was in range to do so (and if you are in range of a 28 gauge, you are in range to announce your approach). He withdrew from the hunting party and returned to the vehicle to rest. There was no way that Cheney, or anybody else in the field, would have known that he decide to return to the group. \n \n We hunt birds here (kansas, it is kind of a big deal) and a lot of the best bird country is CRP, which often grows higher than your head. You always take shots where you cannot be 100% sure what is behind the target. I hunt fairly often with my wifes grandfather. His is 90, and not real spry. He routinely drops us at one end of the field then drives around to the other end to block. If he abandonded his post at the other end of the field and wandered in to find the rest of us, there is a good chance he might end up getting shot. Luckily he is smart enough (and considerate enough) not to do that kind of thing. If he did, I probably would not hunt with him anymore. The last thing I need on my conscience is the death of my wifes grandfather.\n \n This is a nothign deal. It was a mutual mistake made among friends.",

   "My first reaction, and most of my subsquent thought, is that yes, it's a mistake among friends, it's not really a big deal.\n \n Of course, I know some remarkable individuals that take everything they do very seriously, and to make such a potentially fatal blunder (on both parts...choosing to hunt in a low visibility error is still a choice), is not necessarily something we want to see our \"leaders\" doing. Are they this careless with our armed forces? (!)\n \n Another part of what I've heard, that sounds somewhat reasonable (although most conspiracy theories do), is that:\n \n 1. It was out of the norm not to announce this immediately.\n 2. The secret service turned away an officer investigating the incident and remarked they would discuss it the following day (time to let that blood alcohol level drop and get their stories synch'd up).\n 3. There was a lot of confusion among witnesses and Cheney's remarks with regards to whether there was alcohol at lunch, how much was consumed, by who, and when...all relevant to many injury accidents (car, boating, etc.).\n \n Putting all three facts together looks suspicious, and when it's an elected executive of such enormous power (Cheney is like president-lite), it's perhaps worth a look. All this air time? Most news media is about entertainment, not fair, balanced, or otherwise facts-only information to better society. If we cared about what the news media did with their air time, we'd complain 90% of the time, not just about this. (I complain 90% of the time, so I watch news hour and listen to NPR)\n \n -Mach",
