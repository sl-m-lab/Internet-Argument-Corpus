In my case a lawyer was there, who was also a dick head cop.....if you think you're sobered up enough go ahead a blow...cause under .08 you're safe...but if you know you're still pretty drunk go ahead and take the 6 month penalty and your lawyer has more to work with to get you out of it.\n \n Fourth: There is no such thing as justice, but money.

   "No sympathy from me. The advice you offer sounds like you're plotting your next defense. I drink, but in this politically correct day and age with DWI quotas I'd never get behind the wheel of a vehicle after more than one in a two-hour period, even knowing all the statistics of my 195lb weight being able to dissipate one ounce of alcohol per hour. Why? Our state has the .8 threshold for a DWI citation, but it also has a driving impaired by alcohol/controlled substance citation at the citing officer's discretion not requiring any field or chemical tests. Same penalty structure, same suddenly astronomical insurance rates, same stupidity is the way most judges here view either citation. Getting a designated driver, hiring a car, taking public transportation, renting a room or walking are all far better options than drinking and driving. And far less expensive.",

   "Sorry I guess I should have explained my situation a little more clearer. This is what happened....\n \n First I admit before that I have drank and drove home before...but with in the past 3-4 months before that night I wasn't doing that anymore...since one of my best friends got a DUI...we all had a buddy system where we drove each other home.....\n \n So a bunch of buddies and I headed out to this huge party down in the boon docks...where I rarely go...it's a small town way south of where I live...we were in a huge heated horse arena thing and there was like 150 people there and stuff....well my buddy and I were drinking and my other buddy was driving so we got pretty blitzed....well that party got over about 1 in the morning..and my friends found there was another party down the road about a mile or so....I really didn't want to go but my friend that was driving did...so I said whatever...I want to be home by 3 a.m....so that would mean an hour or two just hanging out there....\n \n Well we got there and it was only like 40-50 people in another barn...talk about hickish right?....anyways so most of the people there were around 21-25 years old...I'm only 19 now.....you'll understand in a second.....\n \n Well my bestfriend's ex-girlfriend was there and her best friend wanted my friend, Cody, to leave.....Cody asked why since his Ex didn't care....she, the best friend, was all drunk and started yelling...well at that point some big dudes came over and started telling us to leave...I proceeded to get in the middle and say I'll get everyone to leave...just give me a minute or two while I gather all of us up...like 15 people..and we'd be gone.....well the kid that was driving Cody was up on stage chasing tail and dancing.....so I dragged him off and brought him down by the 'crowd' and I started trying to drag people away from fighting...well they all started shoving but we broke it up...then my one friend starts yelling all beligerant drunk how it's BS and they shouldn't be wanting to fight us when we were leaving...I turn to yell at him when all of a sudden I get shoved for no reason...I get ###### so my friend grabs me and just tells me let's go....\n \n Next thing I know I get rocked in the back of the head while I'm walking out the door.....so I jump out side...and knock out the dude who hit me....well my bestfriend saw another kid going to hit me from behind so he lays him out...and like 5 guys grab him and start kicking the XXXX out of him....we break the fight up and I run to my car....at this point the whole party is outside...and throwing beer bottles at us...2 other fights broke out...and I was just trying to get the hell out of there....\n \n Well long story short...we get out....and I had jumped in the car with 2 other friends....I had been knocked out for a couple seconds, had one to many beers, confused as to where I was (I was genuinely lost) and ###### about being jumped by guys that were that old and I had nothing to do with the whole thing...\n \n Well I had planned on pulling over and letting my friend drive, who was sober...once I found a place we recognized...instead I panicked and started speed cause I couldn't find any road that I knew....next thing I know I see a car pullo out from behind a barn...I was doing 70 in a 55....so the rest is pretty easy to figure out from there...\n \n I was speeding in the country..and when I say speeding...I was way out where I saw maybe two or 3 house/barns in sight after 15 minutes of driving lost....there was no one out where I was...\n \n Yes I know it's bad to drink and drive....my good friends dad died from it...my 3 good friends have DUIs.....and I'm smart enough to know why....\n \n It was just a bogus night.....so I find out Thursday at court what exactly is going to happen...",

   "If you blew a .08 you should have taken the charges to trial, lawyer or not, unless you appeared obviously impaired to the arresting officer. I would guess that would be the case considering you were still probably highly agitated from the circumstances minutes before being pulled over.\n \n At any rate, this is going to cost you a lot of money (and time) even if it is your first D.U.I. I had my only D.U.I. back in 1990 and as I recall the fine was around $1,200, the two hour three night a week classes cost $1,000 and the transportion costs of six months without a liscense, plus the $100 bond the county refused to refund (f'n crooks). \n \n I had backed a car out of a driveway into to move it to the other side of a private driveway so I had room to work on my car which was broken down - the engine was out of my car. While doing so I bumped another car in the drive way and the old no-life neighbors (noses pressed against the window no doubt) across the street decided to call the police as if their life was in danger apparently...four county squads arrived and I resisted arrest. I didn't fight with them - just refused to be handcuffed. Because I had backed the car's back tires onto a public road while moving it - it was a D.U.I. according to the police and according to the court.\n \n Hey, it's not like the old days when I was a young buck - the cops would cut a person some slack back then. A good cop then would have taken the keys and given ya'll a ride home...maybe talked to you or your parents. Now, it's all about the money. The cops have quota's and salary base incentives for making arrests because it generates mucho revenue for the state. Why do you think they conduct all of the mis-named \"roadside safety checks\"? They should be called what they are; legalized roadside shakedowns.",

They should be called what they are; legalized roadside shakedowns.\n\n \n Wrong! It's all about the DEATHS caused by stupidity while driving drunk. \n \n\n Of the 16,694 people who died in alcohol-related crashes in 2004, 8256 (57%) were killed in crashes where the driver had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .08 g/dL or higher. The legal limit for BAC is currently .08 in all states in the US.\n \n Traffic fatalities in alcohol-related crashes fell by 2.4 percent, from 17,105 in 2003 to 16,694 in 2004. Although this is definitely an improvement, it is still a lot of dead fellow citizens. To put this in perspective, it is equivalent to a fully loaded Boeing 747 crashing, and leaving no survivors, every nine days all year long - over 39 airplanes in total.\n \n The 16,694 fatalities in alcohol-related crashes during 2004 represent an average of one alcohol-related fatality every 31 minutes.\n \n NHTSA estimates that alcohol was involved in 39 percent of fatal crashes and in 7 percent of all crashes in 2004.\n \n In 2004, 21 percent of the children age 14 and younger who were killed in motor vehicle crashes were killed in alcohol-related crashes.\n \n An estimated 248,000 people were injured in crashes where police reported that alcohol was present - an average of one person injured approximately every 2 minutes.\n \n The rate of alcohol involvement in fatal crashes is more than 3 times higher at night than during the day (60% vs. 18%).\n \n The highest percentage of drivers in fatal crashes who had BAC levels of .08 or higher was for males and drivers ages 21 to 24.\n \n The percentages of drivers with BAC levels of .08 or higher in fatal crashes in 2004 were 27% for motorcycle operators, 22% for passenger cars, and 21% for light trucks. The percentage of drivers with BAC levels .08 or higher in fatal crashes was the lowest for large trucks (1%).\n \n In 2004, 85 percent (11,791) of the 13,952 drivers with BAC of .01 or higher who were involved in fatal crashes had BAC levels at or above .08, and 51 percent (7,084) had BAC levels at or above .16. The most frequently recorded BAC level among drinking drivers involved in fatal crashes was .18.\n http://www.alcoholalert.com/drunk-driving-statistics.html\n \n",
