   "CNN is as biased for Obama (Democrats/liberals), as FOX is for Republicans/conservatives. \n \n Why these two channels even get views from the American public, I will never know. News is supposed to be objective yet every time I see one of these programs it is as if they are trying to convince me.... The media in this country is here to entertain you, and keep your precious mind occupied from free thinking. Our government doesn't want a populace that's capable of critical thinking. Just mindless, neo-surf consumers who are willing to give up their sovereign rights at the moment of another attack, or regime change. Yes I am talking about both the Bush Administration, and Obama. It is amazing how people, without knowing D!CK about this man (Obama) have flocked to him like if he is the messiah. America is a country full of dimwitted sheeple, and you will all eventually be led to the slaughter because you couldn't think for yourselves. I am not fear mongering, it's just the truth and it's inconvenient for most of you. Whats funny is that a lot f you will call me the \"conspiracy theorist\".... The joke is on all of you! Believe it. Let's vote for Obama, and have the rest of our rights stripped from us, because after the 2nd what else do we have? Or we can go with McCain and in debt ourselves further with this pointless distraction of a war. We really should have given Ron Paul a chance. Just because he doesn't have celebrity status like everyone else doesn't mean he's not the right guy, especially when more active troops support him, as well as more grass roots organizations from both left, and right. He is an idealist, and a constitutionalist and this is what America needs (as well as for you all to get off your lazy asses and do something), not another robot who will represent the status quo, and further infringe on our constitutional rights!!! Sorry for the rant, as it went way further then the topic asked, but you all need to see this, and you need to spread the word, otherwise don't blame anyone for your complacency.",

   "As a synopsis writer, I can say MSNBC I watched was also biased in favor of Obama over others.\n\n I can't disagree with any of the characterizations of news groups here. The question is whether the bias is justifiable. FAUX News repeatedly makes unsubstantiated and downright false claims. I've seen some pretty damn stupid stuff on CNN. At least MSNBC has taken shots at both sides, but I saw a bit the other day that made a halfway decent point yet blew it way out of proportion, surely due to \"bias.\"\n \n \nThere rarely is an unbiased journalist out there anymore...if there ever was.\n\n If an unbiased review of the facts leads a person to favor one side or the other, is that person considered biased? I think that's quite unfair. If one side runs this country into the ground, isn't that worth considering? If the other side swore to lift the county back up and showed a nice false start before sitting back and doing nothing else, is pointing this out bias?",

   "\n If an unbiased review of the facts leads a person to favor one side or the other, is that person considered biased?\n\n You're biased if you let your beliefs (right or wrong) taint the way you present the evidence.\n \n Countless times, I'd LOVE to interject personal slants (and it IS very easy to do in my field) but, professionalism prevents me from doing so.\n Heck, I even cover religious news too. And it's presented free from personal bias. Well, as much as I can...all I do is simplify the news into a smaller, more concise message and look for what I'm told to look for.\n \n \n \nI think that's quite unfair. If one side runs this country into the ground, isn't that worth considering? If the other side swore to lift the county back up and showed a nice false start before sitting back and doing nothing else, is pointing this out bias?\n\n Who's to say in an objective manner if one side IS running this country into the ground?\n \n Take the point on Bush's \"I'll be a uniter\" mantra. And the result being something far from a 'united America'.\n Is that His fault or the fault of those who'd oppose him no matter what due to personal bias? He did 'steal the 'lection' after all. \n In watching this current election, from my biased point of view, the democrats and liberals don't appear to be uniters either. \n So, you can blame Bush for the failure OR you can blaim sabateurs in the opposing party...or even his own.\n You can blame the media who, after throwing weight behind Bush, turned against him in a short period of time.\n I recall tales of 'Iraq IS another Vietnam Quagmire' during the 1st weeks of the offensive in 03. Long before any of Bush's policies showed through by journalist who had no military knowledge, experience or anything. Purely because repeatedly saying something DOES have an effect on bobble-headed parrots who listen and want something to be true.\n \n \n In reading these forums constantly, I can easily note the levels of bias used.\n Heck, I'm even guilty too. Of course, I try to work on it to be an art form rather than just let my inner thoughts flow.\n \n The problems I note with this threads direction is the belief that it's all 'the gubments' secret conspiracy. When actually, it's more of a business conspiracy. All things are related to money, comfortable living and control. The government is too monolithic and divisive to have this type of control. That's why we have lobbyist who front for business to get favorable laws enacted or harmful ones prevented. It's not the business who is in the pocket of the politician often but the other way around.\n \n And psychology plays a HUGE role in who these things work.\n The media is going to hire charismatic people who spark controversy so that viewers will tune in and watch all of those nice commercials in the process.\n AND if you think TiVo will circumvent this...you have the cunning use of joint ventures, sponsorship and product placement.\n One of the chief aspects of my job is looking for that sweeeet product placement during TV news. The subtle banter by the anchors at times as they mention which coffee shop they visited in the morning or which actor is their favorite.\n One of my favorite habits IRL is quoting 'studies' done. The news plays them constantly. Like the bible, you can find a study to support anything.\n Just recently there was one that said ceel phone users have a greater chance to get brain cancer. Another not that long ago said no.\n And, all the while the journalist are covering these segments...they're using Sprint or Nokia or iPhones.\n \n \n Bottom line in reality is you'll be hard pressed to FIND a truely unbiased review of evidence.\n It approaches impossibility to even access all the evidence at times on some subjects to form an honest review.\n And then you have a persons inbuilt bias that they have to wade through. And most people live in denial of their own bias. Journalist more so it would seem.\n After all, they're not biased because they can't be. They're 'independent thinkers'. Investigators and curious people who want the 'truth'.\n It's a form of blind arrogance in believing this that leads them to not self-check their work and allows bias to slip into their work.\n \n And then again, some simply don't even care and knowlingly push biased slants to their stoories.\n \n He's a biased report.\n \n \"A small group of PETA protestors showed up at the KFC restaurant on Main Street to rally against how chickens are raised and prepared for consumption.\"\n \n Want to know where the bias is?\n \n The word SMALL.\n It implies minority and thus insignificance.\n And, really, who's to determine what constitutes small.\n \n Now, to write it in reverse...\n \n \"A group of PETA advocates showed up at the KFC restaurant on Main Street to rally against how chickens are raised in inhumane conditions and slaughtered for market.\"\n \n Change protest for advocate.\n Add in inhumane and use the word slaughtered.\n The slant of the message is changed.\n \n Now, why would this be important?\n Because such subtlies DO (at least as proven in the psychology fields) have an impact on the market.\n Companies (and celebrities) who pay for my services want to know how they are presented in the media.\n Is the press favorable or not?\n \n \n Did you know Starbucks had media commentary when they changed their logo to the naked mermaid recently 'like old times'?\n \n \n As to the journalist?\n Their role is also motivated by their bosses and personal ambitions.\n They want to be known. They want to be PART of the action rather than some 'messenger'.\n There is a secret pleasure in knowing you can manipulate people and compel them. It's part of their personality and what makes them who there are. Without it, they wouldn't be able to tease or intimidate answers out of stubborn subjects.\n \n \n \n \n @jedi, by tangible goods, I meant MONEY.\n That's the name of the game in it's most simplist form.\n And for journalism, I think it unbiased reporting went the way of the Dodo when sponsorship became more and more focused on.\n When those able to afford TV's became poorer and poorer...and thus, less educated as a whole...and desired entertainment over education.\n It's all about the least common denominator.\n And making people stupid and gullible is FAR easier than it is educating them.\n \n \n From my point of view, I'm constantly amazed at the idiocy of people who think themselves the opposite.\n I call it the 'Enlightenment' factor. Somehow, a person knows something to be true even if, objectively, it isn't.\n One common 'enligntened' belief is the one where someone believes that if you treat someone with respect, be nice to them and give them everything they need and even want, that that person will be nice and cooperative in return.\n This isn't often reflected in reality but it IS a belief that's regurgitated quite often so, people start to believe it in opposition to the evidence.\n \n In the end, if you tell a lie often enough...it'll eventually be believed as truth.\n \n I'm sure there's a study out there somewhere that has an accurate number on how many times this lie has to be told and which segments of the population need more lying to and which ones need less.\n \n I'm also sure there's a contradictorary study that challenges those results with findings of it's own.\n \n I'm sure that these studies were funded by businesses and lobbyists who petitioned gov't officials to get ear-mark grants.\n \n Regardless of those findings though, I'm 100% positive that the easiest person to lie to is yourself. After all, you already know what you want to hear.\n \n \n \n Sorry for going on at lengh but one of the more common aspects of people in my field is cynacism.\n But, that comes from looking for product placement.\n Like looking for mentions of polls done in political segments.\n Gallup, Rasmusen, NBC news, Wall Street Journal, etc...etc...etc.\n Did you know they're businesses too?\n And when people start believing these polls are as accurate as they portray themselves to be (they're really kinda useless...I used to work in polling in the distant past) then these companies credibility goes up and they are more in demand to do more polling.\n Humans are comforted by stats and numbers. \n You can be rest assured that that's about 97.3% correct too. +/- 2.2% for error.\n \n \n *sigh*\n And I have to go back to doing this sorta thing on Monday.\n Where I'll even look to see which kind of car was in that accident that killed 2 teens. Was it a FORD or a TOYOTA?\n If in Detroit, will the reporter mention it if it's a locally made vehicle? Will they focus on it if it's not?\n \n \n \n Bias.\n It's everywhere.\n Subtle and overt.\n \n And NOONE thinks for themselves.\n Well, maybe Tarzan did. But, his thinking was tainted by his environment too.\n \n I guess once you recognize this, you'll be more equipped to start thinking for yourself...or become so utterly paranoid that you'll have to be medicated and kept in a padded room somewhere.\n Or, a brutal, self-centered person bent on using such simple jedi mind tricks yourself for fun and profit.\n I call this applied psychology and for the most part, it's IS fun and profitable.\n \n \n I now return you to your regularly scheduled 'programming'...\n \n Live From New York, It's SATURDAY NIIIIGGGHHHTTT LIIIVVVVEEEE!!!",
