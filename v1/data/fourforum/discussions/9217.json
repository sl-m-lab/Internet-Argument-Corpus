To claim the marriage debate is only about the gay-marriage aspect is pretty short-sighted. Sometimes gay marriage proponents like to call it \"slippery slope\" when people point out the the obvious polygamy issue, but at some point reality just can't be avoided. There really IS a reason polygamy comes up a lot in the gay marriage debate: it's because it's a logical progression of the issue. I too am curious about what some of our gay marriage regulars here have to say about this article.\n \n I have to hand it to Matthew, at least he's being consistent here. he's one of the few gay marriage proponents that seems to recognize that if you are going to want marriage broadened in some way, you can't stop with just adding one more group--you have to go all the way with it if you claim to be for equality. Most gay marriage proponents I've addressed this with try to avoid coming out in support of polygamy marriage (or other forms), and so what they seek is not really true equality after all and therefore inconsistent.",

   "All right, let's talk about this.\n \n First off, are we talking about literal or practical polygamy? The difference is that as practiced it always seems to be 1 man, many women. Taken literally, it just means many married; 3 or more people all married to each other with no regards to gender. Some arguments might depend on which one you're talking about.\n \n On to the issue at hand. I can certainly see parallels between the causes. There is something to be said for personal freedom and personal responsibility. I see no reason that any person's life must conform to some narrow norm, as long as it works. If the relationship between all the adults is safe, sane, and consentual, and as long as all children are being raised well, then I am, in principle, happy. But we're not talking about just how people live together, we're talking about legal recognition. That's where things get tricky. Legally, there is no real difference between a two adults getting married, and a man and a woman getting married. You may need to change some pronouns here and there, but that's about it. The intent of the marriage laws is to simplify the building of a home and a family. The laws mostly assume a man and a women, but there's nothing in their that really requires it. (recent additions that say \"must be man and woman\" aside) Any two adults can run the household, one can make the decision if the other is incapacitated, one inherits when the other dies, etc etc. That parallel does not carry over to group marriages. When one dies, who inherits? If one is incapacitied, who decides what the treatment should be? Basically, pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two, so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task, and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious. And as I said before, the answers to these quesitons would probably chage radically if you assume true group marriage as opposed to Mormon style polygamy. \n \n So yes, I do see some parallels in the social freedom arguments between recognizing gay marriage and polygamy, but that's where it ends. If we're talking about legal recognition, and we are (right?), then the cases are wildly different. Our marriage laws, for better or worse, are set up on the assumption of two adults running a household. They also assume man and wife, true, but don't actually depend on that. But the dependence on there being two people is embedded in the laws; changing that is a huge project. So if polygamists want to say \"we should be able to live how we like\", I'm willing to listen to their arguments, and won't be surprised if some of them have been used on this forum. But if they're saying \"we should be able to have legal group marriage\", then I can't imagine that any argument they would put forth would have any parallel to arguments made here.",

   "The polygamy issue within the Church of Later Day Saints (Mormon) has long been defended as persecution of religious beliefs by fundamentalists, which it would be considering Smith's original declarations and those fundamentalists who follow them, but to no avail when facing federal anti-bigamy (polygamy) statues with states rights attached. \n \n Here's a chronological list of anti-polygamy legislation and an interesting series of SCOTUS interpretations on the legal status of illegitimate children of polygamous unions (generally defined as children from unions of husband and wife(s) beyond the first marriage): \n \n http://www.xmission.com/~plporter/lds/chron.htm\n \n http://www.xmission.com/~plporter/lds/illegit.htm\n \n I include them as gay marriages may eventually face some of those same issues. \n \n Relating gay marriage to Mormon polygamous marriage is obviously lacking the religious connection, but both, IMO, share identical discrimination in the form of societal condemnation based on tradition in the form of Christian sect beliefs used as a basis for legislation. The power of the people as often termed by those against gay and polygamous marriage when backed into a corner on morality discussions where their mythical belief system scripture is not accepted as a logical argument. \n \n Gay and polygamous marriage face an uphill battle for legislative acceptance by the general public until Christianity declines as the primary benchmark for US morality. That's not forecast to transpire until after 2030. Unless, of course, US economic/social problems and metropolitanization forces changes to provide egalitarian legislation on those issues.

Here's an example of how arguments that apply to one wouldn't apply to the other.\n\n \n In terms of legal rights, I don't see why it would be any different. Equality in marriage is equality in marriage regardless of the cultural motivation--religious, being in love with more than one person, or simply just for the hell of it. For that matter, the argument could be made that opposite-sex marriage between 2 people is largely a religious construct!",

   "An interesting article on the topic...\n \n http://kipesquire.powerblogs.com/posts/1110164220.shtml \nHerein lies the (not at all difficult) distinction between same-sex marriage and polygamy. Marriage by its nature qua legal status must, in a modern society, be limited to two people. A hypothetical polygamous \"marriage\" qua bundle of hypothetical contracts might be feasible in some hypothetical libertarian utopia. But that is not marriage as it exists, legally, in America today. The only way to validate \"polygamous marriage\" is to rewrite the fundamental definition, the fundamental nature, of marriage itself -- to blank out its nature as a legal status and replace it with some fictitious \"bundle of contracts\" doppelgaenger. But to do so reduces the whole debate down to mere question-begging. Which is not helpful.\n \n As I blogged previously:\n How would divorce be handled in polygamy? Could two \"spouses\" oust a third? What about property ownership -- could three out of seven spouses own property jointly apart from the others? Can a spouse in one polygamous marriage enter into another polygamous marriage without the consent of all the spouses of the original and the new marriages? What about inheritance? Tax returns? Child support? Powers of attorney? Right-to-die decisions?\n \n The legal implications of the [modern] status of marriage require, metaphysically, that it be between two and only two people. But those same legal implications do not require, metaphysically, that it be between a man and a woman.\n As for the hyper-anarcho-libertarians who try to short-circuit the entire gay marriage debate by moaning that \"government should get of the marriage business altogether,\" well, even if such a lament somehow helped the real-world quest for equal treatment of gays (I don't see how it does), it's also, quite frankly, an unacceptably naive and simplistic worldview.\n \n The great thing about marriage, qua legal status, is that it eliminates the need for the (extremely complicated) \"bundle of strictly private contracts\" that radical libertarians and defenders of theoretical polygamy (such as Sandefur) seem to think is such a \"neat-o!\" idea. Ask any gay couple who has actually tried to do it -- I guarantee you they'll say it's not so \"neat-o.\"\n \n Stated differently, marriage, qua legal status, is extremely efficient economically. It saves time. It saves resources (e.g., lawyers drafting documents). It saves money. It saves grief over lost, destroyed or badly-drafted contracts. In an (admittedly Rawlsian) sense, the shortcut of marriage, qua legal status, does the greatest good for the greatest number. It's simply a smart idea in a modern society.\n \n Tinker around the edges all you want. Should there be a \"marriage penalty\" within the federal income tax? I doubt it. Should there be a spousal benefit under Social Security? I seriously doubt it. But these are overlays that don't go to the core of marriage qua legal status. The real meaning of marriage in modern society -- automatic property rights, automatic inheritance rights, automatic child custody rights, automatic healthcare rights, automatic decision-making rights of all kinds, these all derive not from some abstract \"bundle of contracts\" concept of marriage, but from the legal status concept.\n \n And they require that marriage be limited to two people.\n \n If consensual polygamists want to try to build a bird's nest from the individual twigs and strings of contractual arrangements, then by all means they have a right to do so (assuming no externalities, especially to the children of such arrangements). But the assertion that to draw the line at two-person marriage is \"arbitrary\" is nonsense.\n",

   "Is that really the case? I don't think so. Look at the actual benefits given to married people. Are any of them actually about recognizing a relationship between a man and a woman? No, they're not. They're all about making it easier to build a home, a family, and a life together. That's the real intent of the marriage laws, and there's nothing about building a life together that requires the participants to be of differing genders.\n\n \n I believe it to be the case that marriage existed prior to any legal recognition of the relationship. If this is true, it seems reasonable to conclude that the state, for whatever reasons, wanted to encourage that particular relationship. Now, if it did so in order to foster an atmosphere where family life can best be nurtured and brought to maturity, that's well and good. But I still disagree with your conclusion that \"there's nothing about building a life together that requires the participants to be of differing genders.\" As a general proposition, I agree with this. Two individuals can certainly build a life together without any encouragement from the state. However, in a strict legal sense, there certainly are requirements one must fulfill in order to receive the benefits the state wishes to confer. In other words, legislatures have determined not only that they want to foster and encourage an atmosphere conducive for family life, they have determined that the best way to accomplish this is by encouraging the relationship to be between two individuals of the opposite sex.\n \n Now, I will probably say this more than once so that I ensure it has been taken into account: my primary purpose in starting this thread (and my other posts) is not WHETHER the definition of marriage should be changed, but if it is to be changed, WHO should change it.\n \n \nEven if we except that, laws can change. Whatever they meant back then, if we now recognize their defintion to be fundamentally unfair than we should change it.\n\n \n Again, I don't dispute this. However, I am concerned with WHO should make these changes. Courts? No. Legislatures? Yes. I would be interested to know your view on the following:\n \n Assuming marriage laws are to be changed (in whatever way), who should be making the decision about how they are to change. I.e., assuming the definition of marriage is to be revised, who ought to revise it?\n \n I think from reading some more of the posts in this thread that most folks are discussing WHETHER and HOW marriage laws are to be redefined, and I am discussing WHO should redefine them. That part was not clear from my initial post, so I bear some responsibility for people talking past one another.\n \n \n \nOf course. But the point I'm trying to make is that the work to be done, and the arguments to justify that work, are very different from those involved in the gay marriage debate. That was the point here, right?\n\n \n It depends. From a legislative stand point, I think so. But, from the standpoint of the judiciary, I'm not so certain. To be fair to some others in the thread, I think some are speaking of the latter, while others are speaking of the former. This only leads to confusion.\n \n For example, some argue on this forum that the Constitution requires equality, and thus same sex couples should be allowed to marry if opposite sex couples are. I think this reasoning would compel the same conclusion about polygamy (I think this is the sense in which jyoshu is drawing the analogy).\n \n In essence, legislatures don't have to follow their logic to the end. The judiciary, on the other hand, generally has to.\n \n \nWhich constitution? The federal one clearly leaves \"who can marry who\" to the states to decide, and each state will have their own spin. If a state constitution guarantees equal right for gays than that wouldn't really apply to poly marriage, for example.\n\n \n I'm mostly concerned about the federal constitution. However, it seems that state constitutions are important as well, because SCOTUS has considered a certain a change made by a number of states to a constitution or statute to trigger the \"evolving standards of decency\" test whereby it incorporates those individual state decisions into the federal constitution.\n \n \nLegislative as opposed to judicial, you mean? I see even less parallel between the judicial arguements to support gay marriage and poly. In fact, I've heard no judicial arguments put forth for poly marriage at all, only social ones.\n\n \n I tend to disagree here. See the equality example above.",

It says if you meet the qualifications, you can be married irregardless of your race, gender, religion, orientation etc.\n \n Again, I think the primary purpose of the state is to do more than help people who want to build a life together. It wants to encourage a particular relationship it deems to be the best, and that relationship is between two people of the opposite gender.\n \n As long as we're speaking of fairness, why should the state give benefits to people who want to build a life and a home together, but not give benefits to people who want to build a life and a home by themselves?\n \n \n \nTrue enough, but you seem to suggest that you don't agree with them necessarily.

I'm bad at thread titles, and I wasn't as clear as I should have been in the initial post.\n \n A point I have made in the past is that the same legal arguments folks are advancing in the courts to have same-sex marriage recognized could quite possibly also apply to people who would seek to have polygamous marriages recognized. To my knowledge no one has advanced this. But then again, I'm not sure that too many people several years ago would have imagined anyone seeking to have same-sex marriage recognized through the courts.\n \n In essence, I'm advancing a slippery slope idea.\n \n \nLaws are a product of the government, and it's the government that should change them. The impetus for the change can come from any branch as far as I'm concerned. The legislature can take it up on their own, the courts can say that the status quo violates the constitution (assuming it does of course), or the executive branch can request the change. To my mind any of these are fine.[\n \n As for exactly what the new law would say, the process we have in place should work fine. Legislature writes, executive signs, judicial makes sure it's constiutional.\n\n \n I'm fine with this statement because you added the \"assuming it does\" to the judicial role.\n \n However, referencing the article again, I am quite skeptical of an Attorney General who, regardless of what the law says, has intentionally determined not to prosecute people who violate a particular law.\n \n \nAs for me, I've seen no compelling argument that says that the federal constitution requires states to allow gay marriage, only that one state can't ignore a marriage performed in another state.\n\n \n I can only say that I believe you have reached the right conclusion on this one.\n \n As I said in another post, it will be interesting to see what happens with DOMA.\n \n \nSorry, I couldn't quite follow that. By my understanding the states have total control over who they give marriage licenses to, I don't see how decency standards come into play.\n\n \n This was an allusion to a particular argument advanced by the court in Lawrence v. Texas (and various other cases). The idea is that because only X amount of states (generally a small number, 13 in the case of Lawrence) criminalize Y, the prohibition of Y must have been deemed by society to be unacceptable. Because of this, we will incorporate Y into the Constitution as a new protected right. I don't think a judiciary should update the constitution to say something simply because an arbitrary number of states have revised their laws to say it.",

   "But we got some good discussion regardless.\n\n Yeah, I agree.\n \n \n\n I am all for revising laws. But if a law is to be revised, then it ought to be done legitimately in accordance with the appropriate processes. I.e., I think any revisions to marriage statutes ought to be left to the legislatures of the several states.\n \n\n Well, they have been, haven't they? The legislatures are the only ones who can revise the law, if I'm not mistaken. The courts may say that a revision is necessary, but that's not a bad thing, is it?\n \n And as an aside, if you think the legislatures should be doing it, does that mean that you think it shouldn't be done via ballot measures?\n \n \n\n I believe that the states are doing so fairly. The state says if you wish to obtain X(marriage benefits), you must do Y (get married). In order to do Y you must Z (all requirements for marriage). This is the same process for everyone. The law does not single out specific classes of people and say that they can't be married. It says if you meet the qualifications, you can be married irregardless of your race, gender, religion, orientation etc.\n\n Technically yes, but actually no. I assume you'll agree that one really ought to love the person you're marrying, right? And sexual attration is a big plus too? If you can only love men, and the law forbids you to marry a man, then the law is in fact excluding you. I will grant that you could enter into a loveless sham marriage with a woman instead, but no one would advocate that as a good path to take. The same rules apply to everyone, yes. But the rules themselves are unfair, they discriminate against gays, by forbidding them to marry the people they might actually want to marry.\n \n \n\n Again, I think the primary purpose of the state is to do more than help people who want to build a life together. It wants to encourage a particular relationship it deems to be the best, and that relationship is between two people of the opposite gender.\n\n Can you show me how you reached that conclusion? When marriage laws were first written the idea of including gays probably never even occurred to anyone. They didn't decide that straight was best, they just automatically wrote it that way. And also, do you agree with these legislators that opposite gender couples are best?\n \n \n\n As long as we're speaking of fairness, why should the state give benefits to people who want to build a life and a home together, but not give benefits to people who want to build a life and a home by themselves?\n\n Because the state has decided to encourage multi-people homes? Or becuase they recognize that two people joinging their lives is trickier than living seperately, and they want to ease the transition? Or becuase most people do pair up, and so this is an easy way to help alot of people at once?\n And really, most of the benefits only make sense with two people, there's no way to extend them to individuals. How could one person file a joint tax form, or have a default beneficiary when they die?\n \n \n\n I don't always agree with legislatures. But their decisions are binding so long as those decisions are constitutional and the law remains unchanged. We should not necessarily keep every law that has ever been passed, but so long as those laws don't violate the constitution, we should change them through legislative and not judicial means.\n \n\n Throughout this debate I've been getting the feeling that you think laws have been changed by judicial means. I further assume that you're thinking about MA. I've studied that case and I see nothing that happened there that didn't go exactly the way the system says it should. Someone sued over an unconstitutional practice, the courts agreed that it was in fact unconstitutional, the legislature was told to either allow gays to marry or come up with another constitutional solution, and the legislature allowed gays to get married. \n \n \n\n A point I have made in the past is that the same legal arguments folks are advancing in the courts to have same-sex marriage recognized could quite possibly also apply to people who would seek to have polygamous marriages recognized. To my knowledge no one has advanced this.

The IX amendment says: \"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\" In other words, just becuase a right isn't listed here doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

People don't need encouragement to get married, or at least to live in a state which resembles marriage in all but the legal sense. I mean, look at gays. They can't get married in most places, but they're still living together in commited relationships, raising children, planning for the future, etc. People want the stability of a family; they don't need government encouragement to seek it out. Whatever the government's motivation is, it must be something other than that. I think simple benevolence is the answer.

My position is that legislatures assume this activity by passing laws which the courts can then apply.\n\n The legislatures could make anything they wanted to a right also, why pick on the courts here? The point is the courts don't. They use a rational, tested process to come to their conclusions. The laws of our land are crafted by all three branches of government, they all have their say, they all have processes they follow, they all supply checks and balances. I've seen alot of people pointing to court decisions and citing them as evidence of courts running amok, but they never seem to be able to point to any specific bit of the process that the courts are supposed to have violated. I'm not saying that you're doing this, but you do seem to have been influenced by these arguments. I haven't seen the courts do anything wrong, nothing that they aren't quite specifically supposed to do. It seems to me that most people who are saying \"The courts should do that\" are more unhappy about the decisions then about the process used.

You pick on the courts because it is not their job. You say they use a \"rational, tested process\" but what is this process? No one seems to be able to figure it out. Furthermore, the standards by which they decide things change too often. Look at the Lemon Test as an example. This thing has been created, killed, changed, killed again, and used normally depending on what a justice wants to do. How about 14th amendment tests? We first had a strict test then we added a rational basis test and now we have an \"intermediate\" test that came out of left field. These tests are not examples of \"rational, tested processes\" either. They are examples of made up tests that are applied inconsistently. Furthermore, the laws of our land are not crafted by the three branches of government....atleast not all law. Statue law is developed by Congress. The judicial branch is to be the weakest branch \"as they have mere judgment\" (federalist papers). The people have the most power. This is the way it works. \n \n We can also get into the idea that the courts have changed what they are supposed to do. Prior to the early to mid 1900s the courts didn't have this idea of \"substantive due process\" and \"living constitution\". Of course it is the norm now but it developed out of no where and with no basis in US law. The thing is, these rulings that you find to be \"ok\" really have no backing in our law...they just make it sound good. Unless you apply a consistent standard for interpreting law, you will always get rulings that are at best moral judgments.",

Our system is set up to allow for, and correct, such mistakes.\n\n \n I think the judiciary can usurp it's proper authority. An example of a court that did as much is the US Supreme Court during the Lochner era. True, judges can and do make mistakes sometimes, and to the degree that it is only a mistake, they can be forgiven. But a court such as the Lochner court, (or, wait for it, the Warren court) cannot.\n \n \nWell, the original question was about fairness; I'm glad you see my point about how the laws might not be fair. As to whether they're legit, you'ld have to take that on a state by state basis.

If the state provides no such guarantees then it's probably legit for them not to give marriage licenses to gays, but not to say that marriages performed in other states are void. That, to my reading, would violate the US constitution.\n\n \n I agree with most of this. I'm a little unsure about the part about denying marriage status to gays who have obtained it from out of state simply because I don't know. Should be a little more clear if DOMA is ever challenged. I will say that there seems to me to be a much stronger argument in support of this than there is in the argument that the US Constitution protects same-sex marriage.\n \n \nI don't think so. People don't need encouragement to get married, or at least to live in a state which resembles marriage in all but the legal sense. I mean, look at gays. They can't get married in most places, but they're still living together in commited relationships, raising children, planning for the future, etc. People want the stability of a family; they don't need government encouragement to seek it out.

And if that's the motivation, then there's no reason not to extend those benefits to gays.\n\n \n That, I think, is the point. Individuals do not need government encouragement to get married. But, what the government seems to have done is to recognize that a particular relationship is of great value to the fabric of society, and thus they offered some benefits. That isn't to say that they cannot modify or change that to include same-sex couples. It is only to say (as I'm sure you already know) that a legislature can legitimately make these decisions (absent the usual caveat of unconstitutionality). My only point is that most Constitutions do not mandate that everything be fair for every person.\n \n \nCould you say what that basis is? Because I don't see it.\n\n \n This may give some ideas that would be more appropriate for the Goodridge thread (which I guess I will start sometime). But, here is a basic overview. Rational basis is a very low standard to satisfy. A statute undergoing rational basis review comes in with the heavy presumption of Constitutionality, and it is up to the plaintiffs to establish otherwise.\n \n Consistent with the above, I think a legislator could make a rational decision to continue to exclude same-sex couple from marriage (which would be the question before the legislature, i.e., \"should we change the status quo?\"). If the legislator is not convinced that same-sex relationships will prove to be as good at furthering the legislatures preferred ends, then he can vote against a change on a rational basis.\n \n The question, for a legislator, may boil down to whether the legislature should engage in a sort of \"social experiment.\" In the end, a legislator may simply not want to engage in that sort of endeavor.\n \n I'm not saying that this is correct or that it would convince his colleagues, but nevertheless, the legislator has made a rational choice.\n \n \nI'm not up on the equal protection clause. If it's legit to extend it to cover race, why not sexuality as well?\n\n \n Mainly because of the history of the Amendment. It quite clearly addressed squarely issues of race. Beyond that, it didn't really have much to say substantively.\n \n \nSure, go for it!\n\n \n Alright, I'll try to get to it sometime. I'm sure you're not holding your breath given the amount of time that it took me to get back to this thread after I assured you that I would.\n \n \nThe legislatures could make anything they wanted to a right also, why pick on the courts here? The point is the courts don't. They use a rational, tested process to come to their conclusions. The laws of our land are crafted by all three branches of government, they all have their say, they all have processes they follow, they all supply checks and balances.\n\n \n I hope you don't mind me breaking this paragraph up. Doing so makes it easier for me to respond.\n \n I'll agree that all three branches have established processes that they follow. The question that I am most concerned with is whether the judiciary is in fact following that process. I think it is clear that the judiciary does play a role in crafting law in today's society. However, I'm not convinced that they are doing this in accordance with their proper function.\n \n Miranda v. Arizona is an example that comes to mind. This established the well-known \"you have the right to remain silent...\" requirement. Now, this might be a good idea, but I do not think that the judiciary can appropriately make a new law. So, in short, it is the processes utilized by the judiciary that I am discussing.\n \n \nI've seen alot of people pointing to court decisions and citing them as evidence of courts running amok, but they never seem to be able to point to any specific bit of the process that the courts are supposed to have violated. I'm not saying that you're doing this, but you do seem to have been influenced by these arguments.\n\n \n I'll agree that there is a lot of rhetoric concerning the courts. However, I am not simply finding decisions that have a result that I don't like, and then citing those as examples of \"judicial activism\" (I hate this term). Perhaps this post will serve as an empirical example. I know you weren't saying that this is what I am doing, but I just wanted to say it. Now, perhaps I can give an example that would be helpful.\n \n An example of courts acting inappropriately, in my view, is the extension of the bill of rights to the states (aka, the \"doctrine of incorporation\"). This is the view that the specific provisions of the bill of rights applied against state governments as well as the federal government. Now, the result of this doctrine may be a good result, however, it is entirely inappropriate. This idea appeared out of thin air (if you like, I'll point to some cases).\n \n As for me, I have derived my view of the courts primarily from reading a lot of judicial decisions decided from the beginning of the republic until now. I'm aware of the discussions that take place among people, but they have had little influence on my view. For example, I think Justice Scalia's \"pragmatic exception\" to his originalist approach is problematic, and have expressed some criticism of it. I only mention that to try to say that I have independently come to the view that I now hold.\n \n \nI haven't seen the courts do anything wrong, nothing that they aren't quite specifically supposed to do. It seems to me that most people who are saying \"The courts should do that\" are more unhappy about the decisions then about the process used. I don't see that the courts are doing anything new or different; they're doing just what they've done all along. It's just that now some people don't like the conclusions.\n\n \n The Supreme Court, when viewed in it's historical context, has given itself authority it never had, and thus, cannot legitimately exercise. The doctrine of incorporation is but one example, but I think it is sufficient. I suppose that people have disagreed with the conclusions of the Court since the beginning of the republic. I don't think this is what has changed. What I think has changed is the way the public has come to view the role of the court from a passive to an active player in the policy arena.\n \n \nANAL,\n\n \n I'm not up to speed on my forum acronyms.\n \n \nbut from what I've read that does seem to be the way the 9th is interpreted. There's nothing there saying who gets to decide on what other rights people have, it seems that it's fair game for any branch of the government to have their say. The legislature could write a law, the courts could make a ruling, the executive branch probably has some mechanism as well. Checks and balances do their thing, and a new right is codified or not, as the case may be.\n\n \n I think traditionally rights are recognized by legislatures (or, \"the people\"). I'm no expert on the 9th Amendment though. It seems to me that that Amendment pretty much just made a statement, but did not give authority to the Supreme Court to enunciate those rights.",
