The doctor might as well have been commenting on the price of tea in China, as far as going against medical ethics is concerned.\n \n Besides, even though the 365Gay article title (and a biased commenter IN the article) deceptively protrayed the situation as a \"treatment\", it doesn't sound like that was the situation, after giving a fair reading of the article.\n \n But even if it were, I don't think the idea of people living against their homosexual urges or trying to change them is so universally widely rejected in the medical community as you claim. The more likely case is that there's not a lot of hard data and evidence on the matter, period, and as such, it's still a matter of opinion. It's not that it's rejected OR accepted--it's just not an issue the medical community has really done much with period. Sort of like the legitimacy of chiropractors.\n\n \n Do you honestly think ANYONE here is going to get on that merry-go-round again? How many times have the official positions of the AMA, APA, the other APA, and other medical/psychiatric/psychological been brought to your attention?\n \n [Psssst.

Many doctors aren't members of the AMA, and none of these groups preclude doctors from giving their opinions if they so choose. You are naively mistaken if you think these groups don't have political intentions at times. They've intruded into such political areas a gun control, abortion, capital punishment, etc. \n \n Doctors disagree with these groups sometimes. Just because they give a position hardly means it's right or wrong. These organzations don't make the rules, nor are they some official law for ethics. (Although they certainly try to strongarm doctors into falling in line by threatening revocation of membership.)\n \n You'd love to always portray the idea of gay people trying to live against their urges in the worst possible light, and you always do (e.g. your leeches analogy). But it's not that simple. \"Reparative therapy\" is so broad and vague a concept it doesn't always even mean anyting physiological or psychological.

Because your movement certainly doesn't differentiate between the two--ANY attempt to intentionally live like an \"ex-gay\" is typically criticized as \"reparative therapy\" by your movement. So don't suddenly start drawing a distinction now--at least be consistent.\n\n \n Once again, back to square one. \"Reparative therapy\" is a term YOUR side made up to describe various programs from psychological counseling to psychiatric manipulation with drugs and physical therapies to religious counseling, etc. If you don't like the term, see them about it. Had the choice of moniker been up to gay people, the term would be \"charlatanism\" or something...\n \n That aside, I don't understand your point. This thread is about a doctor's office handing out info to ALL patients they perceive or know to be gay. He's not making any distinction. What distinction do you think I should make?\n \n \nIf only ONE has tried it and it works for them, that's good enough for them. It's not like you and your movement ever criticize reparative therapy \"only for those for whom it doesn't work\"; you know good and well you'd rather the philosophy not be out there for ANYONE.\n\n \n I criticize reparative therapy (you used the term again so I will, too) as a \"solution\" to being gay. It certainly isn't that. It might be a way for a very, very small number of people to deal with the conflict between their sexuality (homo or hetero) and a deep, deep guilt associated with sexual feelings. Personally, I'd rather folks like that get treatment for their obsessive or extreme religious views, but I would leave that choice to them and to the psychological professional working with them. A lot of people do seek legitimate counseling. In almost all cases, the choice is to work on adapting to life as a gay person, not to squelch the gay stuff.\n \n As for reparative therapy \"working\", I think there's plenty of evidence that it doesn't work in almost any case, certainly not in the way it's advertised (and it IS advertised by all sorts of anti-gay organizations -- another group you should take up your argument with).\n \n I now know you think I, like all other gay people you know, am a near basketcase so I might just be making this up, but I've known two gay men who sought out \"reparative therapy\" (there I go, using your side's term again). One did so for religious reasons -- he really was burdened with incredible guilt. The other wasn't trying to stop being gay, he just wanted to get married (white picket fence, etc.) and thought the only way to get that was marrying a woman. \n \n The former is now a pastor at a gay church. He's still in therapy about the guilt, but he's stopped trying to be someone he isn't and he hasn't tried to kill himself in years. The latter married a woman (who was fully aware of what she was getting into). They divorced amicably after two years. Having given up on marrying a woman and seeing no hope of finding a good man, he promptly crossed paths with one and has been \"domesticated\" for going on 12 years now.\n \n Those two resolutions strike me as \"successes\" in that the people are happier now, fully conscious of their choices, maturely and honestly making life decisions in light of their needs and wants. Of course, they're failures from the \"reparative therapy\" POV. \n \n \nThat's what I hear, but then I find many of those \"studies\" don't draw the proper distinctions about what's really going on in the reparative therapy, and they assume the conclusions of their studies apply to ALL forms of the philosophy rather than the clinical-psychological forms of reparative therapy. And the studies tend to be conducted by gay rights-affiliated groups.\n\n \n I'm sure you can point us to \"good\" studies. Feel free...",

   "There is no double standard. Plenty of gays in places like San Francisco display their affection publicly without jeers from public. If you do that in a predominantly hetero community though then you should be willing to endure their opinion on it. \n\n \n No double standard because there are a few square miles in the entire country where two men can hold hands in public while a man and woman can hold hands anywhere without comment (even in those few gay square miles)? What WOULD constitute a double standard????\n \n By the way, even in SF, there are very few PDAs outside the gay neighborhoods. I go weeks at a time without seeing men holding hands or women with their arms around eachother's shoulders. I do see straight couples dry-humping in the park at least a couple times a week. And I live in a neighborhood that's about 20-30% gay.\n \n \nThere is no reason that anyone in the U.S. should have to supress their opinion because someone else might not agree with it.\n\n \n Civility? Politeness? Minding-your-own-business-ness?",

   "One of the reasons a certain poster is instantly identifiable, no matter which forum he infests or handle he assumes, is because he's absolutely unique in persisting to claim--in the face of repeated and absolutely indisputable rebuttals--that (among other bizarre assertions):\n a) Republicans are more pro-gay than Democrats\n \n b) That he himself is pro-gay (possibly the most hilarious of his claims)\n \n c) That \"gay activists\" invented the term \"reparative therapy.\"I have no interest in re-visiting the first two of these surreal assertions. (Though I'm sure he'll come around to them again. He seems to assume everyone forgets the last time he was roundly rebutted on them, and routinely brings them up again after waiting a \"decent interval.\" Wash, rinse, repeat.)\n \n In unarguable disproof of the third, however: \n\n Book: Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality, by Joseph Nicolosi, PhD (Nicolosi, by the ways, is one of the foundersof NARTH. Heard of NARTH? Know what they do there--or claim to do?)\n http://www.narth.com/docs/repair.html\n \n Book: Healing Homosexuality -- Case Stories of Reparative Therapy\n http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/narth/cases.html\n \n Article on Leadership U website: Journal Articles Support the Reparative-Therapy Treatment Optionhttp://www.leaderu.com/orgs/narth/journalarticle.html\n If he is seriously implying that NARTH and Leadership University are pro-gay, someone's relatives should seek intervention.\n \n It is worth noting, by the way, that none of the above, nor any other anti-gay website that uses the term, puts the term in quotes--indicating irony--which the vast majority of pro-gay cites that refer to it, do. (As BobNelson2 points out, why on earth would pro-gay people coin a term that specifically describes what they staunchly maintain it doesn't do--\"repair\"??) Nor, in any of the above, do the authors, say \"Well, I'm using the term because gay activists foisted on me\" or offer a similar disclaimer.\n \n It's their term. They invented it. Case closed.\n \n The poster's repeated insistence of the contrary, so easily and often disproven, on here and other fora, over a period of years--(along with the fact that he's mysteriously so bugged by it that he feels it necessary to do it again and again) is clearly indicative, IMO, of the level of dementia of which so many rabid anti-gay activists are possessed.",

   "Once again, back to square one. \"Reparative therapy\" is a term YOUR side made up\n\n \n I never said either side came up with the term, nor does it really matter to me. No matter who came up with it, your movement still does a #### poor job of being specific about what you're talking about nearly every time the term is used.\n \n \nThat aside, I don't understand your point. This thread is about a doctor's office handing out info to ALL patients they perceive or know to be gay.\n\n \n So, you don't think the issue of reparative therapy is pertinent to this discussion?\n \n \nI criticize reparative therapy (you used the term again so I will, too) as a \"solution\" to being gay.\n\n \n That's fine, you are free to criticize it all you want.
