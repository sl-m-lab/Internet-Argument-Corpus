   "This article makes a strong case for removing Arafat. After all, Arafat could be easily located, and he is a terrorist leader.\n \n http://www.politicallyright.com/article151.htm \n The Author is: Ariel Natan Pasko\n \n \"They got Saddam! They got Saddam!\" Passengers on buses and trucks shouted, as others fired into the air and radio stations played upbeat, celebratory music. People were dancing and distributing chocolates. These scenes occurred all over Iraq on the day that Saddam was finally captured.\n \n Contrast this with the responses from \"Palestine.\" According to Israel Radio, a senior Palestinian cabinet minister said that, due to his financial support for suicide bombers and Yasser Arafat's support of Saddam during the 1991 Gulf War, the Palestinian Authority would not issue a formal response to Saddam's capture.\n \n Mohammed Horani, a legislator from PA Chairman Yasser Arafat's ruling Fatah movement, said he expected many Palestinians and Arabs to have mixed feelings. \"Saddam is a dictator and the Iraqi people suffered under him, but on the other hand, it was the [American] occupation that caught him,\" he said. \"There will be a sense of confusion in the public.\"\n \n Confusion among the Palestinian public?\n \n Well sure. This is a population that, when polled, regularly supports suicide bombings by a two-to-one margin. This is a population that, over the past three years of Palestinian terror against Israel, has received millions of dollars that Saddam sent to Judea and Samaria - the West Bank - and Gaza, including US$25,000 for the family of each suicide bomber and US$10,000 for each Palestinian killed in fighting with Israelis. Palestinians have a lot to be confused about.\n \n According to an authoritative May 2003 Pew Global Attitudes Project opinion poll, 80% of Palestinians agreed with the statement: \"The rights and needs of the Palestinian people cannot be taken care of as long as the State of Israel exists.\" Numerous other polls consistently back up these findings. The Palestinians clearly want to destroy the Jewish state; that is something about which there should be no confusion.\n \n The majority of Palestinians are not morally \"confused,\" they are morally depraved. Which brings us to another dictator and leader of a terror regime- Yasser Arafat.\n \n Arafat should be put on trial for crimes against humanity, i.e. Israelis, Lebanese, Americans, Palestinians, and others. Everyone knows that his terror has been inflicted upon Jews and Israelis worldwide. But do people remember that Arafat some twenty years ago admitted his involvement in the 1974 murder of two American diplomats in Sudan? Do people remember the PLO murder spree throughout the 1970s and 1980s in Lebanon?\n \n And yes, Arafat is also responsible for the deaths of Palestinians. Arafat, like Saddam, has diverted hundreds of millions - if not billions - of dollars of western donor money that was supposed to help out impoverished Palestinians, but instead found its way to Arafat's private bank accounts. To generate international sympathy for Palestinians, and to make himself rich, Arafat deliberately impoverished his own people. Moreover, under Arafat's terror regime, quick military night courts found \"collaborators\"- those accused of helping Israel- guilty and executed them without fair trial or the right to appeal. Arafat signed every order of execution.\n \n Arafat should be charged with these crimes.\n \n When charges are brought against him, he does not need to be removed from his Mukatah compound. Instead, Israel should surround the compound for the duration of the trial, and make it off-limits to all visitors, including the media. Finally, Arafat's telephone and other communications links to the outside world should be cut-off. Mukatah will become Arafat's prison. Many Israeli journalists and politicians who have raised the issue of a trial have proffered the excuse, \"But it would be too difficult to take him out.\"\n \n Just leave him in the compound. Problem solved.\n \n With Arafat sequestered in his compound, he can be tried for his crimes in absentia. This is common practice around the world in cases where it is deemed too dangerous to move a prisoner from his cell to a court. When found guilty, if the Israeli army determines that it is too problematical to bring Arafat to Jerusalem for execution, there is an easy solution. Rather than hang Arafat, as was done in 1961 to the Nazi war criminal Adolph Eichmann, the Israeli Air Force, after sanitizing the area, can bomb Arafat's compound with him inside. There should be no excuses made against carrying out this necessary justice.\n \n Saddam has been captured; it is now time to lower the crosshairs on Arafat.",

   "Epaphras_faith,\n \n As I recall the debate was the removal of Arafat by Israel. Do you not want the removal of Arafat period?\n\n \n Ya know, I am a little waffling on this. Part of me realises that Arafat supports palestinian terrorism, however, Arafat is such a poor leader he is easily manipulated. His people don't see it as he has led them from total nothingness (a ragged band) to the borders of nationhood. He has gotten them where they are and they love him. But, I believe he could be used. I think that might be playing with fire. \n \n As I said though, during the debate, Arafat has undoubtedly been grooming his successor which the people will accept as he will have Arafat's legitimacy. My fear is that the new leader would be a much better leader and much harder to control.\n \n I think the israeli people need more protections. I think the fence is a good idea. I think a short period of a year or so of completely closed borders with the palestinian people would help. Yes it would harm them and many would lose jobs etc, but it would provide excellent security. \n \n The removal of Arafat, by anyone would not move things along. Likely it will reverse the gains that have been made. It is possible that Arafat could die of natural causes and in the meantime, our money would be better spent in fomenting discontent amongst the palestinian leadership. This has already happened with the naming of other leaders. We are just in the first stages now. If discontent can be sown then when Arafat dies in a few years there will be struggle for power which will make the palestinian authority weak and controllable.",

   "Epaphras_faith,\n \n I'm very glad your attempting to rethink the topic.

Abbas was one of the potential succesors in 1994. There is very little in the current media on the topic. Even with the scares concerning his health.\n \n Hammas does claim Arafat as authority, but a large enough organization would require that he delegate much authority. I will continue my research and let you know what I find.",
