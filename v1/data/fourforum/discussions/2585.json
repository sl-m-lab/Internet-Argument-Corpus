   "Pat Buchanan: Let me start off with foreign policy-Iraq and the Middle East. You have seen the polls indicating widespread contempt for the United States abroad. Why do they hate us?\n \n Ralph Nader: First of all, we have been supporting despots, dictators, and oligarchs in all those states for a variety of purposes. We supported Saddam Hussein. He was our anti-Communist dictator until 1990... The other thing is that we are supporting the Israeli military regime with billions of dollars and ignoring both the Israeli peace movement, which is very substantial, and the Palestinian peace movement.\n \n \n PB: Why do we support the Sharon/Likud policies in the Middle East rather than the peace movement candidates and leaders in Israel?\n \n RN:The answer to your question is that instead of focusing on how to bring a peaceful settlement, both parties concede their independent judgment to the pro-Israeli lobbies in this country because they perceive them as determining the margin in some state elections and as sources of funding. They don't appear to agree with Tom Friedman, who wrote that memorable phrase, \"Ariel Sharon has Arafat under house arrest in Ramallah and Bush under house arrest in the Oval Office.\"\n \n \n PB: Let's move to immigration. We stop 1.5 million illegal aliens on our borders each year. One million still get through. There are currently 8-14 million illegal aliens in the United States. The president is mandated under the Constitution to defend the States against foreign invasion, and this certainly seems to constitute that.\n \n RN: As long as our foreign policy supports dictators and oligarchs, you are going to have desperate people moving north over the border.\n \n Part of the problem involves NAFTA. The flood of cheap corn into Mexico has dispossessed over a million Mexican farmers, and, with their families, they either go to the slums or, in their desperation, head north. \n \n \n PB: The U.S. population now-primarily due to immigrants and their children coming in-is estimated to grow to over 400 million by mid-century. Would that have an adverse impact on the environment?\n \n RN: We don't have the absorptive capacity for that many people. Over 32 million came in, in the '90s, which is the highest in American history.\n \n \n PB: What would you do about it?\n \n RN: We have to control our immigration. We have to limit the number of people who come into this country illegally. \n \n \n Full interview:\n \n http://www.amconmag.com/2004_06_21/cover.html",
