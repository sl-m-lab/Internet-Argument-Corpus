I'm not sure that there is a real benefit to legalizing it other than it will ease the work load on our police force and jails although this isn't even necessarily going to be the case.\n\n \n Allow me my friend. \n \n 1. Economic: The government could sell it, or if not sell it, at least tax it. In my home state (PA), the government controls the distribution of liquor. Believe me, I was shocked when I moved to FL and found that I could buy it at the grocery store and gas stations. This seemed strange to me. PA has \"state stores\" which are controlled by the PLCB (PA liquor control board.) But they sell it and make the money off of it. So if you either sell it or tax it, it can be very profitable. \n \n 2. Medical: Marijuana has many medicinal benefits. It aleviates nausea, helps control pain, stimulates appetite, and can help relieve ocular pressure caused by glaucoma. Sure we have drugs to do this, but some have bad side effects, some are very expensive, and some even can incapacitate the patient using them. Marijuana has side effects as well, all drugs do. But the side effects of marijuana are mild when used in limited doses. Marijuana is of special benefit to cancer and AIDS patients, for relieving nausea, increasing appetite, and control of pain. If you have read all the posts, you have probably noticed that I have talked about a drug called Marinol...It is pot in pill form. For people that argue against the benefits of medical marijuana, talk to any oncology nurse and ask them what the best drug they have for chemotherapy related nausea is. Marinol would be a great alternative to regular marijuana, but many elderly people with fixed incomes and many without insurance cannot afford to buy expensive prescription drugs. Marijuana could provide relief for this. \n \n 3. Prisons. You mentioned them, so here ya go. Our prisons are vastly overcrowded. Many prisoners are in jail simply for simple marijuana possession. Different states have different policies...I suggest looking at the NORMAL website for these laws, I was facinated to learn how diverse they could be. Some states have no penalty other than a civil offense...(basically a parking ticket). Some states have tough felony laws for simple possession. On average, above an once is usually the cutoff from misdemeanor to felony. This changes with subsequent offense. But an once is a legitimate supply for someone who wants to smoke it responsibly in their own home. It is like buying a carton of cigarettes instead of a pack at a time. You have it on hand, and it is cheaper. But back to prisons...hmmm. Locking up people for possesion of marijuana is pointless. Many of the people I know use it responsibly at home. These people are not hurting anyone, nor are they going out driving around while high. We could vastly ease the burden on taxpayers who are keeping all of these people in jail, and put the money to better uses. Prisons should be for dangerous people that need to be removed from society. If the government wants to keep it illegal, then they should stop locking responsible pot smokers up, and make them pay a simple fine. This again eases overcrowding and could help ease taxes on everyone. And just to throw the police in here... If you live in a rural area, it is rare the cops have anything better to do than to run around looking for little johnny and his 2 grams of pot. But if you live in a city like I do, you realize there is much more to be done. Cities are full of crime, more than the cops can handle. There are many things that they could be focussing on, like keeping my car from getting broken into every month! You will notice in many cities in America, and I have been to a lot of them, the cops will ignore someone on the corner smoking a joint. This is not because they support marijuana, it is usually because they are too busy, or they realize that the reward of getting 1 joint off the street is not worth all the paperwork they will have to do, and all the criminals they will be ignoring to do it. I usually didn't make a habit of smoking in public back when I was smoking (current job prevents it), but on one occasion, I was with a friend in downtown NYC. We just came out of a club, and he asked if I wanted a smoke. Why not? About halfway through the joint, a cop walked up to us. I thought I was going to die! He asked us if we would walk around the corner into the ally so we were not doing it right in front of the club, or put it out till later. I never laughed so hard in my life. Sorry, had to share. \n \n Anyway, I think there are many benefits to marijuana, many more than I have posted here. Explore all the sides.",

   "Instead of rewriting what I have already written numerous times, I will post a copy of a recent post I made on another thread regarding this same topic. You can find the original post here.\n -----------------------------------\n \nI enjoy the experience of getting drunk, high, or anything else like that.\n\n This explains many of your posts. :lol: Ah, I'm just messin' with ya, man.\n\n Hey, I've never influenced while under the post of drugs! ;) (Italics for those who might not get it.)\n \n \nThere is the arguement that drug money supports terrorism, I'll leave that there...\n\n \n \"We know, for instance, that bin Laden and Al Qaida used tens of millions of dollars in profits from the diamond industry to fund their operations. So how come we didn't see a commercial with a woman, say, a senator's wife, fingering the diamonds on her sparkling tennis bracelet and admitting: 'I helped kids learn how to kill?' And, given the fact that 15 out of the 19 hijackers, and most of the detainees in Cuba, came from Saudi Arabia -- where the ruling family, glutted with oil profits, has coddled extremists for decades -- why no taxpayer-funded ad showing a soccer mom filling up her SUV and saying: 'I helped blow up buildings?'\"{1}\n \n \ni've already added my input to this thread, but i just want to say that smoking marujuana does impare your judgement, it does make you do stupid stuff, but that is half the fun!!!!\n\n I have not yet to done anything while high that I wouldn't do while sober. Nor have I witnessed (or heard of) any of my friends doing anything stupid while they enjoyed the intoxication of marijuana.\n \n As for motivation, I have never had a problem with motivation, regardless of the drug. If I wanted or needed to get some work done while suffering intoxication, I still got the work done. I know plenty of people who actually smoke a joint or two before undergoing a major project, and they have no problem with the motivation for it.\n \n \"When heavy marijuana use accompanies these symptoms [lack of motivation], the drug is often cited as the cause, but no convincing data demonstrate a causal relationship between marijuana smoking and these behavioral characteristics.\" (Pp. 107, 108) {5}\n \n \nWeed so needs to be legalized because it would make tons in tax revenue.\nThey can't legalise it now. Because it would be taxed and possibly more expecnsive due to that, and there's already such an infrastructure for obtaining it illegally, people would still take that route, and there'd be no benefit to the government.\n\n The government would benefit from legalization. Decriminilization saves a large amount in enforcement costs. California alone would save $100 million per year.{2}\n \n \"In 1998, the federal governmeent spent $16 billion on the 'drug war.' Approximately 53% ($8.4 billion) was spent on enforcement, court, and prison expenses. (The rest was used for treatment and education.) In 1991--the most recent year for which data are available--state and local governments spent a total of nearly $16 billion, of which about %80 ($12.5 billion) was used for enforcement, court, and prison costs (National Drug Control Strategy, Office of National Drug Control Policy, Washington D.C., 1994).\"{3} Costing more than $9 billion annually for taxpayers.\n \n \nThis to the people with the \"limitation\" arguement: to know your limitations, you have to pass them at least once.\n\n For the first time (I think), I agree with you, Tab.\n \n Even if a person does know their limitations, and feels they still have the capabilities to drive or operate machinery, I think of such a thing as a mistake. Several times I have felt perfectly fine after a few shots of alcohol, then, after walking thirty feet, I suddenly lose hold for a split second and collapse. Granted, I gain control once again when I concentrate back onto it, but all one merely needs to lose concentration for a split second and they could lose complete control of any sort of vehicle.\n \n Personally, I would hate the idea of getting arrested for killing a complete stranger while driving under the influence. What a waste. I would probably have killed a person I did not know, had no objections with, and I would not have even done it purposefully. If I have to spend a great part of my life in jail for murder, I would at least like to do it intentionally, and to someone I know and hate. (Please, do not misunderstand me. I do not plan to go out and kill anyone.)\n \n \nWeed would be the less harsh of all of the illegal drugs, but, still, it is called the \"gateway\" drug. Sure, not everyone who smokes pot does other things, but usually most of the people who do other things get started smoking pot. \n\n \"It does not appear to be a gateway drug to the extent that it is the cause or even that it is the most significant predictor of serious drug abuse; that is, care must be taken not to attribute cause to association.\" (p. 101){5}\n \n \"There is no evidence that marijuana serves as a stepping stone on the basis of its particular physiological effect.\" (p. 99){5}\n \n To add to that: I believe, from my studies, that marijuana becomes a \"gateway drug\" to those with addictive personalities. While marijuana holds no addictive traits on its own, some people develop a mental addiction. After the constant use of marijuana the drug begins to lose its effect, and the person suffering from a mental addiction needs something stronger. They feel they need to experience getting \"high,\" so they move on to stronger and harder drugs. The fault does not belong to marijuana, rather, it belongs to that particular trait in the person.\n \n Either way, \"Compared to most other drugs ... dependence among marijuana users is relatively rare.\" (p. 94){5}\n \n Goturuge\n \n Works Consulted:\n {1} Terrorist Soccer Moms by, Arianna Huffington.\n \n {2} \"Savings in California Marijuana Law EnforcementCosts Attributable to the Moscone Act of 1976--A Summary,\" Michael Aldrich, Ph.D., and Tod Mikuriya, M.D.; Journal of Psychoactive Drugs, Vol. 20(1), January-March 1988; Pp. 75-81.\n \n {3} Marijuana Prohibition Facts on MPP.Org.\n \n {4} Common Questions About Marijuana (answered by the Institute of Medicine)\n \n {5} Nat'l Academies Press, Marijuana dn Medicine: (1999), Table of Contents",

   "Well, I thought you might say that. And you are right the analogy only goes so far. However, using marijuana can affect others. Here is some stuff I posted on another thread. It is aimed mostly at adolescents. One of the links points to the emotional problems people have. This will effect others. it will also like make these folks indigent and therefore supported by my taxes and therefore government (me) does have a right to say.\n\n \n So you would sell your rights for a bowl of porridge. What has happened to the belief that government should be limited, limited, limited. Is that basic principal just something that has been abandoned by Americans? Two hundred years ago if a politician had run on passing laws that prevented prostitution, prevented gambling, prevented drugs, or prevented any personal freedoms, not only would he not have been elected, he would have been strung up by his heels. Yet today we have given up all of those freedoms. Now we want the government to protect us from every minor inconvenience and the principle be damned.\n \n But lets look at what you have asserted. You state that it cost you money because some people use drugs. But are very expensive because the government uses a lot of your tax money to drive up the cost trying to make them rare. It hasn&#8217;t worked but the government has unlimited funds so they keep spending more and more money on it. Not counting the fact that there is so much money in the trade that the police, politicians, and judges are corrupted every day and sometimes innocent people are sent to prison by the police covering their mistakes or with grudges against people. And the fact that we are spending billions of dollars on prisons to house people committing minor drug offences because of mandatory sentencing that make the politicians look good. And you think that the minor amount of money spent on helping the indigent as a result of drug use compares to the wasted taxes spent on our non-working drug policy? How about making drugs legitimate and then taxing them so that money can be used for treatment instead of wasting my tax dollars on trying to stop an addiction that cannot be stopped. What makes you think the government can stop a woman from using drugs by threatening her with prison when she is so addicted that she will sell her daughter for money to buy drugs.\n \n I could also just make the assertion that people who use drugs die young and therefore are not a burden on your taxes. I can&#8217;t prove that but it&#8217;s just as valid as the assertion that you made without backing it up with anything.\n \n [quote]As for Marijuana's effects allow me to post a bit.

   "Hank: I appreciate the kind thoughts. I am not always as kind. However, I think my aregument is that the government has a responsibility to the welfare of its citizens. This is in the preambel to the consittution. \n\n \n The preamble states the \"general welfare\". And the constitution is basically a contract with the American people that limits the powers of the government. I think we are treading on dangerous ground when we let the government tell individuals how to live their lives in order to make the US a better place to live according to the government. If you are talking about protecting individuals from the actions of others, then I think that is a legitimate roll of the government. But trying to tell individuals how to live their lives in order to protect individuals from themselves is a totally different matter. Then we are back to the no eating some kinds of food, no smoking, no drinking, no gambling, and the list goes on and on.\n \n \nYou and I both know that if congress passed and the president signed a bill legalizing harmful drugs that there would be a lawsuit from hell filed by at least one individual (and actually likely a class action suit) that says that the government knew it was harmful and legalized it anyway and that the government has a responsibility to prevent such things. \n\n \n I know no such thing. The government can not be sued without the consent of the government. That's why they don't take out E&O insurance. :) You are basically saying that the government would give us a freedom, then take on the responsibility for us abusing that freedom. If that were the case, the government could be sued for every harmful act we commit every day of our lives.\n \n I broke my arm when I fell while running down a hill.\n Well it's a free country. \n Yeah but the government should have known it was dangerous to run down hills.\n \n \nThis would likely hold up as personal responsibility has gone by the wayside in this country.

We tried it once with prohibition and that was a dismal failure. Now we are trying it with drugs and it is a dismal failure. You want to extend it to nicotine and maybe return to prohibition also. I won't speculate on where you would stand on junk food or staying out in the sun too long, or watching too much TV, or any of the other activities we practice that can harm us. All I will say is that I'm thankful you were not one of the founding fathers.\n \n I'm not sure this discussing is progressing in the way of espousing any new ideas. I think we have pretty much covered both sides and neither of our beliefs are being affected. I may or may not respond if you do but it has been interesting. If not, you keep up the good work fighting to restrict individual freedoms and I'll keep up the good work fighting to expand individual freedoms. LOL\n\n \n Hank: I must say this has been one of the more pleasant debates I have had. I did catch your irony on suicide. Forced treatment is actually fairly common by the way. At least for me. I work in the mental health field. I know how many are ocurt ordered for treatment. I would say at least 10% of the mental health population in my state. \n \n You are quite right there are no new arguments being posited at this point. FYI, I am all for people having feedoms. I am not trying to restrict anyones freedom. I simply like the status quo. I am not going anywhere. You are trying to expand freedoms though. \n \n Even though I think nicotine should be done away with, I am not so certain I would vote for a law to do that or a representative that would vote for a law to do that.\n \n I do have a strong belief in personal freedoms and little government intervention. I was simply arguing a point that I did not think you represented logically at the time. You have made it much more clear.",

   "Nicotine, yes, I think it is the most addictive drug on the planet and I do think it should be done away with. (a seemingly extreme position I know), Alcohol: not sure on this one. Caffien, definitely not as it does not have the harmful effects and the withdrawl symptoms are a headache and no more.\n \n \n Epaphras... emoticon_confused is your alarm on? Nicotine, alcohol, caffiene...they are all addictive substances. They all have harmful effects. And also, to point out, it is not the nicotine that kills people, is the is the carbon monoxide, ethers, formaldyhydes (spelling?), tar, and dioxides that make cigarettes dangerous. Nicotine is a relatively mild drug, mainly working through stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the CNS, neuromuscular junction, autonomic ganglia, and adrenal medulla. Yep, that's right, it is a CNS stimulant which aids in concentration, cognitive ability, and elevates mood. While it can have some minor harmful effects, there are many prescription drugs taken legitimately every day which have worse effects. Alcohol is by far the most dangerous and detrimental of all of these drugs. It is a CNS depressant with toxic effects to cellular function, especially in pancreatic and hepatic cells. I guess we would all be better off if Budweiser contained nicotine rather than alcohol. emoticon_wow And as far as caffiene goes, it inhibits phosphodiesterase, which is an enzyme that degrades cAMP (cyclic adenosine mono-phosphate). It can cause insomnia, restlessness, nervousness, headache, excitement, agitation, muscle tremor, twitching, tachycardia, palpitations, extrasystoles (extra heart beats due to increased erratic electrical function in the hearts conductive system), tinnitus (ear ringing), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, diuresis (increased fluid output from kidneys). Yes, caffiene does have harmful effects, many people however do not think of their morning cup of coffee as a drug but it is. Perhaps if nicotine was delivered in another form other than smoked, it would be more socially acceptable. It would also then be less detrimental than even coffee. Didn't mean to go on a rant, but I just had to throw that in. BTW, great debate between you and Hank. You both make good arguments.",

Do you know that addiction is different from dependence? Physical withdrawl symptoms are not a sign of addiction. They are sign of dependence. If you state that you had or do have a mental dependence, this is part of addictive behavior, but not true addiction. You need to truely understand these terms prior to making statements such as yours. And going 1 week without bud proves nothing really. Marijuana has few physical symptoms after stoppage of use, however some do experience sleep disturbance, lethargy, and headache especially after long term heavy use. These are withdrawl symptoms found with bud. \n \n \nThis, epaphras, is where you made your mistake. Marijuana was a personal freedom, and is no more harmful than caffeine.

I agree when it is administered orally, there is almost no harmful effect. When administered in it's most common route (smoked), it is harmful, and much more so than caffiene.

   "There is nothing wrong with smoking weed!!! emoticon_xgood Q. Is Marijuana Addictive?\n A. No, it is not [8]. Most users are moderate consumers who smoke it socially to relax. We now know that 10% of our population have \"addictive personalities\" and they are neither more nor less likely to overindulge in cannabis than in anything else. On a relative scale, marijuana is less habit forming than either sugar or chocolate but more so than anchovies. Sociologists report a general pattern of marijuana use that peaks in the early adult years, followed by a period of levelling off and then a gradual reduction in use [9]. \n \n Q. Has Anyone Ever Died From Smoking Marijuana?\n A. No; not one single case, not ever. THC is one of the few chemicals for which there is no known toxic amount [10]. The federal agency NIDA says that autopsies reveal that 75 people per year are high on marijuana when they die: this does not mean that marijuana caused or was even a factor in their deaths. The chart below compares the number of deaths attributable to selected substances in a typical year:\n \n Tobacco 340,000 - 395,000 \n Alcohol (excluding crime/accidents) < 125,000 \n Drug Overdose (prescription) 24,000 - 27,000 \n Drug Overdose (illegal) 3,800 - 5,200 \n Marijuana 0\n \n Q. Does Marijuana Lead to Crime and/or Hard Drugs?\n A. No [11]. The only crime most marijuana users commit is that they use marijuana. And, while many people who abuse dangerous drugs also smoke marijuana, the old \"stepping stone\" theory is now discredited, since virtually all of them started out \"using\" legal drugs like sugar, coffee, cigarettes, alcohol, etc.\n \n Q. How Does Marijuana Affect Your Health?\n A. Smoking anything is not healthy, but marijuana is less dangerous than tobacco and people smoke less of it at a time. This health risk can be avoided by eating the plant instead of smoking it [13], or can be reduced by smoking smaller amounts of stronger marijuana. There is no proof that marijuana causes serious health or sexual problems [14] but, like alcohol, its use by children or adolescents is discouraged. Cannabis is a medicinal herb that has hundreds of proven, valuable theraputic uses - from stress reduction to glaucoma to asthma to cancer therapy, etc.\n \n Q. What About All Those Scary Statistics and Studies?\n A. Most were prepared as scare tactics for the government by Dr. Gabriel Nahas, and were so biased and unscientific that Nahas was fired by the National Institute of Health [16] and finally renounced his own studies as meaningless [17]. For one experiment, he suffocated monkeys for five minutes at a time, using proportionately more smoke than the average user inhales in an entire lifetime [18]. The other studies that claim sensational health risks are also suspect, since they lack controls and produce results which cannot be replicated or independently verified.\n \n And also the only reason why weed is against the law is because back then hemp was a better product it made a lot more things. So it started hurting the cotton sells so they outlawed hemp. That's the reason, not because it killed anybody it was because of sells!!!! Blue",
