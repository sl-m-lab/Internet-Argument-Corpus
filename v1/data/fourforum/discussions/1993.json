   "vsaiyan has claimed that he has never seen evolutionists post any support for their claims. Here are is exact words.\n \nSo far I have seen no evolutionists post any support for their claims. They claim their [sic] is much proof yet none has been posted.\n\n I guess it's possible that vsaiyan is so new that he hasn't seen the volumes of evidence that have been posted. Or possibly he is limited in his thinking and was unable to recognize the significance of the evidence. We do know that he doesn't bother to think things through and prefers to post the work of others as his own. And certainly anyone who doesn't know the difference between \"their\" and \"there\" demonstrates only marginal literacy and therefore an inability to understand the written word.\n \n So let me offer some evidence for vsaiyan to consider. First, my claim is that humans and the great apes share a common ancestor. The rest of this piece will be a presentation of one bit of evidence that supports that claim. The creationist answer should be specific evidence why I am wrong, including a reasonable explanation as to why this evidence exists at all if humans do not share a common ancestor with the apes (in fact, we are apes). In other words, why does the \"theory\" of \"creation science\" predict these results and explain them better than evolutionary theory?\n \n First a bit of background information. In the late 1970s a new cell staining technique was developed that revealed the banding patterns of chromosomes in greater detail than was before possible. Yunis et al (1980) published the results of a comparison of the g-banded patterns of human and chimpanzee. While the title of the paper claims only a \"striking resemblance of...g-banded chromosomes,\" actually all of the more than 1000 corresponding non-heterochromatic bands was identified in each species. This included reversals of banding patterns as well as transpositions. The banding patterns of human chromosome 2 matched the patterns of two chimp chromosomes, designated 2p and 2q (humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes while chimps have 24).\n \n Later, Yunis et al (1982) conducted a similar study that included the gorrila and the orangutan with similar results. All of the more than 1000 non-hererochromatic bands were identified in all four species although there were several reversals and transpositions.\n \n IJdo et al (1991) hypothesized that the similarities between human chromosome 2 and the ape chromosomes 2p and 2q were caused a fusion of two chromosomes in an ancester of the human lineage after the split from the chimp. The alternate hypothesis that chromosomes 2p and 2q in apes are the result of a broken chromosome was rejected because it would require an identical break in three different species. In other words, 3 events instead of one. IJdo et al predicted that if the single human chromosome 2 is the result of a fusion of 2 chromosomes in ancestral species then there should be 2 sequences of telemere repeats joined head to head at the point of the apparent fusion (telemeres are recognizable sequences at the ends of chromosomes). In order to test the hypothesis, the DNA at the site in question was sequenced and the predicted sequences were found (5'(TTAGGG)n-(CCCTAA)m3') exactly as expected. Moreover, sequences on either side of the repeats were typical of present day human pretelomeric sequences.\n \n Later Alvarello et al (1992) found remnants of an ancestral centromere that is no longer functional, or at least residual alphoid sequences, at the location that corresponds to the location of the centromere on ape chromosome 2q.\n \n These sequences indicate that human chromosome 2 is the result of the fusion of 2 ancestral ape chromosomes and that one of the two centromeres has become non-functional.\n \n If \"creation science\" wishes to challenge these findings, then it is necessary to show that these sequences arise as a consequence of a common designer, make a prediction from that hypothesis and then offer a means of testing it.\n \n -----------------------------\n \n Avarello R, Pedicini A, Caiulo A, Zuffardi O, Fraccaro M, Evidence for an ancestral alphoid domain on the long arm of human chromosome 2.

   "OK.\n \n First, apes (chimps, gorillas, and orangs) have 24 pairs of chromosomes in each cell. Humans have 23 pairs. In the first part I talked about a new dye that allowed bands on chromosomes to be visible. It isn't clearly understood why these bands show up or what they are. It is believed that they may be some sort of protein scaffold in the chromosome. Nevertheless, applying dyes to chromosomes reveals banding patterns. These banding patterns are consistant in any given chromosome in any individual in a species.\n \n In the first paper I talked about (Yunis et al, 1980) a side by side comparison was done of the banding patterns of humans and chimps. The paper found that the patterns of the two species bore a \"...striking resemblance...\" to each other. This resemblance is so good that all of the banding patterns from each species have been matched, even though they may not be in the same place in both species.\n \n One of the differences is known as an inversion. This is a region where the patterns are reversed between the two species. Such inversions have been observed (it is a mutation) in many species. They don't even seem to affect interfertility when they occur. An example of one inversion between human and chimp can be seen HERE. This is an inversion on chromosome 5.\n \n Another difference is a transposition. That is where part of one chromosome in one species is found on another chromosome. An example of a transposition is the fusion I talked about, where all of chromosome 2q was transposed to chromosome 2p. You can see a diagram HERE.\n \n Common design isn't an adequate explanation for these mutations. There is no reason why there should be inversions or transpositions from a design standpoint, especially since they can on occasion cause problems in reproduction. However, they have been observed to occur as random mutations on many occasions.\n \n Telomeres are certain sequences of the bases that form the DNA. Telomeres are found on the ends of chromosomes. It is the bases that actually carry the genetic code. They are joined to a deoxyribose (sugar) which is strung together by phosphates to form DNA. The bases (2 kinds of purine and 2 kinds of pyrimidine) are adenine, guanine, cytocine and thymine. The initial letters of each of these are used to represent the bits of the genetic code - A,G,C,T. The specific code of telomere in mammals is 5'(TTAGGG)n. The is an indeterminate number of repeats of the TTAGGG sequence. The 5'indicates a specific carbon atoms in the deoxyribose the are joined to the phosphate through a hydroxyl group. The DNA is considered to reproduce (and the code stated) in the 5'-<3' direction. All of that is really just a way to orient the direction in which the genetic code is stated. The corresponding code from the other strand of the DNA is 3'(AATCCC)n.\n \n The reason that the IJdo et al (1991) paper is so significant is that it was predicted that a series of head to head, repeating sequences that are normally found only at the ends of the chromosomes would be found in the middle of human chromosome 2 at exactly the spot expected if human chromosome 2 were the result of a fusion (transposition) of two chromosomes.\n \n The Alvarello et al (1992) paper is the same principle. This paper predicted that a remnant of an ancestral, non-functioning centromere would be found at a location that corresponds to the centromere of chimp chromosome 2q. It was found exactly where predicted. \"Common design\" has no rational explanation for these findings. A centromere is a structure important in cell division, both mitosis and meiosis.\n \n Hope I didn't make it worse. Specific questions might make it clearer.",

   "Hello, Brain, welcome to the forum.\n \n You are indeed right that there is no \"proof\" that evolution is true, just like there is no proof that any scientific theory, law, or principle is true. Science is an inductive process, and the theories, laws, and principles are accepted when the evidence in favor become so strong that it is difficult to deny them. But nothing is ever \"proved\" in science in the sense of a logical, mathematical proof.\n \n That said, the theory of evolution is \"proven\" as much as any scientific principle can be proven. The evidence in favor is quite overwhelming. If you are implying that there is no evidence in favor you are mistaken. You may not be convinced by the evidence - that is your right - you may not even believe in the the evidence - you can deny whatever you like. But the evidence is there. Why don't you start a thread and try to dispute any piece of evidence? Or, join one of the topics that are on going? I even tried to start a thread about how the existence of transitional fossils are powerful evidence for evolution. Unfortunately, the only responses I got were some quotes by scientists supposedly saying that transitionals don't exist. I assure you that the evidence I mention in the post is real; why don't you have a go at it?\n \n As far as the Bible is concerned - this is off topic for this forum, but since you are trying to compare scientific evidence in favor of the Bible with scientific evidence in favor of evolution - there is no evidence whatsoever that the Bible is a reliable historical text. Some of the places and people mentioned did indeed exist, but a few years ago I read a detective novel set in the last part of the 19th century in New York City. One character was the Police Commissioner, Theodore Roosevelt. Indeed, Teddy Roosevelt was an actual historical figure, he was indeed Police Commissioner of New York City, and New York was an actual city. But the main characters in the novel were made up, did not exist, and the real-life Roosevelt did not know those people. Likewise, even though the Bible does mention existing people and places, it is not a history text. There is no evidence that a world-wide flood ever occurred - the geological evidence would be very unambiguous, and it is simply not there. There is no evidence that a large population of slaves escaped from Egypt and wandered around the Sinai for 40 years - such large number of people would have left distinct traces and archaeologists have not been able to find it. There is not even any historical evidence that a wandering preacher name Jesus of Nazareth ever existed - although in this case it is possible for a single human being to disappear without leaving a trace in history. But your claims of \"proof\" of the Bible being a true document is simply without foundation.",
