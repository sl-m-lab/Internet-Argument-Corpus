   "emoticon_idea \n Well hello all and how are you doing? Since we did not make ourself, then we also must come to realize that everything that was made it was done by based on what we are told as the holy scriptures reveals, but by \"GOD SPIRIT\" so this is one of the reasons why I chose this question. But mostly because as we read in the book of Gen.1:1-\"2\"-and the spirit of \"GOD moved upon the face of the waters-5. , \n \n Now, in the book of John we read in Chapter 1: \"1-3\"-5. and please notice that we did not have anything to do with this creation, but in Gen. 1:26-And God said! , \"Let US/Family\" make man in our image, after our likeness:- , and notice that someone spoke, GOD and his only begotten Son/our Lord Jesus Christ (John 3:16 John 10:30) emoticon_idea \n \n Now then! , who or what was moving, or who or what had spoke. Col. 1-\"12-16\"-29. Titus 2:1 love you all from Walter, Jr.\n \n So in view of these views, or maybe that someone has other views, if so then please! share for comfort but according to the holy scriptures: Isiah 40:\"1, 2\"-6-10-18-\"21\"-31-\"But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength\"; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary, and they shall walk and not faint. \n \n Now! the above views is what I saw in a vision, even before I had read the passage in 9-12-84, then I went back to look to see of its contex, so this vs. of the passage of this scripture is very true for comfort. \n \n Now for your input: Titus 2:1 please! \n \n http://www.firstthings1st.com",
