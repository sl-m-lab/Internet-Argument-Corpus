   "Famous Amos, please show how the TIME excerpts that I included in my post are \"far different\" from what you see in your copy of TIME magazine. You have had 3 days to do so.\n \n \n \n \n .\n\n \n \n Some people actually have lives, and I was out of town for work. My job is much more important than responding to your anti-Semitic, racist, and ignorant posts.\n \n Now to TIME. Your posts starts out saying that Bush offered amnesty. In fact, that is as far from the truth as possible (pointed out with the quote \"I don't believe we ought to have amnesty\"). The truth is, Vicente Fox and the Mexican government have been throwing out the idea of amnesty, and some Mexicans have been told by their government that \"if they get 10 miles off the border, they are home free.\" That is what's fueling this fire. \"President Fox has actually encouraged the migration. HE made his goal clear in 2000 when he called for a fully open border within 10 years. When the US opposition to the proposal intensified after 9/11, Fox sought the same goal through the back door.Actually.\" Since the Mexican economy cannot provide jobs with a living wage for its worker, Fox has begun to encouraging them with all his might to flock to the US to get them off his back.\n \n Kerry porposed a quasi-amnesty program. As TIME says, \"John Kerry has promised to propose legislation that would lead to permanent residence for many illegal-alien workers.\" That's amnesty if I've ever seen it!! (but you won't hear any Democrats talk about that)\n \n You pointed out, or rather your article, that our border is more porous. Considering the fact that we have 1000s more border patrol agents and we are employing unmanned drone vehicles to survey the area makes it hard to believe it is more porous. According to TIME, from October 1, 2003 until August 25, 2004, the border patrol estimates that it apprehended nearly 60,000 OTMs (those who fall into the category of Other Than Mexicans). This is over twice the amount they apprehended in all of 2002. True, the laws aren't being properly enforced on US corporations that hire illegals, but we are simply apprehending more illegals and have more manpower to do so. The number of agents assigned to the 1951 mile southern border has grown from 8600 in 2000 to 9900 today. \n \n Both of your sources fail to mention anything done to help alleviate this problem. Anyone can make something look terrible by just citing the bad things. Don't get me wrong...the illegal immigration situation is terrible, but it is getting better.",
