(Philo, mentioned above, and others, notably Tertullian.) The earliest record of Trinitarian terminology is found in the writings of Tertullian (c. 220 A.D.), who also wrote, in his \"Against Praxeas,\" that the majority of Christians rejected his ideas as idolatry, holding instead to \"the Monarchy,\" i.e. the doctrine that there is only One Person who is God, that He is a Spirit, and that He became flesh to be the Saviour. The doctrine of the Trinity was codified by the Council of Nicea in 325 A.D. to satisfy the demand of Emperor Constantine to reconcile the teachings of Arius and his followers, who denied the Deity of Christ, with the rest of Christianity which held firmly to the exclusive Deity of Jesus Christ.\n The resulting compromise satisfied neither camp, but became the single issue which determined \"orthodoxy\" under the rule of Rome.\n\n Evidential Faith: Does the Doctrine of the Trinity Correctly Define the Godhead? by Clifford Readout, Jr.\n \n I suppose that a goodly bit of blood was spilled amongst the various warring Christians on which doctrine to follow, Christians have some sort of a blood lust for such things.",
