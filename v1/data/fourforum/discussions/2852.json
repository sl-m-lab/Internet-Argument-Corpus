   "I find that these to religious people confusing. I thought that Christianity taught love, tolerance, patience, kindness, justice, understanding...\n \n I find these 2 people the exact opposite. Do people really fall for their hateful line of ****?\n \n How much money do you think they have conned people out of in the name of \"The Lord\"?",

   "I dunno. There are so many here in america that see what they do as positive.\n I think their main power base is within the \"silent majority,\" which I think is mostly people over 50 with very traditional values. These values lead them to believe that because Falwell, Hinn, Robertson, etc. and also people like Pat Buchanan, do what they do in the name of christ that it must be good. \n \n Even though, the way I see it, it's another way for the Republican party to garner votes. I don't think there are too many evangelical christians in the democratic party. \n \n I like this quote from: http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/07/06/MNG1Q7H7241.DTL&type=printable\n \"Religious indicators can predict political activity,'' said Frank Newport, a researcher with the Gallup Poll. \"Show me somebody with a Ph.D. who doesn't go to church, and I'll show you a Democrat.''\n \n According to a Time magazine poll conducted in June, 59 percent of Americans who call themselves \"very religious\" support President Bush, compared with just 35 percent for Democrat challenger John Kerry. Those who say they are \"not religious\" favor Kerry by a margin of 69 percent to 22 percent.\n \n \"Religiosity,\" the pollsters say, is a better predictor of party affiliation than whether someone is a Protestant or a Catholic.\n \n Take, for example, Joel Joseph Estrada, a Roman Catholic, and the Rev. Phil Busbee, an evangelical Protestant. Religion is very important in both of their lives. It's also something they'll take into the voting booth this November when they cast their ballots for George W. Bush. \n \n I'll have my PhD soon and don't go to church, but I'm not a Democrat (or a Republican). But, some of my profs have PhDs, go to church, and I'm sure they'll vote for Bush. One is lesbian (i think) and surely not evangelical, and has Bill Clinton quotes outside her door. The PhD doesn't have anything to do with it, but the christian thing has a lot to do with it. \n \n I think it has a lot to do with personality, though. Christians usually need a lot of guidance, and I'm even speaking of my immediate family, who are southern baptists now. They tend to like authority and see those who appear strong, who get their guidance from the Lord, in charge. This is an appeal to the ultimate authority. They are sure that Jesus Christ will guide these leaders along the right path (even though it's quite obvious that they are money-grubbing hypocrites.)",
