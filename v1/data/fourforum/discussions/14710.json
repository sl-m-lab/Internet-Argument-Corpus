   "In this thread Sinjin decided to put his idea of firearms policy up against my reasoning for why his policy would fail miserably, and see who the others felt was more correct. So that's just what we're going to do.\n \n Sinjin has stated multiple times that he believes three particular policies would make a world of difference when it comes to firearms related crime. Those three are: mandatory storage laws for unattended firearms, mandatory reporting laws for lost or stolen firearms, and background checks on ALL secondary firearms sales performed on a national level.\n \n Ignoring the unconstitutionality of the first two I've decided to go after the third proposal here, to explain why such a policy would never work.\n \n First and foremost there's the issue regarding the privacy of the people. Under the Fourth Amendment we have a recognized right to privacy against unwarranted searches and seizures. The Supreme Court has ruled that the government has no business knowing about the private sexual practices between two consenting adults, most recently recognized in the case Lawrence V Texas. And this is just one example of something that the government has no business knowing. They can't implement the documentation and registration of every single muslim in the country, or a detailed list of political dissenters who have opposed government policy, or require the fingerprints of a blogger. So it only stands to reason that should someone try and implement a national database of secondary firearm sales, the Supreme Court would extend the same standard of privacy protection to that; especially after Heller and McDonald. If it can't pass constitutional muster then it's of no use.\n \n Second is the issue of budget. No matter how one tries to slice it, trying to fund all the aspects of a national registry of firearms transfers, primary or secondary in nature, is impossible even in the best of economies. When adding up all of the man hours that would be put in, the personnel -needed to run the registry, maintain the registry, update the registry, and check the registry when trace requests come on- the facilities to store the records (because a computerized registry is prohibited under federal law, there's no getting around that) and make sure that they're properly protected against whatever natural or man-made disaster might strike, and the sheer amount of paper that would be necessary for the countless millions of transfers that would take place in a single year, not counting the money to actually perform a trace, it's easy to see that such a registry would be nothing but a gigantic money hole. Canada has wasted literally billions of dollars simply trying to maintain their registry, and they have far fewer people and gun owners in their country than we do here in America. As is stands we're deep in debt and have no hope of paying it off, so we really can't afford to waste more money on a system that history has shown us will never work.\n \n Third is the complexity that such a system would bring with it. Since a centralized registry is forbidden by federal law, that would mean the old practices would need to be expanded. That means the federally licensed dealers who maintain the current sales records, would have to keep a much greater number of sales records than ever before. A third of the country is estimated to be armed going by currently maintained records, there's no telling how many more have armed themselves through private and untraced sales. If dealers are required to keep secondary sales records the amount of paperwork the ATF will have to sift through during the annual audits will stymie the whole system. On top of trying to see if the licensed dealers are keeping their own records in order to ensure no prohibited sales were made, the ATF will also have to try and sort out the same for private individuals.\n \n In this article here we get a glimpse of just what goes on when the ATF needs to trace firearms, and the picture is very grim.\n \n \n\"When police contact the ATF, tracing specialists take identifying information about the gun, such as the serial number, make and model. In most cases, they have to contact the gun's manufacturer to find out where it was shipped from the factory. The researcher then follows the distribution chain to find the retail dealer that first sold the weapon. The researcher calls the dealer to get the identity of the first buyer, whose name should be on an ATF form \"4473,\" the three-page buyer questionnaire that dealers are required to keep on file.\"\n\n \n \n\"Depending on how well a dealer keeps records, a firearms trace can take hours or weeks. But one-third of all gun traces come from the records of out-of-business gun dealers. In those cases, there is no one to call.\n \n When firearms dealers close, they are required to box up their records and send them to the Martinsburg tracing center. Charles Houser, who oversees the center, and his staff are inundated by the thousands of boxes of records that come in on the trucks each month. They are stacked high along the walls and between cubicles. Last year, the backlog of boxes waiting to be sorted and digitally copied reached 12,000.\"\n\n \n \n\"ATF employees, many of them hunkered over folding tables, go through a tedious process of sorting, stacking, cataloguing and deciphering. From the boxes, they pull out gun-sales records on ink-smeared, yellowed index cards and dog-eared ledger books filled with faded pencil. If they are lucky, they find 4473s written in clear, legible handwriting. Inside the dealer's boxes, workers sometimes find ammunition, the odd gun part - or rat feces. Some records have languished in attics for decades. Others have been underwater.\n \n \"Katrina was a mess,\" Houser said.\n \n Gun dealers all over the Gulf Coast region were driven out of business by the hurricane, and they sent their wet and mildewing records to Martinsburg. For months, paper files sat in the center's parking lot, drying in the sun.\"\n\n \n Thousands of boxes, not papers but boxes, backlogged and just waiting to eventually be reached and sorted through. And that's just from the primary sales carried out as it is now. Add secondary sales and the number could reach tens of thousands, if not millions. One gun could change hands a hundred times, and each time would have to be documented and the records housed indefinitely, likely to never be seen again.\n \n This also doesn't take into account that things sometimes just go wrong. Records become outdated with the transfer of ownership, and secondary sales records would need to be analyzed, sorted, and maintained on a daily basis to ensure accuracy and validity, otherwise you could have dozens of names to a single firearm, all of which would have to be sorted through. Plus with all of the requirements for extended paperwork keeping, mistakes become far more common. It's all too easy for one number to be written down wrong, and when you have a wrong number -be it an incorrect serial number, or a bad zipcode, or anything else like that- you hit a dead end simply because human error exists and can't be done away with.\n \n Like it or not **** happens, people **** up, and records prove to be useless. This is going to change. Increasing the amount of paperwork only makes the system bigger, more unmanageable and more useless than when it's kept relatively small.\n \n With all of this in mind can anyone really claim that mandating the documentation of all secondary sales would make the process any better? Can anyone honestly tell us that increased paperwork and red tape will streamline things and better aid the police?\n \n Fourth, the ease in which such a system can be defeated. Everyone with even half a brain knows that the most important piece required for successfully tracing a firearm is the serial number etched into it. Should anything happen to that serial number and it's removed from the gun, the gun itself can no longer be traced and it becomes a phantom in the system, it's no longer recognized as existing. This is such an important issue that it's actually a felony offense to alter or deface the serial number on a firearm. All one would have to do to defeat a national secondary sales database is file off the serial number, and suddenly all that paperwork amounts to toilet paper, because there's no getting the number back. There's no finding out who the last known owner is, there's no telling where it was sold, there's no telling if it was ever reported stolen. And every two bit criminal out there knows this fact. And they don't seem to have any problem with filing the serial number out of existence, basically taking the gun out of existence with it.\n \n And that's just the most apparent example of how the system can be rendered useless and proven to be nothing more than a gigantic money waste. Assuming that the police and FBI and ATF and such really could trace every single firearm as it traded hands, there's simply going to be times when that trace leads to a dead end. People die, their possessions get stolen or misplaced. Some people simply get old and forget. If a trace on a gun recovered at a crime scene leads us to an elderly gentlemen who's gotten on in years and isn't in full possession of their mental capacities, what exactly are the authorities to do: are they going to arrest the former owner senior citizen for failing to report the theft of their firearm, even if their old age prevents them from remembering they ever owned a gun to begin with? Are they going to be charged with obstruction? Or is it going to be written off as just one of those things that happens?\n \n Or maybe the trace will lead back to the last known owner, only for it to be discovered that it was reported stolen who knows how many years ago. What good has the system done then? Has it brought the police any closer to making an arrest or solving a crime? \n \n Or maybe we'll catch somebody who's genuinely guilty of selling their gun and not filling out the government mandated paperwork. Then what? What exactly have we achieved in making a single small time arrest? If they can't lead us to a bigger fish with a much more notable criminal history then what good has really been achieved?\n \n Then we come to the fifth point of why a national registry of all secondary sales will fail. The simple fact is that the justice system is a mess. Most cases never go to trial anymore, they end in a plea deal and reduced sentences in charges simply because we don't have enough prosecutors, judges, defense attorneys, or time, to try the number of criminals that we have right now. Bringing people in for charges of not registering their firearms would only slow the system down further, which would lead to the legitimate complaints of violating a defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial. We can't hold someone for ten years while we wait for their case to come to court meaning either the charges against them will have to be dismissed (and the registry undermined in the process) or a plea deal will have to be offered, and the weapon charges dropped in the process. Anything else will stagnate the system.\n \n Which brings us to the sixth point. In America we have serious problems going on that the government deems necessary to get involved in. We're hunting for terrorists, trying to address budget deficits and a massive recession that's nowhere near over. We have a legitimate need to secure our borders to enforce the immigration laws that're in place. We have an educational system that's drastically lacking, a justice system that's not doing it's job, violent criminal gangs that commit 80 percent of all the annual crimes in the country, a massive war on drugs, human traffickers and drug smugglers, continued outbreaks of deadly bacteria in foods that can't be tracked down to an original source, and foreign nations that would like to see us blown off the face of the Earth. Do we really need to add to this mess, the mandatory documenting of sales between private individuals who are legally exercising their constitutional rights and not committing criminal harm to anyone? How far do we push in the name of trying to get what some call \"justice\"? Do we push beyond what all other branches and divisions would consider \"reasonable\" simply because it's important for our politicians to be able to get in the soundbyte that they're doing something to address the crime issues in this country?\n \n \n \n The cases have been made. Sinjin has made his proposal for how to better deal with criminals, and I've explained in depth why and how his proposal is doomed to fail miserably. Now it's up to those reading here to determine who's on the right track. Who is correct?",
