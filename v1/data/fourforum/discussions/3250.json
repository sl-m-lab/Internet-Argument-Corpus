   "When I was a little kid I was taught that there was a god, and that when you died, you got to be an angel watching over your loved ones, and then when all your loved ones died, you went to heaven with them and got to be with god eternally. That is what my mother taught me. Then when I was older, about 6 or 7, she explained that that wasn't really a fact, just what she believed. She told me I could believe whatever I wanted to, and to feel free to ask her questions about religion, dying, etc. whenever. So I still believed what my mom had told me, of course she had never been wrong before (I was around 7 years old).\n \n When I was a little bit older I realized that I didn't really truly believe it, but just as a story. I looked at the world and saw all the poor, starving people. All the people dying and decided that if there was an all-powerful god, I didn't want to be with him anyway.\n \n Then whenever I would go to bed, be unoccuppied, I would worry about death. If there was nothing after life, then I'll just be gone, and that was scary. If there was a god, he'd know I didn't believe in him.\n \n So I decided I did believe in god, because either way, it couldn't hurt. It wasn't long when I again realized that I didn't really believe it, I just convinced myself I did because either way, it couldn't hurt, I didn't really believe it.\n \n After thinking for a long time at nights when in bed, I realized that you can't really know for sure if there is a god, but all the stories in the bible at least seem to be based on ideas from back when it was written. \n \n If the sun stopped, wouldn't that imply that the sun was going around the earth?\n Noah's ark it rained 40 days and 40 nights and the water was \"to the heavens\". I think we can all agree that 10 inches a day would be a total downpour unlike we have ever seen in our entire lives, even in hurricanes. So in 40 days, that would be 400 inches, or 33 feet. There are buildings as high as that. The heavens would probably be at least a mile, which would be exactly 132 inches of rain a day. I think we can all agree that this would sink an ark.\n \n And it just seems so much like someone wanted power, everyone wanted to believe that life had a purpose, so they could write a book, say it was by a higher being, and use it to control people. It's used that way now sometimes. Such as you said, to keep people ignorant, a technique used by slave owners to control their slaves. They have to use a punishment for people who don't believe. Of course if someone wrote a book they would have to have some reason for people to join. \"He said if you don't join you'll burn for eternity after death\". I'm not saying this is true, just that there's as much evidence that the bible is true as there is that it is false.\n \n And to people who say, \"if we didn't create the world, the trees, animals, us, water cycle, food chain, etc. then who did?\" I could use the same argument for god. There has to be a stopping point somewhere in the chain. How did god come into existence?\n \n Basically, I think the bible presents good rules to live by, but I don't believe in god. I don't know for sure there is no god, but since there is very little proof I think of him sort of like I think of vampires and werewolves, I won't believe in them until I see some sort of concrete proof.\n \n Well, that's my experience, what's yours?",

   "I went through a similar realisation process. Religious concepts were introduced to me as a child, but as I got older, I began to see the loopholes, the wild claims and alternative religious groups that claimed a god as theirs alone. That raised the question that someone must be wrong, and finally the logical conclusion, they were all wrong! \n \n I accepted that it is natural for people to be concerned with their own death and the fragility of their existence.

I've always wondered if Christians just accept the bible as the truth because it's the only thing presented to them, and the same for other religions. I assume this isn't the case for most people, I'm just curious of what other people believe and why.\n\n As a young person it was the only belief system presented to me. It was morality, discipline; a specific behavioral theme. I did not know the Lord, nor was I able to learn anything other than that which was to be presented outwardly &#8211; towards humanity. I had no inner (or spiritual) growth from it, it was just there and I accepted it as schooling.\n \n A few years ago (about 11 years now) I began to have this urge to understand life in general. How things came to be and why &#8211; why am I here? There had to be more to life than this and there had to be a reason why I felt so empty. But, living, to me, was a one-man-job. No one could do it for me and only I had the power to make it or break it. I saw no other way. But, determined to discover the truth, I took that journey. Along the way I saw the path on which the church had taken me those many years before. In a blink I passed it, suddenly, as if it were but a mere whisper. It was then that I realized that the church, or religion, could only take you so far, no matter how powerful their teaching.\n \n For the benefit of those that have never experienced the Spirit of God, I will say that the initial search for Truth gave me an overwhelming sense of peace unlike anything I have ever experienced before. It not only allowed me to slow down and savor His presence, but it enabled me to read and understand the Bible with much more clarity &#8211; He helped me unlock mysteries of the Word and how it related to me personally. That&#8217;s when I learned that God is a personal God, not one that relies on a one-size-fits-all consciousness. That&#8217;s not to say that what He gives me He cannot give others, but that what he gives me is what I need. I understood what David meant when he said, &#8220;The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want&#8230;\n \n Then after spending time each day with Him all the things I wondered about became clear. And, along the way, He changed me &#8211; inside and out. I began to learn how to place myself into position to learn more, to be blessed and how to bless others. I eventually learned how to shuck religion and, like a hard shell, my old life, my old self, fell away.\n \n Why do I believe? Because He is real.",

   "For many, the comfort of religion will always surpass the thirst for truth and the reality of life.\n\n That is true, to a certain extent. But, afterwards becomes a quagmire of rituals, emotions, and confusion. Religion is akin to a torture chamber lined with silk, warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Religion is the smell of an old church where comfort abounds, where soft whispers lull you to sleep. It&#8217;s the soft drinks and cookies, covered dish dinners and get-togethers, a Sunday afternoon singing. It&#8217;s joyous praises at the alter, praying and lifting up your hands. Religion is all things human. But after the trashcans are full, after the lid is closed on the piano, after the doors are locked on the church, that&#8217;s when religion fails and your own faith and belief must take over.

I assume this isn't the case for most people, I'm just curious of what other people believe and why.\n\n \n Religion was mostly removed from me. My father did not believe it appropriate for anyone to tell another what or how to believe. I grew up with zero religious leanings. In college, I examined many different philosophies. MOstly believed I was the sole authority on anything. I invested in Buddhism, islam, judaism, and christianity. A little of the pagan stuff but not really. It was too far out at that time for me.\n \n I began a foray into christianity when I went to a play at a church which was relevant and good. I enjoyed theater and was particularly impressed that no one wanted to meet me in a little room alone, or ask me for money or make me pray a prayer of a certain type. I saw a good play, had a good meal and went home. \n \n I continued to check them out and learned a few things. i have since accepted christ and continually find that His words of eternal life are true, that is they match up with reality.

   "I was brought up in the Salvation Army since I was born. My grandparents are retired Salvation Army Officiers while my parents were also in the Army. I've never really questioned whether the Bible is 100% true or not, which is partly the reason why I came onto this forum - to see the \"contradictions\" that other people had found in the Bible. I have been most disappointed, however, as many of the supposed \"contradictions\" have not really been all that good and easily refutable. \n \n I consider myself to have an open mind to a certain extent, when the issue of origins is introduced, I have my bias, just like everyone else. No one has an \"open mind\" in that forum. Many of those who are evolutionists are already biased in favour of their view. I have read around and have found out that the Bible is reliable, both scientific, prophetic and historically accurate - no other religous book is anywhere as accurate. All of what I have read points to the fact that the Bible's account of origins (i.e. Genesis) is true and that the Bible is the Word of God, hence, I don't believe that the Bible is the Word of God out of blind faith. The Christian belief is a reasonable and defendable faith. Reading books like the \"Heavenly Man\" only help to reaffirm my belief in that God of the Bible is real and He does still perform miracles. I've felt His presence several times, which also really affirms my belief in Him and His Word. I've seen the way in which people who have given their lives to God who have had their lives turned around! There are many such examples in the Salvation Army's magazine \"The War Cry\".\n \n To zachvac:\n When I was a little bit older I realized that I didn't really truly believe it, but just as a story. I looked at the world and saw all the poor, starving people. All the people dying and decided that if there was an all-powerful god, I didn't want to be with him anyway.\n \n I couldn't help but see this point and I agree with you to a certain extent...\n The Bible says that man is responsible for the death and suffering that we observe in the world today. If we take the Word of God as being literal, which indeed we should, we can find a God of love amidst the groaning of this world by understanding the Genesis account of the Fall - we know that we are looking at a fallen, cursed world.\n \n From teh Bible's perspective of history, death is an enemy, not an \"ally\". In 1 Corinthians 15:26, the Apostle Paul describes death as the \"last enemy.\" Death was not a part of God's original creation, which truly was \"very good\". Death and suffering is the penalty for sin. When Adam rebelled against God, in effect he was saying that he wanted life without God. He wanted to decide truth for himself, independently of God. Now the Bible tells us that Adam was the head of the human race, representing each one of us, who are his descendants. Paul says in Romans 5:12-19 that we sin \"in Adam\", after the likeness of Adam. In other words, we have the same problem Adam had. When Adam rebelled against God, all human beings, represented by Adam, effectively said that they wanted life without God.\n \n God had to judge Adam's sin with death. He had already warned Adam that if he sinned, he would \"surely die\". After Adam's Fall, he and all his descendants forfeited the right to live. After all, God is the author of life. Death is the natural penalty of choosing life without God, the giver of life. Also, because the Lord is holy and just, there had to be a penalty for rebellion. The Bible makes it clear that death is the penalty for our sin, not just the sin of Adam. If you accept the Bible's account of history, then our sins - not just the sins of the \"other guy\" - are responsible for all the death and suffering in the world! In other words, it is really our falt that the world is the way it is. No-one is really \"innocent\". God has given us a taste of life without Him, Romans 8:22 tells us that the whole of creation is groaning and travailing in pain. \n \n However, if God used millions of years (which is an idea from outside of the Bible, and not supported by any Biblical verses) to create things, then I would agree with you. God would be a sadistic ogre. But we know that this is not how He made it - it was once a perfect world, but we made a mess of it. Isn't that hard to swallow? It's our fault and not God's fault. \n \n Therefore, your point about all the suffering and death in the world today is invalid when Genesis is taken literally. God made a deathless and sufferingless place, we made a mess of it and through Adam's rebellion, death was brought into creation making it OUR fault - not God's fault. However, God sent His one and only Son to die for your and my sins so that we would not suffer for all eternity. We also know that the world will not be groaning for much longer, Jesus will return and create a new heaven and a new earth that will once again have no suffering and no death. God did all of this and will restore this creation to it's once perfect state out of His love for us. Hence, God is a God of love.\n \n If the sun stopped, wouldn't that imply that the sun was going around the earth?\n \n No, Joshua's command to the sun to stand still does not support geocentrism, i.e. the idea that the sun moves around the Earth. The Bible uses the language of appearance and observation.\n \n Today people do exactly the same thing. For example, scientists who prepare weather reports for TV announce the times of 'sunrise and sunset'. In fact, the mention of the moon also standing still seems to confirm both the divine authorship of the account and the fact that it is the Earth which moves. Since all Joshua needed was extra sunlight, and most ancients believed the sun moves, not the Earth, a human author of a fictitious account would only have needed to refer to the sun stopping. The article of which this information was from, titled Joshua's Long Day may help shed some more light on what actually happened.\n \n The article ends with this:\n Miracles rest on testimony, not on scientific analyses. While it is interesting to speculate on how God might have performed any particular Biblical miracle, including Joshua's long day, ultimately those claiming to be disciples of Jesus Christ (who authenticated the divine record of the Bible) must accept them, by faith. There is not one logical, scientific reason to claim that, given a God powerful enough to create a universe in six days, Joshua's long day 'could not have happened'. Those who balk at this account are almost invariably those who have already rejected 6-day creation through compromise with evolution 's fictitious long ages, and have thus rejected the authority of the Bible.\n \n Noah's ark it rained 40 days and 40 nights and the water was \"to the heavens\". I think we can all agree that 10 inches a day would be a total downpour unlike we have ever seen in our entire lives, even in hurricanes. So in 40 days, that would be 400 inches, or 33 feet. There are buildings as high as that. The heavens would probably be at least a mile, which would be exactly 132 inches of rain a day. I think we can all agree that this would sink an ark.\n \n I think you are mistaken. Remember the \"waters of the deep\"? You are assuming that the only water came from the sky. In fact, there is geological evidence to suggest that there were catastrophic plate techtonic movements in the times before the flood. In the article Drowned from below, it is said that:\n Scientists have long thought that the hot interior of the earth would be very dry, because the heat would have vaporised and driven off any water. But according to a report in New Scientist, certain minerals, even under the intense heat and pressure deep underground, can store lots of water. Models of the mantle, that part of the earth between the molten core and the solid crust, and notably the 'transition zone' between the upper and lower mantle, now describe it as 'sopping wet'.\n \n What's more, it seems that hot wet rocks are more unstable than hot dry rocks. This new information may now explain 'why massive volcanic outbursts suddenly flood[ed] hundreds of thousands of square kilometres [of land] with lava', as observed in a number of different parts of the geological record.\n \n Who could ask for a more graphic description of the behaviour of the 'fountains of the great deep'? It is interesting that even today, up to 70% or more of what comes out of volcanoes is water, mostly in the form of vapour. \n \n So how much water is stored in the mantle? Estimates vary from 10 to 30 times the amount in all the earth's present oceans! Is it possible for the mantle to suddenly release this water and for the earth to be 'drowned from below'? The author concluded that a 'sudden outpouring of water, Noah-style', was unlikely. His conclusion is consistent with God's promise to Noah, sealed by the sign of the rainbow, never to destroy the earth with water again. \n \n Storms called \"Hypercanes\" may have also contributed to the Flood. This theory is outlined in the article Hypercanes: rainfall generators during the Flood? The article called Noah's Flood - Where did all that water come from? talks about catastrophic plate tectonics and what the \"fountains of the deep\" mean.\n \n About Noah's Ark sinking, I don't think so. Noah's Ark is nothing like the drawings of a small boat with a giraffe's head sticking out the top, no, no, no, it was huge with teh capacity to hold up to 125,000 sheep; 520 railcars at 240 sheep per car. It was extemely stable - more stable, in fact, than modern ships. It was designed by God for capacity and it's ability to float (not speed or manoeuvrability).\n \n And it just seems so much like someone wanted power, everyone wanted to believe that life had a purpose, so they could write a book, say it was by a higher being, and use it to control people.  \n \n Conspiracy theorist, I sense? But you would also have to take into consideration, when dealing with the Bible, the elements that point to Divine Authorship, such as it's amazing unity, preservation, historical, prophetical and scientific accuracy, the Bible's absolute honesty and it's transforming message.\n \n  I'm not saying this is true, just that there's as much evidence that the bible is true as there is that it is false.\n \n I think not, but this is your opinion.\n \n I could use the same argument for god. There has to be a stopping point somewhere in the chain. How did god come into existence?\n \n But the Bible clearly defines God as the uncreated (i.e. eternal) creator of the universe, and what applies within the universe need not apply to God, so the question \"Who created God?\" becomes illogical, just like \"To whom is the bachelor married?\" So hence, your question is answered and the question that responded in you \"turning the tables\" is still unanswered...\n \n I won't believe in them until I see some sort of concrete proof.\n \n What sort of proof would you expect to see if there was a Creator God out there? You brought up death and suffering before, this goes to support the Bible's claim about Adam's Fall. Design is more evidence... True stories like those of what happened to Brother Yun in \"The Heavenly Man\" (which I have outlined his miraclous escape from a maximum security Chinese prison in the topic \"Are miracles real?\" on this forum) also strongly suggest the existence of the God of the Bible...",

This guy really can hold a grudge :)\n \n \n\n From teh Bible's perspective of history, death is an enemy, not an \"ally\". In 1 Corinthians 15:26, the Apostle Paul describes death as the \"last enemy.\" Death was not a part of God's original creation, which truly was \"very good\". Death and suffering is the penalty for sin. When Adam rebelled against God, in effect he was saying that he wanted life without God. He wanted to decide truth for himself, independently of God. Now the Bible tells us that Adam was the head of the human race, representing each one of us, who are his descendants. Paul says in Romans 5:12-19 that we sin \"in Adam\", after the likeness of Adam. In other words, we have the same problem Adam had. When Adam rebelled against God, all human beings, represented by Adam, effectively said that they wanted life without God.\n \n\n So we are all considered Adam just because we are of the same race??\n \n \n \n\n God had to judge Adam's sin with death. He had already warned Adam that if he sinned, he would \"surely die\". After Adam's Fall, he and all his descendants forfeited the right to live. After all, God is the author of life. Death is the natural penalty of choosing life without God, the giver of life. Also, because the Lord is holy and just, there had to be a penalty for rebellion. The Bible makes it clear that death is the penalty for our sin, not just the sin of Adam. If you accept the Bible's account of history, then our sins - not just the sins of the \"other guy\" - are responsible for all the death and suffering in the world! In other words, it is really our falt that the world is the way it is. No-one is really \"innocent\". God has given us a taste of life without Him, Romans 8:22 tells us that the whole of creation is groaning and travailing in pain.\n \n\n If death is the penalty of choosing life without god, why am I still alive and typing now?\n \n \n \n\n However, if God used millions of years (which is an idea from outside of the Bible, and not supported by any Biblical verses) to create things, then I would agree with you. God would be a sadistic ogre. But we know that this is not how He made it - it was once a perfect world, but we made a mess of it. Isn't that hard to swallow? It's our fault and not God's fault.\n \n\n I don't know much about the bible, but I do know that he \"created us in his own image\". If that's true, then why do we sin and be evil like this. If he created us, why didn't he create us so that we wouldn't rebel?\n \n \n \n\n Therefore, your point about all the suffering and death in the world today is invalid when Genesis is taken literally. God made a deathless and sufferingless place, we made a mess of it and through Adam's rebellion, death was brought into creation making it OUR fault - not God's fault. However, God sent His one and only Son to die for your and my sins so that we would not suffer for all eternity. We also know that the world will not be groaning for much longer, Jesus will return and create a new heaven and a new earth that will once again have no suffering and no death. God did all of this and will restore this creation to it's once perfect state out of His love for us. Hence, God is a God of love.\n \n\n I wish he'd hurry, all this news of death and destruction everywhere in the world is a little depressing. And in this new world would we still get homework? :)\n \n \n \n\n If the sun stopped, wouldn't that imply that the sun was going around the earth?\n \n No, Joshua?s command to the sun to stand still does not support geocentrism, i.e. the idea that the sun moves around the Earth. The Bible uses the language of appearance and observation.\n \n Today people do exactly the same thing. For example, scientists who prepare weather reports for TV announce the times of ?sunrise and sunset?. In fact, the mention of the moon also standing still seems to confirm both the divine authorship of the account and the fact that it is the Earth which moves. Since all Joshua needed was extra sunlight, and most ancients believed the sun moves, not the Earth, a human author of a fictitious account would only have needed to refer to the sun stopping. The article of which this information was from, titled Joshua's Long Day may help shed some more light on what actually happened.\n \n\n OK, but if we take the laws of physics into account, even if really the sun stopped. We are moving very fast through space, We go around the sun which is about 93,000,000 miles. to get the circumference that's 2*pi*93,000,000 = 584,336,233 miles in circumference. This is in 365 days=8760 hours, so the earth is moving at 584,336,233/8760=66,705 miles per hour. That's pretty darn fast.\n \n To be in orbit, we have to have the same centripital acceleration (acceleration away from the sun, when you go in a circle the acceleration is away from the center point perpendicular to the direction you're going) as gravity of the sun.\n \n Now it would depend whether the Earth and the sun are going in the direction continuing the ray from the sun to the Earth or the Earth to the sun. If we were going in the direction from the sun to the Earth and the sun stopped, then the Earth would break free from the sun's orbit because it would still be moving that way. The other way around and we would go crashing into the sun because we would head to close to stay in orbit.\n \n \n \n \n\n Noah's ark it rained 40 days and 40 nights and the water was \"to the heavens\". I think we can all agree that 10 inches a day would be a total downpour unlike we have ever seen in our entire lives, even in hurricanes. So in 40 days, that would be 400 inches, or 33 feet. There are buildings as high as that. The heavens would probably be at least a mile, which would be exactly 132 inches of rain a day. I think we can all agree that this would sink an ark.\n \n I think you are mistaken. Remember the \"waters of the deep\"? You are assuming that the only water came from the sky. In fact, there is geological evidence to suggest that there were catastrophic plate techtonic movements in the times before the flood. In the article Drowned from below, it is said that:\n Scientists have long thought that the hot interior of the earth would be very dry, because the heat would have vaporised and driven off any water. But according to a report in New Scientist, certain minerals, even under the intense heat and pressure deep underground, can store lots of water. Models of the mantle, that part of the earth between the molten core and the solid crust, and notably the ?transition zone? between the upper and lower mantle, now describe it as ?sopping wet?.\n \n What?s more, it seems that hot wet rocks are more unstable than hot dry rocks. This new information may now explain ?why massive volcanic outbursts suddenly flood[ed] hundreds of thousands of square kilometres [of land] with lava?, as observed in a number of different parts of the geological record.\n \n Who could ask for a more graphic description of the behaviour of the ?fountains of the great deep?? It is interesting that even today, up to 70% or more of what comes out of volcanoes is water, mostly in the form of vapour. \n \n So how much water is stored in the mantle? Estimates vary from 10 to 30 times the amount in all the earth?s present oceans! Is it possible for the mantle to suddenly release this water and for the earth to be ?drowned from below?? The author concluded that a ?sudden outpouring of water, Noah-style?, was unlikely. His conclusion is consistent with God?s promise to Noah, sealed by the sign of the rainbow, never to destroy the earth with water again. \n \n Storms called \"Hypercanes\" may have also contributed to the Flood. This theory is outlined in the article Hypercanes: rainfall generators during the Flood? The article called Noah's Flood - Where did all that water come from? talks about catastrophic plate tectonics and what the \"fountains of the deep\" mean.\n \n About Noah's Ark sinking, I don't think so. Noah's Ark is nothing like the drawings of a small boat with a giraffe's head sticking out the top, no, no, no, it was huge with teh capacity to hold up to 125,000 sheep; 520 railcars at 240 sheep per car. It was extemely stable - more stable, in fact, than modern ships. It was designed by God for capacity and it's ability to float (not speed or manoeuvrability).\n \n\n OK, we know it rained, a lot. So that means we were getting a lot of rain from above and a lot of rain from below, equaling at least 132 inches per day. That would squash an aircraft carrier, which could easily carry 520 railcars at 240 sheep per car. I don't care how stable it was or even how big, since the bigger it is, the more surface area, the more water hitting it at one time since this is in inches of height. It is most likely that something like this would have been squashed.\n \n \n \n\n And it just seems so much like someone wanted power, everyone wanted to believe that life had a purpose, so they could write a book, say it was by a higher being, and use it to control people.  \n \n Conspiracy theorist, I sense? But you would also have to take into consideration, when dealing with the Bible, the elements that point to Divine Authorship, such as it's amazing unity, preservation, historical, prophetical and scientific accuracy, the Bible's absolute honesty and it's transforming message.\n \n\n I'm just saying it's possible in my opinion. It could have also been a mother somewhere with a worrying child asking \"what happened to dad?\" To comfort him and other children like that she could have claimed an all-mighty being wrote this book and their dad's are all in heaven.\n \n \n\n I could use the same argument for god. There has to be a stopping point somewhere in the chain. How did god come into existence?\n \n But the Bible clearly defines God as the uncreated (i.e. eternal) creator of the universe, and what applies within the universe need not apply to God, so the question \"Who created God?\" becomes illogical, just like \"To whom is the bachelor married?\" So hence, your question is answered and the question that responded in you \"turning the tables\" is still unanswered...\n \n\n Then why can't we be uncreated? I know you never said this, but many people say \"if we didn't create life, the water cycle, the food chain, etc. then who did?\" The answer could be they were all uncreated.\n \n \n \n\n I won't believe in them until I see some sort of concrete proof.\n \n What sort of proof would you expect to see if there was a Creator God out there? You brought up death and suffering before, this goes to support the Bible's claim about Adam's Fall. Design is more evidence... True stories like those of what happened to Brother Yun in \"The Heavenly Man\" (which I have outlined his miraclous escape from a maximum security Chinese prison in the topic \"Are miracles real?\" on this forum) also strongly suggest the existence of the God of the Bible...\n\n I have looked at the forum you're talking about but not very recently and it seems there were credibility problems. We don't know for sure they happened. we can't even find out where Bush was when serving in the national guard, let alone millions of years ago. Proof would include him speaking to me, me dying and finding myself in heaven (or hell), and other concrete proofs.",

   "To zachvac:\n \n But I still don't see why I should be punished for what 2 people did millions of years ago. This guy really can hold a grudge :) So we are all considered Adam just because we are of the same race??\n \n Oh dear... Did you even read the post?? It isn't just Adam's fault that the world is the way it is, it is equally ours. We all rebel against God like Adam did, it is human nature. Adam represented all human beings, i.e. his descendants. I can't really simplify it much more that this, I hope that you can understand this. Btw, the actual Biblical chronology is about 6,000 years ago, not millions of years ago...\n \n If death is the penalty of choosing life without god, why am I still alive and typing now?\n \n He did not say we would die instantaneously. I hate to tell you, but you are dying now, I am dying now. Death is the ultimate natural process when we move away from the giver of life (i.e. God). \n \n I don't know much about the bible, but I do know that he \"created us in his own image\". If that's true, then why do we sin and be evil like this. If he created us, why didn't he create us so that we wouldn't rebel?\n \n Yes, we are made in God's image, hence, we have everlasting \"souls\" - just like the Holy Spirit. Although our bodies die, our souls will live on and be judged by what we have done on Earth and as to whether or not we believe in Him and His Son. As for why He didn't create us so that we wouldn't rebel, well, He gave us free will. He could have made us like robots, but He gave us free will and choices as to whether or not to follow Him. We sin and are evil because we used the free will that God gave us and chose not to follow Him. This is not an overly hard concept to understand...\n \n I wish he'd hurry, all this news of death and destruction everywhere in the world is a little depressing. And in this new world would we still get homework? :)\n \n LOL! I wish that He would hurry up too, and no, I don't think (or hope) that we will get any homework in the new heaven and new earth...\n \n OK, but if we take the laws of physics into account, even if really the sun stopped. \n \n Do you do Physics? It is an okay course, I've just finished it a few weeks ago and am doing the HSC exam soon.\n Oh, yeah, back to the topic at hand. You are assuming that the sun really stopped. Remember that the Bible uses the language of appearance and observation. I am not quite sure whether or not you read the link I provided, but they point out three possible ways that God could have caused Joshua's long day:\n \n 1. Some form of refraction (bending) of the light from the sun and the moon. According to this view, God miraculously caused the sunlight and moonlight to continue in Canaan for 'about a whole day'.\n \n 2. A wobble in the direction of the Earth's axis of rotation. This involves a precession of the axis of the Earth, wobbling slowly so as to trace an 's'-shaped or circular path in the sky. Such an event could have made it appear to an observer that the sun and the moon were standing still, but need not have involved any actual slowing of the rotation of the Earth.\n \n 3. A slowing of the Earth's rotation. According to this view, God caused the rotation of the Earth to slow down so that it made one full revolution in about 48 hours rather than 24. Simultaneously God stopped the cataclysmic effects that would have naturally occurred, such as monstrous tidal waves. Some people have objected to this on the erroneous assumption that, if the Earth slowed down, people and loose objects would fly off into space. In fact, the apparent centrifugal force (tending to throw things off the Earth) is only about one-three-hundredth of the gravitational force. If the Earth stopped rotating (whether suddenly or not), this outward 'force' would cease and we would actually be held more firmly by gravity.\n \n Notice how the stopping of the sun is not mentioned in any of these explanations? None of these can be proved by science, as we can't observe, repeat and experiment on these ideas. They must be taken by faith and also by taking into consideration that God is a God of miracles and He looks at impossibilities and cries \"It shall be done\" (words from a chorus).\n \n \n OK, we know it rained, a lot. So that means we were getting a lot of rain from above and a lot of rain from below, equaling at least 132 inches per day. \n \n I don't know about how you came to 132 inches per day, but anyway... Remember that this ship was designed by God and He perfectly made the plans so that the ship would not sink. The water hitting the Ark would have run off the top of the roof anyway... The boat's roof would not have been weak, it most likely would have been reinforced and most likely have been very thick.\n \n \n I'm just saying it's possible in my opinion. It could have also been a mother somewhere with a worrying child asking \"what happened to dad?\" To comfort him and other children like that she could have claimed an all-mighty being wrote this book and their dad's are all in heaven.\n \n Possibly, but why would the Bible go into Israel's history and the beginning of the universe? Why talk about the Flood - which many other cultures also have documented (but in no where as detailed) - and the beginning of the Church, our behaviour and mans relationship with God and so on? You point would be much more believable if the book only stated about going up to heaven (or hell). \n \n \n Then why can't we be uncreated? I know you never said this, but many people say \"if we didn't create life, the water cycle, the food chain, etc. then who did?\" The answer could be they were all uncreated.\n \n You mean by accidents, natural forces and processes (i.e. without God)? Good question. We will deal with this issue for a while. There is good evidence that the universe had a beginning. This can be shown from the Laws of Thermodynamics, the most fundamental laws of the physical sciences:\n * 1st Law: The total amount of mass-energy in the universe is a constant.\n * 2nd Law: The amount of energy in the universe available for work is running down, or entropy (a measure of disorder, or of the decrease in usable energy) is increasing to a maximum.\n \n So, since the total amount of mass-energy is limited, and the amount of usable energy is decreasing, then the universe cannot have existed forever, otherwise it would already have exhausted all usable energy and reached what is known as \"heat death\". For example, all atoms would have decayed, every part of the universe would be the same temperature, and no further work would be possible. So the best and most logical response is that the universe must have been created with a lot of usable energy, and is now running down. \n \n So we have shown that the universe could not have existed forever and that it must have been created sometime in the past. Was it by accident (the evolutionary idea of the big bang) or by the planned creative acts of God? In order to answer this question, we need to use the Law of Causality. The Law of Causality is basically the \"cause and effect\" relationships. This Law states that one cause can have many effects, but no effect can be quantitatively greater or qualitatively superior to its cause. Observed effects are assumed to have causes because of this law, and thus are not treated as purely random or chance occurences. The inquisitive mind will speculate on the cause of an observed effect and then seek to recreate and test the cause experimentally. All science, history and law enforcement would collapse if this law of cause and effect were denied.\n \n The following reasoning stands up to scrutiny:\n * Everything which has a beginning has a cause - definition of cause refering to the efficient cause, the chief agent causing something to be made.\n * The universe has a beginning (see proof above).\n * Therefore the universe has a cause, i.e. evolutionary idea about big bang is wrong as it cannot be an accident. \n \n No one has observed, or can name one object or creature that has come into being with a cause (using definition above). Thus it is very reasonable to believe that the universe was created by God and it is illogical to believe that the universe made itself through the big bang without the assistance of a God. Also, the universe cannot be self-caused - nothing can creat itself, because it would need to exist before it came into existence; a logical absurdity. \n \n However, you may have heard some physicists assert that quantum mechanics violates this Law and can produce something from nothing, but this is not so. Theories that the universe is a quantum flucation must presuppose that there was something to fluctuate - their \"quantum vacuum\" is a lot of matter-antimatter potential - not \"nothing\". Hence, the cause and effect principles stand. Also, if there is no cause, there is no explanation why this particular universe appeared at a particular time, nor why it was a universe and not, say, a banana or a dog which appeared. This universe can't have any properties to explain its preferential coming into existence, because it would not have any properties until it actually came into existence.\n \n In summary, we have proved that the universe is not eternal (i.e. it must have been created) and that it has to have a cause (i.e. is not an accident). Whichever way you look at it, a belief in an all-powerful, all-knowing Creator God, as revealed in the Bible, not only makes sense, but it is the only viable explanation.\n \n I have looked at the forum you're talking about but not very recently and it seems there were credibility problems. \n \n I was refering to Brother Yun's experience...\n \n Proof would include him speaking to me, me dying and finding myself in heaven (or hell), and other concrete proofs.\n \n Well, I hope that you don't wait until you are burning in hell (burning in sulfur if I am not mistaken) to finally believe in Him, it will be too late then...\n Believing in Him for 70 or so years and spending eternity with Him is a lot better than burning in hell for eternity... A billion years compared to eternity is essentially nothing...\n \n Sorry about the length and for any \"speling\" mistakes in this post.",

Are you saying that all car crashes aren't accidents because everything has a cause and that rules out accidents? It depends on how you define accident but there really isn't such a thing as luck or chance, for instance you roll a die and it really isn't a random number that comes up, it has to do with angle rolled, velocity rolled at, various dust on table and friction, etc. Same thing with the big bang, it wasn't by pure chance, it was because of the way it was moving.\n \n Also I could use the same argument for god, since entropy is increasing (my physics teacher told me to use it as an excuse for a messy room :) ) and energy is decreasing, eventually god will not be able to exist making him not eternal.\n \n \n\n Well, I hope that you don't wait until you are burning in hell (burning in sulfur if I am not mistaken) to finally believe in Him, it will be too late then...\n Believing in Him for 70 or so years and spending eternity with Him is a lot better than burning in hell for eternity... A billion years compared to eternity is essentially nothing...\n \n\n Well I prefer to go by what I know. I have a life to live, from what I know god seems to be made up because there's no proof. I don't know what will happen when I die so I'm going to live my life, the thing I know I have, the best I can. Just because I believe in god doesn't mean I'll be a bad person. I have already said I believe in many of the morals of the stories in the bible as good morals, I just think the stories are just stories. And I can't burn for eternity because energy in the world is decreasing :)\n \n \n\n Sorry about the length and for any \"speling\" mistakes in this post.\n\n \n don't worry about it",

   "So are you saying that god would decide to make conflicts and bad things just so people would believe in him? He allows people to die every day due to accidents they had no fault in. You're saying he kills them so that other people will believe in him? Sounds like a dictator. Why would god kill all the people in the towers on 9/11 just so people would have a need for him? And if he really wanted people to believe in him he could prove it if he wanted to.\n\n im not saying that. im saying that in a world with no conflict whatsoever, in a world of perfect peace and goodness, how would you possibly recognize the existence of peace and goodness? furthermore, without tragedy and adversity, what possible use would a intervening savior have to humans?\n \n let me clarify. i am not suggesting that an existent God imposes tragedy and adversity on people so they can recognize their need for him. im saying that the existence of t&a causes people to recognize their need for a God, or some being that is greater than the conflict. this gives them hope that the conflict can be possibly overcome, and this positive outlook actually helps them overcome their conflict. this creates a cycle of faith: conflict causes faith in God, faith causes success, success causes a reinforcement of faith\n \n the thing is, it works! and even more than that, it would work whether God existed in reality or not!\n \n so my point is, its not that God causes conflict to create a need for him. its that conflict in and of itself creates a need for God. i hope the difference makes sense",

   "Hi zachvac!\n So you're saying if I was born and taught to be a Christian, love god, never rebel, etc. (like many people do) I would live forever?  \n \n No exactly. I have done several - too many to name! - bad things. But since Jesus died for my sins (everyones) I can ask for forgiveness - if I really mean it from my heart - and be forgiven. The sin is then \"forgotten\" by God because it has been paid through the blood of His Son. You have to believe in Jesus as the Saviour and your LORD to go to Heaven as Jesus said that He is the way, the truth and the life, no one goes to the Father except through Him.\n \n And I wasn't sure about how early the bible was but there is proof that the universe is millions of years old with carbon dating and such.\n \n Actually, carbon dating is only limited to thousands of years. What you really mean are methods such as potassium-argon dating methods and so on. The article The way it really is little-known facts about radiometric dating should help clear up a few things, including the many assumptions involved in the methods. Articles such as Radioactive \"dating\" failure and others of which can be obtained from the Radiometric dating methods Q&A page will also show you how unreliable these dating methods really are. \n \n No homework??!!!! :) You just converted me to be Christian!! (just kidding)\n LOL! I wish it were that easy.\n \n \n \n Ya, I took physics last year in high school, not sure what the HSC exam is.\n The HSC stands for \"Higher Schools Certificate\". In Australia, it is the final school exam. From these marks, your UAI (University Admissions Index) mark is determined - it is basically a number that tells you if you can get into a particular university course, as the courses have UAI cutoff marks. For example, Medicine has a UAI cut off mark about 95+.\n \n (\"if you aren't good and be nice to your brother, god will flood the Earth like in the Bible\").\n \n Actually, I believe the next time He will judge the world will be by fire - so don't worry if you can't swim.\n \n OK, first of all I don't agree that the law of casualty rules out accidents. Are you saying that all car crashes aren't accidents because everything has a cause and that rules out accidents? \n \n Notice, everything  that has a beginning, has a cause  (or a purpose). Pop quiz, do car crashes have a beginning? An arguable point, but assuming so, for there to be a crash (the effect), one of the drivers involved must have done something or not have done something to result in a crash (the purpose or cause) - from my understanding of the law.\n \n It depends on how you define accident but there really isn't such a thing as luck or chance, for instance you roll a die and it really isn't a random number that comes up, it has to do with angle rolled, velocity rolled at, various dust on table and friction, etc. \n \n Tell that to Richard Dawkin (without the s at the end I think). He says quote:\n \"Allow a little bit of luck in one generation, and a little bit of luck in the next generation....\" ~ Dr Dawkin from \"From a Frog to a Prince\". If you were to pick a number between 1 and 1,000 and I was to randomly choose a number and get it on my first go - it would be by chance and what we define as luck. The odds against it would be enormous. But when you roll a dice, you don't take any of this into consideration. You do not do any measurements - generally - and as such, by chance you may get a 5, a 6, a 4, and so on. There is no real intelligence acting in such an event and as such, chance and \"luck\" come into the fray.\n \n Same thing with the big bang, it wasn't by pure chance, it was because of the way it was moving.\n \n Okay, then, how did that thing get there and why was it moving in a certain direction (into what?) with a certain velocity with a certain shape and makeup? Since there is no intelligence acting on it, the big bang explosion would have been an accident (thus violating Causality as it didn't have a cause or a purpose), radom chance and \"luck\" would then take over and \"drive\" the process as the evolutionists proclaim. \n \n Also I could use the same argument for god, since entropy is increasing (my physics teacher told me to use it as an excuse for a messy room :) ) and energy is decreasing, eventually god will not be able to exist making him not eternal.\n \n LOL! Can you remember the premises that I set out in a previous message about the reasoning standing up to scrutiny:\n * Everything which has a beginning has a cause.\n * The universe has a beginning.\n * Therefore the universe has a cause.\n The universe requires a cause because it had a beginning (as shown in previous message by Laws of Thermodynamics). God, unlike the universe, had no beginning, so does not need a cause. In addition, einstein's general relativity, which has much experimental support, shows that time is linked to matter and space. So time itself would have begun along with matter and space at the beginning of the unverse. Since God, by definition, is the creator of the whole universe, He is the creator of time. Therefore He is not limited by the time dimension He created, so He has no beginning in time. Therefore he does nt have, or need to have, a cause. The easiest way to answer your question is to state that the Bible defines God as the uncreated creator (or eternal creator) of the universe and what applies within the universe (His creation) need not apply to God, such as the Law of Causality proved above and Thermodynamics because God is \"outside\" the universe, while the two laws are clearly defined in terms of the universe.\n \n And I can't burn for eternity because energy in the world is decreasing :)\n Bad news, what applies to the universe as we know it now, doesn't apply to God and His angels (as well as our souls or spirits) and the bad guys (devil and co.) as well as the places where they reside as they are out of our universe.\n \n Hello Kronus:\n If you had 2 years of college physics you should know better than this! Yes, the entropy of a closed system never decreases. However, the earth isn't a closed system; we get huge amounts of energy from the sun. If you input energy into a system then entropy can decrease. If that weren't true, then your refrigerator wouldn't work, right? The reason that life can happen is because energy is constantly being input into the system from the sun, allowing entropy to decrease.\n \n The article titled Evolution, Creation and Thermodynamics basically destroys your argument that entropy can decrease in an open system, like the Earth. In another article titled Be skeptical about the skeptics by Dr Carl Wielnd, your argument about \"If that weren't true, then your refrigerator wouldn't work, right?\" is delt with:\n \n If energy were all that were needed to keep food fresh (or to increase the ordering in liquid water to form ice in the cube trays), why not just open the door of your refrigerator and blow in hot air with a fan heater? This is a flow of energy. Will that keep your food fresh? Hardly! Random energy pouring into a system will increase the tendency to destructurization of matter, to disorder, unless it is harnessed by a specific mechanism.\n \n The electricity for the fridge must flow into a motor, which is specifically coupled to a complex cooling mechanism programmed to function in a specific way.\n \n To put it simply, water tends to flow downhill, but it can be pumped uphill by a motor and the right machinery. In the same way, complex machines can be forced to arise from simple matter by appropriate programmed machinery (as occurs when living things make copies of themselves). But the programmed machinery cannot itself arise from non-living matter in the absence of such mechanism. To achieve that would require the direct input of mind or intelligence.\n \n The most unscientific thing one could possibly believe is that on a 'primitive earth' the complexity of a living thing arose merely by a 'flow of energy'. Every observable result of science reinforces the fact that such energy will only worsen the problem for the evolutionist, in the same way the food will become a more disorderly mess from blowing hot air towards it.\n \n Added on to this, the raw energy pouring from the sun onto the seed, for example, will produce disorder, not order, unless the seed has the highly complex photosynthetic mechanism and the direction of the genetic code. But this would only demonstrate the need for a programmed mechanism to harness and direct the random, undirected energy, which is what creationists have been saying all along. A seed growing into a plant is not analogous to the presumed evolutionary process in any case, since it involves an 'unfolding' of information which is already there in the genetic 'blueprint'. Evolution requires information and complexity to arise and keep increasing over millions of years.\n \n Therefore, we can conclude that the entropy of an open system, such as the Earth, does not decrease as you say it does. Your neat little story at the end of your quote does not work in the real world unless acted upon by intelligence.",
