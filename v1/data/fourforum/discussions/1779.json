   "I am posting this to speak out against all of the development in Banff national park and other parks around the world. I would really like to know where the government gets the balls to build massive hotels not to mention a town in a national park. This is supposed to be a place of refuge for animals, instead they are at risk in an area which should be a safe haven. When a Grizzly wanders into town and rumages through some garbage, that bear is going to be shot or rellocated. This is unacceptable since national parks are established to protect animals. The government needs to decide whether the goal of national parks are to preserve nature or make money. If I had my way I would bulldoze the Banff Springs hotel as well as the entire town of Banff (not to mention ski resorts). Banff is our oldest national park in Canada and is in the worst shape. Development here must stop!\n Imrahil",

   "Parks exists to preserve nature FOR HUMANS. Banff and other national parks are not nature refuges. They were designated as land set aside to be preserved for the enjoyment of people and future generations. The intent was to protect these areas so they could be enjoyed by all, not just \"animals\". Nature refuges that forbid human activity do exist in Canada, in fact they cover thousands of sq. kms.\n \n While I agree Banff has become too commercial, I think you've missed the point of why national parks were created.\n \n Waxy",
