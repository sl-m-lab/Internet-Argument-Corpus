   "Most Americans know that the correct answer usually lies in the middle of both extremes. That is why the Antis take whatever they can get. However a Constitutional Right compromise is a lot different. Recognizing that it is a Constitutionally recognized as protected Right, the only thing anyone has a right to ask is what is reasonable safe guards. The minimum. Not the maximum. \n \n However, even after we give them a lot more than they are actually entitled to, and now that the goal posts have been moved, they then ask yet again for a compromise. Some being extra clever, only asking for half. This allows them to have the illusion of being a moderate. The voice of reason if you will. \n \n However, even a true compromise, and not a Constitutional Right compromise would be the difference between no gun control at all and a complete ban! Not a compromise of what is left after all of this gun control! \n \n The Federal gun laws passed during the Clinton Administration.\n 1.The assault weapons ban. \n 2.The ten round magazine,\n 3.institution of the waiting period, \n 4.Brady background checks for all handgun buyers, \n 5.Excessive fees and regulations that drove many legitimate gun shop owners out of business.\n 6.Making it illegal for anyone under 18 to own or even possess a handgun. \n 7.The President's executive order stopping the importation of many guns, \n 8. Additional disqualification's and changes to legal firearms purchases on form 4473, \n 9. Insta Check! \n 10. The widening of Brady to include background checks from just handguns to include all new firearm purchases. \n 11 Lautenburg.\n and just recently the NICS improvement act!\n \n   The \"Unregulated\" Gun  \n \"Gun Laws of America is 384 pages of just the federal statutes that regulate guns-more than 88,000 words. Additionally, the associated federal regulations interpreting these laws are even larger. Minimum penalty for a violation is typically 5 years in federal prison for every offense.\n \n It is estimated that there are between 22,000 and 30,000 gun laws on the books in America. Those laws include restrictions on possession, carry, distribution, storage, transfer, manufacture, sale, ownership, importation, use and more. \n\n \n So if we were to actually do a true compromise, and not a Constitutional Compromise with the 2nd Amendment haters, most of all of this above would have to go! \n \n However, that is NOT at all what THEY mean! What they mean give me half of the Constitutionally Recognized as protected Inalienable Rights they have not taken from you yet! Then after you have done the reasonable thing,(In their reckless unconstitutional minds) then they will ask you to compromise yet again, and again, and again, and again, and again and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again.\n \n Well, you get the picture!",
