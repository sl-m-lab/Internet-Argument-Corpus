   "A short treatise illustrative of the fact that one hears what one wants to hear--I am definitely with the slaves on this:\n \n http://www.directionjournal.org/article/?966\n \n \nTHE PROVOCATIVE QUALITY OF BLACK THEOLOGY\n I had made such observations and had an early concept of their implications in mind before I encountered black theology in a systematic way a few years ago.7 But having these ideas in mind made it a startling experience to read God of the Oppressed, written by James Cone, the \"father\" of black theology.8 In some form, every point just made about a supposedly marginal theology for Mennonites is also identifiable in the development of Cone's theology.\n \n African-Americans have occupied a marginal location in North America-brought here against their will, forced to live in slavery, and still marginalized and worse by the majority white society after the Civil War supposedly resolved the slavery problem. That marginal social location gave African-Americans a different view of the classic theology of European Christendom.\n \n If slaves became Christians, they did not accept the proffered Christianity outright. When the white owners read the Bible aloud, they stressed \"Slaves, obey your masters,\" and said that a future home in heaven depended on obedience to earthly masters. Behind that warning was a theology that depicted Jesus as a spiritual savior who delivered people from sin and guilt but did not say anything about conditions in this world. This spiritual salvation could be offered to slaves by owners without challenging the master-slave relationship, and offered to supposedly free African-Americans who were still very unwelcome in white churches.\n \n But when the Bible was read, the slaves actually \"heard\" something else. They \"heard\" the Exodus as a story which placed God squarely on the side of slaves. The story thus promised that one day God would also free the African slaves in America. Slaves \"heard\" the story of Jesus who lifted up the lowly. They saw Jesus as a liberator, whose salvation included freedom from the physical bondage of slavery, and a supporter in the struggle against the continuing evils of segregation and racism in post-slavery America.\n",

   "More from the Mennonites:\n \n IMPLICATIONS AND ONGOING CONVERSATION\n But black theology also speaks to white Christians. It is a powerful challenge about the need for white Christians-including white Mennonites-to reexamine both their attitudes and their theology. Mennonites need to face that challenge if they expect to be a faithful church, a church which values ethnic and cultural diversity in a world that contains apparently increasing racial and ethnic strife. I suggest a few implications for Mennonites of the conversation with black theology.\n \n (1) We should discard the idea that the formulas of Nicene and Chalcedonian Christology and Anselmian atonement are a theological given, a kind of standard theological program that every theology should build on. The independent but parallel critiques of these classic formulas in this essay show that they have a particular orientation and social context just as surely as does black theology or a Mennonite theology. The peace church is free to read the Bible afresh and to develop new images that articulate better than Nicaea-Chalcedon-Anselm the peaceful and just reign of God made visible in the New Testament's story of Jesus.\n \n (2) Some Mennonite theologians advocate that a modern theology for Mennonites should build on the classic formulas of Christendom. But if those formulas were the best foundation for a theology that fully articulated the peaceful and just reign of God made visible in Jesus, then most western Christians would already be pacifists, and slavery and racism would not have existed among so-called Christian peoples.\n \n (3) Black theology provides a necessary reminder for contemporary Mennonites that the gospel has social dimensions and that God's salvation has social dimensions.\n \n (4) In recent years the commitment of Mennonites to peace and nonviolence has been eroding. There are many signs of a willingness to accommodate the military. But an expressed willingness for the peace church to accommodate the military ought to feel as out of place as a willingness to accommodate slavery and racism.\n \n (5) The conversation with black theology makes abundantly clear that the question of violence is not limited to the issue of pacifism and refusal of military violence. It is no mere coincidence that Cone and I articulated parallel statements about the absence of ethics in the classic formulas. Slavery, racism, and the enactment of white superiority are forms of violence just as surely as violence with guns. So are poverty, male dominance, and patriarchy. The list could continue. Concern about violence must encompass a wider range of justice issues than has been the case in the Mennonite past, and engagement with black theology makes plain that failing to deal with those issues contributes to oppression. In particular, Mennonites need to confess the extent to which our theology has been silent about racism and has thus contributed to the assumption of white superiority that permeates United States society.\n \n (6) Recognizing that violence comes in systemic forms such as racism (as well as sexism and patriarchy, poverty and more) makes clear why the principle of \"nonresistance\" is now an inadequate peace stance. Nonresistance may have meaning when it constitutes a refusal to reply to evil with another evil act. It means little, however, in the face of systemic violence such as racism or poverty. In fact, not resisting in that context is to accept the status quo and its systemic violence. To resist systemic violence may mean engaging in active nonviolent resistance. And it is the church founded on Jesus Christ, who makes visible the reign of God in history, which should be the locus of such nonviolent social change. If the church is not confronting injustice, then it is not being the church.\n \n (7) Black theology and a theology for the peace church are not identical nor even in agreement on all major points. Their conversation will be a dialogue, and sometimes an argument, among brothers and sisters. Some disagreements will concern the use of violence. And in a related area, further analysis may reveal that James Cone's understanding of the relationship of the church (as faith community) to oppressed social groups opens the door to another version of the Constantinian temptation that his theological analysis challenged so effectively.",

   "http://www.crf-usa.org/bria/bria16_2.html\n \n King Leopold of Belgium and \"The Heart of Darkness\":\n \n \nIn 1885, King Leopold II of Belgium gained a vast area in central Africa as his personal possession. His greed and the system of forced labor he imposed there prompted the first human rights movement of the 20th century.\n \n Five years after most European nations and the United States had granted colonial status to King Leopold's \"Congo Free State,\" a young merchant seaman traveled up the Congo River in a steamboat. Joseph Conrad was one of the first outsiders to witness and later write about the horrors committed by Leopold's regime in its greedy pursuit of Congo ivory and wild rubber.\n \n In 1902, Conrad published his novel, The Heart of Darkness. In this fictional story, a man much like himself travels up a river into a rain forest where he meets a European ivory trader named Kurtz. The methods Kurtz uses to force the native people to bring him the ivory elephant tusks is symbolized by his guns and a ring of poles around his house. On top of each pole is a human head.\n \n Conrad attempted to show that the \"heart of darkness\" lay deep within the Europeans who exploited the land and people of the Congo. But the full story of the Congo Free State not only involves the evil acts committed there, but also the campaign to expose them to world public opinion. . . .\n\n Portugal and the African Slave Trade:\n \n http://www.antislavery.org/breakingthesilence/slave_routes/slave_routes_portugal.shtml\n \n \nPrince Henry the Navigator, the third son of the King of Portugal, was pivotal to early Portuguese exploration, navigation and science, inspiring an \"Age of Discovery\". He helped finance and organise many expeditions across the Atlantic, such as the one in 1415 to the North and West coasts of Africa, from which he learnt about trade in spices, gold and silver. The first slaves were brought to Portugal in 1441 for Prince Henry. Initially slaves were captured through outrageous means, including kidnapping and banditry. However Prince Henry ordered a change of practice, and so trading for slaves between Africans and Europeans became the norm. \n \n Prince Henry established a slave market & fort in Arguin Bay in 1445 and they were brought back to Portugal. When a large slave auction was held in Lagos in that same year it was described by one witness as a \"terrible scene of misery and disorder\". By 1455 800 Africans were transported to Portugal annually. \n \n By the 1470s Lisbon, Portugal's capital city, became the country's main slave port. The Portuguese slave trade started then not as a trans-Atlantic trade but as an old world trade, supplying slaves to Lisbon and hence onwards to Spain and Italy. In 1539 12,000 slaves were sold in the city's markets. This differed from other European countries' experience of the trade which developed much more in their colonies. \n \n Lisbon also thrived off the businesses associated with slavery, with Portuguese goods exchanged for slaves, goods traded for slaves and goods produced by the slaves. People invested in the trade, and profited, and the Royal family took its share through taxation. African slaves were employed in a variety of occupations but increasingly they were to be found in urban employment such as domestic service.\n \n The Portugeuse explored and claimed more of the West African coast and islands, with trade being established with Ghana, Benin, Gabon, and Mali in quick succession in the 1470s. The Portuguese establish treaties with some nations, often trading weapons for slaves. This had repurcussions, leading to warfare, starvation and ultimately depopulation in some regions. \n In 1443 they were able to trade one horse for 25-30 slaves, by 1500 price of slaves rose to match the increased demand, one horse traded for 6 to 8 slaves.\n \n Bases were established on small islands off the West Coast of Africa, the most important being Cape Verde and Sao Thome. These were used for collecting slaves traded from the mainland, who were then sent to Lisbon. The development of sugar cultivation on Sao Thome provided the blueprint for the larger plantation economy of the Americas. The free black and white populations mixed and rapidly and became creolised, which was common to Portuguese colonies.\n \n The Kongo was devastated by its relationship with Portugal. First contact was in 1482 and initially the Kongolese were hopeful that it might be a beneficial relationship based on equality, and there was even an exchange of Ambassadors and the Royal family were baptised into the Catholic Church. \n",
