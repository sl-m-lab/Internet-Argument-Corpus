   "\n Senate ethics committee admonishes BurrisBy Paul Kane \n Sen. Roland W. Burris (D-Ill.) has been admonished by the Senate ethics committee for his public comments about his appointment last December to the body.\n n a three-page \"public letter of qualified admonition\" issued Friday, the committee formally reprimanded Burris for statements -- some made under oath to an Illinois legislative committee -- in which he denied trying to raise any campaign contributions for indicted former governor Rod Blagojevich for his political committees.\n Several weeks after making those statements, and after being sworn in to the Senate, Burris amended his testimony to say that he had discussed trying to gather donations for Blagojevich. \n Blagojevich appointed Burris to the Senate after being arrested by the FBI for allegedly trying to sell the seat, once held by President Obama, to the highest bidder. \n Fearful of seating anyone selected by Blagojevich, Senate leaders had made Burris's truthful testimony about the appointment before the Illinois legislature a contingency for allowing him to join the chamber in January, becoming its only African American senator. \n http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitol-briefing/2009/11/senate_ethics_committee_admoni.html?wpisrc=newsletter\n \n\n \n Officially, he has received a &#8220;letter of admonition&#8221; from the Senate. It is the mildest form of punishment they can dish out, proving once again, that we are being governed by a pack of lying thieves that are incapable of policing themselves, particularly those leading the Democratic Congress. \n A corrupt Democratic IL Governor (oh wait, that triple redundancy) is bribed by another corrupt IL Democratic politician to be appointed to a Senate seat. He perjures himself before a corrupt Democratic-controlled Subcommittee looking at his appointment so that they will not block his admission to the Senate. After being sworn in, he recants his false testimony and the corrupt Democratically-controlled Senate slaps his wrist, allowing him to keep his bribed seat in the Senate. And why did they let this occur? Because the Democratic Party has lost all semblances of morality, principle and public trust. All that matters to them now is that Burris will still provide a vote in favor of their socialist agenda. :xcensored",
