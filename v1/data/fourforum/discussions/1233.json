   "I was looking at the Libertarian Party website and guess what; Those guys agree with me.\n \n Do you think we should give foreign aid to countries?\n \n http://www.lp.org/issues/foreign-policy.html\n \n Libertarian foreign policy: Ending welfare for nations -- foreign aid\n \n BY MICHAEL TANNER \n \n Foreign aid is little more than welfare for nations -- with the same disastrous effects as domestic welfare programs. \n \n The U.S. currently spends approximately $14 billion per year on foreign aid -- far less than most people believe, but still a substantial sum. Since the end of World War II, the United States has spent more than $400 billion on aid to other countries. But there is little evidence that any of these programs has significantly improved the lives of the people in countries receiving this aid. Instead, foreign aid has typically slowed economic development and created dependence. \n \n Indeed, the U.S. Agency for International Development itself admits, \"Only a handful of countries that started receiving U.S. assistance in the 1950s and 1960s has ever graduated from dependent status.\" In fact, despite massive amounts of international aid, the average annual increase in per capita GNP has declined steadily in developing nations since the 1960s, with many of the Third World's heaviest aid recipients actually suffering negative economic growth. ...",

   "Hey it may be good now but give it a few years. You are talking the typical \"liberal speak\". You want the government to help or take care of people. You think the government is just great don't you.\n\n \n Liberal speak? I simply said you should view both the good and the bad of any situation. If you are to shield all the good or bad from any situation then the answer will appear apparent when infact you are only basing your answer on a very limited and bias information. If it is only \"liberals\" who believe you should look at both the good and the bad of any situation and try to remain unbiased then all hail liberals for they are wise indeed. However I don't believe this is the case. I don't believe this is a trait that belongs to just one type of politician.\n \n The government does help take care of people in case you haven't noticed. You are probably again only looking at the negatives and not the positives and therefore have concluded that it is only a dream that the government could possibly help a single person. So let me ask you, can you even admit that the government may have helped one person that you know in any way and can you tell me how this person was helped? Do the reverse as well and tell me how one person you know was hurt by the government just to keep this balanced.\n \n \nWhat am I talking about? There seems to always be a war going on in the Middle East. Much of the time we are supplying the weapons.\n \n You call balance one side having overwhelming power over the other? That is silly.\n\n \n I asked for specifics. Can you tell me specifically what war is constantly ongoing or were you being a little dramatic a few posts back? Supplying weapons isn't unbalancing in itself. If a room full of people get supplied weapons while they are calmly sitting down and talking is the situation anymore unbalanced now than it was a few minutes ago? I'm not suggesting that the Middle East is calmly sitting down and talking but I am suggesting that supplying weapons isn't unbalancing in itself. You have to tell me how these weapons are causing an inbalance in the Middle East.\n \n As you brought up before Israel once had to fight off a massive attack against them by several enemies on several fronts on short notice. This was not a balanced war and Israel won so you probably agree because they won the war was out of balanced in Israel's favor. At this time however they were heavily out numbered and out gunned. So are weapons the only judge of balance?\n \n Also you probably realize that the world has not has a world war in almost 60 years now and in that time the US has become a massive powerhouse of a nation along with Russia. Our two countries alone could level the entire Earth with our weapons while no other nation can come even close to being in the same league as us. So how has this massive inbalance led to almost 60 years without a massive war while the 60 years before that had 2 massive wars?\n \n \nThat is your excuse for giving taxpayer money to Israel? If you roll the dice enough the Israeli's might lose? Sure anything is possible. I really don't care if they do lose. They are not part of the US. Why do you care?\n\n \n Let say you are in 5th grade and you have a brother who is in 2nd grade. Some bullies pick on him every day but eventually quit picking on him only because they know if they do again you will be there to defend him. But why should you defend him? He isn't you and you are in far less danger if you just avoid the whole situation right? So a day comes where the 2nd grade bullies are picking on him again, do you find any reason to help him? Do you help him if he is only a friend of yours? Do you help him if he is a friend of your brothers or a friend of your friend? How about if you had never seen him before in your life?\n \n I would hope that you are willing to simply stand up for what is right and not what is easiest. Using grade school playground terminology I think Israel is the 2nd grader and the US is the 5th grader while a bunch of bullies are looking to pick him the littler Israel. I don't think it is right and having recently been picked on ourselves this 5th grader isn't about to let the bullies have free reign over Israel. This is how I view the situation. How do you view it?\n \n \nWhy would we need the Israelis'?\n\n \n Why do we need a 2nd grader? There are thousands more like them so why worry about just one? Is that what you are asking?\n \n \nAlso, just because you have free trade does not justify foreign aid. There I no reasoning there.\n\n \n You are hard to get through to sometime. We are not talking aid at all here. We are talking about things we may one day regret. We may one day regret NAFTA because it supported the Canadian economy. What if one day they become more powerful than us and turn on us. Do you think we could regret having ever been of any service to them? So should we end NAFTA now because it may one day turn on us?\n \n \nI looked back and in that quote you are referring to I did not mention 9-11. I mention cause and effect. If you smoke cigarettes there is a higher possibility you will get cancer. You cannot take taxpayer money, toss it around and expect nothing bad to come from it. According to OBL one of the two reasons for 9-11 was our support of Israel. Do you see the cause and effect?\n\n \n You also agreed that 9-11 would have happened if we stayed completely out of foreign affairs. It was not just cause and effect, it was inevitable. Cancer is not inevitable although it is likely regardless of cigarettes.\n \n How about do you see the cause and effect of the Arab nations rising up against Israel right now? They could either win or lose. If they lose they probably get nuked and world tensions rise. If they win the arabs now have nukes and many of them and world tensions rise. If Israel is simply attacked world tensions rise. Is there a cause and effect for the US pulling support from Israel? In my view there sure is but maybe you don't believe there is.\n \n \nYou want to give money away so they like us? Goodwill? Who cares if they like our government? It is not my responsibility. Plus, we seem to back some of the cruelest dictators at times. \n\n \n Goodwill would be the result of helping people who need it. I wouldn't give money just to please people but I would please people anyways as a result of my actions. It also does matter that they like our government. If they were all to hate us I can see a cause and effect happening. You seem to not want to take responsibility for anything other than yourself. I would imagine a lot of your libratarian friends do the same. It really is a selfish form of government although selfishness does lower taxes.\n \n \nWhat reasons do you favor giving taxpayer money to other countries? You personally can give money; no one is going to stop you. But why force everyone to?\n\n \n For the good of others and for ourselves. It is sort of like why people give money to the church. They do it and really get nothing in return except a goodfeeling of having helped an organization who will help others. The government does force people to do this now unlike the church but you can see how the basic principle ties into the real world. Also personally giving money is not going to always go into the right hands either. Personally giving money to Africa in general doesn't always get to the specific location it is supposed to go to. The government has more control over where the money goes and who it helps. True they should do a better job of making sure it gets where it is going. They need to reform.",

   "Liberal speak? I simply said you should view both the good and the bad of any situation. If you are to shield all the good or bad from any situation then the answer will appear apparent when infact you are only basing your answer on a very limited and bias information. If it is only \"liberals\" who believe you should look at both the good and the bad of any situation and try to remain unbiased then all hail liberals for they are wise indeed. However I don't believe this is the case. I don't believe this is a trait that belongs to just one type of politician. \n\n \n The reason it sounded like typical liberal speak is because you have this urge to help people using the government. Personally, I would like the Federal government to leave me alone and don't try to help anybody, except removing people from society that commit force or fraud (in the US only).\n \n \n The government does help take care of people in case you haven't noticed. You are probably again only looking at the negatives and not the positives and therefore have concluded that it is only a dream that the government could possibly help a single person. So let me ask you, can you even admit that the government may have helped one person that you know in any way and can you tell me how this person was helped? Do the reverse as well and tell me how one person you know was hurt by the government just to keep this balanced. \n\n \n Just because the government does try to help people does not mean I think it is right. You are right, in the long run the government can NOT help people.\n \n \nI asked for specifics. Can you tell me specifically what war is constantly ongoing or were you being a little dramatic a few posts back? Supplying weapons isn't unbalancing in itself. If a room full of people get supplied weapons while they are calmly sitting down and talking is the situation anymore unbalanced now than it was a few minutes ago? I'm not suggesting that the Middle East is calmly sitting down and talking but I am suggesting that supplying weapons isn't unbalancing in itself. You have to tell me how these weapons are causing an inbalance in the Middle East. \n\n \n Specifics. I have seen the Israeli / Palestinian conflict non-stop for decades. Besides I have seen many wars occur in the area besides that. \n \n How can there be an imbalance of weapons in the Middle East? Here is how: One side is supplied with a large quantity of weapons.\n \n \n Also you probably realize that the world has not has a world war in almost 60 years now and in that time the US has become a massive powerhouse of a nation along with Russia. Our two countries alone could level the entire Earth with our weapons while no other nation can come even close to being in the same league as us. So how has this massive inbalance led to almost 60 years without a massive war while the 60 years before that had 2 massive wars? \n\n \n There was mutual assured destruction (MAD).\n \n \n Let say you are in 5th grade and you have a brother who is in 2nd grade. Some bullies pick on him every day but eventually quit picking on him only because they know if they do again you will be there to defend him. But why should you defend him? He isn't you and you are in far less danger if you just avoid the whole situation right? So a day comes where the 2nd grade bullies are picking on him again, do you find any reason to help him? Do you help him if he is only a friend of yours? Do you help him if he is a friend of your brothers or a friend of your friend? How about if you had never seen him before in your life? \n\n \n Who is the bully? Who has the most weapons the Palestinians or the Israelis'? Should we arm the underdog? No way!\n \n \n I would hope that you are willing to simply stand up for what is right and not what is easiest. Using grade school playground terminology I think Israel is the 2nd grader and the US is the 5th grader while a bunch of bullies are looking to pick him the littler Israel. I don't think it is right and having recently been picked on ourselves this 5th grader isn't about to let the bullies have free reign over Israel. This is how I view the situation. How do you view it? \n\n \n I don't think it is right giving a second grader a gun. If the second grader then shoots people we would and should be held responsible. Or should we go in and send troops?\n \n \n Why do we need a 2nd grader? There are thousands more like them so why worry about just one? Is that what you are asking? \n\n \n Hey, if you want to go over and help people or send them money go ahead. Viewing government actions for the past few decades, I would say they backfire more times than not. Even those that don't backfire seem to at a later time. \n \n Israel, Nigeria, Columbia, Viet Nam are not part of the US. You can help them personally, but IMHO our collective should not.\n \n \n You are hard to get through to sometime. We are not talking aid at all here. We are talking about things we may one day regret. We may one day regret NAFTA because it supported the Canadian economy. What if one day they become more powerful than us and turn on us. Do you think we could regret having ever been of any service to them? So should we end NAFTA now because it may one day turn on us. \n\n \n Well, in a way I do agree with you. I think NAFTA was unnecessary. We could have just lowered Tariffs. What does concern me is the governing body that NAFTA requires, without oversight from our elected officials. I do agree NAFTA was bad there. BUT, we never needed to impose tariffs or taxes on goods. This initial government action should not have taken place. \n \n Correlating to what we are talking about<b></b>: We should not have imposed taxes in the first place then we would not need NAFTA. We should never have given aid to Israel then according to OBL 9-11 probably would not have occurred (also we should not have stationed troops in Saudi Arabia - the other reason for 9-11)\n \n \n You also agreed that 9-11 would have happened if we stayed completely out of foreign affairs. It was not just cause and effect, it was inevitable. Cancer is not inevitable although it is likely regardless of cigarettes. \n\n \n I did not say 9-11 would have happened if we did not stay out of \"foreign affairs\". I did say 9-11 happened while we were doing what YOU advocate, ie giving money to foreign countries. So \"your\" actions did not prevent 9-11.\n \n \n How about do you see the cause and effect of the Arab nations rising up against Israel right now? They could either win or lose. If they lose they probably get nuked and world tensions rise. If they win the arabs now have nukes and many of them and world tensions rise. If Israel is simply attacked world tensions rise.

It might have been sold to us originally as good intentions but this \"road to hell is paved with good intentions\" (have you heard that quote?). \n \n Yes, I think there will be negatives to pulling our support for Israel. Our politicians would probably receive less money in the form of contributions. But on the up side: It would save the taxpayer money or at least keep the money here. We would be resented less throughout the Arab world. \n \n Israel is not part of the United States. It does not concern me anymore than any other country. If you want to help, go ahead, IMHO.\n \n \n Goodwill would be the result of helping people who need it. I wouldn't give money just to please people but I would please people anyways as a result of my actions. It also does matter that they like our government.

I would imagine a lot of your libratarian friends do the same. It really is a selfish form of government although selfishness does lower taxes. \n\n \n You call me selfish because I do not favor forced charity. I contribute money besides what I pay in taxes. And yes I am selfish. No one will care for my kids like I do. You don't do you? I need to feed and shelter my kids, not the world. \n \n \n For the good of others and for ourselves. It is sort of like why people give money to the church. They do it and really get nothing in return except a goodfeeling of having helped an organization who will help others.

Personally giving money to Africa in general doesn't always get to the specific location it is supposed to go to. \n\n \n No, in fact much of the money we gave in aid to Africa went to purchasing weapons. Good point.\n \n \n The government has more control over where the money goes and who it helps. True they should do a better job of making sure it gets where it is going. They need to reform.\n\n \n They can't do a better job. This is what you don't understand. Maybe you are little young, I don't know.

   "Like I said, you can spend your money on what ever you want. I gave money to help mothers left here while their husbands are in Iraq. This is the way charity should work: voluntarily.\n\n Right. But not every person actually will spend his money on good causes. Your government knows what's good for you and your country (well.... not always, but I have faith in the good willingness of the US government). As a leading nation I think the US does have responsibility to help other nations. One of the biggest complaints the radical leftists had was the US sanctions opposed on Iraq. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi people died because of that. Let's not take that example to argue whether it was justified or not, but it shows that no one will just take his money and spend it on foreign aid.\n \n \nThis is your idea of developing relations? We have to give them money? I like the free market. I don't like spilling blood so I can save a few pennies on oil. OR I don't like taking tax money and bribing people so the consumer can save some money. \n\n Why spilling blood? The US doesn't spill blood over Egypt, Jordan, etc. It's a two way benefit. Both sides can be happy with the income.\n \n \nIt is not the taxpayer's responsibility.\n\n So you do not care that Israel could've lost in 1973? You do not care that millions of people would have been slaughtered. What about WW2? If the US could send money to Europian countries to beat Nazi Germany you wouldn't support it? That way you wouldn't even have to go to war and get killed. Just make others powerful so they'll do the job for you.\n \n Anyways, you said Israel could survive on its own. You said Israel won before US aid ever came in. I showed you that that war (1947-9) was barelly won, and Israel almost lost another war (in 1973) with American aid.\n \n \nHow about some shoes for my kids. My sons have worn hand-me downs. We have shopped at the thrift store for my daughter's dresses. Hey, if you have lots of extra money you send the government or foreign governments money. My kids are still young, so they don't seem to care. We are doing better now. But my feelings come from the decades of poverty I experienced.\n \n Mad and AMD, let me ask you both a question if you don't mind. Do you guys have kids?\n\n Do you think you will pay less tax if foreign aid will be cut? I am definately not an expert on these things and I do not know much about this stuff. But it seems to me that tax money wouldn't change.\n \n And no I don't have kids of my own. And I am only slightly mad, not totally... ;)",

   "Mad, I like your sense of humor. It almost makes me want to write a check and send it to the government, BUT I do not think \"government knows what's good for you and your country\". If fact it is the opposite. I think our elected officials are sold out to the highest bidder. \n \n Do you remember the Microsoft Anti-trust suit? Did you know Microsoft spent very little in contributions before the suit? (rhetorical - don't answer). Well, after they were sued by the justice department that all changed. They are now one of the largest contributors and the suit disappeared. \n \n I don't think MS should have been sued but it does illustrate how the government may have different motives than \"what's good for you\".\n \n PS, thanks for answering about the kids question.",

You are right, in the long run the government can NOT help people.\n\n \n I'm glad you answered this way. You have shown your true colors and anyone who wishes to see this need only refer to post #18 where you made this response. I asked several questions which you didn't answer and you blatantly have shown that you are unable to admit that the government can possible help even one person when you have to know that it is true that they have.\n \n \nSpecifics.

It is balanced now because the Israelis have the weapons to fight against these numbers.\n \n \nThere was mutual assured destruction (MAD).\n\n \n So weapons provide balance as I have shown before. The Arabs would invade Israel if not for MAD but since Israel has these weapons the Arabs won't budge. Israel would invade the Arabs if not for Russia and Europe. So basically the weapons are causing balance even in this conflict.\n \n \nWho is the bully? Who has the most weapons the Palestinians or the Israelis'? Should we arm the underdog? No way!\n\n \n The bully is anyone who tries to invade another nation. Israel has been invaded over and over by the Arabs and ever since then they have been trying to prevent it from happening again. They are the ones being bullied and there is no debate about that. BTW, why not arm the underdogs if they are the ones who will need the help the most? Also I thought you said Israel was too powerful so why are they suddenly the underdogs?\n \n \nI don't think it is right giving a second grader a gun. If the second grader then shoots people we would and should be held responsible. Or should we go in and send troops?\n\n \n We never gave the 2nd grader a gun. We gave him training in karate at most.

I can see obvious reason to help Israel as I'm sure you can see as well but just don't want to admit it (per your 2nd quote in this post). You know you are wrong in this area but are too proud to admit it. So I guess the question now becomes why do you continue to defend something that makes no sense in your own head?\n \n \nWell, in a way I do agree with you. I think NAFTA was unnecessary. We could have just lowered Tariffs. What does concern me is the governing body that NAFTA requires, without oversight from our elected officials. I do agree NAFTA was bad there. BUT, we never needed to impose tariffs or taxes on goods. This initial government action should not have taken place. \n\n \n Actually you should defend tariffs to the grave if you don't want us to somehow help another country that may one day turn on us. We should have massive tariffs in order to prevent any country from doing any business at all with us. We wouldn't want to sell someone something at a fair price if they may one day use it against us. Shouldn't that be your view?\n \n \nCorrelating to what we are talking about<b></b>: We should not have imposed taxes in the first place then we would not need NAFTA. We should never have given aid to Israel then according to OBL 9-11 probably would not have occurred (also we should not have stationed troops in Saudi Arabia - the other reason for 9-11)\n\n \n If we had just isolated ourselves from the world completely we could live in harmony. Lock down all borders and let no one in just in case we may regret letting them in later. Don't talk to the UN or NATO or any other country as me may regret talking to them later. Just how far are you willing to let your paranoia about regreting a future event go anyways?\n \n \nI did not say 9-11 would have happened if we did not stay out of \"foreign affairs\". I did say 9-11 happened while we were doing what YOU advocate, ie giving money to foreign countries. So \"your\" actions did not prevent 9-11.\n\n \n My actions have prevented another 9-11. You basically have no evidence of what \"your\" actions could do as no one has ever attempted \"your\" actions.\n \n \nMy opinion: We should have never given money away in the first place. It might have been sold to us originally as good intentions but this \"road to hell is paved with good intentions\" (have you heard that quote?).\n \n Yes, I think there will be negatives to pulling our support for Israel. Our politicians would probably receive less money in the form of contributions. But on the up side: It would save the taxpayer money or at least keep the money here. We would be resented less throughout the Arab world. \n \n Israel is not part of the United States. It does not concern me anymore than any other country. If you want to help, go ahead, IMHO.\n\n \n Lets assume what you are saying here was the policy of the government before WWII. You are the president and the Nazi's are beginning to take control of Europe. You stayed so isolated that the Japanise never felt that the US was a threat so Pearl Harbor never happened. It is 1942 and England is about to fall and needs our help just as China is begging for help. China and England are not part of the US so does it concern you what is happening there as long as Germany and Japan don't do any physical harm to the US? Do you keep taxes low and not build up our military even if you don't plan on helping the fight overseas? This is the ultimate failure of your system of thinking. When something like this should happen you will have no good answer. Either you will go back on everything you have said and join the fight or you will sit back and await the fall of your nation and government. But based on your response to my previous questions I really don't expect that you would answer these questions either.\n \n \nYou call me selfish because I do not favor forced charity. I contribute money besides what I pay in taxes. And yes I am selfish. No one will care for my kids like I do. You don't do you? I need to feed and shelter my kids, not the world. \n\n \n I call you selfish because of quotes like \"Israel is not part of the United States. It does not concern me anymore than any other country\". You basically state that the fall of Israel would not be your concern. The nukes that Israel would use during their fall against the Middle East would not be your concern. You simply would not care what is happening as long as it does not directly affect you. That is why I call you selfish. As for your kids analogy, I care more for others than you do as I care that Israel is not invaded and that people don't have to die in a bloody war there. You don't care at all. I know I care that your kids get fed and have shelter just as I care that Canadian kids get fed and have shelter. You probably simply stop your caring once you reach our Northern border if not sooner.\n \n \nNo, in fact much of the money we gave in aid to Africa went to purchasing weapons. Good point.\n\n \n Exactly. Reform is necessary!\n \n \nThey can't do a better job. This is what you don't understand. Maybe you are little young, I don't know. The government is not as good at the private sector and never will be.\n\n \n They can't or won't? Of course they can do a better job but just don't know how to handle tracking where their money gets spent so therefore they just won't do this.\n \n If you don't believe that our government is good for our private sector then what do you believe is good for our private sector? The US didn't just become #1 in the world because we are the \"United States\". The government set up our economic system long before you were born. They set up our military defense which has protected us from invasion for hundreds of year. The government has looked out for the interests of our children and helped define what America is for centuries. You are basically stating that if the government never existed that our private sector would be better than it is now. Frankly that is idiotic. You also fail to tell me what libritarian government would be able to do in the time of a crisis. List off a few crisis's that you can forsee happening to the US within the next 50 years and let me know how the libritarian government will handle these crisis's better than our current government. I do hope you have the ability to provide an good response to this.",

You are afraid and feel the solution is to give taxpayer money away. \n \n \n My actions have prevented another 9-11. You basically have no evidence of what \"your\" actions could do as no one has ever attempted \"your\" actions. \n\n \n You can not prove your actions have prevented another 9-11. 9-11 did happen with your plan of meddling in place. You cannot deny 9-11 happened.\n \n \n Lets assume what you are saying here was the policy of the government before WWII. You are the president and the Nazi's are beginning to take control of Europe. You stayed so isolated that the Japanise never felt that the US was a threat so Pearl Harbor never happened. It is 1942 and England is about to fall and needs our help just as China is begging for help. China and England are not part of the US so does it concern you what is happening there as long as Germany and Japan don't do any physical harm to the US? Do you keep taxes low and not build up our military even if you don't plan on helping the fight overseas? This is the ultimate failure of your system of thinking. When something like this should happen you will have no good answer. Either you will go back on everything you have said and join the fight or you will sit back and await the fall of your nation and government. But based on your response to my previous questions I really don't expect that you would answer these questions either.\n\n \n You somehow believe a country or two can take over the world and control it. You are mistaken. No country can do this. We are in the best position of any country throughout history to do so and we get bogged down trying to control just a few or one for an EXTENED PERIOD OF TIME.\n \n The only method of controlling a country is to kill all of the inhabitants. We cannot control Iraq until all inhabitants have perished (control indefinably that is). So until you are ready to genocide populations, we will never win. This is the failure of YOUR system. \n \n \n I call you selfish because of quotes like \"Israel is not part of the United States. It does not concern me anymore than any other country\". You basically state that the fall of Israel would not be your concern. The nukes that Israel would use during their fall against the Middle East would not be your concern. You simply would not care what is happening as long as it does not directly affect you. That is why I call you selfish. As for your kids analogy, I care more for others than you do as I care that Israel is not invaded and that people don't have to die in a bloody war there. You don't care at all. I know I care that your kids get fed and have shelter just as I care that Canadian kids get fed and have shelter. You probably simply stop your caring once you reach our Northern border if not sooner. \n\n \n Oh, because Israel has nukes we have to give them taxpayer money? You are silly.\n \n You say I \"don't care at all\". Quit making things up to support your flimsy arguments. I said I don't care anymore about Israel than other countries.\n \n \n Exactly. Reform is necessary! \n\n \n Typical liberal answer: Oh lets not do away with the program, lets reform it. We have trying to reform it for decades. You are afraid your whole socialist house of cards will collapse.\n \n \n They can't or won't? Of course they can do a better job but just don't know how to handle tracking where their money gets spent so therefore they just won't do this.\n \n If you don't believe that our government is good for our private sector then what do you believe is good for our private sector? \n\n \n FREE enterprise is good for the private sector. Socialism kills the private sector. Government interference kills the private sector. Regulations hurt small businesses more than large ones. This probably went right over your head though. When you grow up you will understand, hopefully.\n \n \n The US didn't just become #1 in the world because we are the \"United States\". The government set up our economic system long before you were born. They set up our military defense which has protected us from invasion for hundreds of year. The government has looked out for the interests of our children and helped define what America is for centuries. You are basically stating that if the government never existed that our private sector would be better than it is now. \n\n \n Blah Blah Blah. We are successful because of freedom. Compare Hong Kong to China, East and West Germany, North and South Korea. What is the difference? Freedom. \n \n \n Frankly that is idiotic. You also fail to tell me what libritarian government would be able to do in the time of a crisis. List off a few crisis's that you can forsee happening to the US within the next 50 years and let me know how the libritarian government will handle these crisis's better than our current government. I do hope you have the ability to provide an good response to this.\n\n \n You do the same with your philosophy.\n \n My goal would be to NOT BE A TARGET. If we do not entangle ourselves in foreign wars and meddling there would be less resentment. After all, according to OBL, it was resentment that caused 9-11 (our money to Israel and troops in Saudi Arabia). NOW AMD, what is your solution for eliminating the resentment for the next 50 years?",

   "This discussion has become quite involved AMD. It is hard to read your post and not respond. When I started reading your posts in this forum I thought you were conservative. I was mistaken. I still respect your opinion. \n \n I am sure there are things I have said that you disagree with. You will want to respond. Go ahead. I might respond to your post, or may not.\n \n I am trying to figure out what our fundamental difference is. Very rarely do I wan the government to fix something. I don't want the governments help per se. I do want local governments to provide police and fire protection. I do want the states to build roads with money collected from a gas tax. \n \n As for the Federal Government: Many members of the Libertarian Party do not feel the need for a standing army. They feel if we are ever invaded, everyone grab their guns and fight. Personally, I have favored a standing army. I do understand why they don't though. They feel our government will use a standing army to invade and kill people in other countries. \n \n Back to foreign aid: I feel most government programs become corrupted and I favor very few. To me Israel is just like any other country, IMHO, they just lobby better. \n \n Footnote: Your philosophy reminds me of mine when I graduated high school. Over the past few decades it has changed. I attribute my early socialist thoughts to socialist programming in a socialist school system. I thought government was \"good\". Now I realize we would all be better off without public education.",

   "I think that until we have solved our own problems at home, giving money to third parties is a misguided act. Americans pay taxes that support our government. Until every American is taken care of, I don't feel our government has the right to give away our tax money.\n \n As far as israel goes, people have pointed out earlier in the thread that without our foreign aid, they could simply not survive. To me, this is the argument for discontinuing aid to israel. If a nation cannot survive except ont he generousity of america, thewy should not survive as a nation. Why should we pump billion a year into a country taht cannot survive on its own? If we are going to do that, we may as well make them a 51st state.",
