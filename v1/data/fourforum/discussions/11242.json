   "Is physical education really necessary for all kids? I have had to take a seven period day and summer school just so I can complete my PE requirement. I find this quite ridiculous. I am a healthy male teenager. I do four hours a week of intense martial arts, 6 hours, soon to be 10 of rigorous dancing (show choir) a week, and I play tennis with my friends a couple of times a week. Is PE really necessary for kids like me? I have already passed the California (where I live) fitness test. I got a 99% in PE this year.\n \n Do kids like me really Physical Education? I would do just fine without it. Just so I can do choir and spanish (foreign language is a requirement for UC campuses), I wake up an hour earlier and take a class at 7:00am. In my opinion, I would be much healthier getting an extra hour of sleep than running around a track. This year, I got into the top choir. I really want to be in this choir, however it is two periods in the day, 0 period (the 7:00 one), and first period. This used to count at PE, because we do run around the school, and dance a lot. All of the kids in Powerhouse passed the California fitness test. However this year, they stopped that. Therefore, I have to waste my summer at another high school (the one that is offering the PE course) just so I can get my credits. They wont even let me take one semester this summer, and one the next (successfully completing four semesters of the required PE). They claim it is against the ed code, and that I am required to be enrolled in a PE class this year. I find this complete BS. I am a healthy individual who does not need PE, and there are many other kids like me. Why then, must I take MORE PE? Is it because it wouldn't be fair to the other kids? This doesn't seem fair to me. Why should I suffer for kids that are not physically fit. I agree that some kids need it, but there are kids that don't, and they should be exempt from the PE requirement as long as they pass the fitness test.\n \n Why should PE be required for very healthy kids, especially if it interferes with academics and extra curricular activities?",

   "First, let me state my opinion--Physical Education as a requirement is ridiculous. If a student chooses to take it out of his or her's own choice, then more power to him or her. I was forced from 1st through 8th grade to take \"gym\" and I was technically required to take it once in high school. \n \n I am not athletic. I enjoy watching sports and playing sports from time to time, and I also workout at the gym around 3 times a week, so I don't hate physical activity. What bothers me is the fact that some people are born jocks and others do not want to be forced to display their lack of athleticsim in front of those \"jocks\". Not to mention that the only reason they probably forced us to take PE in primary school was to get our excess \"kid\" energy out before going back to the classroom. \n \n The funniest part about gym requirements to me is that it doesnt have much to do with learning. Yes, you learn teamwork and how to kick a ball or play tennis, but can't you learn those things when you join leagues optionally? \n \n When my high school advisor was helping me graduate, she checked me off for PE class when I had not even taken it. Shows how much of a priority it is... \n \n I was never the best player or runner as everyone else, but i tried. Looking back now, I think the fact that it was mandatory made it ridiculous, not the class itself.",

   "Honestly I teach junior high and those kids are so ansy sometimes that I think gym is probably good for a lot of them to just get it out of their system. What would be awesome though would be if their was more of a variety of choices in gym classes. Unfortunately that would probably require more gym teachers because the class sizes right now for gym are ridiculous. My colleagues that teach PE usually have class sizes of about 50 to 60 kids at a time. I think high school is better because you can choose different sports to do. My high school had a ton of choices so I was happy that I didn't have to do some of the other sports. I hated the regular gym classes.",

   "I would say it should be required, mostly because its fun, and to lock students into chairs all day, is torture.\n \n They must be let loose, to use up their abundant energy, and be allowed to grow accustomed to activity and to enjoy it, so as to develop good habits of behavior, meaning exercise.\n \n Some students, should however be allowed to get an exemption, if they themselves can show that they are involved in other physical activity, such as martial arts, or sports, etc.. in their personal lives.\n \n But those who cannot show this evidence of activity, are as human beings, as animals, in need of exercise, simply for the sake of their health, and the relaxation of their minds.\n \n \n Personally, I think the idea of schools without recess for games and sports to be horrable, as there is much to learn from games, and sports.... such as sportsmanship... playing fair, and overcoming fears of challenges.\n \n -Mosheh thezion",

   "Of course its necessary! It teaches sportsmanship, team work, good healthy competativeness, it teaches how to follow rules, it also helps them burn off some energy, frustration, and it even keeps them physically fit. \n \n If you haven't noticed, there is a rise in obese and overweight. Children are sitting in front of tv's, computers, video games and not gettin the exercise they need. \n A lot of parents do not or can't make the time to have their kids exercise on their own.",
