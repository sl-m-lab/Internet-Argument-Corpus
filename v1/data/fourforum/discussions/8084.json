   "From CNN (emphases mine):\nLesbians' brains react differently to sex hormones than those of heterosexual women.\n \n An earlier study of gay men also showed their brain response was different from straight men -- an even stronger difference than has now been found in lesbians.\n \n Lesbians' brains reacted somewhat, though not completely, like those of heterosexual men, a team of Swedish researchers said in Tuesday's edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n \n A year ago, the same group reported findings for gay men that showed their brain response to hormones was similar to that of heterosexual women.\n \n In both cases the findings add weight to the idea that homosexuality has a physical basis and is not learned behavior.\n \n \"It shows sexual orientation may very well have a different basis between men and women ... this is not just a mirror image situation,\" said Sandra Witelson, an expert on brain anatomy and sexual orientation at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.\n \n \"The important thing is to be open to the likely situation that there are biological factors that contribute to sexual orientation,\" added Witelson, who was not part of the research team.\n \n The research team led by Ivanka Savic at the Stockholm Brain Institute had volunteers sniff chemicals derived from male and female sex hormones. These chemicals are thought to be pheromones -- molecules known to trigger responses such as defense and sex in many animals.\n \n Whether humans respond to pheromones has been debated, although in 2000 American researchers reported finding a gene that they believe directs a human pheromone receptor in the nose.\n \n The same team reported last year on a comparison of the response of male homosexuals to heterosexual men and women. They found that the brains of gay men reacted more like those of women than of straight men.\n The new study shows a similar, but weaker, relationship between the response of lesbians and straight men.\n \n Heterosexual women found the male and female pheromones about equally pleasant, while straight men and lesbians liked the female pheromone more than the male one. Men and lesbians also found the male hormone more irritating than the female one, while straight women were more likely to be irritated by the female hormone than the male one.\n \n All three groups rated the male hormone more familiar than the female one. Straight women found both hormones about equal in intensity, while lesbians and straight men found the male hormone more intense than the female one.\n \n The brains of all three groups were scanned when sniffing male and female hormones and a set of four ordinary odors. Ordinary odors were processed in the brain circuits associated with smell in all the volunteers.\n \n In heterosexual males the male hormone was processed in the scent area but the female hormone was processed in the hypothalamus, which is related to sexual stimulation. In straight women the sexual area of the brain responded to the male hormone while the female hormone was perceived by the scent area.\n \n In lesbians, both male and female hormones were processed the same, in the basic odor processing circuits, Savic and her team reported.\n \n Each of the three groups of subjects included 12 healthy, unmedicated, right-handed and HIV-negative individuals.\n \n The research was funded by the Swedish Medical Research Council, Karolinska Institute and the Wallenberg Foundation.\n http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/05/08/lesbian.brains.ap/index.html",

   "Ok, I believe that you aren't trying to do that now. I just see it so often and it really bothers me.\n You're right, even though I hinted at my thoughts about this, I didn't directly say anything that added to the discussion. Sorry 'bout that.\n What I really meant by saying that I find this boring, was that I don't think it is the most important issue. However, I do understand where you are coming from and why it can be a potentially very important argument if it is really the case. But another part of me says that if you could prove today beyond a reasonable doubt that homosexuality was 100% genetic, the fundamentalist that are arguing against it now would still be arguing against it. We see that so clearly when it comes to things like evolution. On the other hand, it probably would convince a lot of fence sitters, so it is important. I guess what I should have said was I don't think this is the most important issue in terms of winning support. Nonetheless, I still find it fascinating and would like to continue discussing it.\n \n emoticon_xgood \n \n Incidentally, re: \"proof\"... science never \"definitively proves\" ANYTHING. And we're talking math to physics to chemistry to biology to cosmology to... well, you name it. The very NATURE of scientific investigation (unlike religion, which claims absolute certainty) is based on falsifiability, and everything we know is subject to constant re-examination and testing. All we can ever do is come as close as we can to the \"truth\" of something--we never know it absolutely. It's like peeling an onion with no center... you just keep peeling.\n \n The fact that you never reach the center, however, in no way invalidates the existence of the onion. Much less proves that it must be a radish instead.",

In terms of the evidence presented here and other similar evidence, like I said in a previous post, I do not believe it is solid evidence for a genetic basis. I'm not saying it's not out there and I'm not saying it is, I'm simply saying that I don't believe this is it.",
