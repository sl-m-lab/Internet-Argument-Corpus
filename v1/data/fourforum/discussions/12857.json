   "The music industry does like to insist that filesharing - aka illegal downloading - is killing the industry: that every one of the millions of music files downloaded each day counts as a \"lost\" sale, which if only it could somehow have been prevented would put stunning amounts of money into impoverished artists' hands. And, of course, music industry bosses' wallets. But we won't mention that.\n \n Take the story that appeared in this paper last week:\n  At least 7 million people in Britain use illegal downloads, costing the economy billions of pounds and thousands of jobs, according to a report.\n \n Shared content on one network was worth about \u00a312bn a year according to the research commissioned by the Strategic Advisory Board for Intellectual Property.\n \n David Lammy, minister for intellectual property, said: \"Illegal downloading robs our economy of millions of pounds every year and seriously damages business and innovation throughout the UK. \"It is something that needs tackling, and we are serious about doing so.\"\n Well, up to a point, minister. Ben Goldacre took apart the rather dodgy calculations behind the claims on Saturday.\n \n But it left me wondering. Why does the music industry persist in saying that every download is a lost sale? If you even think about it, it can't be true. People - even downloaders - only have a finite amount of money. In times gone by, sure, they would have been buying vinyl albums. But if you stopped them downloading, would they troop out to the shops and buy those songs?\n \n I don't think so. I suspect they're doing something different. I think they're spending the money on something else.\n \n What else, I mused, might they be buying? Hmm... young.. like the entertainment industry... ah, how about computer games and DVDs? Thus began a hunt for the figures for UK sales of games and of DVDs and of music to see if there was any consistent relationship between them. And since this was about filesharing, it seemed sensible to analyse it since 1999 - when Napster started and blew up the CD business model.\n \n (It's surprising how hard it was to find these statistics. You'd think someone like ELSPA, the European Leisure Software Publishers' Association, would have them. Nope: instead initially I had to track them via press releases. The BPI, representing British record labels, said that it didn't have numbers going back before 2004, which seemed a bit 1984-ish to me; it turns out the BPI doesn't like to release those figures because it changed the methodology for recording sales in 2004, effectively reducing the number. At least DVD data are easily obtained from the British Video Association and the UK Film Council. Thank you.)\n \n The first clue of where all those downloaders are really spending their money came in searching for games statistics: year after year ELSPA had hailed \"a record year\". In fact if you look at the graph above, you'll see that games spend has risen dramatically - from \u00a31.18bn in 1999 to \u00a34.03bn in 2008.\n \n Meanwhile music spending (allowing for that * of adjustment in 2004 onwards) has gone from \u00a31.94bn to \u00a31.31bn.\n \n DVD sales and rentals, meanwhile, have nearly doubled, from a total of \u00a31.286bn in 1999 to \u00a32.56bn in 2008.\n \n If we assume that there's roughly the same amount of discretionary spending available (which, even allowing for the credit bubble, should be roughly true; most of the credit went into houses), then it's clear who the culprit is: the games industry. By 2009, the amount spent in games and music is almost exactly the same as 1999 (though note that the music industry changed its methods from 2004).\n \n Yes, downloaders aren't spending money on the music industry, and in that way they are hurting it. But I'd argue that the true volume of \"lost\" sales is nowhere near the claims made. Assume that music couldn't be copied (as many games can't). I don't think that the volume of music sales would equate to all those downloads. At best, it would be \u00a3600m larger.\n \n But the reality is that nowadays, one can choose between a game costing \u00a340 that will last weeks, or a \u00a310 CD with two great tracks and eight dud ones. I think a lot of people are choosing the game - and downloading the two tracks. That's real discretion in spending. It's hurting the music industry, sure. But let's not cloud the argument with false claims about downloads.\n\n Are downloads really killing the music industry? Or is it something else? | Technology | guardian.co.uk\n \n In today's world, you can download DVD quality video, as well as downloading hacked game files that you can play on your video game platforms (sometimes after applying the appropriate hack).\n \n Yet game sales and DVD sales go up.\n The real problem with music sales is like other industries that are experiencing a decline because people have a taste for something else.\n \n But for the record, I'm not saying illegally downloading music, DVDs, or games is okay.\n I'm saying that the profit change for the music industry cannot be blamed on music pirates.",

   "I think the perception of music sharing is also a lot different than DVDs or video games. A lot of people with MP3 players, portable hard drives, USB drives, etc. load them up with music and share them with friends. It's really easy. Songs are short and don't take up a lot of space. I think people perceive sharing music as \"less wrong\" or not even wrong at all.\n \n With DVDs, you generally have to burn a copy. There's a different perception there. You are copying something onto a physical disk and giving it to somebody else. Movies are big productions and I think people feel more like they are stealing something when they do this, although DVD copying still seems pretty widespread.\n \n As for video games, that's a totally different ball game. The only video games that are really susceptible to copying are single player PC games. You can't copy online games because you have to register your copy with the server in order to play. I know you could play pirated games on the PS2 by using a mod chip, but that required taking apart the console and soldering, a feat that most console gamers are not going to undertake, especially when they still will only be able to play pirated single player games. I'm not sure if the same thing exists for the PS3. In general though, most console gamers are not going to be willing to dismantle their system just to play a couple crappy pirated games.\n \n PS - Regular, non-game PC software pirating is huge though.",

   "I don't see the problem getting any better since everything is digital now and enforcing law is dam near impossible and maybe even pointless.\n \n I think it spells death for the old way and probably fantastic success for the new way but I don't quite know what the new way is going to look like at this point.\n \n I think a big part of what we are hearing about is the old guard saying it doesn't want to become extinct but sure as the sunrise they will.\n \n Does that mean we will not have music anymore?\n \n I doubt it.",
