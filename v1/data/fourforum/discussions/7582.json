   "I'm pro-life and I'm non-religious.emoticon_xgood \n \n I don't mind sharing the cause with the religious, I'm easy going. But sometimes I wonder that when people interject GOD into the abortion issue, I think many neutral-minded people turn a deaf ear because they don't want to hear about religion, they want to hear about the FACTS, like I do.\n \n I feel many facts are going unheard from credible people because they place religion in the situation.\n \n On average a million babys go aborted in the US. Does anyone wonder where these discarded babies go? Valuable tissue that has a price tag. Valuable tisse that promise priceless research capabilities. Are aborted fetus and embryos the staple of the research industry? For the political pro-choicers, is this a critical reason to keep abortion legal? Has anyone noticed that pro-choicers never asked the question where these discarded babies go. It's very disheartening, but I feel the political pro-choicers, are misguiding the neutral pro-choicers, who are willing to listen with an open-mind. I think if all the facts were laid on the table for all to see, we wouldn't like what we've become.\n \n The stories, I've read from nurses, doctors, patients. I know many pro-choicers will think they ALL are a hoax, but think about our society and the things we do know about our humanity. In america alone, kids are raped, and killed, we have documented human trafficking, we have documented black-market organ trafficking, stem-cell research is limited, but do you think people are following the rules?\n \n Is there another reason why Abortion is important to stay legal? Is it really about the woman and her \"choice\". Both sides of the issue, I hope are asking these questions.\n \n If a family member of mine died, and later I found out that he was never buried but used for organ and tissue transplant, I would be angered. I hope abortionist are not taking this babies without the knowledge of the mother and selling them for research or for products. \n \n Would pro-choicers be angry if selling of these babies were happening?",

   "I actually I did know where a lot go, but I'd consider it the same as organ donation, or more closely leaving your body to medicine. Are people horrified at the idea that someone might get a heart transplant? A lot of cancer ends up in labs as well which is why I think this occurs - the hospital owns tissue that you ask them to remove (which is generally a nessesity with regards to tests and suchlike, especially on patients brought there unconcious to be treated). Cancer is an odd case and has been challenged in court as some cell lines have been quite profitable for the owners (and many have out lived their original hosts, even after they have been cured).\n \n I'm not totally up to speed on the precise policies (it differs from country to country and even hospital to hospital) and I wouldn't really object if there was perhaps a bit more control with regard to abortion - an extra form at most would be all it needs.\n \n Think the trouble comes down to it being fairly unpleasant medical waste - feti aren't pretty at the best of times, less so when aborted. Having to deal with the remains yourself is going to be an added stress that most people probably don't need or want. \n \n Staple of the research industry? Not at all, some particular fields perhaps i.e those dealing with human developmental biology, but even then unless its something specific you're looking at animal models are still more efficient.\n \n \nThe stories, I've read from nurses, doctors, patients.

In america alone, kids are raped, and killed, we have documented human trafficking, we have documented black-market organ trafficking, stem-cell research is limited, but do you think people are following the rules?\n \n This bit confuses me, kids are not raped and killed for research purposes, nor organ harvested (most transplantees arn't going to want small organs not to mention the difficultly in finding a match beforehand anyway)",

There are many of these, but murder is an obvious example.\n\n \n Murder laws are not based on faith\n Our democracy is based on the realization of our founders, that no evidence supports the claim (made by such people as King George III) that some people are naturally born with more inherent authority than other people. Because of the lack of evidence supporting such a claim, we must assume no special authority for anyone, and by default assume that all people are created with the same inherent authorities - defined in our constitution as \"rights\". This reality-based idea is the basis for the passage of \"murder\" laws that prevent you from assuming the authority to rob from me my right to life.\n \n Also, there's a difference between laws informed by faith, and laws based on faith. In the abortion issue, you are making an assertion about reality that is unproven, and then you are making a law based on that assertion of faith. \n \n \n \n2) To completely forbid religious faith from effecting the law would necessitate that we prohibit anyone who has any religious faith from voting.\n\n \n Absolutely not. We all have beliefs that are religious in nature. We're all expected to vote our conscience. Faith-based ideas can, and do, become constitutionally valid laws. Likewise, laws informed by none-sense can, and do, get passed by the will of the majority all the time.
