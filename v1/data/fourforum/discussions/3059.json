   "All this GetGreen and Environmental Defense **** is stupid. ED complains about the waste of fuel, lots of pollution and all that ****. Guess what, they have a website. Hmm let's see how their website gets seen:\n \n Power Plant - < Web + DNS + Application Servers\n Power Plant - < Visitors' Homes\n Power Plant - < WAN Routers (loadsa power)\n \n Web Server < DNS Server and WAN Router < ISP < Visitor Computers\n \n Guess what power plants use? FUEL\n What do power plants make? electricity and \"POLLUTION\"\n \n If you are really concerned about the environment, then...\n Why do you fly on airplanes (they use fuel and make pollution)?\n Why do you use shipped products (in most cases they are transported by ship that causes \"pollution\" and uses TONS of fuel)?\n Why do you drive cars (fuel, pollution, noise)?\n \n Terms used in this post that some may not understand:\n NM: Nautical Mile 6076FT\n KT(S): Knots or Nautical Miles/Hour 1.15MPH\n RCL: Royal Caribbean International\n EPA: Evironmental Protection Agency\n Starboard: (you know) right\n Port: (you know) left\n Fore(ward): Front of a ship\n Aft: Rear of a ship\n Freeboard: The distance from the water line to the main deck\n Draft: The distance from the waterline to the keel\n LWL: Length of waterline\n LOA: Length overall\n PPM: Parts per million\n GetGreen: Some environmental organization\n \n What I really want to talk about is the Greenies' claim that cruise/merchant ships \"hurt\" the environment by dumping too much waste into the sea. Guess what? There are many regulations about this -- too many. All vessels may only dump 12NM from th shore. Why? To keep **** from washing up on the shore. By the way Royal Caribbean International takes extra precautions that exceed Coast Guard and EPA or whatever standards. For example, for restaurant and hotel wastes, RCL only discharges food waste beyond 12NM if need be. If not, they incinerate it and land it ashore. Regulations state that, crushed glass (uggghhh), paper ashes, and crushed cans and ground food can be discharged at 12NM.\n Used lube oil and fuel sludge is NEVER discharged at sea.\n RCL only discharges bilge water that is 5ppm or lower UNDERWAY. Some voyages, it is never discharged but kept in a holding tank. Regulations state that up to 15ppm can be discharged while underway.\n RCL physically removes all plastics from blackwater. The blackwater that is to be dumped IS TREATED and is dumped w/ the ships speed at 6KTS (6.904MPH/11.111KPH) beyond 12NM. Regulations state that it may be disharged UNTREATED beyond 12NM.\n Finally, RCL discharges gray water at 6KTS (6.904MPH/11.111KPH) beyond 12NM. Regulations state that it can be discharged anywhere.\n I am sure other cruise lines go the extra mile like RCL.\n For details on RCL's policy, goto http://www.royalcaribbean.com/images/pdf/2001_Environmental_Rpt.PDF.\n \n This is what the greens aka tree worshippers say:\n \n \nThe cruise ship industry is undergoing unprecedented\n expansion in California, with a 67% increase in cruise\n ship traffic between 1990 and 1998, and more than 50\n new cruise ships scheduled to come into service over the\n next four years. Cruise ships can generate up to 37,000\n gallons of oily bilge water; 30,000 gallons of sewage;\n 255,000 gallons of non-sewage wastewater; 15 gallons of\n toxic chemicals, tens of thousands of gallons of ballast\n water, and seven tons of garbage per day. At present, no\n federal regulatory agency is required to monitor the waste\n or receiving waters to see whether on-board treatment\n devices meet water quality regulations. Sewage from\n cruise ships is not regulated to the same standards as onland\n sewage treatment facilities. Gray water, which comes\n from galleys, laundries, baths and showers, can be disposed\n of anywhere in the ocean. Gray water from cruise\n ships contains pollutants such as fecal coliforms, food\n wastes, oil and grease, detergents, shampoos, and cleaners.\n\n Most of that paragraph is incorrect. I could bet the author doesn't even know port from starboard, fore from aft, freeboard from draft, and LWL from LOA.\n \n NEXT:\n \n \n\"Coastal pollution can come from direct discharges (\"point\n sources\") and runoff from land-based activities (\"nonpoint\n source pollution\"). Point sources of pollution include\n municipal treatment plants, power plants, desalination\n plants, vessel discharges (including from cruise ships),\n and stormwater outfall pipes. The MBNMS, which stretches\n along 300 miles of coastline from Marin County in the\n north to San Luis Obispo County in the south, is particularly\n vulnerable to both types of pollution. The GFNMS\n touches fewer miles of coastline than MBNMS but suffers\n contamination from waters exiting San Francisco Bay and\n running off Marin County. The CBNMS does not adjoin\n land but is still susceptible to plumes of contaminated\n runoff, which can float on top of the heavier seawater and\n extend 25 or more miles offshore. Oil spills and other pollution\n from ships pose threats to all three sanctuaries.\"\n\n Whatever. A vague attempt.\n \n Conclusion:\n 1. Cruise ships are not hurting the environment as much as the greenies are wasting time, money, and resources.\n 2. If you complain about fuel then live in a teepee and walk everywhere.\n 3. If you complain about pollution, don't use chemicals, factory made products, or fly on airplanes.\n \n This is not a rant. Please send all hate-mail to my PM.\n /bin/hate < /home/jordanf/mail\n or better yet...\n /bin/hate < /dev/null",

   "Nothing you said disputes this quote: \"At present, no\n federal regulatory agency is required to monitor the waste\n or receiving waters to see whether on-board treatment\n devices meet water quality regulations.\"\n \n Their goal is to get a federal angency created or invloved. If the regulations aren't being enforced, how are we to know they are being followed? Just because RCL says they more than meet regulations doesn't mean they do. I don't understand your blind trust in a corporation.",
