Instead of gender, their sexual attractions are based primarily on age. These individuals are attracted to children, not to men or women. \n \n I have looked at several threads today, and have seen you addressing this issue on at least 5 of them.

Please help me figure out how i should do this.... Thank you so much for you time!\n\n \n Hun, being ex Navy here and 21 I know how you feel. Except alot worse. I was outed and then beaten by four other sailors because I'm Gay. I wasn't even open about it! And yet, I had my head cracked open and almost died from my injuries. \n \n Sadly we see people Like Dan Choi who was open, get discharged for being openly gay in the military. and then sailors like August Provost who was murdered for being gay. You have two choices but they both will be painful. The first, is to stay in. Live a double life, and continue to feel guilt for who you are. And yet maintain employment and be able to send money how to your partner. Until Obama or someone puts a stay on discharges for gay servicemen, your partner will have no rights or entitlements at all sadly.\n \n And to be honest, these double talking ####### in washington won't do anything serious anytime soon. So I wouldnt hold your breath on seeing DADT repealed.\n \n The second option is of course to admit your openly gay and be discharged. I'm not exactly sure what discharge you would recieve but I would think it would be Admin Seperation. It's neither honorable nor dishonorable but in the middle.\n \n I was lucky I got a Honorable discharge because of medical reasons. Since I now have PTSD and my chief went to bat for me and got me my full discharge. Of course I had to keep quiet about me being gay but he knew.\n \n If you want my advice I would say get the hell out. You owe it to yourself and your partner to be who you are 100% of the time. And not to be stuck in a system that will chew you up and spit you out. Because to be honest they don't care about you. Your just a number, another flag or a grave or a statistic. It's a big machine and it just keeps on going.\n \n I would rather you be with your partner and open about who you are, then choking yourself off for a 1500 dollar a month salary, and benefits that won't even kick in until your in the veterans database, and that takes a year or even more. And they sure as hell won't give your partner coverage so you can forget about that altogether.\n \n I know it's hard. I've been there. Realizing that because of who you are people will try to kill you or limit you freedoms despite you willing to give your life for theirs. It's the sickest form of hypocrisy I know. Take that plunge, come out, get out, and move on with your life with your partner. Trust me, you will be a hell of alot happier. I was. It was like a giant weight was finally lifted off my chest. Live your life for you. Don't let anything or anyone stop you. And be proud of who you are. That's the most important thing ever.",

   "Really? Since you raised the issue with your unsupported claim, explain this, if you can. NAMBLA Exposed! \n\n The way people toss links out there without giving any real indication as to what they find viable or reasonable in them is annoying...\n \n First of all, the article blindly complains about the ACLU taking on a case involving consensual sex between a young man who had just turned 18, and another young man who was 14.\n The ACTUAL LEGAL CONCERN of the case was that by the previous Kansas law, if both the adult and the under-age individual were of the same gender, you would have a MUCH HARSHER sentence than if it was an adult man having sex with an under-age girl.\n The law-suit only sought equality for male / female victims in sentencing. That's it.\n \n From the article: \"Kline also fears that an ACLU victory will make it difficult for the state to enforce laws against polygamy, incest, bestiality, and other sexual perversions. \"\n This is beyond stupid, as the state CLEARLY HAD NO WRONG in enforcing the pedophilia statute. It was only in applying a ridiculously higher sentence for a male victim (as opposed to a female victim) which was the issue.\n \n The article then references the \"1972 Gay Rights Platform\", which is almost hilarious cause if you have to go back ALMOST FOUR DECADES to try to link homosexuality to pedophilia, that proves how flawed your effort is...\n \n The article's next move is to make the unsubstantiated claim that three homosexuals supposedly published something in a proclaimed gay publication called \"Guide\".\n I have never heard of \"Guide\". Nobody I have talked to about this have heard of \"Guide\".\n I seriously suspect it is a NAMBLA publication, that the author of this inaccurate piece CLAIMS is \"gay\".\n They say that \"three homosexuals\" wrote it, but then the article specifies three individuals WHO HAVE QUESTIONABLE links to being labeled as \"gay\".\n The first one is the \"co-founder\" of NAMBLA, and despite what some people claim NAMBLA is not \"gay\". It is a PEDOPHILE group.\n Just cause you name three PEDOPHILES doesn't mean that you have named three \"gay\" guys.\n \n \n \nAnd just because some homosexuals don't support or endorse pedophelia, that in no way disproves that many more in the community do.\n\n emoticon_frazzled\n The tactics Archie employs are appalling.\n His article names THREE PEOPLE he claims are gay.\n There are MANY TIMES more than three people that have come out EXPLICITLY CONDEMNING pedophilia.\n I have never seen ANY gay person on this board, or on any other message board, condoning pedophilia.\n \n But Archie thinks the fact that he can name three PEDOPHILES somehow disproves the MUCH LARGER opposition to pedophilia in the gay community...\n emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \nCan you prove with objective scientific evidence that let's say 98% of all homosexuals are anathema to the practice of having sex with minor boys?

HRC? PFLAG? GLSEN? SLDN?\n NONE of them support pedophilia.\n \n And yet you claim most gays support pedophilia.",

   "You know Archie you got me there. I mean how can I you know try to appear normal? I mean in your eyes and the eyes of other christian extremist wacko's I have brought forth the final judgment upon the earth for being a homosexual! Because my so called \"lifestyle\" is so horrid and wicked in the eyes gods chosen, gays just have to be pedophiles right?\n \n I love how you put militant every time in front of the word homosexual. How many times have you done that? or associated me as being a militant? You now archie fair is fair so I want evidence from you because I'm sure that there are not STRAIT men out there that are pedophiles either. I'm sure that because these men are strait and because they formed a supposed group to advocate for pedophilia it is then assumed then that all strait men are pedophiles!\n \n I mean you can't disprove that can you? Just because many in the breeder community don't support pedophilia doesn't mean it's not there in high numbers right? Because that's the ridiculous argument your giving!\n \n But you know it's like talking to a righteous wall with you. You play words and go off trying to sneak in with assumed claims and irrational statements in clever fashion, to paint maybe not all gays, but some or a signifigant ammount of us as pedophiles.

And all as a cover for the fact that you never responded to my post or the evidence in it in any way at all. You must ignore the FACT that the founders of NAMBLA were both very outspoken and committed homosexual activists. Not straight men who were determined to make sex with children the law of the land. And the membership of NAMBLA was made up of members of the homosexual community. \n \n These facts you must deny and ignore as you rage about your victim status and accuse us of hating you because you're homosexuals. But that is just another perversion of the truth because we don't hate you at all. I know I don't. We hate the reprehensible immorality which your lifestyle represents for our society though. That is an accurate description of my feelings about the homosexual lifestyle. But actions can be changed and the person redeemed. That's why we are told to hate the sin, but love the sinner. So don't take my rejection of what your sexual proclivity represents as an indictment of my feelings for you as a person when it is your activities which I find repulsive. At least be honest enough to define me accurately of you really want me to believe you are an honest person who's word can be trusted.\n \n \nReally? Since you raised the issue with your unsupported claim, explain this, if you can. NAMBLA Exposed! \n \n And just because some homosexuals don't support or endorse pedophelia, that in no way disproves that many more in the community do. Can you prove with objective scientific evidence that let's say 98% of all homosexuals are anathema to the practice of having sex with minor boys? After all, the founders of NAMBLA were all militant homosexuals who fought hard for the legalization of sex with minors, so your claim that associating being gay, and being a pedophile in the same realm is not only ridiculous, but also demonizing, and wrong. Is false at every level of what is true in reality. After all, it wasn't straight men who founded the organization, but homosexuals.\n",

No response from Archie.\n \n 2) Even if this were true, what of it?\n We're talking about a few guys, as compared to MILLIONS of homosexuals.\n If I showed that the founders of NAMBLA were Christian, would that prove anything about Christians as a large group?\n Of course not!\n \n Archie readily embraces the stereo-types of prejudice, which most people recognize as illogical and nonsense.\n \n \n \nAnd the membership of NAMBLA was made up of members of the homosexual community. \n\n This claim is coming out of nowhere, with no proof.\n Furthermore, it has already been REPEATEDLY proven that the vast majority of men who molest boys SLEEP WITH WOMEN in their adult sexual encounters.\n \n Yet Archie would claim they're all \"gay\", ignoring the heterosexual sex they have...\n \n11. Sexual Orientation: More than 70 percent of the men who molest boys rate themselves as heterosexual in their adult sexual preferences. In addition, 9 percent report that they are equally heterosexual and homosexual. Only 8 percent report that they are exclusively homosexual. The majority of the men who molest boys are married, divorced, widowed, or living with an adult partner.\n 12. Crossing multiple sex boundaries: More than 60 percent of pedophiles have other paraphilias. Many are also exhibitionists or voyeurs. Of the pedophiles who molest girls, 21 perecent also molest boys. Of the pedophiles who molest boys, 53 percent also molest girls.\n Child Molestation Research &#038; Prevention Institute \n\n \n \n \nThese facts you must deny and ignore as you rage about your victim status and accuse us of hating you because you're homosexuals. But that is just another perversion of the truth because we don't hate you at all.\n\n Honestly dude?\n Considering how often you toss out statements like \"b**chy as a gay\" and denigrate gays by comparing them to pedophiles, I can see how somebody would easily claim you \"hate gays\".\n \n \n \nI know I don't.

It has been associated with groups such as the Aryan Nations, Aryan Republican Army, Eric Robert Rudolph, Phineas Priesthood, and The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord. It has been cited as an influence in a number of terrorist attacks around the world, including the 2002 Soweto bombings.[50][51][52][53]\n\n \n In addition to being a terrorist, he's also of Arabic descent.

But their hidden agenda is as active as every behind the scenes. The unspoken culture if you will.\n \n And you are here right now defending that unspoken agenda as you lie and deny that which you and every other homosexual on this forum know is the unspoken culture of sex without concern for the age of the partner. And I have posted the evidence from within the gay community itself admitting this. So your denials carry no weight with reasonable people.\n \n David Thorstad - William A. Percy\n NAMBLA Exposed!\n \n And here's more: And keep in mind that this is a homosexual delivering this speech to a room full of homosexuals. They are much more open and honest regarding their true agenda in describing their version of a perfect world behind closed doors.\n \"The pederast movement today stresses the liberation and empowerment of young people. Instead of pedagogy, democracy. Rather than a Greek-love mentor relationship, the companionship of independent and autonomous individuals. In place of male supremacy, a vision of sexual, economic, and political liberation for all. Freedom is indivisible. The liberation of children, women, boy-lovers, and homosexuals in general, can occur only as complementary facets of the same dream.\"\n \n The issue of love between men and boys has intersected the gay movement since the late nineteenth century, with the rise of the first gay rights movement in Germany. In the United States, as the gay movement has retreated from its vision of sexual liberation, in favor of integration and assimilation into existing social and political structures, it has increasingly sought to marginalize and even demonize cross-generational love. Pederasty-that is, love between a man and a youth of 12 to 18 years of age-say middle-class homosexuals, lesbians, and feminists, has nothing to do with gay liberation. Some go so far as to claim, absurdly, that it is a heterosexual phenomenon, or even \"sexual abuse.\" What a travesty!\n \n Pederasty is the main form that male homosexuality has acquired throughout Western civilization-and not only in the West! Pederasty is inseparable from the high points of Western culture-ancient Greece and the Renaissance.\n \n In Germany, in the late nineteenth century, pederasty was an integral part of the new gay movement. The first gay journal in the world-Der Eigene, published beginning in 1896 (one year before the formation of the first homosexual rights group, the Scientific Humanitarian Committee of Magnus Hirschfeld)-was a pederast and anarchist journal \"for male culture\" with an individualist anarchist outlook based on the ideas of Max Stirner (author of Der Einzige und sein Eigentum). Its publisher, Adolf Brand, was a leading figure of the gay movement throughout the first decades, until the Nazis came to power. The journal continued to appear until 1933. Brand died in an Allied bombing of Berlin in 1945.\n \n Another leading pederast and writer, Benedict Friedlaender, was also a leader of Hirschfeld's committee, until 1908 when he committed suicide. Not unlike today, the two groups-the pederasts in the Gemeinschaft der Eigenen (the Community of Self-Owners) and the Hirschfeld group-constituted two wings of the gay movement. Although they collaborated in some things (for example, both opposed the sodomy statute, Paragraph 175), sharp ideological and scientific differences separated them. In uncanny ways, many of these differences persist in the quite different circumstances of today.\n \n With the spread of the medical model of homosexuality in the late nineteenth century came an increasing influence of doctors and psychiatrists in the gay movement. These viewed homosexuals as a \"third sex,\" or as \"intermediate sexual types\" (Zwischenstufen in German), a \"male soul trapped in a female body\" (or vice versa for lesbians)-a view advanced by Hirschfeld. The pederasts actively combated this view. They believed in an inherent bisexuality of human beings and argued that the influence of the medical profession gave the gay movement the aura of a hospital. Most felt that younger and older males were naturally attracted to each other and that pederasty was a positive good for society because it helped to socialize young males and provided them with a necessary sexual outlet, thereby reducing undesirable social phenomena such as unwanted pregnancies and prostitution. A few (Hans Bl\u00fcher, for example, famous for his book on the Wandervogel movement) believed that pederasty and male bonding provided a basis for a stronger nation and state-a view that, in a perverted form, found a distorted expression in the militarism of the Hitler Youth.\n \n Friedlaender, for example, ridiculed the concept of \"a poor womanly soul languishing away in a man's body, and of the `third sex,'\" and attacked the third sex concept as \"degrading and a beggarly...pleading for sympathy.\" He insisted on a historical approach that also took into account anthropological evidence, and wrote: \"A glance at the cultures of countries before and outside of Christianity suffices to show the complete untenability of the [Zwischenstufen] theory. Especially in ancient Greece, most of the military leaders, artists, and thinkers would have had to be 'psychic hermaphrodites.'\" [1]\n \n In their critique of the third-sex concept and their recognition of the ambiguities and potential bisexuality of the human animal, the pederasts had their feet more securely on the ground than did the larger \"mainstream\" gay movement. The third-sex argument has been thoroughly discredited for years.\n \n Increasingly, the assimilationist gay and lesbian groups in the United States, in a kind of throwback to the nineteenth century, argue that homosexuality is inborn, that it is genetically determined (\"we can't help it that we're gay, we were born that way, so please don't discriminate against us\"-an echo of the nineteenth-century argument that practically solicits pity and that in no way challenges the built-in social repression of same-sex love). The middle-class gay movement today seeks special treatment for a special kind of person who has adopted a \"gay\" identity-\"gay people\"-rather than seeking to liberate the repressed sexual potential of everyone. For them, what matters is identity, not practice. The basic argument of the gay movement today boils down to the following: Homosexuals are born that way, and heterosexuals are born that way; therefore, homosexual liberation poses no threat to the status quo and dominance of heterosupremacy. This is the old \"nature versus nurture\" argument dressed up in new, accommodationist clothes.\n \n The theoretical poverty of this view can be seen in the fact that many people-including, no doubt, some in this room-change their sexual behavior depending on the circumstances or over the course of their lives. If there is a genetic basis for homosexuality and heterosexuality-that is, our behavior is determined by our genes, rather than myriad social and cultural variables that differ from person to person-it is not as distinct and mutually exclusive categories, but as potentials for varieties of sexual expression that lie within everyone's reach. (This line of antighetto thinking has been eloquently expressed by the late Italian gay activist Mario Mieli in his book, Homosexuality and Liberation.)\n \n The real motivation behind this revival of the \"inborn\" argument is political, not scientific. The gay assimilationists want to become part of an existing, inequitable capitalist society, not change that society in any fundamental way. Their approach is inherently selfish, not altruistic. They seek minor adjustments in the status quo, not radical social change. They have been co-opted by the heterosupremacist power structure.\n \n One obvious contradiction in the assimilationist position is that if homosexual identity is inborn, as they say, then why do they oppose freedom of sexual expression for minors? Assimilationists argue that sexual identity is fixed by age six, but they deny young people the right to enjoy sexual pleasure with the person of their own choice. For them, \"protection\" is the key word, not \"liberation\"; they call on the state to \"protect\" young people from expressing and exploring their own sexual behavior. They want to \"protect\" young people from \"dirty old men\" (I, incidentally, am speaking as a \"dirty gay old man\" -something I take as a positive goal), but in reality are protecting them from themselves. They support criminalization of young people's sexuality, especially if it involves sex with an adult man. They condemn any adult who helps a young person to explore his or her sexuality. They are like parents-only worse, because they pretend to offer a guide to the gay future.Pederasty and Homosexuality - William A. Percy",

You don't want to face the fact that your so called message of love you cling to is a farce that has been fabricated by activist pastors and televangelists who take the message of Christ and turn it into a gay witch hunt.\n \n And yet, you just play off reality and bury your head in the sand like so many other dead eyed suburbanites. You turn a blind eye to the suffering of HIV patients or the homeless or those being burned and shot for being gay. There's no outcry by churches against this violence, or the helping of gays infected with AIDS or HIV. There's no outcry to reinstate funding for HIV patients in California that Schwarzenegger just cut so now they can't get the proper treatment or medication.\n \n The very message Christ preached about helping the sick, the poor, the down trodden, the OPPRESSED, those that have no voice. Those that are shunned by the elite in society. That very message is being tossed out the window and being replaced by lies and slander and demonizing of others to feed the power hungry zealots of the religious right.\n \n You know it's true I know it's true because I've heard it with my own ears every Sunday since I was thirteen Archie. Don;t think I have not sat in the pew on Sunday before the election and seen the Dobson propaganda films about proposition 8. Painting us as demons to and wolf's to steal away youth from their cradles and devour them with our \"perverse\" lifestyle as one pastor put it. I have. I've heard this message of so called love preached when a pastor compares gays in Palm Springs to prisoners forced to wear pink as a way to emasculate them.\n \n And then says to put these hardened criminals in the Palm Springs population so that they would all \"get along\" with their own wickedness. Referring to sex in prison's and putting it in the same realm as sex in a relationship with gay couples. And further insulting gays by portraying us as weak and that we all wear pink cause were all prissy weak limp wrist'ed #######! \n \n Well I just happened to be wearing the tightest brightest pink shirt that day. Stood up gave him one hard look and walked out.. So much for your message of love Archie. Don;t try to cover #### with sugar and call it eatable because it's not..",

   "Addressed them? Not at all. You never actually address anything offered into evidence here. You make excuses, obfuscations, justifications, rationalizations and denials, but never do you honestly address anything. \n \n The undeniable fact which their is no ignoring is that the founders of NAMBLA and the roots of legalizing sex with underage boys is founded in the homosexual movement. And even according to David Thorstad the larger homosexual community has abandoned their true agenda publicly in order to gain legitimacy with the larger straight community. But their hidden agenda is as active as every behind the scenes. The unspoken culture if you will.\n \n And you are here right now defending that unspoken agenda as you lie and deny that which you and every other homosexual on this forum know is the unspoken culture of sex without concern for the age of the partner. And I have posted the evidence from within the gay community itself admitting this. So your denials carry no weight with reasonable people.\n \n David Thorstad - William A. Percy\n NAMBLA Exposed!\n \n And here's more: And keep in mind that this is a homosexual delivering this speech to a room full of homosexuals. They are much more open and honest regarding their true agenda in describing their version of a perfect world behind closed doors.\n \"The pederast movement today stresses the liberation and empowerment of young people. Instead of pedagogy, democracy. Rather than a Greek-love mentor relationship, the companionship of independent and autonomous individuals. In place of male supremacy, a vision of sexual, economic, and political liberation for all. Freedom is indivisible. The liberation of children, women, boy-lovers, and homosexuals in general, can occur only as complementary facets of the same dream.\"\n \n The issue of love between men and boys has intersected the gay movement since the late nineteenth century, with the rise of the first gay rights movement in Germany. In the United States, as the gay movement has retreated from its vision of sexual liberation, in favor of integration and assimilation into existing social and political structures, it has increasingly sought to marginalize and even demonize cross-generational love. Pederasty-that is, love between a man and a youth of 12 to 18 years of age-say middle-class homosexuals, lesbians, and feminists, has nothing to do with gay liberation. Some go so far as to claim, absurdly, that it is a heterosexual phenomenon, or even \"sexual abuse.\" What a travesty!\n \n Pederasty is the main form that male homosexuality has acquired throughout Western civilization-and not only in the West! Pederasty is inseparable from the high points of Western culture-ancient Greece and the Renaissance.\n \n In Germany, in the late nineteenth century, pederasty was an integral part of the new gay movement. The first gay journal in the world-Der Eigene, published beginning in 1896 (one year before the formation of the first homosexual rights group, the Scientific Humanitarian Committee of Magnus Hirschfeld)-was a pederast and anarchist journal \"for male culture\" with an individualist anarchist outlook based on the ideas of Max Stirner (author of Der Einzige und sein Eigentum). Its publisher, Adolf Brand, was a leading figure of the gay movement throughout the first decades, until the Nazis came to power. The journal continued to appear until 1933. Brand died in an Allied bombing of Berlin in 1945.\n \n Another leading pederast and writer, Benedict Friedlaender, was also a leader of Hirschfeld's committee, until 1908 when he committed suicide. Not unlike today, the two groups-the pederasts in the Gemeinschaft der Eigenen (the Community of Self-Owners) and the Hirschfeld group-constituted two wings of the gay movement. Although they collaborated in some things (for example, both opposed the sodomy statute, Paragraph 175), sharp ideological and scientific differences separated them. In uncanny ways, many of these differences persist in the quite different circumstances of today.\n \n With the spread of the medical model of homosexuality in the late nineteenth century came an increasing influence of doctors and psychiatrists in the gay movement. These viewed homosexuals as a \"third sex,\" or as \"intermediate sexual types\" (Zwischenstufen in German), a \"male soul trapped in a female body\" (or vice versa for lesbians)-a view advanced by Hirschfeld. The pederasts actively combated this view. They believed in an inherent bisexuality of human beings and argued that the influence of the medical profession gave the gay movement the aura of a hospital. Most felt that younger and older males were naturally attracted to each other and that pederasty was a positive good for society because it helped to socialize young males and provided them with a necessary sexual outlet, thereby reducing undesirable social phenomena such as unwanted pregnancies and prostitution. A few (Hans Bl\u00fcher, for example, famous for his book on the Wandervogel movement) believed that pederasty and male bonding provided a basis for a stronger nation and state-a view that, in a perverted form, found a distorted expression in the militarism of the Hitler Youth.\n \n Friedlaender, for example, ridiculed the concept of \"a poor womanly soul languishing away in a man's body, and of the `third sex,'\" and attacked the third sex concept as \"degrading and a beggarly...pleading for sympathy.\" He insisted on a historical approach that also took into account anthropological evidence, and wrote: \"A glance at the cultures of countries before and outside of Christianity suffices to show the complete untenability of the [Zwischenstufen] theory. Especially in ancient Greece, most of the military leaders, artists, and thinkers would have had to be 'psychic hermaphrodites.'\" [1]\n \n In their critique of the third-sex concept and their recognition of the ambiguities and potential bisexuality of the human animal, the pederasts had their feet more securely on the ground than did the larger \"mainstream\" gay movement. The third-sex argument has been thoroughly discredited for years.\n \n Increasingly, the assimilationist gay and lesbian groups in the United States, in a kind of throwback to the nineteenth century, argue that homosexuality is inborn, that it is genetically determined (\"we can't help it that we're gay, we were born that way, so please don't discriminate against us\"-an echo of the nineteenth-century argument that practically solicits pity and that in no way challenges the built-in social repression of same-sex love). The middle-class gay movement today seeks special treatment for a special kind of person who has adopted a \"gay\" identity-\"gay people\"-rather than seeking to liberate the repressed sexual potential of everyone. For them, what matters is identity, not practice. The basic argument of the gay movement today boils down to the following: Homosexuals are born that way, and heterosexuals are born that way; therefore, homosexual liberation poses no threat to the status quo and dominance of heterosupremacy. This is the old \"nature versus nurture\" argument dressed up in new, accommodationist clothes.\n \n The theoretical poverty of this view can be seen in the fact that many people-including, no doubt, some in this room-change their sexual behavior depending on the circumstances or over the course of their lives. If there is a genetic basis for homosexuality and heterosexuality-that is, our behavior is determined by our genes, rather than myriad social and cultural variables that differ from person to person-it is not as distinct and mutually exclusive categories, but as potentials for varieties of sexual expression that lie within everyone's reach. (This line of antighetto thinking has been eloquently expressed by the late Italian gay activist Mario Mieli in his book, Homosexuality and Liberation.)\n \n The real motivation behind this revival of the \"inborn\" argument is political, not scientific. The gay assimilationists want to become part of an existing, inequitable capitalist society, not change that society in any fundamental way. Their approach is inherently selfish, not altruistic. They seek minor adjustments in the status quo, not radical social change. They have been co-opted by the heterosupremacist power structure.\n \n One obvious contradiction in the assimilationist position is that if homosexual identity is inborn, as they say, then why do they oppose freedom of sexual expression for minors? Assimilationists argue that sexual identity is fixed by age six, but they deny young people the right to enjoy sexual pleasure with the person of their own choice. For them, \"protection\" is the key word, not \"liberation\"; they call on the state to \"protect\" young people from expressing and exploring their own sexual behavior. They want to \"protect\" young people from \"dirty old men\" (I, incidentally, am speaking as a \"dirty gay old man\" -something I take as a positive goal), but in reality are protecting them from themselves. They support criminalization of young people's sexuality, especially if it involves sex with an adult man. They condemn any adult who helps a young person to explore his or her sexuality. They are like parents-only worse, because they pretend to offer a guide to the gay future.Pederasty and Homosexuality - William A. Percy\n\n \n You know Archie why don't you give Anita Bryant a call if she's still around. I'm sure you two would get along just fine with your fairytale views and crackpot theories on Gays. Maybe you could even have a little pow wow and pray for the soul of America and pray for everyone to think and believe just like you... \n \n As for this.. this #### you have posted. Sorry not buying it. I have no sexual desire for a young boy nor will I ever. I don;t know about Foundit or Matthew maybe they do? Maybe Harvey Milk did? Maybe all the gays I hung out with last night do? Cause that's the generalization your putting on this issue Archie and it's shameful and sick.\n \n But go ahead and continue to throw hints and play words and demonize us some more. Then pour some sugar on this turd you;ve thrown at us in these post and expect us to stomach it. Sorry Archie I won;t and I for one thinks it's disgraceful you would even try to generalize gays like this.\n \n But hey since it's below the belt tactics why not. Because after all you know we gays are so used to going below the belt... ha ha ha laugh at the ### joke Archie go ahead Because that's all we are to you. One big huge ####ing joke...",

   "There is absolutely no correlation between 'homosexual' and 'pedophile'. What you are saying,Arch, is equivalent to me saying that the priests who molested children are representative of ALL Christians and all Christians therefore have a penchant for molesting little boys. Does that sound reasonable to you?\n\n \n Your analogous conclusion is misplaced and erroneous CxT. The proper conclusion based on the evidence of the Priest Molestation crisis within the Catholic church is that it was caused because for decades and possibly centuries, the RCC built up a culture of homosexuals in the priesthood. It was this culture of homosexuals as priests which led to the rampant sexual abuse of alter boys within the catholic church.\n \n The evidence that what i'm saying is absolutely true and not a CHRISTIANITY WIDE ISSUE is that in the Protestant denominations, ALL OF THEM WITHOUT EXCEPTION, where pastors have always been allowed to marry and have children as the bible allows for, this culture of molesting boys has never been an issue at all as a wide spread problem. Here's some further documentation of what I am saying. \n \n Homosexual Culture Undercuts Priesthood\n Phil Brennan,\n Friday, April 5, 2002\n \n Father Andrew Greeley called it the \"Lavender Mafia,\" a homosexual underground within the Catholic Church in America that has managed to dominate many of the seminaries and must bear the largest share of the blame for the sex scandals afflicting the church.\n \n Like the gay underground in the British Foreign Office of the past where for scores of years the road to advancement was open only to homosexuals, the Lavender Mafia has been the gatekeeper determining who will be admitted to seminaries and ultimately to the Roman Catholic priesthood. In Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood,\" author Michael S. Rose quotes a former Mundelein seminarian, Joseph Kellenyi, as saying: \"The issue was never one of my suitability for ordination. Rather it was that the gay clique had been given veto power over who got ordained.\"\n \n 'Gay Profession' In his book, \"The Changing Face of the Priesthood,\" the rector of St. Mary's Seminary in Cleveland, Father Donald B. Cozzens, warned that the priesthood was becoming a \"gay profession.\" And in the seminaries it wasn't merely a preponderance of gay students, but also \"a disproportionate number of homosexually-oriented persons,\" including faculty, he wrote. That kind of atmosphere, Rose notes, \"deters the heterosexual man from continuing to study and prepare for the priesthood.\" Rose wonders how can \"any healthy heterosexual seminarian expect to be properly formed and prepared for the priesthood when constantly subjected to that which is so clearly contrary to Church teaching and discipline?\" 'Threatening Atmosphere'\n \n He asks: \"How many heterosexual seminarians, whether orthodox or not, have decided to leave the seminary and abandon their vocations because of the 'gay subculture' they were forced to endure, because they had been propositioned, harassed or even molested? We're not talking here about the presence of a few homosexually-oriented men who conduct themselves with perfect chastity. Rather there exists an intense and often threatening atmosphere.\" Indeed, so horrific is the situation that \"certain seminaries have earned nicknames such as Notre Flame (for Notre Dame Seminary in New Orleans) and Theological Closet (for Theological College at Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.); St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore has earned the nickname 'The Pink Palace.'\"\n \n Visiting the Gay Bars At some of the seminaries, faculty and students would don their gay apparel and head for gay bars. In March 2000 the liberal Greeley, often called the church's resident pornographer for his racy novels, testified that seminary professors \"Tell their students that they're gay and take some of them to gay bars, and gay students sleep with each other.\" Greeley is not alone in exposing the homosexual behavior rampant in many of the nation's seminaries:\n \n According to Father Andrew Walker, the situation at the Baltimore seminary was so bad that the vice rector delivered a lecture \"in front of at least 150 people when he stated, \"Yes, we accept openly gay seminarians; that's our policy.\"\n According to Father John Trigilio, while visiting the Baltimore seminary he observed: \"There was no discretion at all. The few times I was there, some of the seminarians would literally dress like gays from [Greenwich] Village. They would even go so far as to wear pink silk; it was like going to see La Cage Aux Folles.\"\n \"In my day at St. Mary's,\" recalled Father John Despard (a pseudonym) \"down the hall there would be two guys in the shower and everybody knew it.\" Rose cites numerous instances of gay domination at many of the nation's seminaries. One priest described the situation at Chicago's Mundelein seminary in the 1970s. Many of the younger students would be placed into situations where they compromised their sexual integrity,\" said Father Wayne H. Wurst during a radio broadcast. \"This would be used against them by older students for favors. And those older students actually had faculty members who would request from time to time a friend who would come and visit them because they were lonely. And these students would supply fresh meat. \"So there were madams, pimps and prostitutes all in a major seminary system that from outside, if you were to walk through, would look very holy.\" Heterosexuals Driven Out\n Heterosexual students at a number of seminaries were persecuted by the gay subculture. Reporting homosexual behavior by classmates could get them expelled, as could resisting homosexual advances. Rose cites scores of cases of heterosexuals driven out of seminaries because they refused to accept the gay culture. In Cozzen's book, \"The Changing Face of the Priesthood,\" he wrote that there has been \"a heterosexual exodus from the priesthood\" due, Rose notes, in part to the unrestrained gay subcultures in some seminaries, the resulting \"overwhelming gay clergy culture will have an effect on how the laity views the priesthood and it will have an effect on incoming vocations.

The culture of having sex without concern for the age of the partner. So Archieligically, all (or the vast majority) of homosexuals support this hidden culture in which sex with boys is permitted.\n \n The problem is that, though you might say that men who want to have sex with little boys are homosexuals, they are truly paedolphiles. Using Archielogic, you could argue that those men who wish to have sex with little girls are rooted within the culture of hetrosexuals, and of course the majority of hetrosexual men support this hidden culture. What if it's grown women who want to have sex with little boys? Or women who want to have sex with little girls? Do we blame the homosexual community (the vast majority of which condemn all these practices) for such activities? These people (not the homosexual community as a whole) are paedophiles, paedophiles of different persuasions, but all paedophiles.\n \n So Archie, it is true that you did not actually say that the vast majority of homosexuals are paedophile, in much the same way as G W Bush didn't actually say that Iraq was responsible for 9/11, but he did mention them together as often as possible so that the majority of gullible Americans would come away believing that there was a link.",

Percy\n NAMBLA Exposed!\n \n And here's more: And keep in mind that this is a homosexual delivering this speech to a room full of homosexuals. They are much more open and honest regarding their true agenda in describing their version of a perfect world behind closed doors.\n \"The pederast movement today stresses the liberation and empowerment of young people. Instead of pedagogy, democracy. Rather than a Greek-love mentor relationship, the companionship of independent and autonomous individuals. In place of male supremacy, a vision of sexual, economic, and political liberation for all. Freedom is indivisible. The liberation of children, women, boy-lovers, and homosexuals in general, can occur only as complementary facets of the same dream.\"\n \n The issue of love between men and boys has intersected the gay movement since the late nineteenth century, with the rise of the first gay rights movement in Germany. In the United States, as the gay movement has retreated from its vision of sexual liberation, in favor of integration and assimilation into existing social and political structures, it has increasingly sought to marginalize and even demonize cross-generational love. Pederasty-that is, love between a man and a youth of 12 to 18 years of age-say middle-class homosexuals, lesbians, and feminists, has nothing to do with gay liberation. Some go so far as to claim, absurdly, that it is a heterosexual phenomenon, or even \"sexual abuse.\" What a travesty!\n \n Pederasty is the main form that male homosexuality has acquired throughout Western civilization-and not only in the West! Pederasty is inseparable from the high points of Western culture-ancient Greece and the Renaissance.\n \n In Germany, in the late nineteenth century, pederasty was an integral part of the new gay movement. The first gay journal in the world-Der Eigene, published beginning in 1896 (one year before the formation of the first homosexual rights group, the Scientific Humanitarian Committee of Magnus Hirschfeld)-was a pederast and anarchist journal \"for male culture\" with an individualist anarchist outlook based on the ideas of Max Stirner (author of Der Einzige und sein Eigentum). Its publisher, Adolf Brand, was a leading figure of the gay movement throughout the first decades, until the Nazis came to power. The journal continued to appear until 1933. Brand died in an Allied bombing of Berlin in 1945.\n \n Another leading pederast and writer, Benedict Friedlaender, was also a leader of Hirschfeld's committee, until 1908 when he committed suicide. Not unlike today, the two groups-the pederasts in the Gemeinschaft der Eigenen (the Community of Self-Owners) and the Hirschfeld group-constituted two wings of the gay movement. Although they collaborated in some things (for example, both opposed the sodomy statute, Paragraph 175), sharp ideological and scientific differences separated them. In uncanny ways, many of these differences persist in the quite different circumstances of today.\n \n With the spread of the medical model of homosexuality in the late nineteenth century came an increasing influence of doctors and psychiatrists in the gay movement. These viewed homosexuals as a \"third sex,\" or as \"intermediate sexual types\" (Zwischenstufen in German), a \"male soul trapped in a female body\" (or vice versa for lesbians)-a view advanced by Hirschfeld. The pederasts actively combated this view. They believed in an inherent bisexuality of human beings and argued that the influence of the medical profession gave the gay movement the aura of a hospital. Most felt that younger and older males were naturally attracted to each other and that pederasty was a positive good for society because it helped to socialize young males and provided them with a necessary sexual outlet, thereby reducing undesirable social phenomena such as unwanted pregnancies and prostitution. A few (Hans Bl\u00fcher, for example, famous for his book on the Wandervogel movement) believed that pederasty and male bonding provided a basis for a stronger nation and state-a view that, in a perverted form, found a distorted expression in the militarism of the Hitler Youth.\n \n Friedlaender, for example, ridiculed the concept of \"a poor womanly soul languishing away in a man's body, and of the `third sex,'\" and attacked the third sex concept as \"degrading and a beggarly...pleading for sympathy.\" He insisted on a historical approach that also took into account anthropological evidence, and wrote: \"A glance at the cultures of countries before and outside of Christianity suffices to show the complete untenability of the [Zwischenstufen] theory. Especially in ancient Greece, most of the military leaders, artists, and thinkers would have had to be 'psychic hermaphrodites.'\" [1]\n \n In their critique of the third-sex concept and their recognition of the ambiguities and potential bisexuality of the human animal, the pederasts had their feet more securely on the ground than did the larger \"mainstream\" gay movement. The third-sex argument has been thoroughly discredited for years.\n \n Increasingly, the assimilationist gay and lesbian groups in the United States, in a kind of throwback to the nineteenth century, argue that homosexuality is inborn, that it is genetically determined (\"we can't help it that we're gay, we were born that way, so please don't discriminate against us\"-an echo of the nineteenth-century argument that practically solicits pity and that in no way challenges the built-in social repression of same-sex love). The middle-class gay movement today seeks special treatment for a special kind of person who has adopted a \"gay\" identity-\"gay people\"-rather than seeking to liberate the repressed sexual potential of everyone. For them, what matters is identity, not practice. The basic argument of the gay movement today boils down to the following: Homosexuals are born that way, and heterosexuals are born that way; therefore, homosexual liberation poses no threat to the status quo and dominance of heterosupremacy. This is the old \"nature versus nurture\" argument dressed up in new, accommodationist clothes.\n \n The theoretical poverty of this view can be seen in the fact that many people-including, no doubt, some in this room-change their sexual behavior depending on the circumstances or over the course of their lives. If there is a genetic basis for homosexuality and heterosexuality-that is, our behavior is determined by our genes, rather than myriad social and cultural variables that differ from person to person-it is not as distinct and mutually exclusive categories, but as potentials for varieties of sexual expression that lie within everyone's reach. (This line of antighetto thinking has been eloquently expressed by the late Italian gay activist Mario Mieli in his book, Homosexuality and Liberation.)\n \n The real motivation behind this revival of the \"inborn\" argument is political, not scientific. The gay assimilationists want to become part of an existing, inequitable capitalist society, not change that society in any fundamental way. Their approach is inherently selfish, not altruistic. They seek minor adjustments in the status quo, not radical social change. They have been co-opted by the heterosupremacist power structure.\n \n One obvious contradiction in the assimilationist position is that if homosexual identity is inborn, as they say, then why do they oppose freedom of sexual expression for minors? Assimilationists argue that sexual identity is fixed by age six, but they deny young people the right to enjoy sexual pleasure with the person of their own choice. For them, \"protection\" is the key word, not \"liberation\"; they call on the state to \"protect\" young people from expressing and exploring their own sexual behavior. They want to \"protect\" young people from \"dirty old men\" (I, incidentally, am speaking as a \"dirty gay old man\" -something I take as a positive goal), but in reality are protecting them from themselves. They support criminalization of young people's sexuality, especially if it involves sex with an adult man. They condemn any adult who helps a young person to explore his or her sexuality. They are like parents-only worse, because they pretend to offer a guide to the gay future.Pederasty and Homosexuality - William A. Percy[/QUOTE]\n \n Your analogous conclusion is misplaced and erroneous CxT. The proper conclusion based on the evidence of the Priest Molestation crisis within the Catholic church is that it was caused because for decades and possibly centuries, the RCC built up a culture of homosexuals in the priesthood. It was this culture of homosexuals as priests which led to the rampant sexual abuse of alter boys within the catholic church.\n \n The evidence that what i'm saying is absolutely true and not a CHRISTIANITY WIDE ISSUE is that in the Protestant denominations, ALL OF THEM WITHOUT EXCEPTION, where pastors have always been allowed to marry and have children as the bible allows for, this culture of molesting boys has never been an issue at all as a wide spread problem. Here's some further documentation of what I am saying. \n \n Homosexual Culture Undercuts Priesthood\n Phil Brennan,\n Friday, April 5, 2002\n \n Father Andrew Greeley called it the \"Lavender Mafia,\" a homosexual underground within the Catholic Church in America that has managed to dominate many of the seminaries and must bear the largest share of the blame for the sex scandals afflicting the church.\n \n Like the gay underground in the British Foreign Office of the past where for scores of years the road to advancement was open only to homosexuals, the Lavender Mafia has been the gatekeeper determining who will be admitted to seminaries and ultimately to the Roman Catholic priesthood. In Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood,\" author Michael S. Rose quotes a former Mundelein seminarian, Joseph Kellenyi, as saying: \"The issue was never one of my suitability for ordination. Rather it was that the gay clique had been given veto power over who got ordained.\"\n \n 'Gay Profession' In his book, \"The Changing Face of the Priesthood,\" the rector of St. Mary's Seminary in Cleveland, Father Donald B. Cozzens, warned that the priesthood was becoming a \"gay profession.\" And in the seminaries it wasn't merely a preponderance of gay students, but also \"a disproportionate number of homosexually-oriented persons,\" including faculty, he wrote. That kind of atmosphere, Rose notes, \"deters the heterosexual man from continuing to study and prepare for the priesthood.\" Rose wonders how can \"any healthy heterosexual seminarian expect to be properly formed and prepared for the priesthood when constantly subjected to that which is so clearly contrary to Church teaching and discipline?\" 'Threatening Atmosphere'\n \n He asks: \"How many heterosexual seminarians, whether orthodox or not, have decided to leave the seminary and abandon their vocations because of the 'gay subculture' they were forced to endure, because they had been propositioned, harassed or even molested? We're not talking here about the presence of a few homosexually-oriented men who conduct themselves with perfect chastity. Rather there exists an intense and often threatening atmosphere.\" Indeed, so horrific is the situation that \"certain seminaries have earned nicknames such as Notre Flame (for Notre Dame Seminary in New Orleans) and Theological Closet (for Theological College at Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.); St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore has earned the nickname 'The Pink Palace.'\"\n \n Visiting the Gay Bars At some of the seminaries, faculty and students would don their gay apparel and head for gay bars. In March 2000 the liberal Greeley, often called the church's resident pornographer for his racy novels, testified that seminary professors \"Tell their students that they're gay and take some of them to gay bars, and gay students sleep with each other.\" Greeley is not alone in exposing the homosexual behavior rampant in many of the nation's seminaries:\n \n According to Father Andrew Walker, the situation at the Baltimore seminary was so bad that the vice rector delivered a lecture \"in front of at least 150 people when he stated, \"Yes, we accept openly gay seminarians; that's our policy.\"\n \n According to Father John Trigilio, while visiting the Baltimore seminary he observed: \"There was no discretion at all. The few times I was there, some of the seminarians would literally dress like gays from [Greenwich] Village. They would even go so far as to wear pink silk; it was like going to see La Cage Aux Folles.\"\n \n \"In my day at St. Mary's,\" recalled Father John Despard (a pseudonym) \"down the hall there would be two guys in the shower and everybody knew it.\" Rose cites numerous instances of gay domination at many of the nation's seminaries. One priest described the situation at Chicago's Mundelein seminary in the 1970s.

Wurst during a radio broadcast. \"This would be used against them by older students for favors. And those older students actually had faculty members who would request from time to time a friend who would come and visit them because they were lonely. And these students would supply fresh meat. \"So there were madams, pimps and prostitutes all in a major seminary system that from outside, if you were to walk through, would look very holy.\" \n \n Heterosexuals Driven Out\n Heterosexual students at a number of seminaries were persecuted by the gay subculture. Reporting homosexual behavior by classmates could get them expelled, as could resisting homosexual advances. Rose cites scores of cases of heterosexuals driven out of seminaries because they refused to accept the gay culture. In Cozzen's book, \"The Changing Face of the Priesthood,\" he wrote that there has been \"a heterosexual exodus from the priesthood\" due, Rose notes, in part to the unrestrained gay subcultures in some seminaries, the resulting \"overwhelming gay clergy culture will have an effect on how the laity views the priesthood and it will have an effect on incoming vocations. \n \n Potential candidates for the priesthood who are heterosexual will be intimidated from joining an institution where the ethos is primarily that of a gay culture.\" Anyone wondering how the church could have got itself in the mess it is now experiencing need look no further than the pages of Rose's extraordinary book. What we are seeing today are the results of a gay priesthood being loosed upon parishes all across the nation, where they have abused impressionable young men they treated as \"fresh meat\" to satisfy their unnatural sexual urgings.

Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood\" at a discount.\n  Homosexual Culture Undercuts Priesthood\n \n You should also understand that I get no personal pleasure from documenting this info from sources which are insiders so have no motive to lie in my favor. And neither do I post misinformation in order to falsely defend a position. As hard as it is to accept. What I have said is true and undeniable regarding the underlying agenda and tenets of the homosexual movement.[/QUOTE]\n \n \nAll I'm doing is getting a feeling for Archielogic.\n \n You extrapolated from NAMBLA is a bunch of homosexuals, to all homosexuals (or the vast majority) must be paedophiles.

   "More evidence of the reprobate thinking that you represent Matt is your continued need to lay every burden, no matter how exaggerated or even false that it is at the door of the christian believer in Christ is just more evidence of your need to gain acceptance via sympathy as an oppressed people. I don't hate you or any homosexuals at all. I don't want you persecuted, beaten, killed, harassed or denied any human rights at all. These claims of repeated victimization by you is a natural part of your culture in order to garner sympathy which isn't deserved at all in any special way. And the speech I posted right above your quoted rant is by a homosexual saying the exact same thing. Here, learn about what your culture represents from one of your own. It's just an excerpt...\n Friedlaender, for example, ridiculed the concept of \"a poor womanly soul languishing away in a man's body, and of the `third sex,'\" and attacked the third sex concept as \"degrading and a beggarly...pleading for sympathy.\" He insisted on a historical approach that also took into account anthropological evidence, and wrote: \"A glance at the cultures of countries before and outside of Christianity suffices to show the complete untenability of the [Zwischenstufen] theory. Especially in ancient Greece, most of the military leaders, artists, and thinkers would have had to be 'psychic hermaphrodites.'\" [1]\n \n In their critique of the third-sex concept and their recognition of the ambiguities and potential bisexuality of the human animal, the pederasts had their feet more securely on the ground than did the larger \"mainstream\" gay movement. The third-sex argument has been thoroughly discredited for years.\n \n Increasingly, the assimilationist gay and lesbian groups in the United States, in a kind of throwback to the nineteenth century, argue that homosexuality is inborn, that it is genetically determined (\"we can't help it that we're gay, we were born that way, so please don't discriminate against us\"-an echo of the nineteenth-century argument that practically solicits pity and that in no way challenges the built-in social repression of same-sex love). The middle-class gay movement today seeks special treatment for a special kind of person who has adopted a \"gay\" identity-\"gay people\"-rather than seeking to liberate the repressed sexual potential of everyone. For them, what matters is identity, not practice. The basic argument of the gay movement today boils down to the following: Homosexuals are born that way, and heterosexuals are born that way; therefore, homosexual liberation poses no threat to the status quo and dominance of heterosupremacy. This is the old \"nature versus nurture\" argument dressed up in new, accommodationist clothes.\n\n \n Then why do you and the anti gay Christians continue to stop us from protecting our families and relationships, and lives by opposing ENDA and the matthew shepard act, by supporting DOMA, by gathering signatures, putting marriage amendmants on the ballot to deny us the protections you and yours take for granted? You want to deny me and mine equality under the law. That is hardly love. You and the anti gay Christians are doing everything in their power to hurt us and you know it. They don't want us to get married and thus protect us from being thrown out of our homes losing our health insurance, having our children taken from us. This is hardly love.",

   "Here is a direct quote from Archie (so he cannot claim I am twisting his words).\n \n \n Does this not connect the homosexual community with an unspoken culture? The culture of having sex without concern for the age of the partner. So Archieligically, all (or the vast majority) of homosexuals support this hidden culture in which sex with boys is permitted.\n \n The problem is that, though you might say that men who want to have sex with little boys are homosexuals, they are truly paedolphiles. Using Archielogic, you could argue that those men who wish to have sex with little girls are rooted within the culture of hetrosexuals, and of course the majority of hetrosexual men support this hidden culture. What if it's grown women who want to have sex with little boys? Or women who want to have sex with little girls? Do we blame the homosexual community (the vast majority of which condemn all these practices) for such activities? These people (not the homosexual community as a whole) are paedophiles, paedophiles of different persuasions, but all paedophiles.\n \n So Archie, it is true that you did not actually say that the vast majority of homosexuals are paedophile, in much the same way as G W Bush didn't actually say that Iraq was responsible for 9/11, but he did mention them together as often as possible so that the majority of gullible Americans would come away believing that there was a link.\n\n \n And don't forget that my links which I carried over to this page confirm exactly what I said from homosexual speeches and given by homosexual activists to homosexual audiences. And remember that what they said, and what I repeated is the homosexual communities agenda to rid societies of laws which restrict consensual sex between adults and children based on any age limit. \n \n The inference is that if allowed to vote on the issue, the homosexual community would vote affirmatively as a block of voters even if some would never participate personally in such a relationship.",

Is it impossible for you to accurately interpret what I say? :)\n \n Pederasty and Homosexuality by David Thorstad\n \n [Speech to the Semana Cultural L\u00e9sbica-Gay, Mexico City, June 26, 1998. More than 600 people attended the talk: standing room only, and many had to be turned away. This is an English version of the speech, which was given in Spanish.]\n \n \"The pederast movement today stresses the liberation and empowerment of young people. Instead of pedagogy, democracy. Rather than a Greek-love mentor relationship, the companionship of independent and autonomous individuals. In place of male supremacy, a vision of sexual, economic, and political liberation for all. Freedom is indivisible. The liberation of children, women, boy-lovers, and homosexuals in general, can occur only as complementary facets of the same dream.\"\n \n The issue of love between men and boys has intersected the gay movement since the late nineteenth century, with the rise of the first gay rights movement in Germany. In the United States, as the gay movement has retreated from its vision of sexual liberation, in favor of integration and assimilation into existing social and political structures, it has increasingly sought to marginalize and even demonize cross-generational love. Pederasty&#8212;that is, love between a man and a youth of 12 to 18 years of age&#8212;say middle-class homosexuals, lesbians, and feminists, has nothing to do with gay liberation. Some go so far as to claim, absurdly, that it is a heterosexual phenomenon, or even \"sexual abuse.\" What a travesty!\n \n Pederasty is the main form that male homosexuality has acquired throughout Western civilization&#8212;and not only in the West! Pederasty is inseparable from the high points of Western culture&#8212;ancient Greece and the Renaissance.\n \n In Germany, in the late nineteenth century, pederasty was an integral part of the new gay movement. The first gay journal in the world&#8212;Der Eigene, published beginning in 1896 (one year before the formation of the first homosexual rights group, the Scientific Humanitarian Committee of Magnus Hirschfeld)&#8212;was a pederast and anarchist journal \"for male culture\" with an individualist anarchist outlook based on the ideas of Max Stirner (author of Der Einzige und sein Eigentum). Its publisher, Adolf Brand, was a leading figure of the gay movement throughout the first decades, until the Nazis came to power. The journal continued to appear until 1933. Brand died in an Allied bombing of Berlin in 1945.\n \n Another leading pederast and writer, Benedict Friedlaender, was also a leader of Hirschfeld's committee, until 1908 when he committed suicide. Not unlike today, the two groups&#8212;the pederasts in the Gemeinschaft der Eigenen (the Community of Self-Owners) and the Hirschfeld group&#8212;constituted two wings of the gay movement. Although they collaborated in some things (for example, both opposed the sodomy statute, Paragraph 175), sharp ideological and scientific differences separated them. In uncanny ways, many of these differences persist in the quite different circumstances of today.\n \n With the spread of the medical model of homosexuality in the late nineteenth century came an increasing influence of doctors and psychiatrists in the gay movement. These viewed homosexuals as a \"third sex,\" or as \"intermediate sexual types\" (Zwischenstufen in German), a \"male soul trapped in a female body\" (or vice versa for lesbians)&#8212;a view advanced by Hirschfeld. The pederasts actively combated this view. They believed in an inherent bisexuality of human beings and argued that the influence of the medical profession gave the gay movement the aura of a hospital. Most felt that younger and older males were naturally attracted to each other and that pederasty was a positive good for society because it helped to socialize young males and provided them with a necessary sexual outlet, thereby reducing undesirable social phenomena such as unwanted pregnancies and prostitution. A few (Hans Bl\u00fcher, for example, famous for his book on the Wandervogel movement) believed that pederasty and male bonding provided a basis for a stronger nation and state&#8212;a view that, in a perverted form, found a distorted expression in the militarism of the Hitler Youth.\n \n Friedlaender, for example, ridiculed the concept of \"a poor womanly soul languishing away in a man's body, and of the `third sex,'\" and attacked the third sex concept as \"degrading and a beggarly...pleading for sympathy.\" He insisted on a historical approach that also took into account anthropological evidence, and wrote: \"A glance at the cultures of countries before and outside of Christianity suffices to show the complete untenability of the [Zwischenstufen] theory. Especially in ancient Greece, most of the military leaders, artists, and thinkers would have had to be 'psychic hermaphrodites.'\" [1]\n \n In their critique of the third-sex concept and their recognition of the ambiguities and potential bisexuality of the human animal, the pederasts had their feet more securely on the ground than did the larger \"mainstream\" gay movement. The third-sex argument has been thoroughly discredited for years.\n \n Increasingly, the assimilationist gay and lesbian groups in the United States, in a kind of throwback to the nineteenth century, argue that homosexuality is inborn, that it is genetically determined (\"we can't help it that we're gay, we were born that way, so please don't discriminate against us\"&#8212;an echo of the nineteenth-century argument that practically solicits pity and that in no way challenges the built-in social repression of same-sex love). The middle-class gay movement today seeks special treatment for a special kind of person who has adopted a \"gay\" identity&#8212;\"gay people\"&#8212;rather than seeking to liberate the repressed sexual potential of everyone. For them, what matters is identity, not practice. The basic argument of the gay movement today boils down to the following: Homosexuals are born that way, and heterosexuals are born that way; therefore, homosexual liberation poses no threat to the status quo and dominance of heterosupremacy. This is the old \"nature versus nurture\" argument dressed up in new, accommodationist clothes.\n \n The theoretical poverty of this view can be seen in the fact that many people&#8212;including, no doubt, some in this room&#8212;change their sexual behavior depending on the circumstances or over the course of their lives. If there is a genetic basis for homosexuality and heterosexuality&#8212;that is, our behavior is determined by our genes, rather than myriad social and cultural variables that differ from person to person&#8212;it is not as distinct and mutually exclusive categories, but as potentials for varieties of sexual expression that lie within everyone's reach. (This line of antighetto thinking has been eloquently expressed by the late Italian gay activist Mario Mieli in his book, Homosexuality and Liberation.)\n \n The real motivation behind this revival of the \"inborn\" argument is political, not scientific. The gay assimilationists want to become part of an existing, inequitable capitalist society, not change that society in any fundamental way. Their approach is inherently selfish, not altruistic. They seek minor adjustments in the status quo, not radical social change. They have been co-opted by the heterosupremacist power structure.\n \n One obvious contradiction in the assimilationist position is that if homosexual identity is inborn, as they say, then why do they oppose freedom of sexual expression for minors? Assimilationists argue that sexual identity is fixed by age six, but they deny young people the right to enjoy sexual pleasure with the person of their own choice. For them, \"protection\" is the key word, not \"liberation\"; they call on the state to \"protect\" young people from expressing and exploring their own sexual behavior. They want to \"protect\" young people from \"dirty old men\" (I, incidentally, am speaking as a \"dirty gay old man\" &#8212;something I take as a positive goal), but in reality are protecting them from themselves. They support criminalization of young people's sexuality, especially if it involves sex with an adult man. They condemn any adult who helps a young person to explore his or her sexuality. They are like parents&#8212;only worse, because they pretend to offer a guide to the gay future.\n \n Of course, money plays a role in this too. This is very clear, for example, in the many scandals in the United States over sex between priests and youths, in which the Catholic church has paid out millions of dollars in an effort to resolve them. If, as has happened frequently in these scandals, (1) the boy came back regularly over a period of years in order to have sex with the priest, and (2) the \"victim\" waited twenty to thirty years before denouncing the priest, one is entitled to wonder whether his motive was not financial above all; and if there is a sense of guilt, it results mainly from the medieval and hypocritical attitude of the church, and not automatically, nor necessarily, from the sexual relationship itself.\n \n There are also a growing number of gay child protection agencies (I call them \"boy dick protection societies\"), youth support organizations, groups that work with abused children and runaways (victims of family violence) who are receiving money from the state. But that money is available only if these agencies parrot the official antisexual (or antihomosexual) line of the state funders.\n \n In Minnesota, for example, these gay agencies do not fight to remove the sodomy statute. Minnesota is considered to be one of the most liberal states in the United States (and has had openly gay and lesbian legislators for more than a decade), but the gay assimilationists barely acknowledge that the state still has a sodomy statute when more than half of the others have eliminated theirs, and this more than two hundred years after the French Revolution repealed the French law. They are lapdogs of the ruling-class parties who prefer cocktail parties with the oppressor as a way of protesting against oppression. They also refuse to call for a lowering or a repeal of the age-of-consent laws (in Minnesota, the age of consent for heterosexual sex&#8212;because homosexual sex is still not legal at any age &#8212;is, as it is in Mexico, 18). The state also has no \"emancipation of minors\" law, something that is desperately needed to empower minors who cannot live with abusive families; but the gay youth protection agencies maintain a deafening silence about the need for such a law. They do not wish to confront the antisexual policies of the state, because the state is paying their salaries, and they have become like pigs at the trough. As the great black leader Malcolm X once said: \"When they lay those dollars on you, your soul goes.\"\n \n The German penal code in the nineteenth century set the age of consent at 14. In 1897, the Scientific Humanitarian Committee began circulating a petition calling for repeal of the sodomy statute (a campaign that lasted twenty-five years, without success). It hoped to make its proposal more palatable to the authorities by proposing that, in exchange for repeal of the statute, the age of consent be raised to 16! It thereby began a trend, which has continued in the gay movement to this day, to shift the focus away from the consensual nature of sexual acts toward achieving greater sexual elbow room for adults at the direct expense of others&#8212;boy-lovers and young people, whose relationships they know (or ought to know) are no less consensual.\n \n The writer John Henry Mackay expressed indignation at the efforts of Hirschfeld's committee to trade off an increase in the age of consent for repeal of Paragraph 175. In his 1907 pamphlet Geh\u00f6r! Nur einen Augenblick! (Listen! Only a Moment!), he noted that \"No law can protect youth from seduction. Only enlightenment can do that.\" Instead of the law, we should trust the unwritten \"law of love.\" He denounced \"professional seducers of youth\" who would seduce a boy \"before he has reached the time of maturity,\" but noted that everyone is different and therefore age cannot be the criterion: \"This is where the borderline lies, and not in an artificial stipulation of age. One person is mature, yet still looks like a child; the next person is still a child, although we take him to be mature on account of his age.\"[2]Summarizing his struggle in 1912, he concluded: \"it is our task, those of us who love young people, to win them for ourselves&#8212;not through persuasion and seduction, but through love and friendship.\"[3] In 1924, Mackay voiced bitterness at the efforts of Hirschfeld and others to accommodate themselves to prejudices against man/boy love:\n \n For it has been shown again in these years that this love has to look for its worst enemies among those who call themselves \"leaders\" in this fight and have made themselves responsible, in one of their ridiculous and degrading petitions to those currently in power, who have publicly advocated an \"age of consent\"&#8212;not for children, but for mature boys and youths&#8212;and thereby the prosecution and punishment of those whom they know, as no others do, to be just as innocent as themselves, and once again those who love an older age have sought to save themselves at the cost of the comrades-in-fate of their time&#8212;a betrayal of the cause more disgraceful in intention and more dreadful in its result cannot be imagined.[4]\n \n A more recent example of this tendency to seek improvements for some at the expense of others was the decision of the state of Wisconsin in May 1983 to decriminalize consensual homosexual sex between adults. Tacked onto the measure was an amendment that increased from a misdemeanor to a felony sex between and adult and a teenager of 16 or 17 years of age! This attack on the sexual rights of young people sailed through the legislature without any outcry from the lesbian and gay movement.\n \n In the early part of the twentieth century, pederasts reacted to the stifling and sex-repressive atmosphere of pre&#8211;World War I Germany by celebrating nudity and the beauty of the body. Glorification of the male body \u00e0 la ancient Greece made it possible to depict and discuss a universal aspect of human sexuality in the face of widespread ignorance, the increasing medicalization of homosexuality, and repressive legislation. Together with this glorification of the male body, however, went a tendency on the part of some pederasts to denigrate other forms of sexual expression&#8212;particularly between two adult members of the \"third sex\"&#8212;and even misogyny. Friedlaender, for example, went so far as to reject Marxism and Social Democracy on the grounds that their support for the right of women to vote demonstrated that they had caved in to pressure from women!\n \n Such views were strongly criticized by other pederasts. One of them, Edwin Bab, wrote several articles at the beginning of this century that remain strikingly contemporary in their analysis. For him, the goal of the boy-love movement was \"a fundamental reform of our morals,\" and this could not be accomplished in isolation from the women's movement, let alone in opposition to it. He accused Friedlaender of having developed \"the most reactionary viewpoints,\" and warned boy-lovers against allowing their \"cult of the love of friends to drag along with it a contempt for women similar to the position of the woman in ancient Greece.\" Both the boy-love movement and the women's movement, he argued, \"unquestionably must work hand in hand.\" If both movements could join forces, he hoped, \"in the not too distant future, a truly human culture would bloom.\"[5]Adolf Brand, Mackay, and Elisar von Kupffer all opposed Friedlaender's misogynist views. Unfortunately, however, in view of the antisexual trends within the women's movement over the past twenty years, Bab's views were overly optimistic.\n \n Mackay saw as the greatest mistakes of the German gay movement the following: (1) an attempt to present this love as \"nobler and better,\" when in reality it is \"a love like any other, neither better nor worse,\" and equally able to bring happiness if it is a true love; (2) an attempt \"to promote the freedom of men to love, at the expense of women\"; and (3) a final error, which was \"more disastrous, in my view, than all the others\": \"This love, persecuted by judges and damned by priests, has fled to the medical doctors, as if it were a sickness that could be cured by them.\"[6]\n \n Parallel to, and overlapping with, the early pederast movement in Germany were the Wandervogel and youth movements. The first Wandervogel group was founded in 1896, the year the first issue of Der Eigene appeared. By 1913, there were approximately 800 different Wandervogel groups, with more than 25,000 members. The Wandervogel (which literally means \"migratory bird\") was initially all-male, and organized youth into outdoor activities such as hiking and camping. It represented a reaction to the constraints of bourgeois society. The movement continued off and on until it was largely subsumed by the Hitler Youth.\n \n It was not a gay movement, and its ideology was \"lead and be led.\" The Wandervogel institutionalized homoerotic sentiment&#8212;though not necessarily sex&#8212;between leaders and followers. This outlook contained an inherent ambiguity: it institutionalized something like the Greek mentor relationship on the one hand, but, on the other, contained an implicit militaristic potential. Today, most of us would find the combination of homoeroticism and leadership outlook less appealing than the free development of all forms of tenderness and true democracy.[7]\n \n One of the leading figures in the Wandervogel movement was Hans Bl\u00fcher, who joined in 1902 at the age of 14. He was a misogynist who believed in the innate inferiority of women&#8212;yet also that bisexuality was the natural human condition. Homosexual and bisexual men, in his view, make the best teachers of the young&#8212;a view strikingly expressed by Friedlaender too: \"Only he who is a good pederast can be a perfect pedagogue.\"\n \n Bl\u00fcher professed disgust with Hirschfeld and his circle, and said that the campaign to repeal Paragraph 175 \"was of no interest whatsoever to me.\" Homosexuality, he said, should be accepted, not tolerated. Everyone has a gay component, so knowledge about homosexuality benefits everyone. Homosexuality is more social than heterosexuality, which leads to isolated coupling, whereas homoeroticism naturally gives rise to larger social units, such as nation-states.\n \n Such views contain some insight, but also have their problems, and are not of much relevance to today. Where the Wandervogel movement looked to leadership and guidance of the young (still preferable to the \"protection\" approach of today's gay assimilationists), the pederast movement today stresses the liberation and empowerment of young people. Instead of pedagogy, democracy. Rather than a Greek-love mentor relationship, the companionship of independent and autonomous individuals. In place of male supremacy, a vision of sexual, economic, and political liberation for all. Freedom is indivisible. The liberation of children, women, boy-lovers, and homosexuals in general, can occur only as complementary facets of the same dream.\n \n Having touched on a few of the historical and ideological aspects of our topic, I would like to conclude on a more personal note. As middle-class gays become increasingly part of the mainstream, and turn their backs on the ideas that gave rise to and inspired their movement&#8212;and even on comrades who fought the heterosexual dictatorship before they themselves had come out&#8212;and as the ruling class steps up its efforts to control, police, and instill fear in the population, and as it passes laws criminalizing more and more things, and builds prisons at a breakneck pace to hold the millions it has criminalized (huge numbers of whom are imprisoned for consensual and harmless activity, such as possession of marijuana), life and survival for men and boys who love each other is becoming extremely dangerous. To be an active pederast in the United States today is like being a Jew in Nazi Germany. The United States is becoming&#8212;perhaps already has become&#8212;a police state. The backlash against the increased visibility of homosexuality since the Stonewall Riots in 1969 is striking pederasts most severely. Thousands are currently in jail in the United States for purely consensual relationships, and the gay movement will not lift a finger or a voice in protest. All the liberation movements of the 1960s&#8212;blacks, women, homosexuals, the left&#8212;have either moved to the right or, in the case of the left, virtually disappeared. The women's movement and the gay movement have fallen in love with the state and seem no longer able to differentiate between their friends and their enemies. In fact, these days, the gay movement in the United States functions more as an adjunct of the police than as a movement for liberation. Nowadays, I sometimes feel as if I need to be liberated from assimilationist gay men and lesbians as much as I do from heterosupremacy, capitalism, and police repression.\n \n It is difficult to identify with a movement whose primary goals are to win official approval for gay marriage, gay families, and acceptance in the imperialist military. Homosexuals in the United States seem intent on demonstrating that they can be as conventional as heterosexuals. These days, I have to struggle with myself not to be antigay.\n \n In April of this year, Edward Brongersma, a distinguished Dutch political leader and writer, as well as a pederast, died. He was well known for having once spent time in jail for his sexuality, yet eventually rose to a seat in the Dutch Senate. In that capacity, he proposed a bill to lower the age of consent to 16, and the bill was adopted with widespread support, including from the church. Yet, the antisex hysteria that originated in the United States in the late 1970s has reached Holland as well as other countries in Europe. Brongersma was forced to flee his home temporarily by hostile mobs after the wave of hysteria caused by the Dutroux affair in neighboring Belgium reached the Netherlands. Brongersma saw everything he had worked for wiped out in eighteen months. He died a broken man. He was cremated in private within 48 hours of his death, and no obituaries or even death announcements were issued for fear of hostile public reactions.\n \n In Minnesota, a highly respected and prominent gay man who has worked with youth for years in state-funded agencies was recently forced to leave his position when parents discovered that he had an 18-year-old boyfriend (hence, not even a minor). The gay movement has maintained a deafening silence about this.\n \n In my own case, my boyfriend is now 18, but when he was 16 I could not approach any gay or state agencies for assistance with schooling or anything else for fear that moralists and television reporters would turn our life into a living hell. The law stipulates that any person who works in counseling, psychiatry, psychology, social work, teaching, and so on, who merely suspects that an illegal sexual relationship may be going on, must report it to the authorities. Investigation, harassment, hysterical and inaccurate publicity, arrest, and imprisonment are the likely result. Ten or twenty years ago, the gay movement would have been a source of support for such relationships. Today, it is virtually indistinguishable from the heterosexist dictatorship itself.\n \n Pederasty, like homosexuality, has existed, and exists, in all societies that have ever been studied. Homoeroticism is a ubiquitous feature of human experience, as even efforts to repress it confirm. Men and youths have always been attracted to each other, and, like homosexuality in general, their love is irrepressible. Even if it is far from triumphing, or flowering with the freedom it merits and has enjoyed in some other cultures (for example, Siwa oasis in Egypt), still, it can never be repressed. It will continue to find its way to expression despite all the efforts to suppress and demonize it. As John Henry Mackay wrote in 1924 in The Books of the Nameless Love:\n \n Pederasty and Homosexuality - William A. Percy",

Sad thing is what that person said is the truth, you people run with anything to try to taint or tarnish the image of the LGBT community in anyways you can because you can't stand us for whatever reasons your sad mind can conjure up.\n\n \n I didn't ask for evidence of some kind Jason, I asked for evidence that specifically refuted the evidence I posted which proved that NAMBLA and the movement to legalize sex with children was founded within the homosexual community. You end up posting a false claim by a blogger which has no basis in fact in reality. In order for your claim that anyone in the straight community is using that one story, WHICH I WAS COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF PRIOR TO READING YOUR POSTED STORY, in order to assert that all homosexuals are pedophiles because of this one story, you would want to actually post conservative, or christian sites actually making the assertion rather than just posting a homosexual blogger making the accusation. Get it? Your evidence is bogus which means it is nothing more than dishonest propaganda. ",

   "[QUOTE]\nLook CxT, focus for a minute will you? Pay attention to the tactics being used by this dishonest blogger and try to comprehend the validity of the point I made with my pointing out that dishonesty. Here's the link to his claims and my response once again: http://www.4forums.com/political/363654-post110.html\n \n Here's the scam/lie in a nutshell. Jasons blogger is saying this in his headline: \"Anti-Gay Extremists Cite Gay Pedophile As Typical Of All Gays\" And he goes on to offer alleged quotes of people without actually linking to the source of their claims which actually assert such beliefs. He is making a sweeping generalization without offering even one actual conservative source which has made this claim at all. It is a classic case of propaganda through false affiliation by asserting that the anti-gay extremists are doing something he can't prove is being done at all. \n\n \n \n I see what you are saying, however, I'm less concerned with what some blogger thinks than I am with how you perceive the gay 'community'. For instance, you keep repeating that NAMBLA was started 'within the gay community' as if that somehow transfers some of the guilt to homosexuals that aren't pedophiles. Homosexuals who aren't pedophiles bear no more responsibility for pedophiles who molest little boys than you or I do for pedophiles who molest little girls. Let's leave pro/anti gay groups out of it for a bit and get down to our personal beliefs. As far as gay leaders or even the gay community, let me ask you a question. Is there anyone in our 'conservative' community that speaks for us all? When McCain makes a speech are you and I bound as conservatives to espouse everything he says? Let's take just me and you... do you think we feel the same way about Sara Palin? What about Mark Sanford? Since he is (was?) a conservative 'leader,' does that mean we're also responsible for his transgressions? I'd say no. Just like your average gay isn't in the least answerable to NAMBLA.\n \n \n \nAnd all to remove focus from the fact that this individuals crime was of the most despicable kind of sexual abuse against his own son. Even in reporting about that crime, he had to find a way to make the homosexual community a victim of the straight community. When will these dishonest hypocrites ever come to the point when they can report on a story about their own community without attempting to capitalize on it in some propagandistic way by blaming someone else in order to minimize their own responsibility?\n\n \n Again, by treating the gay community as a unit, rather than a group of individuals who happen to have the same sexual orientation, you are making sweeping generalizations of your own. I'm fairly sure we've agreed that gays abhor pedophilia as straights do. If we agree on that, we should say so and move on to the next issue.",

If you take the time to reflect on it, talk to some gay folks, I think you'd see that they really want the same things as you do.

   "Founded within the homosexual community. See? here we go again. You broaden the influence of these pedophiles to the point to where you think they hold some sway or influence within the gay community which they do not. \n\n \n Really? Where did I comment on their influence at all? I referred to the early construct within the community and the struggle which exists even today between the two factions. The Pederasts continue to war against the political wing which they believe has betrayed the original principles which homosexuals stood for. So stop attempting to deny the truth by playing a game of semantics. And learn the truth of what your own community has stood for, and only abandoned in order to gain political acceptance. Not for any reason of moral disgust for their original values at all. \n The issue of love between men and boys has intersected the gay movement since the late nineteenth century, with the rise of the first gay rights movement in Germany. In the United States, as the gay movement has retreated from its vision of sexual liberation, in favor of integration and assimilation into existing social and political structures, it has increasingly sought to marginalize and even demonize cross-generational love. Pederasty-that is, love between a man and a youth of 12 to 18 years of age-say middle-class homosexuals, lesbians, and feminists, has nothing to do with gay liberation. Some go so far as to claim, absurdly, that it is a heterosexual phenomenon, or even \"sexual abuse.\" What a travesty!\n \n Pederasty is the main form that male homosexuality has acquired throughout Western civilization-and not only in the West! Pederasty is inseparable from the high points of Western culture-ancient Greece and the Renaissance.\n \n In Germany, in the late nineteenth century, pederasty was an integral part of the new gay movement. The first gay journal in the world-Der Eigene, published beginning in 1896 (one year before the formation of the first homosexual rights group, the Scientific Humanitarian Committee of Magnus Hirschfeld)-was a pederast and anarchist journal \"for male culture\" with an individualist anarchist outlook based on the ideas of Max Stirner (author of Der Einzige und sein Eigentum). Its publisher, Adolf Brand, was a leading figure of the gay movement throughout the first decades, until the Nazis came to power. The journal continued to appear until 1933. Brand died in an Allied bombing of Berlin in 1945.\n \n Another leading pederast and writer, Benedict Friedlaender, was also a leader of Hirschfeld's committee, until 1908 when he committed suicide. Not unlike today, the two groups-the pederasts in the Gemeinschaft der Eigenen (the Community of Self-Owners) and the Hirschfeld group-constituted two wings of the gay movement. Although they collaborated in some things (for example, both opposed the sodomy statute, Paragraph 175), sharp ideological and scientific differences separated them. In uncanny ways, many of these differences persist in the quite different circumstances of today.\n \n With the spread of the medical model of homosexuality in the late nineteenth century came an increasing influence of doctors and psychiatrists in the gay movement. These viewed homosexuals as a \"third sex,\" or as \"intermediate sexual types\" (Zwischenstufen in German), a \"male soul trapped in a female body\" (or vice versa for lesbians)-a view advanced by Hirschfeld. The pederasts actively combated this view. They believed in an inherent bisexuality of human beings and argued that the influence of the medical profession gave the gay movement the aura of a hospital. Most felt that younger and older males were naturally attracted to each other and that pederasty was a positive good for society because it helped to socialize young males and provided them with a necessary sexual outlet, thereby reducing undesirable social phenomena such as unwanted pregnancies and prostitution. A few (Hans Bl\u00fcher, for example, famous for his book on the Wandervogel movement) believed that pederasty and male bonding provided a basis for a stronger nation and state-a view that, in a perverted form, found a distorted expression in the militarism of the Hitler Youth.\n \n Friedlaender, for example, ridiculed the concept of \"a poor womanly soul languishing away in a man's body, and of the `third sex,'\" and attacked the third sex concept as \"degrading and a beggarly...pleading for sympathy.\" He insisted on a historical approach that also took into account anthropological evidence, and wrote: \"A glance at the cultures of countries before and outside of Christianity suffices to show the complete untenability of the [Zwischenstufen] theory. Especially in ancient Greece, most of the military leaders, artists, and thinkers would have had to be 'psychic hermaphrodites.'\" [1]\n \n In their critique of the third-sex concept and their recognition of the ambiguities and potential bisexuality of the human animal, the pederasts had their feet more securely on the ground than did the larger \"mainstream\" gay movement. The third-sex argument has been thoroughly discredited for years.\n \n Increasingly, the assimilationist gay and lesbian groups in the United States, in a kind of throwback to the nineteenth century, argue that homosexuality is inborn, that it is genetically determined (\"we can't help it that we're gay, we were born that way, so please don't discriminate against us\"-an echo of the nineteenth-century argument that practically solicits pity and that in no way challenges the built-in social repression of same-sex love). The middle-class gay movement today seeks special treatment for a special kind of person who has adopted a \"gay\" identity-\"gay people\"-rather than seeking to liberate the repressed sexual potential of everyone. For them, what matters is identity, not practice. The basic argument of the gay movement today boils down to the following: Homosexuals are born that way, and heterosexuals are born that way; therefore, homosexual liberation poses no threat to the status quo and dominance of heterosupremacy. This is the old \"nature versus nurture\" argument dressed up in new, accommodationist clothes.\n \n The theoretical poverty of this view can be seen in the fact that many people-including, no doubt, some in this room-change their sexual behavior depending on the circumstances or over the course of their lives. If there is a genetic basis for homosexuality and heterosexuality-that is, our behavior is determined by our genes, rather than myriad social and cultural variables that differ from person to person-it is not as distinct and mutually exclusive categories, but as potentials for varieties of sexual expression that lie within everyone's reach. (This line of antighetto thinking has been eloquently expressed by the late Italian gay activist Mario Mieli in his book, Homosexuality and Liberation.)\n \n The real motivation behind this revival of the \"inborn\" argument is political, not scientific. The gay assimilationists want to become part of an existing, inequitable capitalist society, not change that society in any fundamental way. Their approach is inherently selfish, not altruistic. They seek minor adjustments in the status quo, not radical social change. They have been co-opted by the heterosupremacist power structure.\n ",

I have studied the history of the gay rights movement from Stonewall to Harvey Milk, and there has NEVER been any such warring discord between gays who support pedophilia, and those that don't.\n \n What the gay community stands against is morally corrupt close minded devious bigots. What we stand against are these lies and misleading so called \"facts\" your kind throw at the general public to confuse and spread uncertainty about us.\n \n We have never abandoned such sickening devious acceptance of pedophilia. Because we never advocated, nor would we ever! And as far as to gain political acceptance? Maybe you should read a newspaper sometime and see the political machine we fight against to maintain even the small amount of rights we do have!\n \n And as far as \"original\" values. I know what that's code for Archie. That's code for not gay ethics, or anything to do with gays at all! It's you so called \"morals\" Archie. It's code for your corrupt thinking and demonizing of gays that shows just how far you have tumbled down the rabbit hole into wonderland... \n \n I can now say without a shadow of a doubt that not only are you a few fries short of a happy meal, but you also scheme and plant seeds of discord and false evidence posted as \"fact\" to really really drive home how evil and corrupt you think gays and lesbians really are.\n\n \n  Thorstad and Percy are members of your community Jason, not mine. and you can go ballistic and have tantrums all day long as you lash out at me for simply posting speeches from your fellow militant homosexuals. But all of the blustering and denials in the world by you wont negate what people are reading with their own eyes regarding the true history of the homosexual movement that these men have outlined so clearly. Here's what I mean Jason...\n The issue of love between men and boys has intersected the gay movement since the late nineteenth century, with the rise of the first gay rights movement in Germany. In the United States, as the gay movement has retreated from its vision of sexual liberation, in favor of integration and assimilation into existing social and political structures, it has increasingly sought to marginalize and even demonize cross-generational love. Pederasty-that is, love between a man and a youth of 12 to 18 years of age-say middle-class homosexuals, lesbians, and feminists, has nothing to do with gay liberation. Some go so far as to claim, absurdly, that it is a heterosexual phenomenon, or even \"sexual abuse.\" What a travesty!\n Note the bolded in its proper context. It sounds just like foundit as he argues ad infinitum that it is straight men who sexually molest boys, but never homosexuals. I must respect at least one thing about these pro- pedophile homosexual activists, and that is that at least they are honest about who they are and what they represent.\n Pederasty is the main form that male homosexuality has acquired throughout Western civilization-and not only in the West! Pederasty is inseparable from the high points of Western culture-ancient Greece and the Renaissance.\n \n Need I say more when Thorstad has said it all, himself?\n In Germany, in the late nineteenth century, pederasty was an integral part of the new gay movement. The first gay journal in the world-Der Eigene, published beginning in 1896 (one year before the formation of the first homosexual rights group, the Scientific Humanitarian Committee of Magnus Hirschfeld)-was a pederast and anarchist journal \"for male culture\" with an individualist anarchist outlook based on the ideas of Max Stirner (author of Der Einzige und sein Eigentum). Its publisher, Adolf Brand, was a leading figure of the gay movement throughout the first decades, until the Nazis came to power. The journal continued to appear until 1933. Brand died in an Allied bombing of Berlin in 1945.\n \n Another leading pederast and writer, Benedict Friedlaender, was also a leader of Hirschfeld's committee, until 1908 when he committed suicide. Not unlike today, the two groups-the pederasts in the Gemeinschaft der Eigenen (the Community of Self-Owners) and the Hirschfeld group-constituted two wings of the gay movement. Although they collaborated in some things (for example, both opposed the sodomy statute, Paragraph 175), sharp ideological and scientific differences separated them. In uncanny ways, many of these differences persist in the quite different circumstances of today.\n And here we have the founding fathers of this movement and a description of the split which has evolved over time. The bolded says it all, really. Unless you are in complete denial of your communities roots which you obviously are. Here's the whole speech, I'm tired of spoon feeding it to you. Just know that every time it's reposted, more people read it.\n \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/363635-post100.html\n",

Thorstad is a freak if he advocates sex with kids and most homosexuals would agree.\n\n \n No it isn't just one dudes opinion. If you actually read the numerous links I have sourced to, you would see that in his historical study he refers to dozens of names of people as early leaders of the homosexual movement going back to the 19th century; most whom were dedicated to CONTINUING the historical culture of cross generation sex with boys and making it an acceptable practice in the modern world as it was in the ancient Greek and Roman cultures.\n \n \nYou are taking one guy's #### and extrapolating that to mean that gays are based in pedophillia and that ( some substantial portion) of them support sex with kids. You can't make that leap just because Thorstad said so....\n\n \n What Thorstad has shown, and the history of homosexuality itself proves is that it as a culture and community is founded in this practice of Pederasty. Sorry if that grates on your sensibilities, but it is the truth which you seem unwilling to accept. According to that history, the modern american homosexual movement has betrayed its roots for social and political acceptance.\n \n And the danger of ignoring this reality is that once this group attains complete acceptance in main stream society, there is no reason to believe they wont then go back and continue on to gain acceptance of this original agenda in order to complete their vision of remaking society in their image.\n \n \nAre you kidding? Straight guys have been raping virgins (legally at that) since WAYYYYY back, even at times when you'd be burned at the stake for being gay.\n\n \n And your point is? I mean, what does this have to do with our discussion? You are debating just like the homosexuals now by attempting to reroute the discussion by saying that straights rape women also. But it's a red herring because what straights do has no bearing on what homosexuals have represented as a culture, or with this debate in any way.\n \n \nAgain, this is one guy with an agenda. Not the 'duly elected spokesperson for gays.' Just one dude...\n\n \n This is a homosexual founder of NAMBLA who is using the history of the movement to justify his place in that movement. You can't just disregard or marginalize him because you don't like his message. After all, nobody dislikes his message more than I do. I only post his history of the homosexual movement because you can't find one homosexual source which disputes the accuracy of it as documented by the men I have posted here.\n \n \nSlavery is in the USA's history...but it has nothing to do with our country today. Germany's history involves the holocaust, does that mean they hate Jews today?\n\n \n You refuse to accept the relevance of the info without extrapolating that I am implying that all current homosexuals must be pedophiles. \n \n \nAre you kidding? Straight men don't like young women? When's the last time you saw an 80 y/o sportscar model?\n\n \n Straight men who are attracted to prepubescent girls are also considered pedophiles. That isn't the norm in the straight culture as it was considered to be in the early homosexual culture according to their admitted history. And just because you don't like that history, it does nothing to change it.\n \n \nNo, you are claim that Thorstad is defining the 'movement'. There's a difference.\n\n \n Thorstand is documenting the history of the homosexual culture and movement. The reason why the homosexuals on this site have been so silent is because they know that they can't refute the facts he documents. Only Jason has attempted to scream and insult me down but he has just exposed his ignorance of his own culture since he hasn't refuted anything because what I have posted is irrefutable history of the homosexual community.

   "Study #1\n In 1978 psychologist Nicholas Groth screened 175 men who had been convicted in Massachusetts of sexual molestation of children and referred by a court for psychological evaluation. He found not a single gay man in this sample. Every one of the perpetrators was either an exclusive heterosexual, a bisexual with a predominantly heterosexual orientation, or a fixated pedophile with no sexual interest in adults.[4]\n \n His conclusion? That \"the adult heterosexual male constitutes a greater risk to the underage child than does the adult homosexual male.\"\n Playing the Pedophilia Card\n =====================================================\n Study #2\n \n In the same year, researcher David Newton reviewed the scientific literature and found no reason to believe that anything other than a \"random connection\" existed between homosexual orientation and child molestation.[5]\n Playing the Pedophilia Card\n =====================================================\n Study #3\n \n In 1988, renowned sex researcher Kurt Freund at the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry in Toronto studied two groups of paid volunteers and found that gay men responded no more to male child stimuli than heterosexual men responded to female child stimuli.[6] He later described as a \"myth\" the notion that gay men are more likely than straight men to be child molesters.[7]\n Playing the Pedophilia Card \n =====================================================\n Study #4\n \n In 1992, alarmed over claims made during a campaign for an anti-gay state constitutional amendment in Colorado, two physicians reviewed every case of suspected child molestation evaluated at Children's Hospital in Denver over a one-year period. Of the 269 cases determined to involve molestation by an adult, only two of the perpetrators could be identified as gay or lesbian. The researchers concluded that the risk of child sexual abuse by an identifiably gay or lesbian person was between zero and 3.1%, and that the risk of such abuse by the heterosexual partner of a relative was over 100 times greater.[8]\n Playing the Pedophilia Card\n =====================================================\n Study #5\n \n A 1994 study found that \"a child's risk of being molest ed by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is 100 times greater than by someone who might be identified as a homosexual.

Sexual orientation: More than 70 percent of the men who molest boys rate themselves as heterosexual in their adult sexual preferences. In addition, 9 percent report that they are equally heterosexual and homosexual. Only 8 percent report that they are exclusively homosexual. The majority of the men who molest boys are also married, divorced, widowed, or living with an adult partner.\n Child Molestation Research & Prevention Institute\n =======================================================\n Study #7\n \n Seventy-seven percent of perpetrators of maltreatment were parents and 11% were other relatives of the victims.

In one study of 269 cases of child sexual abuse, only two offenders were gay or lesbian. Of the cases studied involving molestation of a boy by a man, 74 percent of the men were or had been in a heterosexual relationship with the boy's mother or another female relative. The study concluded that \"a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is over 100 times greater than by someone who might be identifiable as being homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual.\"10 \n http://archive.aclu.org/issues/gay/parent.html \n =====================================================\n \n General Note:\n \n The American Psychological Association, the National Association of Social Workers, the American Academy of Child Psychiatrists and the Child Welfare League of America all have policy statements stating there is no correlation between homosexuality and child abuse. \n \n When asked about this question, the American Psychiatric Association wrote to the Senate stating: \"While we are all concerned by the issu of sexual abuse, there is no credible evidence that lesbians and gay men are more likely to commit such offenses than others.

   "[QUOTE][QUOTE]\n\n And the danger of ignoring this reality is that once this group attains complete acceptance in main stream society, there is no reason to believe they wont then go back and continue on to gain acceptance of this original agenda in order to complete their vision of remaking society in their image.\n\n \n \n Ok, I guess we'll never agree on this. If you think that pedestry doesn't turn homosexuals' stomachs every bit as much as yours or mine, then we don't even need to continue.\n \n \nAnd your point is? I mean, what does this have to do with our discussion? You are debating just like the homosexuals now by attempting to reroute the discussion by saying that straights rape women also. But it's a red herring because what straights do has no bearing on what homosexuals have represented as a culture, or with this debate in any way.\n\n \n My point is that one guys sickness says nothing about what's in someone else's head/heart.\n \n \n \n \nThis is a homosexual founder of NAMBLA who is using the history of the movement to justify his place in that movement. You can't just disregard or marginalize him because you don't like his message. After all, nobody dislikes his message more than I do. I only post his history of the homosexual movement because you can't find one homosexual source which disputes the accuracy of it as documented by the men I have posted here.\n\n \n Yes, this guy is the FOUNDER of NAMBLA!!! You don't think he doesn't have an AGENDA? Arch, we talk about how people are constantly trying to rewrite history. Why wouldn't that apply here?\n \n \nYou refuse to accept the relevance of the info without extrapolating that I am implying that all current homosexuals must be pedophiles. \n\n \n \n No, I refuse to conclude that pederasty has anymore to do with homosexuality than it does with heterosexuality. I hold that it has nothing to do with either! Pederasty is an evil, it is born of violence and force. Homo/hetero-sexuality are two sides of the same coin..the natural state into which one is born.\n \n \n \nStraight men who are attracted to prepubescent girls are also considered pedophiles. That isn't the norm in the straight culture as it was considered to be in the early homosexual culture according to their admitted history. And just because you don't like that history, it does nothing to change it.\n\n \n Again, Historical gayness has nothing to do with anyone alive today anymore than I own slaves or the Germans are trying to kill the jews. And you're just plain wrong if you think that gays are somehow plotting to 'get' your kids (or anyone else's), as I said they mostly just want to be left alone.\n \n \n \n \nThorstand is documenting the history of the homosexual culture and movement. The reason why the homosexuals on this site have been so silent is because they know that they can't refute the facts he documents. Only Jason has attempted to scream and insult me down but he has just exposed his ignorance of his own culture since he hasn't refuted anything because what I have posted is irrefutable history of the homosexual community. It is much more than just Thorstads preferred beliefs.\n\n \n \n We'd be quick to accuse the left of rewriting history to fit their agenda on any other thread, why wouldn't we think this guy would do it here?!?!?",

Of the 269 cases determined to involve molestation by an adult, only two of the perpetrators could be identified as gay or lesbian. The researchers concluded that the risk of child sexual abuse by an identifiably gay or lesbian person was between zero and 3.1%, and that the risk of such abuse by the heterosexual partner of a relative was over 100 times greater.[8]\n Playing the Pedophilia Card\n =====================================================\n Study #5\n \n A 1994 study found that \"a child's risk of being molest ed by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is 100 times greater than by someone who might be identified as a homosexual.

His five victims sat looking forward in the gallery.

   " Thorstad and Percy are members of your community Jason, not mine. and you can go ballistic and have tantrums all day long as you lash out at me for simply posting speeches from your fellow militant homosexuals. But all of the blustering and denials in the world by you wont negate what people are reading with their own eyes regarding the true history of the homosexual movement that these men have outlined so clearly. Here's what I mean Jason...\n\n \n Thorstad and Percy are not members of the gay community Archie. We don; embrace pedophiles. They are members of groups that support pedophilia. I have not seen their names in any LGBT rights group fund raising or protest mentioned supporting the gay community. \n \n And Archie they are not one of my fellow \"militant homosexuals\". I just love you paint us as militants, as enemies to some fabricated world of delusion you indulge yourself in on a daily basis. \n \n And the true history of the gay movement is not one of pedophilia Archie. It began with the Stonewall riots back in 1969 to voice that we were not going to be quiet and were going to stand up for gay right, not the rights of pedophiles. Harvey Milk did not die for the rights of pedophiles, in fact he fought against the very fabricated lies you spew against proposition 6, which painted gays as those who prey on children, as pedophiles in the public school system and would have them fired if they were openly gay.\n \n Anita Bryant, John Briggs, and all those people fought with a zealous fervor for prop 6 because they based their so called \"facts\" off of lunacy and christian dogma. Playing off the same old stigma's and stereotypes that your ilk have done for decades.\n \n \n \nAnd here we have the founding fathers of this movement and a description of the split which has evolved over time. The bolded says it all, really. Unless you are in complete denial of your communities roots which you obviously are. Here's the whole speech, I'm tired of spoon feeding it to you. Just know that every time it's reposted, more people read it.\n\n \n You say roots Archie. You say that at one time all gays were pedophiles then had some split. Thats ######## Archie and you know it is. Pedophilia in general is a mental illness of those that do it. If you had forgotten in the early seventies the APA clearly stated that homosexuality was not a mental illness. \n \n As far as spoon feeding me sorry Archie but like I said you don't need to convince me of anything. I already know the truth and the history behind the gay rights movement? And why do I know about it? \n \n Well because I am part of that movement today Archie. I do march in the streets, I am an activist, I post the fliers I talk to those on the streets, in the grocery lines, and I stand up for the US's out there. Because it's the right thing to do.\n \n What you have convinced me of is that there are organized groups of pedophiles trying to justify in some way their horiffic actions including leeching off the gay community and using the very lies the extreme right have used to turn them around and give in their mind clear voyance to do what they wish.\n \n Like I said Archie, no LGBT rights group supports pedophiles. In fact I know they would fight against it and you know why? Because Gays and Lesbians have children of their own!! Do you think these families that raise their kids in loving homes want them around their kids? no! \n \n So stop sitting here and saying that we are somehow linked, stop with your slanderous ######## because I know that if any gay or lesbian couple found out there was a pedophile preying on their kid, they would report them to the authorities or go to that person with a baseball bat.",

The study concluded that \"a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is over 100 times greater than by someone who might be identifiable as being homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual.\"10 \n http://archive.aclu.org/issues/gay/parent.html \n ================================================== ===\n \n \n And lastly, this link is just a repeat of the Sheila Reid link at #5\n \n General Note:\n \n The American Psychological Association, the National Association of Social Workers, the American Academy of Child Psychiatrists and the Child Welfare League of America all have policy statements stating there is no correlation between homosexuality and child abuse. \n \n When asked about this question, the American Psychiatric Association wrote to the Senate stating: \"While we are all concerned by the issu of sexual abuse, there is no credible evidence that lesbians and gay men are more likely to commit such offenses than others. Gay men and lesbians do not pose any particular threat to youth and should not be singled out or discriminated against in any manner.\n Fact Sheet on Sexual Orientation and Child Abuse\n \n \"Mental health professionals agree that pedophilia should never be considered normal, because it is truly a disease. None of the things that make homosexuality a normal variation of human sexuality apply to pedophilia.\"\n - Martin Downs, WebMD Medical News\n \n \"There is no medical evidence to suggest an association between homosexuality and impaired moral judgment.\"\n - Journal of the American Medical Association - Pediatric Forum, March 2001\n \n \"It is ludicrous to identify pedophiles as homosexuals.\"\n - Stan Robson, Chief Deputy, Benton County Sheriffs Department\n (In over 14 years of Robson's work with pedophiles, 498 out of 500 offenders identified themselves as heterosexual.)\n \n \"The vast majority of offenders are heterosexual men. Male offenders who abuse young boys maintain adult heterosexual relationships. The habitual molester of boys is rarely attracted to adult males.\"\n - Roland Summit, M.D. Head Physician, Community Consultation Service, Harbor UCLA Medical Center.\n \n \"The belief that homosexuals are particularly attracted to children is completely unsupported by our data. The child offenders who engaged in adult relationships as well, were heterosexuals. There were no homosexual adult oriented offenders in our samples who turned to children.\"\n - A. Nicholas Groth, Ph.D., Director of the Sex Offender Program, Connecticut Department of Corrections, and Co-Director of the St. Joseph College Institute for the Treatment and Control of Child Sexual Abuse\n \n \"The empirical research does not show that gay or bisexual men are any more likely than heterosexual men to molest children. This is not to argue that homosexual and bisexual men never molest children. But there is no scientific basis for asserting that they are more likely than heterosexual men to do so. And, as explained above, many child molesters cannot be characterized as having an adult sexual orientation at all; they are fixated on children.\"\n -Dept. of Psychology, UC Davis\n \n \"Another myth about homosexuality is the mistaken belief that gay men have more of a tendency than heterosexual men to sexually molest children. There is no evidence to suggest that homosexuals are more likely than heterosexuals to molest children.\"\n - American Psychological Association\n \n So with all of your blustering and intending to make it look like you have posted overwhelming evidence which makes your point. What you have in fact done is repeated the same links, or with held a link, and just posted from gay sources which have an agenda to support and defend. Nice job, really, foundit. So in answer to your accusation that I can't support my claim. Wrong again. Proving your dishonesty is just a matter of clicking on the source.",

They aren't the least bit objective.\n\n See above analysis of Archie hypocrisy, ad nausieum.\n \n \n \nSo with all of your blustering and intending to make it look like you have posted overwhelming evidence which makes your point.

Rather than a Greek-love mentor relationship, the companionship of independent and autonomous individuals. In place of male supremacy, a vision of sexual, economic, and political liberation for all. Freedom is indivisible. The liberation of children, women, boy-lovers, and homosexuals in general, can occur only as complementary facets of the same dream.\"\n \n  The issue of love between men and boys has intersected the gay movement since the late nineteenth century, with the rise of the first gay rights movement in Germany. In the United States, as the gay movement has retreated from its vision of sexual liberation, in favor of integration and assimilation into existing social and political structures, it has increasingly sought to marginalize and even demonize cross-generational love. Pederasty-that is, love between a man and a youth of 12 to 18 years of age-say middle-class homosexuals, lesbians, and feminists, has nothing to do with gay liberation. Some go so far as to claim, absurdly, that it is a heterosexual phenomenon, or even \"sexual abuse.\" What a travesty!\n \n Pederasty is the main form that male homosexuality has acquired throughout Western civilization-and not only in the West! Pederasty is inseparable from the high points of Western culture-ancient Greece and the Renaissance.\n \n In Germany, in the late nineteenth century, pederasty was an integral part of the new gay movement. The first gay journal in the world-Der Eigene, published beginning in 1896 (one year before the formation of the first homosexual rights group, the Scientific Humanitarian Committee of Magnus Hirschfeld)-was a pederast and anarchist journal \"for male culture\" with an individualist anarchist outlook based on the ideas of Max Stirner (author of Der Einzige und sein Eigentum). Its publisher, Adolf Brand, was a leading figure of the gay movement throughout the first decades, until the Nazis came to power. The journal continued to appear until 1933. Brand died in an Allied bombing of Berlin in 1945.\n \n Another leading pederast and writer, Benedict Friedlaender, was also a leader of Hirschfeld's committee, until 1908 when he committed suicide. Not unlike today, the two groups-the pederasts in the Gemeinschaft der Eigenen (the Community of Self-Owners) and the Hirschfeld group-constituted two wings of the gay movement. Although they collaborated in some things (for example, both opposed the sodomy statute, Paragraph 175), sharp ideological and scientific differences separated them. In uncanny ways, many of these differences persist in the quite different circumstances of today.\n \n With the spread of the medical model of homosexuality in the late nineteenth century came an increasing influence of doctors and psychiatrists in the gay movement. These viewed homosexuals as a \"third sex,\" or as \"intermediate sexual types\" (Zwischenstufen in German), a \"male soul trapped in a female body\" (or vice versa for lesbians)-a view advanced by Hirschfeld. The pederasts actively combated this view. They believed in an inherent bisexuality of human beings and argued that the influence of the medical profession gave the gay movement the aura of a hospital. Most felt that younger and older males were naturally attracted to each other and that pederasty was a positive good for society because it helped to socialize young males and provided them with a necessary sexual outlet, thereby reducing undesirable social phenomena such as unwanted pregnancies and prostitution. A few (Hans Bl\u00fcher, for example, famous for his book on the Wandervogel movement) believed that pederasty and male bonding provided a basis for a stronger nation and state-a view that, in a perverted form, found a distorted expression in the militarism of the Hitler Youth.\n \n Friedlaender, for example, ridiculed the concept of \"a poor womanly soul languishing away in a man's body, and of the `third sex,'\" and attacked the third sex concept as \"degrading and a beggarly...pleading for sympathy.\" He insisted on a historical approach that also took into account anthropological evidence, and wrote: \"A glance at the cultures of countries before and outside of Christianity suffices to show the complete untenability of the [Zwischenstufen] theory. Especially in ancient Greece, most of the military leaders, artists, and thinkers would have had to be 'psychic hermaphrodites.'\" [1]\n \n In their critique of the third-sex concept and their recognition of the ambiguities and potential bisexuality of the human animal, the pederasts had their feet more securely on the ground than did the larger \"mainstream\" gay movement. The third-sex argument has been thoroughly discredited for years.\n \n Increasingly, the assimilationist gay and lesbian groups in the United States, in a kind of throwback to the nineteenth century, argue that homosexuality is inborn, that it is genetically determined (\"we can't help it that we're gay, we were born that way, so please don't discriminate against us\"-an echo of the nineteenth-century argument that practically solicits pity and that in no way challenges the built-in social repression of same-sex love). The middle-class gay movement today seeks special treatment for a special kind of person who has adopted a \"gay\" identity-\"gay people\"-rather than seeking to liberate the repressed sexual potential of everyone. For them, what matters is identity, not practice. The basic argument of the gay movement today boils down to the following: Homosexuals are born that way, and heterosexuals are born that way; therefore, homosexual liberation poses no threat to the status quo and dominance of heterosupremacy. This is the old \"nature versus nurture\" argument dressed up in new, accommodationist clothes.\n \n The theoretical poverty of this view can be seen in the fact that many people-including, no doubt, some in this room-change their sexual behavior depending on the circumstances or over the course of their lives. If there is a genetic basis for homosexuality and heterosexuality-that is, our behavior is determined by our genes, rather than myriad social and cultural variables that differ from person to person-it is not as distinct and mutually exclusive categories, but as potentials for varieties of sexual expression that lie within everyone's reach. (This line of antighetto thinking has been eloquently expressed by the late Italian gay activist Mario Mieli in his book, Homosexuality and Liberation.)\n \n The real motivation behind this revival of the \"inborn\" argument is political, not scientific. The gay assimilationists want to become part of an existing, inequitable capitalist society, not change that society in any fundamental way. Their approach is inherently selfish, not altruistic. They seek minor adjustments in the status quo, not radical social change. They have been co-opted by the heterosupremacist power structure.\n \n One obvious contradiction in the assimilationist position is that if homosexual identity is inborn, as they say, then why do they oppose freedom of sexual expression for minors? Assimilationists argue that sexual identity is fixed by age six, but they deny young people the right to enjoy sexual pleasure with the person of their own choice. For them, \"protection\" is the key word, not \"liberation\"; they call on the state to \"protect\" young people from expressing and exploring their own sexual behavior. They want to \"protect\" young people from \"dirty old men\" (I, incidentally, am speaking as a \"dirty gay old man\" -something I take as a positive goal), but in reality are protecting them from themselves. They support criminalization of young people's sexuality, especially if it involves sex with an adult man. They condemn any adult who helps a young person to explore his or her sexuality. They are like parents-only worse, because they pretend to offer a guide to the gay future.Pederasty and Homosexuality - William A. Percy[/QUOTE]\n \n Your analogous conclusion is misplaced and erroneous CxT. The proper conclusion based on the evidence of the Priest Molestation crisis within the Catholic church is that it was caused because for decades and possibly centuries, the RCC built up a culture of homosexuals in the priesthood. It was this culture of homosexuals as priests which led to the rampant sexual abuse of alter boys within the catholic church.\n \n The evidence that what i'm saying is absolutely true and not a CHRISTIANITY WIDE ISSUE is that in the Protestant denominations, ALL OF THEM WITHOUT EXCEPTION, where pastors have always been allowed to marry and have children as the bible allows for, this culture of molesting boys has never been an issue at all as a wide spread problem. Here's some further documentation of what I am saying. \n \n Homosexual Culture Undercuts Priesthood\n Phil Brennan,\n Friday, April 5, 2002\n \n Father Andrew Greeley called it the \"Lavender Mafia,\" a homosexual underground within the Catholic Church in America that has managed to dominate many of the seminaries and must bear the largest share of the blame for the sex scandals afflicting the church.\n \n Like the gay underground in the British Foreign Office of the past where for scores of years the road to advancement was open only to homosexuals, the Lavender Mafia has been the gatekeeper determining who will be admitted to seminaries and ultimately to the Roman Catholic priesthood. In Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood,\" author Michael S. Rose quotes a former Mundelein seminarian, Joseph Kellenyi, as saying: \"The issue was never one of my suitability for ordination. Rather it was that the gay clique had been given veto power over who got ordained.\"\n \n 'Gay Profession' In his book, \"The Changing Face of the Priesthood,\" the rector of St. Mary's Seminary in Cleveland, Father Donald B. Cozzens, warned that the priesthood was becoming a \"gay profession.\" And in the seminaries it wasn't merely a preponderance of gay students, but also \"a disproportionate number of homosexually-oriented persons,\" including faculty, he wrote. That kind of atmosphere, Rose notes, \"deters the heterosexual man from continuing to study and prepare for the priesthood.\" Rose wonders how can \"any healthy heterosexual seminarian expect to be properly formed and prepared for the priesthood when constantly subjected to that which is so clearly contrary to Church teaching and discipline?\" 'Threatening Atmosphere'\n \n He asks: \"How many heterosexual seminarians, whether orthodox or not, have decided to leave the seminary and abandon their vocations because of the 'gay subculture' they were forced to endure, because they had been propositioned, harassed or even molested? We're not talking here about the presence of a few homosexually-oriented men who conduct themselves with perfect chastity. Rather there exists an intense and often threatening atmosphere.\" Indeed, so horrific is the situation that \"certain seminaries have earned nicknames such as Notre Flame (for Notre Dame Seminary in New Orleans) and Theological Closet (for Theological College at Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.); St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore has earned the nickname 'The Pink Palace.'\"\n \n Visiting the Gay Bars At some of the seminaries, faculty and students would don their gay apparel and head for gay bars. In March 2000 the liberal Greeley, often called the church's resident pornographer for his racy novels, testified that seminary professors \"Tell their students that they're gay and take some of them to gay bars, and gay students sleep with each other.\" Greeley is not alone in exposing the homosexual behavior rampant in many of the nation's seminaries:\n \n According to Father Andrew Walker, the situation at the Baltimore seminary was so bad that the vice rector delivered a lecture \"in front of at least 150 people when he stated, \"Yes, we accept openly gay seminarians; that's our policy.\"\n \n According to Father John Trigilio, while visiting the Baltimore seminary he observed: \"There was no discretion at all. The few times I was there, some of the seminarians would literally dress like gays from [Greenwich] Village. They would even go so far as to wear pink silk; it was like going to see La Cage Aux Folles.\"\n \n \"In my day at St. Mary's,\" recalled Father John Despard (a pseudonym) \"down the hall there would be two guys in the shower and everybody knew it.\" Rose cites numerous instances of gay domination at many of the nation's seminaries. One priest described the situation at Chicago's Mundelein seminary in the 1970s. Many of the younger students would be placed into situations where they compromised their sexual integrity,\" said Father Wayne H. Wurst during a radio broadcast. \"This would be used against them by older students for favors. And those older students actually had faculty members who would request from time to time a friend who would come and visit them because they were lonely. And these students would supply fresh meat. \"So there were madams, pimps and prostitutes all in a major seminary system that from outside, if you were to walk through, would look very holy.\" \n \n Heterosexuals Driven Out\n Heterosexual students at a number of seminaries were persecuted by the gay subculture. Reporting homosexual behavior by classmates could get them expelled, as could resisting homosexual advances. Rose cites scores of cases of heterosexuals driven out of seminaries because they refused to accept the gay culture. In Cozzen's book, \"The Changing Face of the Priesthood,\" he wrote that there has been \"a heterosexual exodus from the priesthood\" due, Rose notes, in part to the unrestrained gay subcultures in some seminaries, the resulting \"overwhelming gay clergy culture will have an effect on how the laity views the priesthood and it will have an effect on incoming vocations. \n \n Potential candidates for the priesthood who are heterosexual will be intimidated from joining an institution where the ethos is primarily that of a gay culture.\" Anyone wondering how the church could have got itself in the mess it is now experiencing need look no further than the pages of Rose's extraordinary book. What we are seeing today are the results of a gay priesthood being loosed upon parishes all across the nation, where they have abused impressionable young men they treated as \"fresh meat\" to satisfy their unnatural sexual urgings. Next: Bashing orthodoxy: how false teaching demoralizes and discourages aspiring priests.\n \n Get \"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood\" at a discount.\n  Homosexual Culture Undercuts Priesthood\n \n You should also understand that I get no personal pleasure from documenting this info from sources which are insiders so have no motive to lie in my favor. And neither do I post misinformation in order to falsely defend a position. As hard as it is to accept. What I have said is true and undeniable regarding the underlying agenda and tenets of the homosexual movement.\n David Thorstad - William A. Percy\n NAMBLA Exposed!",

I find it somewhat amusing.\n \n \n \nAs for your opinion, I get that you think homosexuality is not \"normal\".\n You don't want to \"accept\" homosexuality.\n THAT IS YOUR PEROGATIVE.\n One point is that OTHERS who have no problem with homosexuality VASTLY OUTNUMBER you...\n\n \n [yawn] and this means what?

NO.\n I am in a gay monogamous relationship with my partner.\n Please tell me what diseases I have a \"exponentially\" higher capability of catching???\n\n \n Good for you, sincerely. You are a statistical anomoly.\n \n \nPROMISCUOUS behavior, gay or straight, is that which causes the spread of disease.\n A gay guy in a monogamous relationship is a LOT SAFER against catching an STD as compared to some straight guy who sleeps with prostitutes.\n\n \n Interesting how you always seem to compare deviant heterosexual behavior with homosexual behavior.\n \n \nYour current tactic is one to attack and slander. To bully and annoy.\n I can't help but wonder what brought this on?\n \n Is it an obfuscational attempt to ignore the substance of what I said?\n Do YOU recognize Archie's behavior for what it is, and you're annoyed that somebody can be so honest and cut through Archie's lies so efficiently?\n\n \n I don't find Archangels comments to be lies.

What you call bigotry, I call a rejection of society tailoring it's laws to make life convenient for a chosen behavior.\n \n \n \n \nOne of the popular attempts in this area is to try to link the fall of Rome to homosexuality.\n However, one who actually LOOKS at history with an interest in learning (i.e. not you) can see that Rome had a LONG-STANDING acceptance of homosexuality. Rome stood for FOUR CENTURIES with homosexuality acceptance, so one has to wonder exactly how long it would take your supposed connection to have homosexuality cause a nation to crumble.\n \n And furthermore, Christianity was on the RISE in the last part of the fourth century, and dominant in the fifth century. This new rise of Christianity lead Rome to BECOME PREJUDICED TOWARDS homosexuality, which in your mentality would have saved Rome?\n Except it didn't...\n And ironically, if one were to try to make a more logical, but also nonsensical allegation, it would be CHRISTIANITY which was the newcomer which could be perceived as leading to the downfall of Rome...\n \n Rome exists for multiple centuries with homosexuality? Not a problem.\n Christianity the newcomer on the block. Suddenly there's a problem?\n\n \n I could not have said it better myself.

This has been seen in numerous court rulings.\n Romer v Evans.\n Lawrence v Texas.\n \n You claim \"special rights\", but that is a fool's analysis.\n When gays are prevented from something that straights are allowed without question to their sexual orientation, WHO has the \"special right\" there...\n By your pretense, the discriminated against group has a \"special right\" when they seek to END THE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THEM???\n \n So blacks would be seeking a \"special right\" so that they stop being discriminated against in the military? In employment?\n Laughable and ludicrous!\n \n \n \nYou see, that's where you don't get it. I have no illusions about bringing you to Christ. As far as driving you away..., if Christ were to pursue you, there is nothing I could say to keep you apart.\n\n So by your religious beliefs, Christ does not pursue me...\n ROFLMAO!

If you actually will take the time to understand, anyway. I believe that you view that atheists are actually 'haters of the light,' but you are fundamentally misunderstanding how most (I'd say 80%+) of us 'feel' about god and religion. We don't hate god. We feel the same way about god as you feel about President Fizzles. That's right, there was no president Fizzellbaum so you don't feel one way or another. I feel the same way about god as I do about the Easter Bunny. Furthermore, we don't hate religious people. Personally, except for on this forum, I hardly EVER think or talk about religion or god. I'm sure that's true about the vast majority of atheists. Sure you have some that are 'militant' but every category of people has its zealots or extremists.\n \n \nYou consider our rejection of the sexual abominations you so easily accept, as demeaning when all we do is tell you how wrong what you defend as normal and right is.\n\n \n Here's another thing. It's not that most of us straight people who support equal rights for gays sit at home thinking about how much we love gays and we're not plotting the moral decay of the US. I hardly ever think about 'gay' people. I just think about people. I don't care what people do in the privacy of their own homes. Now when I do think about it or am confronted with a question or see oppression (mostly on here and in the news) I support the path that gives people the most liberty, what's the most fair, and what keeps the govt. smaller and out of our lives.",

   "Archangel.., is it true that you are pretending to \"Not indict all homosexuals\" ?\n \n I don't think an indictment on ALL homosexuals is even up for discussion. Just because you, foundit, have unlimited time to post and argue every single point made against homosexuality, and you have an army of limp-wristed cheerleaders to egg you on, does not make homosexual behavior normal or accepted. Your behavior, up to this point is being tolerated.\n \n You have succeeded in convincing yourself that putting your dick where another man evacuates his bowls, his normal. It doesn't matter to you, that this behavior expotentially exposes you to a disease that kills you, (but lets not let the natural order of things muddy the issue).\n \n And yes, there are a number of straights, who empathize with your condition just as they do the mentally and physically handicapped. Throw them a few prime parking spaces and put up some bars in the restrooms, but no-one wants to trade places with them or allow the world to revolve around them either.\n \n Homosexuality and all other forms of deviant sexual behavior have always preceeded the fall of the great empires in human history and even the not-so-great.\n \n Now your first reaction to this post will be that it is full of \"hate speech\". \n \n OK, the comment about your \"limp-wristed\" groupies may have been somewhat spiteful, but, while you think you busted out of the closet, the truth is.., tolerant, conservative Christians allowed you to come out.\n \n Not because your behavior has become accepted, but because your behavior must be exposed. As we near the end of this dispensation you are being given a chance to make yourself right with God, and more to the point Jesus.\n \n It just freaks you out, along with the abortion advocates when a Christian does not act in the all loving \"turn the other cheek\" manner. So much so that when he speaks God's truth, you can only see it as hate.\n \n When you ask, \"how can an all loving God allow such torment and murder on this earth\"? You fail to realize that this life we have is of little consequence to God. Jesus said that a man must lose his life, in order to save it.\n \n The indictment on homosexuality has already been made.\n\n \n You know when I read this I had to kind of just take a step back and take a few deep breathes because honestly had I have posted right after I read this I most likely would have been banned.\n \n But regardless what I see here is once again someone who views us gays as weak. Because you know all of us just happen to be limp wristed prissy little XXXXXXX right steamroller? Let me ask you, do you get off on your power trip? Does it give you a stiffy when you try to convince yourself just how superior you think you are to a group of limp wristed fags?\n \n I mean honestly, you really really have some inferiority complex issues here. It's not even the fact that what you wrote was so dehumanizing and hurtful, or that had it been made in person I would have most likely decked you in the face, but the fact that you actually have convinced your warped mind that somehow your under the guise of \"saving\" others.\n \n I would rather spend an eternity in hell with all of the other so called \"limp wristed XXXXXXX\", than spend one single minute with you in your imaginary delusional world called heaven. If heaven to you constitutes hating others and getting a sick sense of satisfaction on the power trip of hurting others then buddy you can take your so called faith and shove it.\n \n Oh and by the way having another man stick his rock hard thick veiny XXXX into my bowels is the greatest feeling EVER you want to get vulgar? You want to get descriptive and make this into a dick size contest? Go right ahead. Because while you find that personally repulsive, I find that sticking my genitals into a rotten stinky fish smelling birth canal to be personally revolting.\n \n So lets compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges ok? Because I'll tell you something right now Steamroller. The faint idea or inclination that you are ANYTHING close to representing that of Christianity is not only laughable, but sick and revolting. \n \n I would love for you to print out your post and give it to your pastor. Or maybe to a gay friendly church? Or better yet email it to the 700 club and I'm Sure Pat Robertson would buy you lunch...

Instead of pedagogy, democracy. Rather than a Greek-love mentor relationship, the companionship of independent and autonomous individuals. In place of male supremacy, a vision of sexual, economic, and political liberation for all. Freedom is indivisible. The liberation of children, women, boy-lovers, and homosexuals in general, can occur only as complementary facets of the same dream.\"\n \n  The issue of love between men and boys has intersected the gay movement since the late nineteenth century, with the rise of the first gay rights movement in Germany. In the United States, as the gay movement has retreated from its vision of sexual liberation, in favor of integration and assimilation into existing social and political structures, it has increasingly sought to marginalize and even demonize cross-generational love. Pederasty-that is, love between a man and a youth of 12 to 18 years of age-say middle-class homosexuals, lesbians, and feminists, has nothing to do with gay liberation. Some go so far as to claim, absurdly, that it is a heterosexual phenomenon, or even \"sexual abuse.\" What a travesty!\n \n Pederasty is the main form that male homosexuality has acquired throughout Western civilization-and not only in the West! Pederasty is inseparable from the high points of Western culture-ancient Greece and the Renaissance.\n \n In Germany, in the late nineteenth century, pederasty was an integral part of the new gay movement. The first gay journal in the world-Der Eigene, published beginning in 1896 (one year before the formation of the first homosexual rights group, the Scientific Humanitarian Committee of Magnus Hirschfeld)-was a pederast and anarchist journal \"for male culture\" with an individualist anarchist outlook based on the ideas of Max Stirner (author of Der Einzige und sein Eigentum). Its publisher, Adolf Brand, was a leading figure of the gay movement throughout the first decades, until the Nazis came to power. The journal continued to appear until 1933. Brand died in an Allied bombing of Berlin in 1945.\n \n Another leading pederast and writer, Benedict Friedlaender, was also a leader of Hirschfeld's committee, until 1908 when he committed suicide. Not unlike today, the two groups-the pederasts in the Gemeinschaft der Eigenen (the Community of Self-Owners) and the Hirschfeld group-constituted two wings of the gay movement. Although they collaborated in some things (for example, both opposed the sodomy statute, Paragraph 175), sharp ideological and scientific differences separated them. In uncanny ways, many of these differences persist in the quite different circumstances of today.\n \n With the spread of the medical model of homosexuality in the late nineteenth century came an increasing influence of doctors and psychiatrists in the gay movement. These viewed homosexuals as a \"third sex,\" or as \"intermediate sexual types\" (Zwischenstufen in German), a \"male soul trapped in a female body\" (or vice versa for lesbians)-a view advanced by Hirschfeld. The pederasts actively combated this view. They believed in an inherent bisexuality of human beings and argued that the influence of the medical profession gave the gay movement the aura of a hospital. Most felt that younger and older males were naturally attracted to each other and that pederasty was a positive good for society because it helped to socialize young males and provided them with a necessary sexual outlet, thereby reducing undesirable social phenomena such as unwanted pregnancies and prostitution. A few (Hans Bl\u00fcher, for example, famous for his book on the Wandervogel movement) believed that pederasty and male bonding provided a basis for a stronger nation and state-a view that, in a perverted form, found a distorted expression in the militarism of the Hitler Youth.\n \n Friedlaender, for example, ridiculed the concept of \"a poor womanly soul languishing away in a man's body, and of the `third sex,'\" and attacked the third sex concept as \"degrading and a beggarly...pleading for sympathy.\" He insisted on a historical approach that also took into account anthropological evidence, and wrote: \"A glance at the cultures of countries before and outside of Christianity suffices to show the complete untenability of the [Zwischenstufen] theory. Especially in ancient Greece, most of the military leaders, artists, and thinkers would have had to be 'psychic hermaphrodites.'\" [1]\n \n In their critique of the third-sex concept and their recognition of the ambiguities and potential bisexuality of the human animal, the pederasts had their feet more securely on the ground than did the larger \"mainstream\" gay movement. The third-sex argument has been thoroughly discredited for years.\n \n Increasingly, the assimilationist gay and lesbian groups in the United States, in a kind of throwback to the nineteenth century, argue that homosexuality is inborn, that it is genetically determined (\"we can't help it that we're gay, we were born that way, so please don't discriminate against us\"-an echo of the nineteenth-century argument that practically solicits pity and that in no way challenges the built-in social repression of same-sex love). The middle-class gay movement today seeks special treatment for a special kind of person who has adopted a \"gay\" identity-\"gay people\"-rather than seeking to liberate the repressed sexual potential of everyone. For them, what matters is identity, not practice. The basic argument of the gay movement today boils down to the following: Homosexuals are born that way, and heterosexuals are born that way; therefore, homosexual liberation poses no threat to the status quo and dominance of heterosupremacy. This is the old \"nature versus nurture\" argument dressed up in new, accommodationist clothes.\n \n The theoretical poverty of this view can be seen in the fact that many people-including, no doubt, some in this room-change their sexual behavior depending on the circumstances or over the course of their lives. If there is a genetic basis for homosexuality and heterosexuality-that is, our behavior is determined by our genes, rather than myriad social and cultural variables that differ from person to person-it is not as distinct and mutually exclusive categories, but as potentials for varieties of sexual expression that lie within everyone's reach. (This line of antighetto thinking has been eloquently expressed by the late Italian gay activist Mario Mieli in his book, Homosexuality and Liberation.)\n \n The real motivation behind this revival of the \"inborn\" argument is political, not scientific. The gay assimilationists want to become part of an existing, inequitable capitalist society, not change that society in any fundamental way. Their approach is inherently selfish, not altruistic. They seek minor adjustments in the status quo, not radical social change. They have been co-opted by the heterosupremacist power structure.\n \n One obvious contradiction in the assimilationist position is that if homosexual identity is inborn, as they say, then why do they oppose freedom of sexual expression for minors? Assimilationists argue that sexual identity is fixed by age six, but they deny young people the right to enjoy sexual pleasure with the person of their own choice. For them, \"protection\" is the key word, not \"liberation\"; they call on the state to \"protect\" young people from expressing and exploring their own sexual behavior. They want to \"protect\" young people from \"dirty old men\" (I, incidentally, am speaking as a \"dirty gay old man\" -something I take as a positive goal), but in reality are protecting them from themselves. They support criminalization of young people's sexuality, especially if it involves sex with an adult man. They condemn any adult who helps a young person to explore his or her sexuality. They are like parents-only worse, because they pretend to offer a guide to the gay future.Pederasty and Homosexuality - William A. Percy[/QUOTE]\n \n Your analogous conclusion is misplaced and erroneous CxT. The proper conclusion based on the evidence of the Priest Molestation crisis within the Catholic church is that it was caused because for decades and possibly centuries, the RCC built up a culture of homosexuals in the priesthood. It was this culture of homosexuals as priests which led to the rampant sexual abuse of alter boys within the catholic church.\n \n The evidence that what i'm saying is absolutely true and not a CHRISTIANITY WIDE ISSUE is that in the Protestant denominations, ALL OF THEM WITHOUT EXCEPTION, where pastors have always been allowed to marry and have children as the bible allows for, this culture of molesting boys has never been an issue at all as a wide spread problem. Here's some further documentation of what I am saying. \n \n Homosexual Culture Undercuts Priesthood\n Phil Brennan,\n Friday, April 5, 2002\n \n Father Andrew Greeley called it the \"Lavender Mafia,\" a homosexual underground within the Catholic Church in America that has managed to dominate many of the seminaries and must bear the largest share of the blame for the sex scandals afflicting the church.\n \n Like the gay underground in the British Foreign Office of the past where for scores of years the road to advancement was open only to homosexuals, the Lavender Mafia has been the gatekeeper determining who will be admitted to seminaries and ultimately to the Roman Catholic priesthood. In Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood,\" author Michael S. Rose quotes a former Mundelein seminarian, Joseph Kellenyi, as saying: \"The issue was never one of my suitability for ordination. Rather it was that the gay clique had been given veto power over who got ordained.\"\n \n 'Gay Profession' In his book, \"The Changing Face of the Priesthood,\" the rector of St. Mary's Seminary in Cleveland, Father Donald B. Cozzens, warned that the priesthood was becoming a \"gay profession.\" And in the seminaries it wasn't merely a preponderance of gay students, but also \"a disproportionate number of homosexually-oriented persons,\" including faculty, he wrote. That kind of atmosphere, Rose notes, \"deters the heterosexual man from continuing to study and prepare for the priesthood.\" Rose wonders how can \"any healthy heterosexual seminarian expect to be properly formed and prepared for the priesthood when constantly subjected to that which is so clearly contrary to Church teaching and discipline?\" 'Threatening Atmosphere'\n \n He asks: \"How many heterosexual seminarians, whether orthodox or not, have decided to leave the seminary and abandon their vocations because of the 'gay subculture' they were forced to endure, because they had been propositioned, harassed or even molested? We're not talking here about the presence of a few homosexually-oriented men who conduct themselves with perfect chastity. Rather there exists an intense and often threatening atmosphere.\" Indeed, so horrific is the situation that \"certain seminaries have earned nicknames such as Notre Flame (for Notre Dame Seminary in New Orleans) and Theological Closet (for Theological College at Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.); St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore has earned the nickname 'The Pink Palace.'\"\n \n Visiting the Gay Bars At some of the seminaries, faculty and students would don their gay apparel and head for gay bars. In March 2000 the liberal Greeley, often called the church's resident pornographer for his racy novels, testified that seminary professors \"Tell their students that they're gay and take some of them to gay bars, and gay students sleep with each other.\" Greeley is not alone in exposing the homosexual behavior rampant in many of the nation's seminaries:\n \n According to Father Andrew Walker, the situation at the Baltimore seminary was so bad that the vice rector delivered a lecture \"in front of at least 150 people when he stated, \"Yes, we accept openly gay seminarians; that's our policy.\"\n \n According to Father John Trigilio, while visiting the Baltimore seminary he observed: \"There was no discretion at all. The few times I was there, some of the seminarians would literally dress like gays from [Greenwich] Village. They would even go so far as to wear pink silk; it was like going to see La Cage Aux Folles.\"\n \n \"In my day at St. Mary's,\" recalled Father John Despard (a pseudonym) \"down the hall there would be two guys in the shower and everybody knew it.\" Rose cites numerous instances of gay domination at many of the nation's seminaries. One priest described the situation at Chicago's Mundelein seminary in the 1970s. Many of the younger students would be placed into situations where they compromised their sexual integrity,\" said Father Wayne H. Wurst during a radio broadcast. \"This would be used against them by older students for favors. And those older students actually had faculty members who would request from time to time a friend who would come and visit them because they were lonely. And these students would supply fresh meat. \"So there were madams, pimps and prostitutes all in a major seminary system that from outside, if you were to walk through, would look very holy.\" \n \n Heterosexuals Driven Out\n Heterosexual students at a number of seminaries were persecuted by the gay subculture. Reporting homosexual behavior by classmates could get them expelled, as could resisting homosexual advances. Rose cites scores of cases of heterosexuals driven out of seminaries because they refused to accept the gay culture. In Cozzen's book, \"The Changing Face of the Priesthood,\" he wrote that there has been \"a heterosexual exodus from the priesthood\" due, Rose notes, in part to the unrestrained gay subcultures in some seminaries, the resulting \"overwhelming gay clergy culture will have an effect on how the laity views the priesthood and it will have an effect on incoming vocations. \n \n Potential candidates for the priesthood who are heterosexual will be intimidated from joining an institution where the ethos is primarily that of a gay culture.\" Anyone wondering how the church could have got itself in the mess it is now experiencing need look no further than the pages of Rose's extraordinary book. What we are seeing today are the results of a gay priesthood being loosed upon parishes all across the nation, where they have abused impressionable young men they treated as \"fresh meat\" to satisfy their unnatural sexual urgings. Next: Bashing orthodoxy: how false teaching demoralizes and discourages aspiring priests.\n \n Get \"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood\" at a discount.\n  Homosexual Culture Undercuts Priesthood\n \n You should also understand that I get no personal pleasure from documenting this info from sources which are insiders so have no motive to lie in my favor. And neither do I post misinformation in order to falsely defend a position. As hard as it is to accept. What I have said is true and undeniable regarding the underlying agenda and tenets of the homosexual movement.\n David Thorstad - William A. Percy\n NAMBLA Exposed!",

Especially in ancient Greece, most of the military leaders, artists, and thinkers would have had to be 'psychic hermaphrodites.'\" [1]\n \n In their critique of the third-sex concept and their recognition of the ambiguities and potential bisexuality of the human animal, the pederasts had their feet more securely on the ground than did the larger \"mainstream\" gay movement. The third-sex argument has been thoroughly discredited for years.\n \n Increasingly, the assimilationist gay and lesbian groups in the United States, in a kind of throwback to the nineteenth century, argue that homosexuality is inborn, that it is genetically determined (\"we can't help it that we're gay, we were born that way, so please don't discriminate against us\"-an echo of the nineteenth-century argument that practically solicits pity and that in no way challenges the built-in social repression of same-sex love). The middle-class gay movement today seeks special treatment for a special kind of person who has adopted a \"gay\" identity-\"gay people\"-rather than seeking to liberate the repressed sexual potential of everyone. For them, what matters is identity, not practice. The basic argument of the gay movement today boils down to the following: Homosexuals are born that way, and heterosexuals are born that way; therefore, homosexual liberation poses no threat to the status quo and dominance of heterosupremacy. This is the old \"nature versus nurture\" argument dressed up in new, accommodationist clothes.\n \n The theoretical poverty of this view can be seen in the fact that many people-including, no doubt, some in this room-change their sexual behavior depending on the circumstances or over the course of their lives. If there is a genetic basis for homosexuality and heterosexuality-that is, our behavior is determined by our genes, rather than myriad social and cultural variables that differ from person to person-it is not as distinct and mutually exclusive categories, but as potentials for varieties of sexual expression that lie within everyone's reach. (This line of antighetto thinking has been eloquently expressed by the late Italian gay activist Mario Mieli in his book, Homosexuality and Liberation.)\n \n The real motivation behind this revival of the \"inborn\" argument is political, not scientific. The gay assimilationists want to become part of an existing, inequitable capitalist society, not change that society in any fundamental way. Their approach is inherently selfish, not altruistic. They seek minor adjustments in the status quo, not radical social change. They have been co-opted by the heterosupremacist power structure.\n \n One obvious contradiction in the assimilationist position is that if homosexual identity is inborn, as they say, then why do they oppose freedom of sexual expression for minors? Assimilationists argue that sexual identity is fixed by age six, but they deny young people the right to enjoy sexual pleasure with the person of their own choice. For them, \"protection\" is the key word, not \"liberation\"; they call on the state to \"protect\" young people from expressing and exploring their own sexual behavior. They want to \"protect\" young people from \"dirty old men\" (I, incidentally, am speaking as a \"dirty gay old man\" -something I take as a positive goal), but in reality are protecting them from themselves. They support criminalization of young people's sexuality, especially if it involves sex with an adult man. They condemn any adult who helps a young person to explore his or her sexuality. They are like parents-only worse, because they pretend to offer a guide to the gay future.Pederasty and Homosexuality - William A. Percy\n\n \n Your analogous conclusion is misplaced and erroneous CxT. The proper conclusion based on the evidence of the Priest Molestation crisis within the Catholic church is that it was caused because for decades and possibly centuries, the RCC built up a culture of homosexuals in the priesthood. It was this culture of homosexuals as priests which led to the rampant sexual abuse of alter boys within the catholic church.\n \n The evidence that what i'm saying is absolutely true and not a CHRISTIANITY WIDE ISSUE is that in the Protestant denominations, ALL OF THEM WITHOUT EXCEPTION, where pastors have always been allowed to marry and have children as the bible allows for, this culture of molesting boys has never been an issue at all as a wide spread problem. Here's some further documentation of what I am saying. \n \n Homosexual Culture Undercuts Priesthood\n Phil Brennan,\n Friday, April 5, 2002\n \n Father Andrew Greeley called it the \"Lavender Mafia,\" a homosexual underground within the Catholic Church in America that has managed to dominate many of the seminaries and must bear the largest share of the blame for the sex scandals afflicting the church.\n \n Like the gay underground in the British Foreign Office of the past where for scores of years the road to advancement was open only to homosexuals, the Lavender Mafia has been the gatekeeper determining who will be admitted to seminaries and ultimately to the Roman Catholic priesthood. In Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood,\" author Michael S. Rose quotes a former Mundelein seminarian, Joseph Kellenyi, as saying: \"The issue was never one of my suitability for ordination. Rather it was that the gay clique had been given veto power over who got ordained.\"\n \n 'Gay Profession' In his book, \"The Changing Face of the Priesthood,\" the rector of St. Mary's Seminary in Cleveland, Father Donald B. Cozzens, warned that the priesthood was becoming a \"gay profession.\" And in the seminaries it wasn't merely a preponderance of gay students, but also \"a disproportionate number of homosexually-oriented persons,\" including faculty, he wrote. That kind of atmosphere, Rose notes, \"deters the heterosexual man from continuing to study and prepare for the priesthood.\" Rose wonders how can \"any healthy heterosexual seminarian expect to be properly formed and prepared for the priesthood when constantly subjected to that which is so clearly contrary to Church teaching and discipline?\" 'Threatening Atmosphere'\n \n He asks: \"How many heterosexual seminarians, whether orthodox or not, have decided to leave the seminary and abandon their vocations because of the 'gay subculture' they were forced to endure, because they had been propositioned, harassed or even molested? We're not talking here about the presence of a few homosexually-oriented men who conduct themselves with perfect chastity. Rather there exists an intense and often threatening atmosphere.\" Indeed, so horrific is the situation that \"certain seminaries have earned nicknames such as Notre Flame (for Notre Dame Seminary in New Orleans) and Theological Closet (for Theological College at Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.); St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore has earned the nickname 'The Pink Palace.'\"\n \n Visiting the Gay Bars At some of the seminaries, faculty and students would don their gay apparel and head for gay bars. In March 2000 the liberal Greeley, often called the church's resident pornographer for his racy novels, testified that seminary professors \"Tell their students that they're gay and take some of them to gay bars, and gay students sleep with each other.\" Greeley is not alone in exposing the homosexual behavior rampant in many of the nation's seminaries:\n \n According to Father Andrew Walker, the situation at the Baltimore seminary was so bad that the vice rector delivered a lecture \"in front of at least 150 people when he stated, \"Yes, we accept openly gay seminarians; that's our policy.\"\n \n According to Father John Trigilio, while visiting the Baltimore seminary he observed: \"There was no discretion at all. The few times I was there, some of the seminarians would literally dress like gays from [Greenwich] Village. They would even go so far as to wear pink silk; it was like going to see La Cage Aux Folles.\"\n \n \"In my day at St. Mary's,\" recalled Father John Despard (a pseudonym) \"down the hall there would be two guys in the shower and everybody knew it.\" Rose cites numerous instances of gay domination at many of the nation's seminaries. One priest described the situation at Chicago's Mundelein seminary in the 1970s. Many of the younger students would be placed into situations where they compromised their sexual integrity,\" said Father Wayne H. Wurst during a radio broadcast. \"This would be used against them by older students for favors. And those older students actually had faculty members who would request from time to time a friend who would come and visit them because they were lonely. And these students would supply fresh meat. \"So there were madams, pimps and prostitutes all in a major seminary system that from outside, if you were to walk through, would look very holy.\" \n \n Heterosexuals Driven Out\n Heterosexual students at a number of seminaries were persecuted by the gay subculture. Reporting homosexual behavior by classmates could get them expelled, as could resisting homosexual advances. Rose cites scores of cases of heterosexuals driven out of seminaries because they refused to accept the gay culture. In Cozzen's book, \"The Changing Face of the Priesthood,\" he wrote that there has been \"a heterosexual exodus from the priesthood\" due, Rose notes, in part to the unrestrained gay subcultures in some seminaries, the resulting \"overwhelming gay clergy culture will have an effect on how the laity views the priesthood and it will have an effect on incoming vocations. \n \n Potential candidates for the priesthood who are heterosexual will be intimidated from joining an institution where the ethos is primarily that of a gay culture.\" Anyone wondering how the church could have got itself in the mess it is now experiencing need look no further than the pages of Rose's extraordinary book. What we are seeing today are the results of a gay priesthood being loosed upon parishes all across the nation, where they have abused impressionable young men they treated as \"fresh meat\" to satisfy their unnatural sexual urgings.

Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood\" at a discount.\n  Homosexual Culture Undercuts Priesthood\n \n You should also understand that I get no personal pleasure from documenting this info from sources which are insiders so have no motive to lie in my favor. And neither do I post misinformation in order to falsely defend a position. As hard as it is to accept. What I have said is true and undeniable regarding the underlying agenda and tenets of the homosexual movement.\n David Thorstad - William A.
