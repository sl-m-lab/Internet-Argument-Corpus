His name [is] Immanuel (NKJV)\" Matt. 1:20-23. \n \n \n \"This is what the LORD says: \"A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because her children are no more (NIV).\" Jer. 31:15 \n \n \"When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under . . .then the [prophecy] was fulfilled (NIV).\" Matt. 2:16-4:1 \n \n \n \n \n Through the prophet Jeremiah, 627 - 580 B.C., God indicated that some of Israel's children would be killed at the coming of the Messiah. \n \n \n \"When Israel was a child, I loved him, And out of Egypt I called My son.\" Hosea 11:1 \n \n \"Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, \"Arise, take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him. When he arose, he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed for Egypt, and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, \"Out of Egypt I called My Son.\" (NKJV).'\" Matt. 2:13-15 \n \n \n \n \n This prophecy was given by the prophet Hosea around 750 B.C. This amazing prophecy says that Messiah would come from Egypt. Jesus had to be born into the family of David, born of a virgin, born in Bethlehem, children would die and Jesus come out of Egypt. The prophet must have wondered why Messiah would come out of Egypt. This did not fit the concept the Jews had about Messiah. This is God's plan and these are God's prophecies. \n \n \n \n \n \"They divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots (NKJV).\" Ps. 22:18 \n \n \"Then they crucified Him, and divided His garments, casting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet: \"They divided My garments among them, And for My clothing they cast lots (NKJV).\" Matt. 27:35 \n \n \n \n After the soldiers crucified Jesus (nailed Him to the cross), they gambled for Jesus' clothes. Little did they know they were fulfilling a 1000 years old prophecy. The prediction was provided by God through King David. \n \"I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and supplication; then they will look on Me whom they pierced (NKJV).\" Zech. 12:10 \n \n \"But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.\n \n For these things [occurred] that the Scripture should be fulfilled . . . \"They shall look on Him whom they pierced (NKJV).\" John 19:34-37 \n \n \n \n Another isolated event predicted in 520-512 B.C. In A.D. 33, some soldier thrust his spear into the side of Jesus to make sure that He would die before 6 pm that evening. Little did he realize that Jesus was already dead (John 19:30) and that he was fulfilling a 480 year old prophecy from Zechariah. \n \n \"Even my own familiar friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted up His heel against me (NKJV).\" Ps. 41:9 \n \n \"Judas Iscariot . . . betrayed Him.\" Matt. 10:4\n \n \"that the scripture might be fulfilled, 'He who eats My bread has lifted up his heel against Me (NKJV).\" John 13:21-28 \n \n \n \n This prediction was recorded by King David, 1020 - 970 B.C. It refers to the Messiah's betrayal by His friends. Judas is well known as the one who agreed to help the Romans capture Jesus at a cost of 30 pieces of silver. Peter was another who betrayed Jesus three times. \n \n \"See, your king comes to you, righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey (NIV).\" Zech 9:9 \n \n \n \n \"And the disciples . . . brought the donkey and the colt, and laid on them garments, on which he sat.

   "See, we talk about dishonest and yet you must know full well by know that cats have never turned into dogs, I I strongly suspect that as a transitional speicies this is what you want despite not being supported by evolution. a transitional fossil is somewhere between a previous fossil and either another later fossil or a living species - it is NOT a species that appears to be turning from a living speices into another one. Evolution says this doesn't happen, so its hardly evidence against it if we can't find one of your transitional species.\n \n How long do fossils take to form, more than 6000 years I expect? Not to mention I posted the stats for beetle evolution. There are just too many for Noah's 'kinds' to have existed. Especially as it would require him travelling to the amazon in a boat he hasn't built yet to collect a bunch of them.\n How long did Noah take to gather these animals anyway given that some lived on other continents and we know vaguely how long he had to manage it by the ages of his sons when they had children.",

There are a few fossils attributed to pre-cambrian sediments , none that explain the diversity, not even close.\n\n So did god make some simple creatures at first, then more complex ones later?\n \n \nGen 1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: \n\n Maybe he just meant directional signs?\n But surely some christian astrologist can use this passage as a basis for legitimacy.\n \n Again, how perfect is 365.242190 days per year?\n It took us quite a while to devise a 'perfect' calendar to fit this odd bit of perfection.\n \n \nOverwhelmingly they are. If you study the way the fossils are situated at Rancho La Brea it makes perfect sense they were killed in a watery catastrophe . It makes no sense they could have just walked in to the tar.\n\n Yeah, animals getting trapped in tar makes so little sense, what was I thinking !! emoticon_rolleyes \n \n But, the Bible makes no mention whatsoever of fossils.\n Either god didn't want us to know about them, \n OR...ancient men had no clue as they were writing scripture. \n \n \n Really . \n \"The voice of one crying in the wilderness: \"Prepare the way of the LORD; Make straight in the desert a highway for our God. (NKJV).\" Isaiah 40:3 \n\n Any mention of Jesus?\n No?\n \n \n\"In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, and saying, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!' For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying: 'The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the LORD . . . (NKJV).'\" Matt. 3:1-3 \n\n This is New Testament. You'll have to provide ONE old testament verse that specifically mentions Jesus, or even something that jesus did.\n Specifically.\n \n NT guys reading the OT and fitting Jesus in where they can doesn't count.\n \n \n \n John the Baptist came before Jesus Christ and let people know that He was coming. What a fascinating period of history. This prediction was given by the prophet Isaiah, 740-680 B.C. History tell us that John the Baptist did in fact come preaching repentance and baptism. \n\n Yet, Isaiah says nothing about a messiah or Jesus.\n Any mention of a \"savior\" comes in the form of Yahweh or some human hero that saves the day.\n \n \n \"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come . . . one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times (NIV).\" Micah 5:2 \n\n This is an old dispute that says that this is a man named Bethlehem.\n Not only that, there are at least 2 ancient towns named Bethlehem, but only one is in Judah.\n Anyway, look at the wording in the literal translation:\n \nAnd thou, Beth-Lehem Ephratah, Little to be among the chiefs of Judah! From thee to Me he cometh forth -- to be ruler in Israel, And his comings forth [are] of old, From the days of antiquity.\n\n Here the wording indicates a man, a chief.\n \n \n\" After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod . . . (NIV)\" Matt. 2:1 \n Micah, 735 - 710 B.C., tells us that the Christ or Messiah will be born in Bethlehem.\n\n OR, that a descendent of a man named Bethlehem would be ruler of Israel.\n BTW - Jesus was never the ruler of Israel (and still isn't ;) )\n \n \nIt is recognized by all that Jesus was indeed born in Bethlehem. \n Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel (NKJV).\" Isaiah 7:14 \n\n Immanuel just means \"god is with us.\"\n No mention of Jesus? \n \n Also, read the context. The prophecy is of something happening within the near future, not within hundreds of years.\n \n \n10 Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz, 11 \"Ask the LORD your God for a sign, whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights.\"\n \n 12 But Ahaz said, \"I will not ask; I will not put the LORD to the test.\"\n \n 13 Then Isaiah said, \"Hear now, you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of men? Will you try the patience of my God also? 14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you [c] a sign:\n\n The LORD says he will give Ahaz a sign.\n How can Ahaz have a sign hundreds of years from then?\n \n \nThe virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and [d] will call him Immanuel. [e] 15 He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right. 16 But before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste. 17 The LORD will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since Ephraim broke away from Judah-he will bring the king of Assyria.\" 18 In that day the LORD will whistle for flies from the distant streams of Egypt and for bees from the land of Assyria. 19 They will all come and settle in the steep ravines and in the crevices in the rocks, on all the thornbushes and at all the water holes.\n\n Did this happen on the first christmas, on Jesus' birthday? No?\n You mean to tell me that there were no bees and flies that settled in all the ravines, in the crevices, and on all the water holes?\n Did the NT guys miss this, did they not notice all the flies?\n Did they not notice the lands being laid to waste?\n And Jesus is God, he always knew wrong from right.\n This CANNOT be about Jesus.\n \n \n\"Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins . . .

[b]\n They sacrificed to the Baals\n and they burned incense to images. \n\n It's so obvious that this is NOT about Jesus, that you MUST be joking.\n \n \n \n\"Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, \"Arise, take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him.

This amazing prophecy says that Messiah would come from Egypt. \n\n What's amazing is that you actually believe this.\n \n \n \nJesus had to be born into the family of David, born of a virgin, born in Bethlehem, children would die and Jesus come out of Egypt. The prophet must have wondered why Messiah would come out of Egypt. This did not fit the concept the Jews had about Messiah.

Little did they know they were fulfilling a 1000 years old prophecy. The prediction was provided by God through King David. \n\n Except the \"prophecy\" is a song that has nothing to do with Jesus.\n \n \n \n \"I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and supplication; then they will look on Me whom they pierced (NKJV).\" Zech. 12:10 \n\n Again reading in context, we see that this cannot be about Jesus.\n The chapter says:\n \nOn that day, when all the nations of the earth are gathered against her, I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock for all the nations. All who try to move it will injure themselves\n\n At the time of Jesus, all the nations of the Earth were certainly NOT gathered against Jerusalem.\n and more:\n \nOn that day I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness,\" declares the LORD. \"I will keep a watchful eye over the house of Judah, but I will blind all the horses of the nations. 5 Then the leaders of Judah will say in their hearts, 'The people of Jerusalem are strong, because the LORD Almighty is their God.'\n \n 6 \"On that day I will make the leaders of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile, like a flaming torch among sheaves. They will consume right and left all the surrounding peoples, but Jerusalem will remain intact in her place.\n \n 7 \"The LORD will save the dwellings of Judah first, so that the honor of the house of David and of Jerusalem's inhabitants may not be greater than that of Judah. 8 On that day the LORD will shield those who live in Jerusalem, so that the feeblest among them will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the Angel of the LORD going before them. 9 On that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem. \n\n Since absolutely NONE of this ever happened, it cannot possibly apply to Jesus.\n \n At the time Jesus's side was pierced, none of this was going on.\n \n Also:\n \nOn that day the weeping in Jerusalem will be great, like the weeping of Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo. 12 The land will mourn, each clan by itself, with their wives by themselves: the clan of the house of David and their wives, the clan of the house of Nathan and their wives, 13 the clan of the house of Levi and their wives, the clan of Shimei and their wives, 14 and all the rest of the clans and their wives.\n\n Jerusalem, as a city, certainly didn't weep for Jesus.\n Remember, they were the ones that condemned him?\n They chose Jesus to die instead of a criminal?\n \n \n \n \n\"But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.\n \n For these things [occurred] that the Scripture should be fulfilled . . . \"They shall look on Him whom they pierced (NKJV).\" John 19:34-37 \n\n Ok, so Romans pierced people's sides to ensure their death during crucifixion.\n Since the OT passage has nothing to do with Jesus....it doesn't matter.\n \n \nAnother isolated event predicted in 520-512 B.C. In A.D. 33, some soldier thrust his spear into the side of Jesus to make sure that He would die before 6 pm that evening. Little did he realize that Jesus was already dead (John 19:30) and that he was fulfilling a 480 year old prophecy from Zechariah. \n\n I wish you could hear me laughing.\n \n \n\"Even my own familiar friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted up His heel against me (NKJV).\" Ps. 41:9 \n\n Again people, don't let the evil one fool you.\n Here is the whole song.\n \n1 Blessed is he who has regard for the weak;\n the LORD delivers him in times of trouble.\n \n 2 The LORD will protect him and preserve his life;\n he will bless him in the land\n and not surrender him to the desire of his foes.\n \n 3 The LORD will sustain him on his sickbed\n and restore him from his bed of illness.\n \n 4 I said, \"O LORD, have mercy on me;\n heal me, for I have sinned against you.\"\n \n 5 My enemies say of me in malice,\n \"When will he die and his name perish?\"\n \n 6 Whenever one comes to see me,\n he speaks falsely, while his heart gathers slander;\n then he goes out and spreads it abroad.\n \n 7 All my enemies whisper together against me;\n they imagine the worst for me, saying,\n \n 8 \"A vile disease has beset him;\n he will never get up from the place where he lies.\"\n \n 9 Even my close friend, whom I trusted,\n he who shared my bread,\n has lifted up his heel against me.\n \n 10 But you, O LORD, have mercy on me;\n raise me up, that I may repay them.\n \n 11 I know that you are pleased with me,\n for my enemy does not triumph over me.\n \n 12 In my integrity you uphold me\n and set me in your presence forever.\n \n 13 Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel,\n from everlasting to everlasting.\n Amen and Amen.\n\n Can't you see that this has NOTHING TO DO WITH JESUS.\n \n \n\"Judas Iscariot . . . betrayed Him.\" Matt. 10:4\n \n \"that the scripture might be fulfilled, 'He who eats My bread has lifted up his heel against Me (NKJV).\" John 13:21-28 \n\n And? Someone was singing in the OT about being betrayed by his best friend, and somehow this is a prediction of the future?\n \n \n This prediction was recorded by King David, 1020 - 970 B.C. It refers to the Messiah's betrayal by His friends. Judas is well known as the one who agreed to help the Romans capture Jesus at a cost of 30 pieces of silver. Peter was another who betrayed Jesus three times. \n\n Now, if the passage had said, one friend will betray you outright and the other 3 times, then I'd be suspicious.\n But the song was absolutely no prediction.\n \n \n \n \n \n\"See, your king comes to you, righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey (NIV).\" Zech 9:9 \n\n Again, this is NOT about JESUS!!!\n Here's the context:\n \n9 Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion!\n Shout, Daughter of Jerusalem!\n See, your king [b] comes to you,\n righteous and having salvation,\n gentle and riding on a donkey,\n on a colt, the foal of a donkey.\n \n 10 I will take away the chariots from Ephraim\n and the war-horses from Jerusalem,\n and the battle bow will be broken.\n He will proclaim peace to the nations.\n His rule will extend from sea to sea\n and from the River [c] to the ends of the earth. [d]\n \n 11 As for you, because of the blood of my covenant with you,\n I will free your prisoners from the waterless pit. \n\n None of this other stuff happened.\n There was no king of Zion that ruled sea to sea.\n He never proclaimed peace to the nations, from the river to the ends of the earth.\n None of this happened, and it certianly didn't involve Jesus.\n \n \n \n\"And the disciples . . . brought the donkey and the colt, and laid on them garments, on which he sat. And most of the multitude spread their garments in the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in the road (NIV).\" Matt. 21:6-8 \n \n \n \n Zechariah, 480 - 470 B.C., stated that Messiah, the king, would come riding on a donkey. Donkeys were sometimes ridden in times of peace (Judges 5:10) but stallions were normally used by kings. This is unexpected by those looking for a military Messiah. \n\n And this is the old \"donkey\" vs. \"donkey and colt\" debate.\n But it doesn't matter, because the prophecy was about a king, not a messiah.\n A king that never existed, mind you.\n \n \n \n \n If you want more just ask.\n\n If you can provide ONE passage from the OT that specifically predicts Jesus or something he did, please provide it.\n \n \n \n That link is really lame. It discredits almost all the predictions on the grounds Jesus did not directly mention them. I am not impressed. Try reading the book yourself instead of thinking what your told to think.\n\n O, I do my own thinking thank you.\n And I'm sure you didn't read through 32 pages of posts.\n And you are wrong about the manner in which they totally discredit all so-called OT predictions about Jesus.\n \n \n I love this board, Topic Drift?

   "If you study the way the fossils are situated at Rancho La Brea it makes perfect sense they were killed in a watery catastrophe . It makes no sense they could have just walked in to the tar.\nActually, it makes perfect sense since it still happens today. That's why there's a fence around the pits. If you go there you will notice that lots of water pools on the surface of the tar. Why doesn't it make any sense for animals to walk out into the water to get a drink? Do you think that they are smart enough to know that they can get caught in the tar?\n \n If the animals at La Brea were killed in this mythical flood, why aren't they buried under a mile of sediment like at the Grand Canyon? How can they have been killed by a flood and still be at the surface?\n \n You just don't think things through, peddler.",

   "There are a few slight problems with that theory. First of all the evidence fits perfectly with that book you speak of. If predicts that all creatures came about suddenly and completely formed. This is all we have ever observed. The earliest creatures -according to your theories dating- had incredibly formed eyes etc. and no ancestors among the fossils\n\n wrong, we have not observed that all species came about suddenly and fully formed. what we have observed is evidence that creatures lived in the distant past which no longer live in the present, and that creatures that live in the present did not live in the distant past\n \n \nIt also predicts that animals will produce the same kind of animals , this is all that has ever in the history of the world been observed.\n\n wrong, it has been observed that creatures are capable of producing offspring very different from its parents, and that many generations can produce increasingly different ofspring\n \n \nIt predicts the heavens will show a perfect order and can be used for signs and for seasons and for days and for years. That is all that has ever been observed in the history of the world.\n\n this 'order' of which you speak is completely subjective and not observable. the positioning of stars and planets do affect the seasons and times, but there are no predictions about this in the bible\n \n \nIt predicts that recorded human history will be less that 10k years. That is what we observe.\n\n recorded human history is only possible as long as humans capable of communication exist. you are correct that this development is roughly 10k years or less. however, the emergence of communication in humans by no means marks the origin of humans on the planet, far less of life on the planet\n \n \nIt predicts that man has always been intelligent and ancient language and buildings confirm this.\n\n wrong, man's existence predates the existence of buildings and language. therefore man was not always intelligent\n \n \nIt predicts that billions of fossils will be found in rock laid down by water all over the world, this we have observed.\n\n the fossils have been explained. they are shown to have been deposited at very different times and for very different reasons\n \n \nIt predicts there will be pathways in the sea, this is so.\n It predicts that the heating of the air will create wind and this is so.\n It predicts that the sea is the source of rain and it is so.\n\n -no comment-\n \n \nIt predicted 800 years in advance that the Messiah the King would ride in to erusalem on a donkey to the exact day . That He would be crucified and his side pierced with a spear and cry out My God , My God why has thou forsaken me ?and it was so. It was predicted the ones who crucified him would cast lots for his garments and they did. That three days later He would rise from the dead and He did.\n\n the very book that claims these predictions were made is the book that claims that these prediction were fullfilled. similarly, the wizard gandalf predicted that he would return to minas tirith in 3 days, and he did. nothing about a book making claims and following through on the claims makes it a truthful book\n \n \nThat DNA mutates does not prove anything other that it mutates. It is almost always harrmul or fatal and has never been observed to change one kind of an animal into another.\n\n which is why evolution is a theory. you are correct that speciation has never been observed, but the fact remains that different species are known to be related and classified as such (eg, ferrets and weasels). while this does not prove the theory of evolution, it agrees with it\n \nThat the species that adapt to their environment survive and those that don't die is a self evident truth not evidence. About as intellectually stimulating as saying most things who fail to survive die.\n\n or as inteelctually stimultaing as saying that the sea is the source of rain. scientific observations are not intended to entertain you. they help answer questions about reality\n \n \nFossils exist. Now that is a brilliant statement. Why not say , water exist , or sand is? \n\n -no point-\n \n \nAll dating methods are based on circular logic. If the date agrees with the theory it is correct , if not it must be contaminated. It is based on an assumtion of the quantity of some radioactive substance in a material at some time in the past and how much has decayed when compared to the rate of decay gives us a date. Fortunately we already knew the earth was very old or evolution could not have occured. We know how old fossils are because of the rocks they are in and how old the rocks are by the fossils in the rocks. If the 2 are in the wrong place then we know there was an overthrust which is basically a miracle from God which is allowed because evolution needs it.\n\n wrong, rocks and other mineral deposited are dated without fossils in them. similarly, fossil can be correctly dated by means of radiocarbon methods because the quantity of isotope that was there to begin with is known. \n \n \nLife forms in the millions so therefore it must has started out as a random bunch of chemicals that created itself on a planet that created itself and evolved into the millions we see now. Another brilliant deduction. You are on a roll.\n Believe our eyes. Oh you must mean all those times you are walking down the beach and trip all over the lobe finned fish coming on shore for the first time. Or the thousands of times we have seen a lizard with half a wing or a beaver giving birth to an armadillo. Yes , seeing is believing.\n You present a brilliant argument. How could anyone argue with your brand of logic? That would be senseless.\n\n your logic entails being oblivious to reality and depending on a book full of internal and irreconcilable contradictions to tell you what reality is.",

   "On the Isaac Newton heresy point, he was an arian unitarian: didn't believe in the divinity of Christ. Is that enough heresy? Plus it was the CofE he had to hide his beliefs from, what with being English and all.\n \n gnojek: God bless you. And i never say that. The worst thing for atheists and rligious people alike is the sort of ******** that you so rightly identified. Basically the argument seems to be 'take any passage in the Bible out of context, see if it could refer to Christ, call it prophecy. I might as well quote 'was a just and upright man' out of Job and say it applies to Jesus.\n \n As for all the out of Egypt, out of Bethlehem and slaying of the innocents stuff, that's very likely added to attempt to fulfill prophecy. There is no evidence of a census to tax the whole world (which brought Mary to Bethlehem), though censuses of the Roman Empire were recorded. And the slaughter of the innocents isn't mentioned in other sources, though you would of thought people would have noticed. As for the quote about a virgin giving birth: the Hebrew is 'maid' in the sense of 'young girl'. This is an embarassing case of the early Christians misreading the Hebrew. They ended up persecting Jews for pointing out that the Bible never said virgin",

   "I think that it is important to further explore a few things that this debate brings up. It is much larger than simply evolution, indeed it gets to the heart of Christian evangelicalism, which often times turns fundamentalist. By fundamentalist I shall use Emmanuel Sivan, R. Scott Appleby, and Gabriel A. Almonds' definition from \"Strong Religion\" \"'Fundamentalism,' in this usage, refers to a discernible pattern of religious militance by which self-styled 'true believers' attempt to arrest the erosion of religious identity, fortify the borders of the religious community, and create viable alternatives to secular institutions and behaviors.\" (p. 17) Now this definition will take some parising so people don't leap to conclusions.\n \n First off by \"religious militance\" we take militance in a broad term. It need not be physical militance like the Army of God (www.armyofgod.com) or the infamous Jihadist of \"The Base\" organization (in arabic Al Qu'ada). By religious militance I, and the trio of authors above, mean that they are 'fighting' in some organized and methodical way for their religious conviction. One can view this, especially as Jessica Stern does, as a \"political battle\" or as the authors of strong religion does as a stuggle against \"the outside [that] is polluted, contagious, dangerous.\" For they are \"in exile.\"\n \n This is why they \"fight\" for the interpretation of events that would suite their religious needs, and by needs I use the term like I would use it for a basic life need, because for religious fundamentalists, religion is a life need. So we have people who are determined to protect themselves against the erosion, especially from within the \"faithless\" members who claim to espouse the same religion.\n \n This is why you see people like Falwall and Robertson fighting so hard especially against the \"liberals\" and why it seems fundamentalists on this board fight harder against christian pro evolutionists than they seem to do against Al Qu'ada and Islamic extremists. Indeed it seems when they talk about the Islamic extremists they talk about them in caricatures and a sort of extension of their evangelical goals... complete conversion to THEIR definition of true religion.\n \n So what does this have to do with this thread? I want to give context to those most radical supports of Creationism, those people who seem to flat out ignore some strong evidence (note I am not saying conclusive, because I realize such a thing is near inconceivable when it comes to science, but is a necessity when it comes to religion.)\n \n These people feel \"deracinated,\" that is uprooted. They look at our modern secular culture and for some reason feel no cantus firmii, no firm base, no place to root themselves. I'm not necessarily talking about spiritually, but just about society in general. Our news, which I presently have on to \"Late Edition\" with Wolf Blitzer, leaps from topic to topic, often unrelated to our personal lives. People are changing jobs rapidly and information is coming at us faster than we can assimilate it. \n \n Imagine taking all the stuff that is on TV, newspapers, novels, books, radios, everywhere; a totality of existence. For some people it is so overwhelming- they retreat into this brand of religion because it gives them something to grasp on. It gives them a Manichaeanist world-view (one of good v. evil, black v. white, light v. darkness, just let your archetypical imagination free) which is protected by a wall of virtue which CLEARLY DELINEATES what is good, light, and white; and by extension, what is not. What is evil, dark, black.\n \n They feel part of this fundamentalist community, which is together in exile. They now have people to directly relate to, those that feel the same exact angst about society and find solace in being \"the select\" and have true knowledge of \"The Truth\". The Truth is often found in absolute truth claims which are then followed blindly. These truth claims often involve taking things literately which aught not to be done.\n \n You see there is a crucial difference between mythos (the myth of religion) and the logos (more scientific evidence) of everyday life. Mythos was the common communal story. For the 12 tribes of Israel the mythos was Genesis, the logos, was every day life which DID NOT include genesis. They were well aware that Genesis would not be true, it was a story they told children, like Santa Clause. It was just a common story that gave their lives meaning, like Chris Columbus for America, or like the folk stories of the West. Not to be taken seriously, but to unite people under a common thread.\n \n What happens is that the fundamentalists are now blending the mythos and logos and now believe that Genesis, which was a mythos, should now be taken as a logos, as a scientific belief of life, indeed even more, it should be a FACT of life. This is our story, this is how we got here, AND IT IS 100% TRUE AND COMPLETELY IRREFUTABLE. It was done by the divine winds, and it is a mysterious business, but everything else is outside of the enclave and is simply trying to mislead us, to tear us away from God. \n \n This is the mindset that these fundamentalists are bringing to bear. this is what they believe. We can cart out whatever evidence we want to. We can say whatever we want to. But their believe in this is absolute, as absolute as my belief in gravity, or your belief in your existence. To dissuade them of this is ... in a word ... virtually impossible. They must come to see it for themselves that they are wrong. Like the Millerites of old, some prediction will prove awfully wrong, and individuals will come to their senses. Until then... I will join you in our truly absurd effort to show the evidence of evolution, for hope that some moderates, some understanding people will realize the vast amount of strong evidence that compels us to believe that evolution is a part of the most logical explanation of how we got here.",

   "I was rummaging around the boards and found this post (http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=4169) by Black Pheonix. It is exactly what I am talking about. The view that the time we live in is \"the worst\" and that the enclave \"The good\" is being eroded by the other \"the evil\". \n \n The sad truth is, this is life. Nothing much has changed. In the 1990's you had the Hutti's genocide of the Tutti's. In the 1950's you had Stalin's purges, in WWII you had Hitler. I suggest you read Chaulcer, a medieval author, who has lots of sex and \"perverted\" stuff in his works. What of the medieval love poems where sex runs rampant? Remember most of Shakespeares love poems were written to men, or so it is believed. Also let us leap back to Ancient Greece, where homosexuality was more than accepted.\n \n Even in the Victorian era, when sex was at its most REPRESSED state... it only succeeded in creating a culture of sexual innuendo that rivals that of the Carmina Burana (which the lyrics were written by medieval troubadours.)\n \n Let's face it, if humanity is being shoved into the gutter now, nothing is new.I happen to disagree with the Black Pheonix, we have more freedoms and more people better off today than even 10 years ago.",
