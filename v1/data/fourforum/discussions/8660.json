   "hello! i've just now read a news that says that georgian special services in cooperation with american experts in informational technologies are preparing a new frame-up video clip featuring emzar kvitsiani, former president of georgia who resigned as a result of the rose revolution and declared disobedience to the new georgian government of mikhail saakashvili, and now is the leader of the kodori gorge rebellion. it is said in the news that kvitsiani was captured in kobuleti by special forces jointly commanded by the interior minister of georgia vano merabishvili and defence minister irakli okruashvili, however this fact is kept secret. they are said to be planning to feign an interview with emzar kvitsiani as if filmed in abkhazia, while he is actually kept in secret cia prison not far from tbilisi \n \n well, honestly, this news did not surprised me. it has been known since very long ago that there are secret cia prisons in georgia where not only iraqi and afghani insurgents are held in detention, but also political antagonists of current regime of georgia. as for the frame-up interview with kvitsiani, this is a trite method that the cia has used million times to help president bush improve his rating and make the nation unite in the face of global terrorism. for example a recording with osama bin laden or al-zarkaui. it is known that the both terrorists are dead, however their \"addresses to america\" with threats appeared from time to time at the moment when bush needed to undertake an offensive against iraq or afghanistan. anyway, it's a fake and the same about emzar kvitsiani. georgia and cia experts will only use him to discredit abkhazia and use this interview as an excuse for an assault against this break-away autonomy. the cia simply helps georgia to reunite with its autonomies by means of stale methods",
