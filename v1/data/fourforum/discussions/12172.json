Yet when it comes to individual contributions to charitable causes, liberals are cheapskates.\n \n Arthur Brooks, (who is also a liberal) the author of a book on donors to charity, &#8220;Who Really Cares,&#8221; cites data that households headed by conservatives give 30 percent more to charity than households headed by liberals. A study by Google found an even greater disproportion: average annual contributions reported by conservatives were almost double those of liberals.http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/opinion/21kristof.html",

Planned Parenthood Abortion Business Makes $1 Billion Income for First Time \n Planned Parenthood Abortion Business Makes $1 Billion Income for First Time\n Email this article\n Printer friendly page\n \n RSS Newsfeed\n \n by Steven Ertelt\n LifeNews.com Editor\n March 28, 2008\n \n \n Washington, DC (LifeNews.com) -- A new annual report from Planned Parenthood shows the nation's largest abortion business has made over $1 billion in income for the first time in its history. The non-profit pro-abortion group shows the historical gain in its new annual report covering 2006-2007.\n \n While Planned Parenthood made $972 milion in its 2005-2006 annual report, last fiscal year it brought in $1.017 billion.\n \n On its web site posting of the annual document, Planned Parenthood says it \"highlights our advancements in providing and protecting trusted health care services and medically accurate sexuality education.\"\n \n Instead, the report finds Planned Parenthood doing more abortions than ever before.\n \n The report shows an increase in the number of provided abortions from 264,943 in 2005 to 289,650 in 2006.\n \n Planned Parenthood reveals it has doubled \"excess of revenue over expenses\" funds from $55.7 million in 2005 to $112 million in 2006.\n \n Of concern to pro-life groups, Planned Parenthood acknowledges the receipt of over $336 million in government grants and contracts from both state and federal governments. However, the abortion business provides no breakdown showing how much Planned Parenthood received from the federal government or specifics states.\n \n The revelations from the annual report upset Tony Perkins, the head of the Family Research Council.\n \n \"A majority of Americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortion -- however, still Planned Parenthood receives more than $300 million in taxpayer funding each year for 'family planning' projects that help bolster their abortion trade,\" he told LifeNews.com.\n \n He said Planned Parenthood was not a \"wise investment\" of public money because of its history.\n \n \"Would you invest in a company whose affiliates are complicit in sexual crimes against children?\" he asked, pointing to numerous instances of its centers doing abortions on victims of statutory rape and sexual abuse.\n \n \"Would you take your hard-earned money and pile it into a company whose fundraisers \"get excited\" when someone wishes to target African-American babies for extinction?\" he asked.\n \n The comment refers to a recent investigative report from students at UCLA who found Planned Parenthood officials excited about receiving donations from a racist donor.\n \n Perkins said the ultimate slap in the face to the majority of Americans who are pro-life is the fact that Planned Parenthood still receives government funds despite the fact its political action committee will spend $10 million in this year's election on pro-abortion candidates.\n I will assume you have no problem at all with PP supporting pro death candidates, right? Your ignorance and hypocrisy is mind numbing as you make completely irrational arguments in support of an industry that thrives on murdering the most innocent and defenseless among us.

   "[INDENT][COLOR=&quot;Navy&quot;]Planned Parenthood Abortion Business Makes $1 Billion Income for First Time\n \n by Steven Ertelt\n LifeNews.com Editor\n March 28, 2008\n \n \n Washington, DC (LifeNews.com) -- A new annual report from Planned Parenthood shows the nation's largest abortion business has made over $1 billion in income for the first time in its history. The non-profit pro-abortion group shows the historical gain in its new annual report covering 2006-2007.\n \n While Planned Parenthood made $972 milion in its 2005-2006 annual report, last fiscal year it brought in $1.017 billion.\n \n On its web site posting of the annual document, Planned Parenthood says it \"highlights our advancements in providing and protecting trusted health care services and medically accurate sexuality education.\"\n \n Instead, the report finds Planned Parenthood doing more abortions than ever before.\n \n The report shows an increase in the number of provided abortions from 264,943 in 2005 to 289,650 in 2006.\n \n Planned Parenthood reveals it has doubled &#8220;excess of revenue over expenses&#8221; funds from $55.7 million in 2005 to $112 million in 2006.\n \n Of concern to pro-life groups, Planned Parenthood acknowledges the receipt of over $336 million in government grants and contracts from both state and federal governments. However, the abortion business provides no breakdown showing how much Planned Parenthood received from the federal government or specifics states.\n\n Chiming in here, yes, I can well imagine that Planned Parenthood does get income from the abortions it performs - income needed to pay its doctors, administrators, and to pay for media informing women of the existence of the centers where they can get an abortion if they need to. Given the unfortunate fact that there are a large number of unwanted pregnancies where women find themselves needing an abortion, such a service may not be all brightness and light, but it is an unfortunate necessity and, as such, needs to have an operating budget. The only behavior I would consider bad is if it tried to convince or coerce women to get abortions who would not otherwise consider it, or if they were charging such exhorbitant fees as to make the heads very rich on it (since, if it is to receive donations from people, it should be a not-for-profit corporation). Do you claim that either of those are true?\n \n As for the two quotes about bad behavior:\n \n\"Would you invest in a company whose affiliates are complicit in sexual crimes against children?\" he asked, pointing to numerous instances of its centers doing abortions on victims of statutory rape and sexual abuse.\n\n I don't see how this is considered a negative. Even most pro-life advocates support abortion rights in the case of rape or incest. Who is to provide abortions in such situations if not an organization such as Planned Parenthood. If the only guilt they have is in providing the abortions, then I don't see that as a guilt and nearly everyone in the US would seemingly agree since nearly everyone supports abortion in cases of rape.\n \n\"Would you take your hard-earned money and pile it into a company whose fundraisers \"get excited\" when someone wishes to target African-American babies for extinction?\" he asked.\n \n The comment refers to a recent investigative report from students at UCLA who found Planned Parenthood officials excited about receiving donations from a racist donor.\n\n If they planned on carrying out racist policies to please that racist donor, then I would be worried. Unless you have some evidence that they are carrying out racist policies, then that point is also irrelevant. There are many Republicans who are racist who contribute to various Republican political organizations. Should those organizations reject all donations from racists out of principal? I'm afraid that that would significantly reduce the money pooring in. For me, the political or ethical persuasion of the donor isn't as important as whether or not there is any suspician that the organization receiving the funds will do anything unethical to please that donor. I don't see that being the case with Planned Parenthood where racism is concerned.",

   "Wow. Simone, you love to deal in absolutes, and it appears that you also commonly tell people what they believe, rather that letting them tell you. I am a pro-life, and I am also a Christian. \n \n If you think that Christians and pro-lifers don't care about people after they are born, then you haven't read a single word that Christ said. He spoke of love for all people, including those who don't agree with me. I don't think you even believe what you say, you just say it in an attempt to insult the sayer enough to get a rise out of them, and hurt them back for views that you find to be offensive.\n \n If you want to have a \"grown-up\" discussion of why I think abortion is wrong, and stop insulting or attempting to anger me, and even pretend to be modestly respectful of anybody's views that are not your own, I would be willing to talk with you. You are not doing your cause any justice by being so incredibly close minded. I know many pro-choicers that I get along very well with; we both respect the other person's opinion. \n \n You seem to prefer insults to logic and fact. Please try to be respectful. You can start by not calling us \"fetus worshipers.\" That would be like me calling you a \"death-monger.\" It does not represent truth or respect. I do not believe you are really a \"death-monger.\"\n \n You also immediately assume that because I am pro-life, I am ignorant. You don't even stop to wonder WHY I am pro-life. You assume that it is because I am stupid or evil, which is a great way to get all pro-lifers to stop listening instantly. If you want to convince us, start by treating us like equals.",

I am a U.S. citizen, a republican, AND I am an activist against poverty, hunger, and am a crusader for education. I don't fit in that tidy little box that you try to shove us all into. Believe it or not, I do not agree with republicans who think that all liberals and democrats are, \"lazy, socialist, baby-killing hippies who want to dip into the money that I worked so hard to earn.\" Why? Because it's not true or fair to lump people together that way. It's very ignorant to subscribe to stereotypes. Yet this is exactly what you are doing to us with your blatant slander of our beliefs. \n \n Republicans are only after wars and profit, huh?\n \n So was Lincoln (a Republican,) after money when he commanded Grant and McClellan to march against the south? Or maybe Regan? Yeah, he must have been after money and war when he avoided the tension with Russia turning into a real war, and ended the cold war without firing a shot...\n \n \nKeep them stupid and send them off to our endless wars so that our war contractors and manufacturers can make bundles of money.\n\n Let's examine the republican war record. Now, what would we call the major wars of last century? \n \n I would say, Phillipines conflict, WWI, WWII, Korean War, Vietnam War, Gulf war. Did I miss any important ones? Not according to wikianswers. (it won't let me post the link. Just google \"USA wars 1900's\")\n \n Now let's look at this carefully: The president who declared war for the Phillipines and WWI was Woodrow Wilson, a DEMOCRAT. The president who declared war for WWII was Theodore Rosevelt, a DEMOCRAT, the president who declared the Korean war was Harry Truman, a DEMOCRAT, and the Vietnam conflict turned into war under Kennedy and Johnson, DEMOCRATS. The Gulf War was declared by Bush, who was a republican. Now this is what I think is funny. The REPUBLICANS are seen was war mongers, when out of the 6 wars for USA in the 1900's, 5 were headed by democrats. The cold war, potentially the biggest of the century, and seen as inevitable by many experts worldwide, was AVERTED BY A REPUBLICAN. How? By spending money, NOT GAINING it. \n \n Now go ahead, I think you were saying something funny about republicans being war-mongers?\n \n Which one did we reap the most economic benefit from? WWII, (DEMOCRAT) which had the government spending three times what FDR's \"NEW DEAL\" ever did, and THAT was what ended the Depression. Look it up if you don't believe me. So do I think FDR started into WWII because it would give us money? No. I think it was because the snot was bombed out of Pearl Harbor. Please use facts, not empty accusations. Try to convince, not insult me.\n \n My father is a volunteer pastor. He works 40 hours a week as a business consultant, then gives all his free time to helping run his local church, RECEIVING NO PAYMENT. His services are helping people overcome addictions, assisting with welfare needs of his congregation, organizing service projects for people with medical or other needs, and running Sunday services. He donates 12% of all of his income to charity. He is not a rich man. He took in a girl who was in an abusive household and had no-where else to go. She and her two children lived with us for seven years. He paid their food and insurance, and charged them no rent. Five years ago, he did it again. We now have a young man living with us whose mother was a druggie. He didn't want to fall into her habits, and wanted to get out of that situation before he ended up one too. That young man still lives with them. Many times, people come up to me in tears and tell me what my Dad did for them when they were having trouble. Dad does this on less than $50,000 a year.\n \n He raised me to do the same. I donate 14% of my income to charity. (it's not much, I'm a full-time student.) I volunteer locally whenever I can. I'm a volunteer tutor locally, for the TOPS program.\n \n He served in city government AS A REPUBLICAN. HE IS PRO-LIFE. But I'm sorry, please continue. You were saying something funny about how hard-hearted we are, and how we only care about people who aren't born yet. \n \n Yeah, you must be right. We're downright evil. Shame on us.\n \n Just because we ALSO care about the unborn, why do you assume we care about nothing else? Just because we believe that we shouldn't be forced to be charitable, why do you think that we don't believe in being charitable ourselves? It means we don't think the government spends our money in the best way, not that we want to keep all our money. \n \n You seem to find thing you don't agree with, and assume that that's what we are all about. Democrats believe in expanding welfare and governmental control. So if I were using your tactics, I'd start to say, \"All you care about is having your dictatorship government, and paying lazy people to do nothing! You don't care that AIDS is killing hundreds of thousands in Africa! You don't care that children are being brain-washed into being soldiers and killing other children!\" But I wouldn't say that. It would be ridiculous. It's way off-base. It's not close to the truth. I know that the Democratic platform is about so much more than that. I don't agree with it, but I wouldn't slander it like that. \n \n So why doing almost that exact thing to us? Your original post assumes that we don't care about rape and human trafficking. Now you throw in education. So let me ask again: just because we care about the unborn, and you don't, why do you assume that we care about nothing else?",

A fetus cannot understand any language, so how do we know of the \"mind\" is functional or not?\n\n No citation, just my own reasoning for why/where I would draw my own personal line - a general fuzziness line around the point where the mind becomes functional in a foetus (2nd/3rd trimesterish) and it all seems to start working. As far as official guidelines go, I'm very much of the opinion voiced in Roe vs Wade - there are a great many opinions, both scientific and non, as to where 'individual life' begins; and in the end it comes down to personal choice - that is, each woman should make her own choice where to draw the line, as long as it falls before before a near-universally recognised boundary such as viability (although even a later boundary such as birth didn't use to be the case; cf the Spartans killing off sickly children).\n \n With regards to 'mind' itself - yes, there is certainly a lot we don't know about it yet. I loved the TED talk a few years back about mirrors and phantom limb pain - definitely relevant to self-awareness and how 'correct' it may be. It's another set of fuzzy definitions. Your article made for an excellent quick read - I may well revisit it later when I'm more awake.\n \n As for 'potential' life - again, we have another fuzzy term. Does 'potential' refer to an ejaculated sperm? A fertilised egg which is yet to embed itself in the uterine wall? A four-cell zygote? A baby pre-birth? Or - worse - an un-ejaculated sperm or the sexual urges of a rapist-to-be? Hence my opinion of personal choice of the woman. If you consider condoms to be infanticide - don't have sex with one on. If you think abortion is murder - don't have one. But unless you have conclusive evidence to push back that near-universally accepted border, you shouldn't force your line onto other people (although trying to convince them of your line is fine by me, clinic-bombing tactics notwithstanding).\n \n That drink sounds good to me.emoticon_xgood\n \n \nWhat is it about chimeras that proves what I said (that a prebirth child has different DNA from it's mother) is wrong?\n \n All things (Genetic malady's or mutations) being considered,... my point remains that a human fetus is not \"part of the mother's body.\" Again, check the DNA. \nChimeras don't disprove that a foetus/embryo/zygote has different DNA from its mother, but they do disprove your other statement - that this fact implies that the ZEF (Ah!

If I told you that reckless slaughter of kindergarteners was underway, with over 21,000 children killed a day just so their parents could be rid of them, you'd be appalled, and would consider it a terrible occurance, which must be stopped. To me, it's almost the same. The very existence of at-will abortion is an affront to me. With FOCA, if I understand it correctly, some of my tax dollars will be paying for what I consider murder. In its very admittance, it is being forced on me. \n \n Conversely, if I had my way, and abortion were limited to rape and medical necessity, it would force women to choose another alternative. (It's \"the woman's right to make a sixth choice,\" that everybody is arguing for. Choices, they have.) In this way, yes, I would be forcing my opinions on somebody. \n \n In the end, it's their choice on me, or my choice on them. I hate it, but I see no real compromise possible. \n \n This brings us to the fact that the \"establishment\" clause that gives us freedom of religion is, in fact, promoting a religious approach. Atheism is becoming the state religion. In some ways, such as abortion, atheism gives us a course of action that is in direct contradiction to many religions, such as mine. Atheism IS a religious school of thought. It IS a belief about God, or gods, that is, that He/they do not exist. Therefore, religious ideals by very nature, must be forced on somebody. \n \n Here's me baring all:\n I don't have any suggestions to fix this. I don't have any snappy response that will make it more right for me to have my ideal being the one that is enforced. I believe in mine, and therefore I support it; just as you believe in yours, and therefore you support it. I have plenty of reasons why I believe in mine, but so do you. Therefore I don't pretend that you accept my religious reasons. Obviously, there are millions of conflicting religious ideals, and I believe in empirical basis for laws. I do believe in a God of science and logic, though. So I believe that the scientific, ethical, emotional, and scientific backing is on my side. If only legal backing were too... emoticon_confused\n \n I paraphrase Churchill in his statement about capitalism, but I'm using it in reference to USA's attempt at separation between church and state; \"It's the worst system out there, except for everything else.\"\n \n I'm not a fundamentalist. I may not agree with what you have to say, but I'd fight to the death to defend you're right to say it.\n \n About that drink... I don't do alcohol, it is fine with you if my beer is of the \"root\" variety? emoticon_xhoho\n \n Today I've put down a summary of my main points on the issue.

   "@Romebigred:\n \n I still am agreeing with much of what you are saying - I'm not a fan of abortion used as contraception, either (unless the already-there contraception has failed, which does happen). However, I do disagree with a couple of things.\n \n Firstly, what you consider as an appropriate reason for redrawing 'the line' of legal abortion to a date earlier than it currently is - which seems to be that if the topic is being debated, you think the line should be redrawn 'just in case'. The problem I have here is that many different people have many different versions of 'the line' - and some go back to before where you would draw it, to the point of making contraceptives illegal because 'every sperm is sacred' (thanks, Monty Python). As I said before, you could even hypothesize that some rapists consider their act to be an attempt to realise as much 'potential life' as possible, although I would probably avoid that argument as it's a little too slippery-slope-esque. To simplify - the fact that some people consider a zygote to be 'life' should not be reason enough to protect all zygotes, simply because some people consider 'sperm' to be equally as 'alive'. What is needed instead is conclusive evidence that a zygote is 'alive'; by 'alive', I mean 'alive as a person', not 'alive as a cell' (to differentiate between sperm and zygote).\n \n Secondly, and slightly off-topic, I still don't consider 'atheism' to necessarily be a belief, though it certainly is for some. Atheism as I see it, from my agnostic POV, is just the absence of belief, nothing more - my laptop is an atheist, because it has no belief, as is a new-born baby. If you consider atheism to be the rejection of God, then you have to also include atheism to be the rejection of all things theistic, be it God, Allah, Shiva, Ra, Loki, Oden, the Invisible Pink Unicorn or the old, forgotten gods, who we shouldn't be able to reject because we don't even know. who they were any more. Going by that notion, you see that even believers are 'atheists', it's just that they reject one less god than everyone else -this approach makes little sense.\n \n Finally, on adoption. Adoption is a wonderful thing - but I don't consider it a practical solution to the problem of abortion. In a year in the US, about 127,000 children are adopted, but about 1.2 million ZEFs are aborted. Boosting adoption rates by a factor of ten just isn't practical, or even possible.\n \n It's good to read your posts. I look forwards to your reply.\n \n @Chuz: What do you mean, ''part of' as I am implying'? I would consider it obvious that a (successfully) transplanted heart is part of the recipient's body, and I would argue that a foetus is equally a part of the mother's body - the mothers body breathes for it, digests food for it and supplies it nutrients, protects if from harm etc.",

   "iangb, your posts continue to impress me. \n \n JP, I take your same view on Roe V Wade. My research paper was done for an audience that was fairly ignorant of the actual content of Roe V. Wade, and might not tell you anything you don't already know, but I would love to give a copy of my research paper to you. Not sure quite how to accomplish that... \n \n \n iangb:I still don't consider 'atheism' to necessarily be a belief, though it certainly is for some. Atheism as I see it, from my agnostic POV, is just the absence of belief. If you consider atheism to be the rejection of God, then you have to also include atheism to be the rejection of all things theistic, be it God, Allah, Shiva, Ra, Loki, Oden, the Invisible Pink Unicorn or the old, forgotten gods, who we shouldn't be able to reject because we don't even know. who they were any more. Going by that notion, you see that even believers are 'atheists', it's just that they reject one less god than everyone else -this approach makes little sense.\n\n \n I don't follow you here... I can see where you are coming from, but I don't consider a person atheist if they are ignorant of the existence of the belief. Mirriam-Webster defines atheism thus: \"a : a disbelief in the existence of deity b : the doctrine that there is no deity\" \n \n Disbelief is \": the mental rejection of something as untrue\" People ignorant of God (I mean the God of the Jews, Christians and Muslims,) do not 'mentally reject' the existence of God. That's non-belief, not disbelief. \n \n Therefore atheism is active belief that there is no god/God. It is \"the doctrine that there is no deity\" It is a belief that relates to the theological, therefore it is a religious belief. Mirriam-Webster, \"religious: ...2: of, relating to, or devoted to religious beliefs or observances\" Atheism certainly relates to religious beliefs by countering them.\n \n However, the terms are open to many different definitions and interpretations. I'm clarifying just the definitions I use. Simply being unaware of a belief system does not make a person atheist to me.\n \n \nFinally, on adoption. Adoption is a wonderful thing - but I don't consider it a practical solution to the problem of abortion. In a year in the US, about 127,000 children are adopted, but about 1.2 million ZEFs are aborted. Boosting adoption rates by a factor of ten just isn't practical, or even possible\n\n \n That's assuming that all of those women WOULD give birth to that many children. If abortion were not an option, I think we would see many women being more cautious, and the number of pregnancies plummet. I think we can expect less than half the number of births as the current number of abortions, just based on the aborting mothers I've known personally. Also, some of those current abortion ARE medically-based, or rape-induced. I also think you might be underestimating the number of children wanted. In the last 15 years, foreign adoption rates have gone up by 400%. There are still tens of thousands of parents on domestic waiting lists for years. My parents gave up after 3 years on a list.",

   "Chuz, good point about the parasite... \n \n Iangb, also, as far as the \"slippery slope\" thing, yeah, it's true. Yet any declaration of when a life begins has that same problem. You've decided when you believe life begins. I've decided when I believe it does. What is the fundamental difference? Legislators agree with you, but other than that, I see no difference. \n \n You want us to prove to you that life begins earlier. Can you prove is doesn't? There is very little proof either way. In my developmental psychology class, we discussed how very little we know of when a fetus becomes an entity. Each study performed uses different criteria, therefore has different results. \n \n I think I would rather move it back \"just in case.\" After all, it was moved forward because legislators didn't want to deprive the mother of choice, \"just in case\" the fetus wasn't alive. All we have are guesses and theories. I think it's just as dangerous as when the US government decided that blacks were only \"3/5ths\" of a person, and were inferior to whites. That decision resulted in millions of lives being turned upside-down, and an entire race being mistreated for about two hundred years. We still feel the effects of that mistake. That's why I find it sad that the 14th amendment was one of the ones cited in Roe V Wade.",

It says much that of the six links you have finally provided, one is from wikipedia and is uncited, one has been dealt with before almost word-for-word and one is from a website whose author states (for legal reasons, I suspect) that she is not a medical professional. It also says much that your first attempt to find a 'scientific source' to confirm your view, that source instead contradicted them (more on that later) - and your response was to ignore it and go on looking.\n \n So - looking at the three remaining, you have: Planned Parenthood (presumably written by someone with a relevant qualification), PlanetPsych (I cannot find anything about the authors of the site, let's assume they're qualified) and the Biology Active Learner book (that tutorial written by Daniel Edelstein, M.S. - which I am guessing stands for Medical Student, as I cannot find a better alternative acronym). Three professional/semi-professional opinions.\n \n On the other hand, we have these:\n \"No. The zygote is not an organism.\" ~ Dr Wolpe, PhD\n \"I don't know any biologist who would classify a single cell from a Homo sapiens as a Homo sapiens. Even a zygote, which may have the *potential* to become a Homo sapiens, but is not an organism by any stretch of the imagination, is not considered an individual Homo sapiens by any members of the scientific community that I know.\" ~ Dana Kremples, PhD\n \"[Whether a zygote is an organism or not] isn't a topic of concern in the scientific community. In fact, it isn't even really science! Science is testable and falsifiable; my view is neither. This does not make it a religious view, however; consider the fact that neither is your position in this argument! It is philosophy and semantics; taxonomy with some deep thoughts, if you will!\" ~ Eugene Kalstrom, PhD.\n \n And since wikipedia now seems to be a viable source:\n \"There is no unequivocal definition of life\" ~Wikipedia\n \n Three for three! As I have said elsewhere, and Roe vs Wade stated clearly - no scientific consensus exists on the semantic definitions that you are trying to treat as as scientific fact.\n \n \n\"placenta- The organ formed on the wall of the uterus by the developing embryo that provides oxygen and other nourishment from the woman to her fetus and through which waste products are eliminated from the fetus.\"\nDidn't I say more or less exactly this - that the placenta originates from the zygote?

   "Again, biologically speaking.... a \"human\" zygote is in your opinion... \"alive\"\n That is to say \"it (a living human zygote) is alive in as much as a living sperm cell is alive.\"\n \n Is this correct? \n\n That is correct - in fact, it's tautological (see the bolded two parts from your quote). I feel that a relevant quote here would be one of my own - from the Challengers Corner thread, the early post #9.\n \nI'm not denying that the cell a zygote is made of is 'alive', nor have I ever done so - it's provably a living cell. What I am trying to do is distinguish between a 'life' in the context of a cell (which a zygote is), and a 'life' in the context of a person (which, my argument would be, it isn't). There's a big difference - for example, a corpse on life support can be composed mainly of living cells, but be entirely brain dead. In contrast, an alive person may have many dead cells as part of their body - dead skin cells, if nothing else. Furthermore, most of the cells in your body are younger than you are - most human cells live for less than ten years. You need to be talking about the period of life of the individual, not of the cells that make them up.\n",

Continue when you have time - I will do the same. I would restate, though, that this would make for better posting in the 'challengers corner' thread, as it is highly relevant and is basically a continuation of that argument, from the latest post onwards (even if we now seem to be heading slightly in circles). Plus I don't want to lose sight of my posts with romebigred, which made for very interesting reading.\n \n Where you post, though, just as with when, is up to you.",
