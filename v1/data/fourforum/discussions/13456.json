   "Time for a little provocation from DU:\n \nHow Many Child Prostitutes Is B*sh Responsible for?\n March 18, 2008\n George Bush has been tied to a prostitution ring involving as many as 50,000 women and girls. The prostitutes, some as young as 13, are among the 1.2 million desperate Iraqis who fled to Syria after Bush's invasion of Iraq in 2003, according to the U.K. Independent.\n \n Bush's invasion destroyed the Iraqi government and unleashed a wave of political and sectarian violence that has killed over 1 million Iraqis and forced 4 million to become refugees, according to the UN.\n \n Facing starvation, as many as 50,000 women and girls have been forced into prostitution in Syria alone, according to Hana Ibrahim of the Women's Will Association.\n \n \"70 percent to 80 percent of the girls working this business in Damascus today are Iraqis,\" 23-year-old Abeer told the New York Times. \"The rents here in Syria are too expensive for their families. If they go back to Iraq they'll be slaughtered, and this is the only work available.\"\n \n According to the Times, \"inexpensive Iraqi prostitutes have helped to make Syria a popular destination for sex tourists from wealthier countries in the Middle East. In the club's parking lot, nearly half of the cars had Saudi license plates.\"\n\n How Many Child Prostitutes Is B*sh Responsible for? - Democratic Underground\n \n Ah, child prostitutes! How the little black heart of Rush Limbaugh must tremble at the joy!",
