   "the reason why folks bash republicans for anti-gay intolerance and not democrats is relatively simple. Democrats don't make it part of their party platform. I'd be as upset with a democrat who opposed gay marriage as a republican. But even if 59% of dems. oppose it, i'd imagine that percentage is much higher for republicans.\n \n Oh, the other reason why republicans deserve a bit more yelling is because their opposition to gay marriage and/or civil unions is hypocritical and antithetical to their own core values. Theoretically, repubs believe in a limited government and free individual action. Regarding gay marriage, they wish to expand government into social dictates and restrict individual action on the grounds that it is to the overall benefit of society (or even worse, society \"wants\" it). Government enforcing social and/or behavorial norms? Hmm, sounds pretty authoritarian to me.",

   "God doesnt accept gays( so the bible says), so why should gays wanna be part of a religious act, dont make sense to me.\n\n \n Marriage is not a religious act for everyone. It is primarily a civil act, and this recognition is necessary in the case of death of a partner for child custody, house ownership, etc.\n \n \ni don't know what this post is meant to prove, that people are stupid?\n \n also, democrats are NOT liberal, they just happen to fall a little more left than republicans.\n\n \n Yep, your graph looks about right to me. The Republicrats are just more upfront about being murdering thieving scumbags. You know what they say, \"If voting could change anything it would be illegal\".\n \n \nI neither intensely dislike nor fear gays\n\n \n Really? Do you love them, then? You sure spend enough time creating threads to talk about them, you must have some strong emotion about them. I would hazard a guess based on the fact that you oppose their legal recognition, and have openly stated that you think people should restrict their rights, that despite what you say you have intense feelings on the subject.\n \n On the \"solutions\" proposed, I'm going to re-iterate my old one; that if there is to be no gay marriage, we should not recognize het marriage either. Have a religious ceremony if you like, party in a white dress all night, wear a ring anywhere on your person, but you get no tax or other civil benefits by being coupled.",
