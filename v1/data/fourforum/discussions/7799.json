   "A photon is both massless and timeless - which I suppose is another way of saying that when the speed of light is reached, time ends.\n\n \n Thanks for your response, \n \n Its my understanding that light does have mass. Otherwise how is it bent by gravity? As when it passes by a black hole or even our sun. In any case light and energy are different states of the same thing. E=MC(2) or M=E/C(2) granted that is a tiny bit of mass for a large amount of energy (light). \n \n There is speculation about whether our universe will expand forever or will eventually collapse into an entity such as existed before the big bang. If it does collapse, and another big bang occurs, how many times has this cycle repeated itself? \n \n If light does travel forever, wouldn't an amount of light and therefore mass escape the universe? If that is true, and if the universe expands and contracts in cycles, then will the universe after many, many of these cycles, eventually loose enough mass/energy that either it will not collapse? Expand forever? Or if it does, there will be insufficient mass/energy to create another big bang? There is also a question about whether our current universe will continue to expand forever due to it's mass or lack of sufficient mass. \n \n Ever since I first read about the big bang, I supposed that if it actually happened, and assuming that space is unending, then the big bang must have happened many times, in many different places in the cosmos, creating many different universes. If it happened once, then given enough time and space it must have happened an infinite number of times. This may be a philosophical belief on my part, but I think of both time and space as infinite. I can't imagine any alternative. \n \n I do prattle on don't I. But here's what I'm getting at. Each universe must act similarly, they must all expand and contract in cycles, rather than expand forever. otherwise the cosmos being infinitely old would be filled with the leftovers of an infinite number of old universes whose constituent parts have continued to travel through space and would continue to do so forever. I think that scenario would be more chaotic than what we observe. Likewise, if light traveled forever, universes would eventually lose mass and continue their expansion to infinity. So light must eventually slow down, turn into a particle of mass, and eventually, get rolled up in a contracting universe. But I'll admit that doesn't seem to hold with special relativity. at least as I perceive it. \n \n I realize that I've made lots of asumptions and even called on some philosophical beliefs. But it's fun to surmise how the cosmos might work. \n \n Sincerely,",

You are confusing particle-wave duality with the idea that \"particles\" should have mass, which is simply not the case.

Does light ever get converted back into mass? What happens to light when it is slowed to below lightspeed? Such as when it's absorbed by something, or is captured ba a black hole. The moment it slows to below lightspeed it ceases to be light, but does it re-acquire mass, turn into heat, or both, or does something else come into play? Thinking a little more about light I can see where it does not have mass. For example, if light is reflected back on its original path, I would think that it must stop at the reflective surface, at the point where it did it's 180 before continuing back towards it's source. But that cannot happen if the light is to remain as light. It seems that only a \"massless\" entity could do that. Does that conclusion hold with accepted theory?",

But I was thinking in much larger terms.
