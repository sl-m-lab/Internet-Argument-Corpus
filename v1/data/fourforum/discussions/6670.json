He was undoubtedly a rank amateur out of water. However, we do find the following quotations from Einstein:\n \n \"Only the Church opposed the fight that Hitler was waging against liberty. Till then I had no interest in the Church, but now I feel great admiration and am truly attracted to the Church which had the persistent courage to fight for spiritual truth and moral freedom.\" - Quoted in: Modern Fascism: Liquidating the Judeo-Christian Worldview, by Gene Edward Veith, Jr., (St. Louis, MO: Concordia Publishing House, 1993), p. 76. \n \n Albert Einstein \n Physicist and Professor, Princeton University \n 1879-1955 \n \n \"As a child I received instruction both in the Bible and in the \n Talmud. I am a Jew, but I am enthralled by the luminous figure of \n the Nazarene....No one can read the Gospels without feeling the \n actual presence of Jesus. His personality pulsates in every word. \n No myth is filled with such life. \n Jesus is too colossal for the pen of phrase-mongers, however \n artful. No man can dispose of Christianity with a bon mot.\"\n \n - George Sylvester Viereck, \"What Life Means to Einstein,\" The Saturday Evening Post, October 26, 1929.",

   "Guys, stop it.\n \n Einstein was not religious in the sense that people people try to claim, and he was actually concerned, that people would misrepresent his views in order to do just what easy is doing here. \n \n \nA man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death. (Albert Einstein, \"Religion and Science\", New York Times Magazine, 9 November 1930\n \n I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures, or has a will of the kind that we experience in ourselves. Neither can I nor would I want to conceive of an individual that survives his physical death; let feeble souls, from fear or absurd egoism, cherish such thoughts. I am satisfied with the mystery of the eternity of life and with the awareness and a glimpse of the marvelous structure of the existing world, together with the devoted striving to comprehend a portion, be it ever so tiny, of the Reason that manifests itself in nature. (Albert Einstein, The World as I See It)\n \n I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modeled after our own -- a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms. (Albert Einstein, obituary in New York Times, 19 April 1955)\n \n I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings. (Albert Einstein) Following his wife's advice in responding to Rabbi Herbert Goldstein of the International Synagogue in New York, who had sent Einstein a cablegram bluntly demanding \"Do you believe in God?\" Quoted from and citation notes derived from Victor J. Stenger, Has Science Found God? (draft: 2001), chapter 3.\n \n One strength of the Communist system ... is that it has some of the characteristics of a religion and inspires the emotions of a religion.
