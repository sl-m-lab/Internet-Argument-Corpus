   "Country music legend Buck Owens has passed away. This guy was as original as a breath of fresh air in his heyday. His sound was unique--very catchy songs--and was enhanced with the addition of his lead guitar player, Don Rich, who provided tight backup vocals and snappy Fender guitar work. Rich was killed in a motorcycle accident at the height of Owens' career, and I felt Buck never recovered from it.\n \n But he came to be known as the pioneer of the Bakersfield sound, and irritated a lot of people (me included) when he snubbed the Nashville sound in some disparaging comments. (This was another movement spearheaded by Chet Atkins, who produced lush arrangements which reached out to new audiences. I thought both sounds were legitimate, but I quickly forgave Owens.)\n \n He gained a lot of fans with his long-standing hosting duties on Hee Haw also, which became his new focus after his recording career declined.",

Why do some people think they get to define what is within the boundaries of a certain musical genre? Country music was floundering in the late 50's after Hank died. Everything and everyone tried to be another Hank. The Nashville Sound was the first to break out of the box, spearheaded by the genius of Chet Atkins. When Chet was asked what the Nashville Sound was, he'd jingle the coins in his pocket. He found a new direction for it, and attracted vast new audiences. So did Buck. \n \n \n\n Gentleman Jim still has a fan base over here - but I guess not very large now.

Though I appreciate Krause's talent and listen to her music, I prefer the sound of bluegrass instruments to vocals. As an example, on their Lonely Works Both Ways album, Krause's solo ballads with banjo accompaniment are few and far between, but other songs make up for it. \n \n That's somewhat common with local groups here (I haven't traveled in some time) who have a high pitch lead vocalist (male and female). If they have a good sound person the banjo picker can be toned down, but I often see the banjo & fiddle spotted 10-15' from the vocalist working melody, infrequently let out for a brief time to regenerate the audience mood. Most vocalists here prefer acoustic instruments as primary accompaniment because they aren't as dominant and the music of most acts with a decent vocalist is arranged around the vocals. It takes one hell of a voice to match a hot banjo or fiddle. Loretta Lynn discovered that early on.",
