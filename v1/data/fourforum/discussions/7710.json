   "I can understand why DoD should be qualified to disallow school funding relating to activities within their mandate if denied campus access for recruitment, but not all federal funding for general education. To me it looks like a government red herring for public distraction from the now all important military recruiting pool, high schools. \n \n The traditional method of recruitment within high schools and universities was ROTC. DoD furnished funding and equipment for that program, intended to furnish pre-qualified military personnel who completed their education level and then served a defined period of formal military service, many making it their career choice.\n \n If we (US) were on a defense military footing with a draft pool for expansion if attacked, without aggressive foreign policy using military actions and threats, I don't believe this issue would have been pushed to SCOTUS. The original legislation was passed in 1994, after the Gulf War made it apparent reserve units were not going to voluntarily remain on active duty regardless of threat levels and that recruitment would become a major issue in the event of any military action not backed by public patriotism. As has been proven with eventual deep public rejection of our ongoing activities in Afghanistan and Iraq. A draft for those and similar military foreign policy actions would fall flat on its face. \n \n As to the SCOTUS decision, which I haven't read, I felt it was based on the constitutional right for congress to raise an army, equal access with regard to other potential employers and disregard of existing military discrimination regarding sexual preferences while enforcing federal legislation. The constitutional right to protest, reiterated as available in the argument, has been carefully legislated out of existence by government at all levels using designated areas allowed for protest far removed from those public officials who still actually appear in public. That can easily be carried to the campus level by attachments to funding legislation. \n \n While certainly IMO not a major issue at the university level other than further trampling of the first amendment which we should be getting used to, I see no application at the high school level. What private companies recruit employees on high school campuses? With signing bonuses, pay and benefit levels and education opportunities currently being offered by the military far overshadowing private service industry employment opportunities and still failing to meet recruitment goals, something is drastically wrong with our direction and consequently this decision.",

   "This mainly concerned college campuses...more specficily private ones receiving federal money. It is not a violation of first amendment rights to say you won't get money if you don't accept the conditions. \n \n There claim was it forces the college to indirectly support their actions...not true. As Judge Scalia pointed out if someone comes knocking on your door with a warrent you are forced to say \"come on in\"...but this isn't really a violation of free speech. The colleges aren't even being forced to have these recruiters on campus....they can just not get the money.",
