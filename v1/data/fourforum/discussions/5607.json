   "So you think sleep depro or water boarding is the same as chopping off people's heads, GTFO? Come on man...these people are serious about hurting YOU. It would be criminal not to attempt to stop them.\n\n I'm not keen on people getting their heads cut off (and I never implied that I was), but waterboarding is something that was done to American prisoners by the Japanese in World War II. Of course, America was appalled by this, but it seems that it's okay now. So, next time an American is waterboarded, for whatever reason their captor feels necessitates it, America will have no grounds for complaint.\n \n But let's get back to what forms of torture are justified. You seem to be of the opinion that if it is not permanent then it's at least on the table. Then we have to ask at what point these legitimate techniques can be used.\n \n Let's go straight to the top. You capture Osama himself. You know he's a bad guy, you're 99% certain he knows about some dastardly deed that will shortly befall your nation, but as to whether he will cough up the details you are doubtful. Do you torture him? What form of torture and how much?\n \n What if he pretends to give in and feeds you a load of bogus info? You can't be certain just waterboarding him, or whatever other barbaric processes you can come up with, will work on him. So how far can you push the envelope of torture in order to be certain that he will provide useful info?\n \n Here's an idea. Why not torture someone important to him? A son or grandson perhaps? Maybe he would crack if he saw a beloved family member being tortured. You have already admitted that torturing innocent people is allowed (collateral damage is going to happen after all), so how far can we stretch this concept?\n \n And one more question. You stated back in post #32 that if you were 'caught up in a circumstance where there was a reason to think I had info about an imminent attack or plan to attack', that you would forgive those who made you uncomfortable. What if those people were Iranians? Would you be so forgiving then? Iran has pretty good reason to think that America will attack, so that scenario doesn't seem too unreasonable.",

   "Ok we'll take it point by point. (and I don't think you agree with decapitation btw...only that you don't seem to see the difference between what we sometimes are forced to do and what their actual SOP is.)\n \n We don't water board enemy SOLDIERS who follow the rules of war. When our soldiers do things that are wrong they are tried under a system of military law. If we caught Osama (or whomever) it would not be permissible to inject his family (assuming they aren't participants) with sodium pentathol or water board them. (nor to do so with minors in any circumstances).\n \n As to Iranians (the number 1 sponsor of state terror)... they came and scooped me out of the US because they believed I was about to blow up their children I'd understand their reasoning but they are more into causing terrorism than preventing it. Of all the countries in the world, I'd rather be caught by Americans.\n \n For clarification...I don't care if the innocent or guilty 'forgive' the US. I'm just stating what I believe we should do when all the choices are horrid. I think you are a bit naive to think that everything is black and white and that what we sometimes have to do to them is the same as what they want to do to us and our kids.",

I certainly see the difference between decapitation and the forms of torture used by the US, but it is a bit of a stretch to say that your nation is 'forced' to torture people.\n \n Are you sure you don't waterboard enemy soldiers? Perhaps that is just reserved for citizens who resist the occupation of their country. Just out of interest, what are 'the rules of war'. Are they the ones where the enemy is supposed to stand in one long line wearing flourescent jackets, so the might of the American military can pick them off from 50,000 feet, thereby not endangering themselves? Are ambushes not allowed when facing the vast army of the US? Just wondering.\n \n As for military law, please don't make me laugh. The US is known throughout the world for flouting the law at every turn. They sign up to internation agreements and then plead special circumstances (or make up new terminology) when someone looks at them a bit funny to avoid adhering to said agreements (The Geneva Conventions are a prime example).\n \n True, Iran is a major sponsor of state terror, but then the US has a pretty good track record too, so don't go playing victim on that one. One might also enquire as to why the US is so pally with Saudi Arabia too.\n \n But let's get back to Osama. I wasn't accusing America of using any of those extreme techniques to get him to talk. I was merely asking how far we can bend the rules to get valid info out of the old coot? We have already established that you have little concern about innocents being tortured so long as it makes you feel a little safer in your bed at night. Sure, give them a bit of money or something to stop them whining, but is that really taking responsibility?\n \n You also didn't answer the question about how much these people get compensated or who decides how much (not that I really expected one), and whether it might come to a point where it is more economical to sacrifice a few Americans rather than risking having to pay vast amounts of compensation. The more paranoid America gets, the more innocents are tortured, the less financially viable it becomes. I'm sure if some international agreement were drawn up and duly signed by the US to fix an amount of compensation for wrongful torture, the US would be coming up with bucket loads of new categories to avoid payment (you don't have any cash right now you know).\n \n We weren't 'torturing an innocent person', we were 'harrowing a lawful non-combatant'.\n \n And just in case you're watching out there ye powers that be, I claim copyright on that particular phrase, so don't go stealing it or I'll be wanting royalties.\n \n I think it's you that is naive, but then the American news hides all the really embarrassing stuff from you lot, so I guess I'll have to forgive you for that (whether you care about forgiveness or not).",
