   "Dear Readers\n The Bush administration is calling for sanctions on Iran. Now, what the hell is this going to do to stop Iran?\n Israel is being stupid and is threatening military strikes on Iran if it does not halt nuclear research/abolishment of it's research. Now, could Israel have success in bringing down Iran or even taking suspected plants down? I think Israel needs to sit this one out and let Amerika take care of it. Now, the world nuclear powers like France, Britain, Germany, America, and so on are calling for Iran to halt. They refuse. Iran wants to hold talks.\n Well, what sense does talks mean when they won't budge? The citizens of Iran support the nuclear research. There is still no shred of evidence of nuclear bomb assembling. But, you got a terrorist supporting government, and a thug as a president, why the hell would they not strive for atomic bombs?\n Now, I think the Bush administration should do heavy duty spying and proove they are making bombs. Unlike Iraq, they need to get heavy duty intel on the situation, and proove that Bush is right before marching in and shooting everyone. I think Amerikans will be very ###### off if Bush leads another war and wmd's are not there.\n Now, also, I am beginning to doubt Iran would go for nuclear bombs. One thing, Amerika and the western allies would get so ######, they would probably bomb the nuclear plants, or wage a war. The probably saw the results of Iraq how Amerika does not want weapons in their hands, it is no diffrent here. Iran is not any better than Iraq. Iran is almost identical.\n I think military strikes on their land should be the last resort. A ally in the war on Terror, Pakistan, would surely turn on us and will use it's nukes to derive us from Iran. Pakistan is a close ally with Iran and will nuke anyone that invades Tehran. \n This is almost unwinnable for the United States because if we invade, Pakistan gets involved, and if we don't, we got a thug building suspected nuclear bombs. \n I think we are at a loss on this one.\n -John Hetev Milosevic",

   "This broohaha is not really about nuclear power or nuclear weapons. That \"dispute\" has been going on for a long while now.\n \n No, that is a smokescreen and the real \"threat\" coming from Iran is the creation of the Iranian Oil Bourse, which will accept oil trade in any currency and would be stiff competition for NYMEX and IPE, which both trade solely in dollars. Saddam was about to trade oil for Euros once the sanctions on Iraq were lifted, which was planned to happen around 2003 (IIRC). The US don't play dat. We need oil to be traded for dollars so that countries around the world are required to keep dollar reserves if they want to buy oil. This keeps the value of the dollar higher that it would be if oil could be traded in other currencies. And because we insure a steady rate of inflation, it's our little way of taxing the rest of the world, a sort of economic imperialism.\n \n The Iranian Oil Bourse is scheduled to open in March of this year. There is talk of some sort of military action against Iran to occur somewhere around that time. Plan on hearing a steady increase of \"threat talk\" regarding Iran. I predict that the SOTU coming up on Tuesday may just focus on Iran and how much of a threat their nuclear program is. You won't hear their oil exchange mentioned, though.",
