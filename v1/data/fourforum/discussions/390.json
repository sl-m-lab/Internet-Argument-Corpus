   "How often do you hear in the media or from your teachers to take good care of nature? If you consume less global warming causing things like transport, heating, waste etc., you inevitably neglect economy, friends and family, if they live far away from you, health, security in the traffic, if you prefer driving a \n small car, etc.. I really regret it that hardly anyone tries to understand the whole issue. And by the way, well, if you try to blame deforesting countries for the global warming, you should first blame yourself. If you use your furniture as long as anyhow possible, much less wood is needed. If you live in a house, which is much better isolated, much less recouces will be required to use it. If you use your car only of necessary, you will use much less recources aswell. If you don't buy expensive glance-magazines, much fewer trees will have to be chopped down for paper production. If you choose to buy only products which were produced in a town close by, fewer trucks will have to be on the street. \n Well, you might argue that if you don't consume in such an extravagant way, the economy will suffer from that so that, for example, medical progress will be hampered. But there are alternatives. For example, people always tell that I have to travel abroad, if I really want to learn the English language properly. \n I totally agree with them. I prefer watching BBCworld and reading lots of interesting sites on the net. Apart from that, the capability to write properly is more important to speak it properly. \n \n Well, by the way, if you didn't know it before, in terms of global warming, your country is the most careless country of this planet! \n If you dispute my statement, it won't be a big deal to find hundreds of internet sites that prove me right. \n \n Well, but I was happy to find this issue here at all!",

I'll go by the scientific report, however, which states it is a problem.\n \n \n The amount of fresh water entering the Arctic Ocean from the rivers that feed it is increasing, UK scientists report.\n \n Writing in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, they say the increase is caused in part by human activities and is an early sign of climate change.\n \n The rise in fresh water entering the Arctic Ocean could change the global distribution of water, the team says.\n \n It could also affect the balance of the climate system itself and even possibly alter the behaviour of the Gulf Stream.\n \n The team is from the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, part of the UK Met Office.\n \n Knock-on effects\n \n The global hydrological cycle is the exchange of water between the land, the oceans and the atmosphere. The rate of the exchange is expected to increase as the Earth warms.\n \n Part of the process is likely to mean more precipitation (hail, rain, sleet and snow) at higher latitudes, and so more water flowing down the rivers.\n \n If the global water distribution changes, this could have important social and economic consequences. An altered hydrological cycle might conceivably have a profound cooling effect on north-west Europe as well.\n \n The American Geophysical Union, publisher of the journal, says: \"It could also alter the balance of the climate system itself, such as the Atlantic thermohaline circulation, a kind of conveyor belt.\n \n \"Cold water flows southward in the Atlantic at great depths to the tropics, where it warms, rises, and returns northward near the surface.\n \n \"This flow helps keep northern Europe at a temperate climate, whereas the same latitudes in North America are sparsely settled tundra or taiga.\"\n \n The Hadley researchers compared data published in 2002 from observations of Siberian river flows with model simulations, to see whether they could identify a human influence on the increase in fresh water.\n \n Making allowances\n \n They point out that higher emissions of greenhouse gases, caused by human activities, are expected to intensify the hydrological cycle in the Arctic, with higher precipitation there balanced by a reduction in the tropics.\n \n They tested the model with four simulations which took into account both human inputs and natural factors, including solar variability and volcanic eruptions.\n \n The results showed a steady increase in river discharges, especially since the 1960s, with the annual rate of increase since 1965 8.73 cubic kilometers, far greater than the long-term trend.\n \n The simulations excluded human impacts in one instance and natural impacts in another, and included all factors in a third.\n \n Dominant part\n \n The team concluded that if there had been no human inputs, the hydrological cycle would have shown no trend at all in the 20th Century.\n \n Over the past four decades, they say, human activity played the major role in the increased flows, and it is likely that the upward trend is part of the early stages of an intensified hydrological cycle.\n \n Dr Peili Wu, a team member, told the BBC: \"It looks clear to us that this is an early signal of human-induced climate change. If only natural factors were involved, you wouldn't get these results.\n \n \"It is possible the increase in fresh water entering the Arctic Ocean could contribute to an alteration in the thermohaline circulation, because it is diluting the saltiness of the seawater and reducing its density.\"\n\n \n \n \n David Sington\n \n We are all seeing rather less of the Sun, according to scientists who have been looking at five decades of sunlight measurements.\n \n They have reached the disturbing conclusion that the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth's surface has been gradually falling.\n \n Paradoxically, the decline in sunlight may mean that global warming is a far greater threat to society than previously thought.\n \n The effect was first spotted by Gerry Stanhill, an English scientist working in Israel.\n \n Cloud changes\n \n Comparing Israeli sunlight records from the 1950s with current ones, Dr Stanhill was astonished to find a large fall in solar radiation.\n \n \"There was a staggering 22% drop in the sunlight, and that really amazed me.\" Intrigued, he searched records from all around the world, and found the same story almost everywhere he looked.\n \n Sunlight was falling by 10% over the USA, nearly 30% in parts of the former Soviet Union, and even by 16% in parts of the British Isles.\n \n Although the effect varied greatly from place to place, overall the decline amounted to one to two per cent globally every decade between the 1950s and the 1990s.\n \n Dr Stanhill called it \"global dimming\", but his research, published in 2001, met a sceptical response from other scientists.\n \n It was only recently, when his conclusions were confirmed by Australian scientists using a completely different method to estimate solar radiation, that climate scientists at last woke up to the reality of global dimming.\n \n Dimming appears to be caused by air pollution.\n \n Burning coal, oil and wood, whether in cars, power stations or cooking fires, produces not only invisible carbon dioxide - the principal greenhouse gas responsible for global warming - but also tiny airborne particles of soot, ash, sulphur compounds and other pollutants.\n \n This visible air pollution reflects sunlight back into space, preventing it reaching the surface. But the pollution also changes the optical properties of clouds.\n \n Because the particles seed the formation of water droplets, polluted clouds contain a larger number of droplets than unpolluted clouds.\n \n Recent research shows that this makes them more reflective than they would otherwise be, again reflecting the Sun's rays back into space.\n \n Scientists are now worried that dimming, by shielding the oceans from the full power of the Sun, may be disrupting the pattern of the world's rainfall.\n \n There are suggestions that dimming was behind the droughts in sub-Saharan Africa which claimed hundreds of thousands of lives in the 1970s and 80s.\n \n There are disturbing hints the same thing may be happening today in Asia, home to half the world's population.\n \n \"My main concern is global dimming is also having a detrimental impact on the Asian monsoon,\" says Professor Veerhabhadran Ramanathan, professor of climate and atmospheric sciences at the University of California, San Diego. \"We are talking about billions of people.\"\n \n Alarming energy\n \n But perhaps the most alarming aspect of global dimming is that it may have led scientists to underestimate the true power of the greenhouse effect.\n \n They know how much extra energy is being trapped in the Earth's atmosphere by the extra carbon dioxide we have placed there.\n \n What has been surprising is that this extra energy has so far resulted in a temperature rise of just 0.6 degree Celsius.\n \n This has led many scientists to conclude that the present-day climate is less sensitive to the effects of carbon dioxide than it was, say, during the ice age, when a similar rise in CO2 led to a temperature rise of six degrees Celsius.\n \n But it now appears the warming from greenhouse gases has been offset by a strong cooling effect from dimming - in effect two of our pollutants have been cancelling each other out.\n \n This means that the climate may in fact be more sensitive to the greenhouse effect than previously thought.\n \n If so, then this is bad news, according to Dr Peter Cox, one of the world's leading climate modellers.\n \n As things stand, CO2 levels are projected to rise strongly over coming decades, whereas there are encouraging signs that particle pollution is at last being brought under control.\n \n \"We're going to be in a situation unless we act where the cooling pollutant is dropping off while the warming pollutant is going up.\n \n \"That means we'll get reducing cooling and increased heating at the same time and that's a problem for us,\" says Dr Cox.\n \n Even the most pessimistic forecasts of global warming may now have to be drastically revised upwards.\n \n That means a temperature rise of 10 degrees Celsius by 2100 could be on the cards, giving the UK a climate like that of North Africa, and rendering many parts of the world uninhabitable.\n \n That is unless we act urgently to curb our emissions of greenhouse gases.\n",

The least we could do is give back to the Earth, in return for everything that the Earth has done for us! \n \n All over the world there are people that are harming the Earth, without even realizing it. Sometimes we fail to throw away our trash into its rightful place - a trash receptacle. Instead, we throw it on the ground, and sometimes someone else picks it up, but most of the time, it just sits there. When we write, or print something off of the computer, we waste paper, which is causing people to deplete the world's forests. When we drive our cars, the fuel emits into the air, causing global warming. When we buy something at the store, like a box of cereal, the factory that it was made in emits smoke into the air as well. There are people carelessly animals throughout the world, which causes them to become endangered, or worse, extinct. If all of this continues, our world could end, without notice.\n \n There are many problems in the world today, more than we can all count, because of the fact that most people don't realize how serious this is. We take everything for granted when it comes to the Earth, like everything will always be the same, and we'll all live happily ever after. We are wrong... The effects of global warming, for example, are endless. Global warming is causing the ice caps, glaciers, and Polar Regions of the world, like Antarctica, the Arctic Circle, and areas around Northern Canada, Northern Russia, and Greenland, to melt. What happens is, the ice is made from fresh water, when the ice melts, the fresh water mixes with the salt water in the oceans, which makes a \"fresh/salt solution\". When the \"solution\" forms, it makes the ocean currents act strange. The ocean currents are the main source of weather. The \"solution\" is what's causing all of the ocean currents to produce \"mega\" hurricanes, tsunamis, and other \"freak weather\". If the more ice melts, the weather could only get much worse. That is why we must act fast. I am not trying to scare you, or freak you out by this, but this is a very serious matter.\n \n What can we do to help, you ask? You can recycle aluminum cans, paper, plastic, .etc. Before printing something off of your computer, think to yourself, \"Do I really need this?\" Reuse paper as often as you can. If you're doing an art project, or writing a letter, save the rest of the paper that you have left, or recycle it, instead of throwing it away. If you live in a big city, walk to places more, or even better, ride your bike more often than riding in a car. It's healthier for the planet, and you receive your daily dose of exercise as well! Get your friends involved! Make a game out of it! Ask your teacher or principal to have a Recycling Contest for your school, and the winner of the contest gets a prize, like a bike, or something like that. Ask your teacher or principal to get a school account at a local recycling center, so that whenever students recycle their cans, the money goes to the school. Plant trees around your community, or even in your own backyard! Get involved in your local 4-H. Do research on the internet for other ways that you can help out.

Most of the detailed results are based on studies of the species Coptotermes lacteus. We found that in mid-latitudes the emissions vary seasonally. As much methane is emitted in the summers as in all other seasons combined. The soils a few meters from the mounds consumed methane at an average rate of 40 &#956;g/m2/h. We found no evidence of net emissions of CO and found that H2 is consistently consumed by the mounds and the soils near the mounds. All six species studied produced chloroform. The concentrations of chloroform inside the mounds of C. lacteus were a thousand times greater than ambient levels, but our calculations show that termites are not likely to be a significant global source of chloroform. Finally, we used the results of our study, and others before us, to construct a view of the role of termites in the global carbon cycle. \n http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990JGR....95.3619K\n \n",

   "Hello! I just don't get it why the US is raising the hysteria about global warming. I saw on the Internet a US EPA report to the UN that endorses that \"human activities such as oil refining, gas and coal firing are significant causes of global warming\". But is it so in actual fact? I think there is yet much to be discovered in the process of global warming.\n \n On other hand, it may be that Washington won't let the rest of the world know the plain truth - that global warming is a result of Pentagon's experiments in the field of climate weapon research. Why not really? Many experts in fact are well in the know.... Do you recall the disastrous hurricane Katherine hitting New Orleans in 2005? Right after this act of nature there were quite few people who doubted that it was some sort of an aftermath of a climate change experiment that had got out of control of American military men. So that's why I also abandon myself to the idea that global warming is in certain connection with Pentagon's secret climate change researches. I think it is like playing with edged tools - no one knows when it would go too far. \n What's really a pity is that nobody has braved it so far to plainly blame the USA for global warming.",

   "Extract from the Daily Telegraph UK 11th July.\n \n The runaway warming predicted by their computer models simply isn't happening. Last week one of the four official sources of temperature measurement, compiled from satellite data by the University of Huntsville, Alabama, showed that temperatures have now fallen to their average level since satellite data began 30 years ago. \n \n \n Faced with a \"consensus\" view which looks increasingly implausible, a fast-growing body of reputable scientists from many countries has been coming up with a ''counter-consensus'', which holds that their fellow scientists have been looking in wholly the wrong direction to explain what is happening to the world's climate. The two factors which most plausibly explain what temperatures are actually doing are fluctuations in the radiation of the sun and the related shifting of ocean currents. \n \n Two episodes highlight the establishment's alarm at the growing influence of this ''counter consensus''. In March, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which has a key role in President Obama's plans to curb CO2 emissions, asked one of its senior policy analysts, Alan Carlin, to report on the science used to justify its policy. His 90-page paper recommended that the EPA carry out an independent review of the science, because the CO2 theory was looking indefensible, while the \"counter consensus'' view - solar radiation and ocean currents - seemed to fit the data much better. Provoking a considerable stir, Carlin's report was stopped dead, on the grounds that it was too late to raise objections to what was now the EPA's official policy. \n \n Meanwhile a remarkable drama has been unfolding in Australia, where the new Labor government has belatedly joined the \"consensus'' bandwagon by introducing a bill for an emissions-curbing \"cap and trade'' scheme, which would devastate Australia's economy, it being 80 per cent dependent on coal. The bill still has to pass the Senate, which is so precisely divided that the decisive vote next month may be cast by an independent Senator, Stephen Fielding. So crucial is his vote that the climate change minister, Penny Wong, agreed to see him with his four advisers, all leading Australian scientists. \n \n Fielding put to the minister three questions. How, since temperatures have been dropping, can CO2 be blamed for them rising? What, if CO2 was the cause of recent warming, was the cause of temperatures rising higher in the past? Why, since the official computer models have been proved wrong, should we rely on them for future projections? \n \n The written answers produced by the minister's own scientific advisers proved so woolly and full of elementary errors that Fielding's team have now published a 50-page, fully-referenced \"Due Diligence'' paper tearing them apart. In light of the inadequacy of the Government's reply, the Senator has announced that he will be voting against the bill. \n \n The wider significance of this episode is that it is the first time a Western government has allowed itself to be drawn into debating the science behind the global warming scare with expert scientists representing the \"counter consensus\" - and the \"consensus\" lost hands down.",

   "It seems that there is a large variation in Global Warming hypotheses and ideas. Some people believe that global warming is a severe threat, and that we should take immediate action, or it will result in environmental destruction in the near future. (Being 100 years from now.) Some persons, however, believe that global warming is a hoax projected by the democratic government. There are many ideas, yet I would like to state mine very boldly. Global Warming is not a problem. In fact, it is a hoax, a fake. I will give you basic statistics on global warming. There are cycles of warming that occur during the periods of time, as well as periods of cooling. For example, the ice age. Yet, the democratic government uses global warming as a scare to the public, just as well as they use everything as a a scare to the public. And this is not just for the democratic side, but sometimes even the republican side scares the public just for money. Money, money, money. The government does things, creates unreal issues just so you give them money. Yet, that money is distributed to \"global warming?\" No, it isn't because you can't spend money to cure \"global warming.\" It is not a financial issue or a public issue, it is a astronomical issue. But it is all a lie. First of all they state that it is a problem, and that it will get very bad, enough to destroy our earth. Then, they want to spend money on it, but they can't.

   "The Climate Change Climate Change :: Senator Steve Fielding\n \n Doesn't look like it is a fabrication.\n\n \n This link is worth repeating for its relevance, especially now in light of the Cap and Trade Legislation.\n The Climate Change Climate Change\n News Clippings June 26 2009\n \n Wall Street Journal\n By Kimberley Strassell\n June 26, 2009\n \n Steve Fielding recently asked the Obama administration to reassure him on the science of man-made global warming. When the administration proved unhelpful, Mr. Fielding decided to vote against climate-change legislation.\n \n If you haven't heard of this politician, it's because he's a member of the Australian Senate. As the U.S. House of Representatives prepares to pass a climate-change bill, the Australian Parliament is preparing to kill its own country's carbon-emissions scheme. Why? A growing number of Australian politicians, scientists and citizens once again doubt the science of human-caused global warming.\n \n Among the many reasons President Barack Obama and the Democratic majority are so intent on quickly jamming a cap-and-trade system through Congress is because the global warming tide is again shifting. It turns out Al Gore and the United Nations (with an assist from the media), did a little too vociferous a job smearing anyone who disagreed with them as \"deniers.\" The backlash has brought the scientific debate roaring back to life in Australia, Europe, Japan and even, if less reported, the U.S.\n \n In April, the Polish Academy of Sciences published a document challenging man-made global warming. In the Czech Republic, where President Vaclav Klaus remains a leading skeptic, today only 11% of the population believes humans play a role. In France, President Nicolas Sarkozy wants to tap Claude Allegre to lead the country's new ministry of industry and innovation. Twenty years ago Mr. Allegre was among the first to trill about man-made global warming, but the geochemist has since recanted. New Zealand last year elected a new government, which immediately suspended the country's weeks-old cap-and-trade program.\n \n The number of skeptics, far from shrinking, is swelling. Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe now counts more than 700 scientists who disagree with the U.N.-13 times the number who authored the U.N.'s 2007 climate summary for policymakers. Joanne Simpson, the world's first woman to receive a Ph.D. in meteorology, expressed relief upon her retirement last year that she was finally free to speak \"frankly\" of her nonbelief. Dr. Kiminori Itoh, a Japanese environmental physical chemist who contributed to a U.N. climate report, dubs man-made warming \"the worst scientific scandal in history.\" Norway's Ivar Giaever, Nobel Prize winner for physics, decries it as the \"new religion.\" A group of 54 noted physicists, led by Princeton's Will Happer, is demanding the American Physical Society revise its position that the science is settled. (Both Nature and Science magazines have refused to run the physicists' open letter.)\n \n The collapse of the \"consensus\" has been driven by reality. The inconvenient truth is that the earth's temperatures have flat-lined since 2001, despite growing concentrations of C02. Peer-reviewed research has debunked doomsday scenarios about the polar ice caps, hurricanes, malaria, extinctions, rising oceans. A global financial crisis has politicians taking a harder look at the science that would require them to hamstring their economies to rein in carbon.\n \n Credit for Australia's own era of renewed enlightenment goes to Dr. Ian Plimer, a well-known Australian geologist. Earlier this year he published \"Heaven and Earth,\" a damning critique of the \"evidence\" underpinning man-made global warming. The book is already in its fifth printing. So compelling is it that Paul Sheehan, a noted Australian columnist-and ardent global warming believer-in April humbly pronounced it \"an evidence-based attack on conformity and orthodoxy, including my own, and a reminder to respect informed dissent and beware of ideology subverting evidence.\" Australian polls have shown a sharp uptick in public skepticism; the press is back to questioning scientific dogma; blogs are having a field day.\n \n The rise in skepticism also came as Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, elected like Mr. Obama on promises to combat global warming, was attempting his own emissions-reduction scheme. His administration was forced to delay the implementation of the program until at least 2011, just to get the legislation through Australia's House. The Senate was not so easily swayed.\n \n Mr. Fielding, a crucial vote on the bill, was so alarmed by the renewed science debate that he made a fact-finding trip to the U.S., attending the Heartland Institute's annual conference for climate skeptics. He also visited with Joseph Aldy, Mr. Obama's special assistant on energy and the environment, where he challenged the Obama team to address his doubts. They apparently didn't.\n \n This week Mr. Fielding issued a statement: He would not be voting for the bill. He would not risk job losses on \"unconvincing green science.\" The bill is set to founder as the Australian parliament breaks for the winter.\n \n Republicans in the U.S. have, in recent years, turned ever more to the cost arguments against climate legislation. That's made sense in light of the economic crisis. If Speaker Nancy Pelosi fails to push through her bill, it will be because rural and Blue Dog Democrats fret about the economic ramifications. Yet if the rest of the world is any indication, now might be the time for U.S. politicians to re-engage on the science. One thing for sure: They won't be alone.",

   "I'm sorry, I didn't read every word of all of these responses, but I did not see anyone mention the possible motivation of the powers (\"scientists\" and other governments). If scientists are supposed to look at ALL factors in order to prove or disprove a hypothesis, doesn't it logically follow that if they DON'T, then there must be an agenda that they are pushing. I've heard of at least one study that indicated \"scientists\" refused to explore data on the sun...seems to me that makes their credibility as \"scientists\" somewhat questionable, wouldn't you agree? In addition, we're no longer living in the 1950's folks...am I wrong or are we not the cleanest country on the planet. We have all sorts of regulations and standards for car and factory emissions. Yet, I always hear that the U.S. is to blame, yet countries like Russia, China, India, Brazil, etc do not have the same high standards as the U.S. When those countries, and the people that blame the U.S. first, stop their attacks on us and concentrate on the REAL culprits (I don't believe there ARE any by the way), THEN maybe I would listen. These other countries and \"scientists\" would love nothing more than to see the standard of living in the U.S. plummet to developing nation status so that, yet again, everything is equal. Considering the fact that nature (such as volcanoes, spewing out more pollutants in one eruption than man has since the industrial revolution) plays a much bigger role than we EVER could, I just don't see how the global warming alarmists are given any credibility whatsoever. Even if man DID contribute, are you actually telling me that the .0000(whatever)% we might contribute is JUST enough to send this planet on the path to destruction?
