Republicans Happier than Democrats | LiveScience\n Republicans Happier than Democrats\n By Robert Roy Britt, LiveScience Managing Editor\n posted: 15 March 2006 06:53 pm ET\n \n Overall happiness among U.S. residents has not changed much over the years, according to the latest survey by the Pew Research Center that finds 34 percent of adults are very happy.\n \n Among 3,014 telephone respondents, half reported being pretty happy, and 15 percent said they are not too happy.\n \n The survey, released this week, points out several disparities based on lifestyle, beliefs and political persuasion:\n \n Republicans are happier than Democrats.\n People who worship frequently are happier than those who don't.\n The rich are happier than the poor.\n Whites and Hispanics are happier than blacks.\n Married people are happier than the unmarried.\n Dog owners and cat owners rate the same.\n Sunbelt residents are happier than everyone else.\n About 45 percent of Republicans said they were very happy, compared with 30 percent of Democrats. Republicans have been happier in surveys going back to 1972, the Pew study notes.\n \n The reason might seem obvious, since \"Republicans tend to have more money than Democrats, and-as we've already discovered-people who have more money tend to be happier,\" the report states.\n \n But even after adjusting for income, poor Republicans are happier than poor Democrats, and rich Republicans are happier than rich Democrats.\n \n What about religion?\n \n Forty-three percent of people who attend religious services weekly or more say they're very happy, compared to 26 percent of those who go seldom or never. The Pew analysis does not answer the question of how religion, Republicanism and happiness might be related, however.\n \n The full report is available here.\n \n What aggravates us about liberals on this forum and chester in particular is the irrational statements made which have no practical basis in fact at all, but which are stated so matter of factly as if written in stone. Two excellent examples of such ignorant drivel from chester are within the last 10 posts are where he has stated that righties are ANGRY ALL THE TIME, and that WHITE MEN ARE IN FEAR OF BECOMING MINORITIES. I could also quote him saying this historical fairy tale: Yet one more false dichotomy.\n What about tough eyeball-to-eyeball diplomacy of the sort that JFK used in the Cuban Missile Crisis \n \n That statement clearly implies that Kennedy and Kruschev sat across each other at a table and worked out the CMC face to face which is complete balderdash as usual from him. But it elevates his democratic hero so actual facts regarding the crisis never even entered his mind to consider. \n \n what is even more infuriating is that other liberals like you will never speak up to correct or oppose even the most blatant misinformation which one of these perceived philosophical allies defecates around here, yet at the same time that you like to think that you are objective and interested only in the truth. What has been shown though is that liberals care less about the truth than protecting allies against those you disagree with.",

It's because you are ignorant, petty, and prejudiced.\n\n \n Not at all tq, it's because those adjectives apply to you perfectly. It is your petty hatred and ignorance which causes you to be prejudiced against my spiritual perspective of life. You are a close minded anti christian bigot who hates those of us who dare defend our scriptural world view in opposition to your secular humanist world view which is no deeper than your personal moral center.\n \n \nAnd I should jump in to lambast anyone and everyone on every board who says something incorrect? Why didn't you correct Chester's error when he first made it? That was...2 weeks ago. Did it take you that long to realize that Chester's statement about an important event in your country's history was wrong? Or did you just finally figure it was worth nit picking?\n\n \n Uh, I responded to it when I noticed it? Never considered that one did you.\n \n \nBesides which, I took it to be a figure of speech-eyeball to eyeball, as in, they stared each other down. You, of course, will now write an insult laden response about how I'm twisting and turning to cover for my intellectual dishonesty. Since Chester wrote it, I'm sure he could tell us what he actually meant.\n\n \n Of course you took it to be a figure of speech. Because it wasn't worth correcting the blatant mistake of someone you agree with in most cases. Someone with a complete history of irrational and unsupported arguments which are never EVER backed up with evidence of any kind. \n \n And how interesting that you mention only the inaccurate Kennedy statement while ignoring where he has stated that righties are ANGRY ALL THE TIME, and that WHITE MEN ARE IN FEAR OF BECOMING MINORITIES. You never corrected them or the hundreds of other ridiculous statements he has made which are nothing more than reflections of his distorted view of reality in the real world. And why is that? I can only assume it's because you share those warped and disturbing views or else you would find a wealth of issues to debate and correct him over. \n \n \nP.S:Anyone else find this sentence from Archie especially funny:\"...the irrational statements made which have no practical basis in fact at all, but which are stated so matter of factly as if written in stone.\"\n\n \n And here once again we find tq attempting to gather a gang of allies to join him in attacking/mocking Archangel once again. I waited 4 1/2 hours before responding and look, no one has piped in to agree with you. I guess your sense of humor is as warped as the views you share. Also, what I do find humorous is that statement wasn't funny at all, but was said to accurately define what chester represents in most everything he writes here. Things which obvious make sense to you since you've never challenged him, which means your thinking is as twisted as his is. emoticon_xdonno",

   "Why am I NOT surprised that with every response you claim I have missed the point of your criticism just because I expand on your intent rather than just on what you say? \n\n Because you really don't get what the point is?\n \n \n \n \nIt doesn't really matter to me what you consider yourself to be.\n\n No, I've noticed that you and reality really don't play nice together.\n \n \nBy your arguments and positions on any and every issue you speak to, it is obvious you are an extreme leftist.\n\n Yeah, OK, you tell me what my views and beliefs are Archie. I'm sure you would know better than I do.\n \n \nThat you are blind to that reality just confirms how clueless you are to the reality of what you represent.\n\n I really need to learn the knack of putting someone down by describing your own faults. Archie makes it look so effortless.\n \n \nWith that said you defended and supported Obama and what the dems represent at every turn and even praise the socialism which has been adopted by Canada.\n\n Huh?\n \n \nDo you call what Obama is doing the promotion of small Government?\n\n No. Point out where I've touted Obama's supremacy. FFS Archie. I've been \"pro-Obama\" only in stating the world can't take another Bush.\n \n \nDo you call his policies which promote a nanny state not legislating morality by only rewarding people if they choose to buy into his government programs to receive the tax credits attached to them?\n\n Seriously, ### are you talking about?\n \n \nNot at all tq, it's because those adjectives apply to you perfectly. It is your petty hatred and ignorance which causes you to be prejudiced against my spiritual perspective of life.\n\n No, I'm pretty sure it's your ignorance, petty, and prejudiced. Oh, if only I had said that. Wait, I did. \n \n \nand You are a close minded anti christian bigot who hates those of us who dare defend our scriptural world view in opposition to your secular humanist world view which is no deeper than your personal moral center.\n\n See above.\n \n \n \n \nUh, I responded to it when I noticed it? Never considered that one did you.\n\n That would make two of us then. Never considered that, did you?\n \n \n \nOf course you took it to be a figure of speech.\n\n Of course. I could have gone your route and gotten angry and called Chester a liar, but I prefer to do that when I have evidence to support such an allegation. I took it to be a figure of speech. I know you're not familiar with them, but they do exist.\n \n \nBecause it wasn't worth correcting the blatant mistake of someone you agree with in most cases. Someone with a complete history of irrational and unsupported arguments which are never EVER backed up with evidence of any kind. \n\n OR, I considered it a figure of speech\n \n \nAnd how interesting that you mention only the inaccurate Kennedy statement\n\n That would be you actually.\n \n \nwhile ignoring where he has stated that righties are ANGRY ALL THE TIME, and that WHITE MEN ARE IN FEAR OF BECOMING MINORITIES. You never corrected them or the hundreds of other ridiculous statements he has made which are nothing more than reflections of his distorted view of reality in the real world. And why is that?\n\n Because, like you said, THEY ARE RIDICULOUS STATEMENTS. CT has written many valid, interesting posts, and usually holds himself to a higher standard. I was attempting to remind him of this fact. Then you, you little pissant, decided to come in and start another little bitchfest. \n \n \nI can only assume it's because you share those warped and disturbing views or else you would find a wealth of issues to debate and correct him over. \n\n You know what? ......I've ever had the displeasure to interact with.\n \n \n \nAnd here once again we find tq attempting to gather a gang of allies to join him in attacking/mocking Archangel once again.

   "Because, like you said, you simpering #####, THEY ARE RIDICULOUS STATEMENTS. CT has written many valid, interesting posts, and usually holds himself to a higher standard. I was attempting to remind him of this fact. Then you, you little pissant, decided to come in and start another little bitchfest.\n\n \n So you admit that ridiculous statements which chester makes aren't worth criticizing. But here's an opinion I offered in another thread which responded to an attack from subaru who has since been banned, and look at how you couldn't resist breaking in completely unprovoked in order to also attack me. http://www.4forums.com/political/religion-debates/12228-religion-joke.html#post340579\n \n \n You know what? You are absolutely and utterly pathetic. You have got to be the absolutely dumbest SOB I've ever had the displeasure to interact with.\n\n \n Speaking of pathetic, here's another example of your trolling ways. You don't contribute one thing to this thread until post 54 where you break in to specifically attack me with yet another insulting post. No wonder you like penfold and chester so much, you are 3 peas from the same pod. http://www.4forums.com/political/creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution/12202-global-conspiracy-scientists-2.html#post340210 So tell me tq, what does the level of contributions you offer to threads say about your intelligence? What I marvel at is that you think that being called dumb by an ##### will offend me. :pemoticon_xgoodemoticon_smile\n \n \n \nYou want to stop people from laughing at you, stop being a joke.\n\n \n Once again, it's you who either isn't smart enough to comprehend the exchange, or you purposely misinterpret it in order to deny what was said to you. Here it is again for emphasis.\n \n You said:\n \nP.S:Anyone else find this sentence from Archie especially funny:\"...the irrational statements made which have no practical basis in fact at all, but which are stated so matter of factly as if written in stone.\"\n\n \n Then I responded with this:\n \nAnd here once again we find tq attempting to gather a gang of allies to join him in attacking/mocking Archangel once again.

Things which obvious make sense to you since you've never challenged him, which means your thinking is as twisted as his is.\n\n \n If you were too slow to observe the point I made tq, after 4 1/2 hours, at the time of my response, nobody joined you in laughing at me. At this point it's been 7 hours since your call to arms and still you stand alone in your weird sense of humor. Just check out our respective profiles tq, if you want to see which of us is taken seriously around here, and which of us is a joke. Go figure huh? emoticon_xbye",
