Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen &#8211; I&#8217;m with ya&#8217;.\n \n What exactly has lead us to believe that there is gold in the moon&#8217;s core? Did we get a book that states this, or did we conclude this from some process?\n When we first began to have faith in this claim, did we try it, test it, make sure it&#8217;s not some scam? Can we, at times, get a &#8220;taste&#8221; of this treasure after we have gone through a moon-gaze? Or does the moon itself shed some sort of eerie light on those that stand in a certain place at its highest, fullness? What gives us this faith, and what is given for having this faith to keep us riveted to that goal?\n \n \n(this is satire by the way)\n\n And a good one at that. I can hear the wheels a-spinnin&#8217; :)",

Cats held Egypt ransom demanding attention and benefits in return from being spared from their bad luck. \n \n All we have to lose is a some effort and a bit of genetic diversity.\n \n The only reason you would disagree is that you've not really looked into the issue or are a complete Bastite wanting bad luck to happen to people - cancer is unlucky, you're going to wishing cancer on someone",

I've watched it and it makes more sense now. Cats were the ones who forced us to live on an Earth with war and disease and such. Kill the cats!!!",
