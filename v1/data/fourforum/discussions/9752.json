   "Greetings, fellow NYTimes exiles, and welcome to 4Forums!\n \n I'm sure you've already noticed many differences between these forums and the Times ones, but you may not have noticed some of the less obvious.\n - The \"ignore\" list (like the Times one, but infinitely expandable) is accessible by clicking on the User CP link on the dark blue bar beneath the thread title. \n \n - In the upper right corner of the screen (beneath the Welcome notice) is a link for sending private messages between members, something we didn't have at NYT. \n \n - Clicking on a member's name takes you to a page with handy data like when a person joined, how many times they've posted, and their rate of posting. \n \n - And the tools in the bar above your message window allow you to easily boldface, italicize, indent and put cited references in quote boxes... \nlike this\n...which I encourage you to make use of. (I'm looking at you, Sam!)\n \n - There's also a button at the right end of every message bar for reporting offensive posts to the moderators--who respond much more quickly than the NY Times ones did. (Read the Forum FAQ for infom on what's considered out of bounds.)\n There are many more, but I'll let you discover these for yourselves by exploring and asking questions. Anyway, welcome again, and good posting!\n \n MrWriteLA (aka m_d_sutton)",
