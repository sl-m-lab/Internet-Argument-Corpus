   "I take a pro-war stance when it comes to Iraq, N. Korea, and other state sponsors of terrorism. We must disrupt the command and control aspects of our enemy's ability to wage war on us. Since al Qaeda is a conglomeration of autonomous cells, with their objectives given prior to sleeper implantation, this could be a more daunting task than first imagined. Destroying the enemy propaganda machine is as necessary as the creation of our own efficient propaganda outlets. By propaganda, I do not mean lies and deception. It is easy to see how the naked truth about the nature of our enemy will accomplish the task of rallying our people to support the destruction of those who wish to slit our throats. Play the Danny Pearl tape. Expose the Arab world's treatment of women. List the atrocities that their governments our committing. Play feeds that get to the heart of the anti-American, anti-Jewish sentiments prevalent in the Arab world. Anything which is not sympathetic to our enemies, and allows the American population to support the wholesale killing of the virus that seeks to destroy Western culture, should definitely be played up by our many media outlets. If the news agencies truly value the right of a free press, they will be more than happy to oblige the government's request.",

   "You seemed to have missed the content and message of my thread. Let's put it in perspective for you. By propaganda, I mean reporting the truth. I mean less censorship, more stories that expose the vile culture that America finds itself diametrically opposed to. I am calling for less fluff pieces, and more on the ground reporting of movements like Hamas, the PLO, and the Saudi regime. How does this equate to censorship?\n \n Unfortunately, our newsrooms are packed with left-wingers that wish to aid the enemy. If the liberal arts colleges actually taught people a useful method of thinking, instead of indoctrinating them with rabid anti-Americanism, then the things I suggest would help us win this propaganda war would already be in practice. No, I want more responsibility on the part of the media. We could use fewer stories about CAFE standards and Columbine, and more stories designed to educate the people about the threat we face.\n \n The press's ignoring of important world events and their liberal agenda is partly responsible for the pants down attack we received on 9-11. I have been concerned about NBC weapons since the fall of the Soviet Union, yet they ignored the issue. Where are we today because of the \"self-censoring\" they engaged in during the 1990's? We find the prospect of a bio-terror event to be a grim reality that we will most likely face in the near future. Now, tell me again how I am wrong.",
