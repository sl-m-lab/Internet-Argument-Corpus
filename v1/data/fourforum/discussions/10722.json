   "There are apparently many frozen embryos left over from fertility clinics. The question for this thread is - what is the best thing to do with those embryos?\n \n Of course, the couple themselves can use more embryos for having more children. A few other options that come to mind include:\n 1) Keep them frozen for perpetuity.\n 2) Allow them to be used for stem cell research.\n 3) Allow other infertile couples to \"adopt\" them.\n \n In my own opinion, all of those options are acceptable - though the third one might pose some legal difficulties of who \"owns\" the embryos (ex. the biological parents of the embryo might need to give permission). \n \n Some might argue that generating frozen embryos is itself immoral and should not be used for fertility treatment.\n \n Of course, this discussion ties in with the abortion debate since it deals with the moral issue of treatment of very early human life.\n \n What are your views on the subject?",

   "I think most of us on the pro-choice side do agree that, among other things, using frozen embryos for stem cell research is justified for the potential medical benefits and lives saved.\n \n However, we have not yet heard from pro-life proponents and part of the reason I set up this thread was to get their take. The pro-life side appears to have mixed feelings about using embryos for stem cell research, where some pro-life proponents do support it. Either way, a question that has never been answered by pro-life proponents in general is what to do with the excess frozen embryos that will not be used for fertility (or stem cell research). Do you suggest keeping them frozen indefinitely? Do you think that they never should have been produced to begin with (which would severely limit the options available for infertile couples)? What is your view?",
