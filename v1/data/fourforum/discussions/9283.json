This is where the false christians show their bigotry: they condemn homosexuality and try to get gay marriage banned in states and even propose constitutional amendments against it, and then when they speak against divorce (not too often from what I've seen), they don't follow through with actions like they do with gay marriage. This is becasue they are bigots, and hypocrites - gay marriage is easy to go against for them becasue of their irrational fear of homosexuals, where divorce, however, would be going against a large amount of people in their own \"church\" that are divorced and if they do that they'll lose their moneymaking capabilities when those people leave the congregation.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nBecause it attempts to redefine marriage as an institution; I'd rather find other ways to give people of other relationship types the benefits they need rather than using what has traditionally been an opposite-sex institution to do it.\n \n\n \n Ah, really? It has been? Funny, back when it was a pagan ritual (before some christians in the past stole or at least borrowed the ceremony) men could marry men and women could marry women along with man and woman marrying. Later on, it wasn't a marriage between man and women, but between man and property - it was basically a way of obtaining more wealth and property. Then it was between a white man and white woman, not a white person and a black person. So if you go by the traditional way, gay marriage is normal and should be allowed. If you don't, well, I certanly see that it had been redefined several times throughout history, so there is no reason not to redefine it now for loving gay couples instead of being stuck in bigotry, hatred, fear, and misunderstanding like much of the US is (which is because of the so-called \"christians\" who twist God's word).",

Later on, it wasn't a marriage between man and women, but between man and property - it was basically a way of obtaining more wealth and property. Then it was between a white man and white woman, not a white person and a black person. So if you go by the traditional way, gay marriage is normal and should be allowed. If you don't, well, I certanly see that it had been redefined several times throughout history, so there is no reason not to redefine it now for loving gay couples instead of being stuck in bigotry, hatred, fear, and misunderstanding like much of the US is (which is because of the so-called \"christians\" who twist God's word).\n\n \n Well, sure, I'm not saying that no aspects of marriage have ever changed since the beginning of time. I think the issue all depends on how you define marriage in a root way. To me and to many people, marriage, by it's very nature is between members of the opposite-sex. Obviously you disagree and that's fine. You're certainly entitled to that opinion.",

Can't do it, can you.\n The historical definition of \"sex\" refers ONLY to heterosexual vaginal copulation. Even heterosexual mouth to genitalia would not be referred to as \"sex\" or \"intercourse\" heterosexually.\n It is a modern reinterpretation of \"sex\"/\"intercourse\" which establishes homosexual 'behavior' as \"sex\".

(Previous verses establish that God was not going to destroy the cities if there were \"10 or more\" righteous people. And if the \"righteous / unrighteous\" issue was judged purely by homosexuality, that leaves us with 9 or fewer straights.)\n We know of SIX straight people explicitly listed, so that means that we are down to THREE OR FEWER straight people in the TWO cities. (Already counting Lot's family) Of these six are Lot's two \"sons in law\", and one wonders if Lot's two daughters found the only two straight men in the city???\n It makes ABSOLUTELY NO sense for two cities to exist, at that period in time, with ONLY three or fewer straight people in the entire city.\n The very thought of a city that existed with 99.9...% gay people (with only Lot's family and a couple other possibilities) is insane.",

I just want to hear ONE person try to explain HOW it is supposedly going to \"destroy\" straight marriage.\n \n JPSartre's response is typical of one who would like to assume without any basis for the assumption. Hiding behind doubt that this claim COULD be right, instead of attempting to actually prove why the claim should be held in the first place. \n\n \n Does anyone have an answer to explain the destruction to civilization that this menace would cause?",
