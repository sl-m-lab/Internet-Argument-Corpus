I can't prove it, but after I got carpet the kids began to get the worst of all earaches.\n \n Another thing that helps is breast feeding. It seems that your natural nourishment helps to lessen the painful effects.\n \n I can't count all the nights that Baby Tylenol and me holding a warm, damp rag of salt over the bad ear(s) finally put the poor souls to sleep.
