   "I was lurking to see what the American reaction to the Scottish Cardinal's remarks were. So far nothing...emoticon_ic\n I'll post the Cardinal's statement below, see what happens.\n \n \n \n \nScotland on Sunday\n We must seek justice rather than vengeance\n By Cardinal Keith O' Brien\n \n LIKE many others, I have been following with interest the recent attempts by the Foreign Relations Committee of the United States Senate to summon Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, justice secretary Kenny MacAskill and the former UK home secretary Jack Straw to a hearing in Washington.\n This was followed by the news that the Senate committee was ready to send some of its members to the UK to question British witnesses on the release by the Scottish Government earlier this year of the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi, on compassionate grounds.\n \n The First Minister is reported as having said that there was \"no way on earth\" that Scottish ministers would formally give evidence to a committee hearing of a foreign legislature, even if it were to be held in the UK, adding pointedly that it was impossible to imagine US lawmakers agreeing to such an interrogation on foreign soil. I too believe that Scottish ministers are accountable to the Scottish Parliament and ultimately the Scottish people alone.\n \n At the core of this dispute, there seems to be what might be termed a \"clash of cultures\". In Scotland over many years we have cultivated through our justice system what I hope can be described as a \"culture of compassion\". On the other hand, there still exists in many parts of the US, if not nationally, an attitude towards the concept of justice which can only be described as a \"culture of vengeance\".\n \n The murder of 270 innocent people on board Pan Am flight 103 and in the town of Lockerbie on 21 December 1988 was an act of unbelievable horror and gratuitous barbarity. It is completely natural and understandable that many of those most directly affected, the bereaved and their families would want justice even vengeance. It is in the midst of such inhuman barbarism, however, that we must act to affirm our own humanity. It is in these moments of grief and despair that we must show the world that the standards of the murderer and his disdain for human life are not our standards. They may plunge to the depths of human conduct but we will not follow them.\n \n For Christians, the teaching of St Paul in his letter to the Romans is clear: \"Vengeance is mine says the Lord\", revenge is not a path we should take. A statement from the Criminal, Justice and Parole Division of the Scottish Government earlier this year stating that \"the perpetration of an atrocity should not be a reason for losing sight of the values people in Scotland seek to uphold and the faith and beliefs by which we seek to live the values of humanity and compassion\" I hope is a reflection of a view that would be held and endorsed by people of many faiths and none.\n \n Since 1976, 1,221 people have been executed in the US. Its execution rate is only outdone by Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran and China.\n These are not countries known for placing human rights on a pedestal. It is certainly invidious company for the world's leading democracy to find itself in.\n \n The steady rate at which judicial killing is used in the United States would suggest that the deterrent effect often proposed as a justification for such a policy is not working. On 13 May, 2010, Michael Beuke, convicted of aggravated murder of one man and guilty of the attempted slayings of two others in 1983, lost his appeals before the US Supreme Court and was executed by lethal injection.\n \n He had been on death row for more than 26 years and was the 38th person put to death in Ohio since that state resumed the practice of the death sentence in 1999. Ohio has only one execution per month to give the \"execution team\" (Ohio's term) an opportunity to \"recuperate\" between executions. The fact that a virtual conveyor belt of killing operates among them does not seem to have persuaded Ohio's legislators that their approach to justice is demonstrably and completely ineffective. \n \n On 18 June 2010, Ronnie Lee Gardner was hooded, strapped to a chair and shot by a firing squad at a prison in Utah. He had been condemned to death for murder in 1985. He spent 25 years in solitary confinement, and ultimately was given an option as to how he preferred to die: by firing squad or by lethal injection.\n \n While his actions were inexcusable, his death did not bring back the life of his victim. His death will not prevent other violent murders. His death simply brought to an end a life of utter misery and darkness. \n \n His story is symptomatic of so many who sit incarcerated within the US justice system waiting to die. Ronnie Lee Gardner was first picked up by the authorities at the age of two, abandoned, wandering the streets in a nappy. He was sniffing glue by the time he was six, taking heroin at ten and sent to a mental home at 11 where he was sexually abused as a teenager. His descent into violence was as predictable as it was piteous.\n \n Perhaps the consciences of some Americans, especially members of the US Senate, should be stirred by the ways in which \"justice\" is administered in so many of their own states. Perhaps it is time for them to \"cast out the beam from their own eye before seeking the mote in their brothers\". Perhaps they should direct their gaze inwards, rather than scrutinising the workings of the Scottish justice system.\n \n Scotland's legal system allowed the Scottish justice secretary to release Megrahi on compassionate grounds, following due process and based on clear medical advice. It was a decision for Scottish ministers and no others to make. Scotland's justice system has embedded, alongside punishment, the idea of reform.\n It is one reason why the finality of the death penalty has rightly been rejected.\n \n I believe that only God can forgive and show ultimate compassion to those who commit terrible crimes and I would rather live in a country where justice is tempered by mercy than exist in one where vengeance and retribution are the norm.\n\n Scotland on Sunday",

Internally they incarcerate huge numbers of people (mainly poor Whites, Blacks and Latinos).\n \n The government wastes huge amounts of money (borrowed) on prosecuting its foreign policies (huge amounts of aid money to corrupt governments such as Pakistan and Afghanistan) and prosecuting wars.\n \n The country is in state of decay, with high endemic unemployment a crumbling infrastructure and diminishing tax revenues due to tax cuts to the rich (see below)\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/09/opinion/09krugman.html?_r=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss\n\n \n What I find difficult to imagine is how you get a people (a majority it would appear) who are being abused & victimized by a system to religiously support the same system?

It needed also a sort of athleticism of mind, an ability at one moment to make the most delicate use of logic & at the next to be unconscious of the crudest logical errors.

The US as long as it has capital punishment will always have that issue when brought up by countries that don&#8217;t. In that area fine you win, we kill people who kill people, let&#8217;s look at the rest of how crime is dealt with.\n \n Looking at this man who we should show mercy and compassion towards the question for me is how much? The passengers on that plane will never have the opportunity to suffer from cancer, nor will they have a chance to beat the odds and live longer than expected. They will not have the opportunity to live past the day he decided. They will not die in familiar surroundings with people who care around them. They will not have a chance to set their affairs in order or say good-bye. Instead they will die in terror, unexpectedly, their last words drowned out by explosions or spoken to the stranger next to them. \n \n Was he not given more mercy than he gave? He is alive 22 years longer than anyone on that plane. He gets to go home, nobody on the plane was granted that same mercy. Was he not shown more compassion than he showed? He was given a fair trial, the passengers were not. They were condemned to death, chosen to pay for acts they had no involvement with. \n \n He was not put in prison for some petty act; he blew up a plane while in the air full of people. I believe we showed the world we would not sink to their depths of human conduct. He is alive, was clothed, fed permitted books, visitors, medical care, social interaction and movies while the families of his victims visited the graves of their loved ones. \n \n In my eyes the Cardinal has taken this opportunity to say &#8220;We are the religion of peace and mercy, not you.&#8221; I would ask the Cardinal what then do we do with those who choose to extinguish life? Those who spend lengthy periods on Death Row is not to make them suffer, but to give them opportunities they were not willing to give their victims. We are not Scots, our cultures are different, our values are different and our reactions to issues of this nature are different. We may not like or agree with how things turned out, but it is not within our right to do anything but complain about it. \n \n Mercy and compassion can go one way for only so long.

This queasy quasi civic religion is based on the imaginary concepts of a Free? Market. Lookit what Mr. Gramm of the infamous Gramm-Leach-Biley Act says about Wall Street. Wall Street is a &#8216;holy place&#8217;?\n \n \nThe Reckoning \n Deregulator Looks Back, Unswayed \n \n At the Altar of Wall Street\n Mr. Gramm would sometimes speak with reverence about the nation&#8217;s financial markets, the trading and deal making that churn out wealth.\n \n &#8220;When I am on Wall Street and I realize that that&#8217;s the very nerve center of American capitalism and I realize what capitalism has done for the working people of America, to me that&#8217;s a holy place,&#8221; he said at an April 2000 Senate hearing after a visit to New York.\n \n That viewpoint &#8212; and concerns that Wall Street&#8217;s dominance was threatened by global competition and outdated regulations &#8212; shaped his agenda. \n \n In late 1999, Mr. Gramm played a central role in what would be the most significant financial services legislation since the Depression. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as the measure was called, removed barriers between commercial and investment banks that had been instituted to reduce the risk of economic catastrophes. Long sought by the industry, the law would let commercial banks, securities firms and insurers become financial supermarkets offering an array of services.\n \n The measure, which Mr. Gramm helped write and move through the Senate, also split up oversight of conglomerates among government agencies. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, would oversee the brokerage arm of a company. Bank regulators would supervise its banking operation. State insurance commissioners would examine the insurance business. But no single agency would have authority over the entire company. \n \n &#8220;There was no attention given to how these regulators would interact with one another,&#8221; said Professor Cox of Duke. &#8220;Nobody was looking at the holes of the regulatory structure.&#8221;\n http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/17/business/economy/17gramm.html?pagewanted=all\n\n \n Why does Mr. Gramm remain unswayed? Why do the American people continue to follow sheeplike thereby becoming one of the HERD?\n \n Perhaps it's because no amount of logic, reason, or whatever can budge a faith consciously or unconsciously based on a fallacy.\n \n Sorry to branch off here but it should be noted there seems to be at least two serious mistakes in thinking. The naturalistic fallacy, (George Edward Moore coined the phrase however earlier identified by David Hume), is the leap from is to ought - that is, the tendency to believe that what is natural is good; that what is, ought to be. \n \n The other is the moralistic fallacy, (Bernard Davis coined this phrase) & is the opposite of the naturalistic fallacy. It refers to the leap from ought to is, the claim that the way things should be is the way they are. This is the tendency to believe that what is good is natural; that what ought to be, is. Sometimes called the reverse naturalistic fallacy.\n \n Political conservatives tend to favor the naturalistic fallacy while political liberals tend to favor the moralistic fallacy.\n \n Unfortunately, neither speaks about what simply IS. This makes it difficult to get to the point where you can even identify the problems much less get to the solutions.\n \n \nIdentify the problem. &#8212; &#8220;What&#8217;s the real question we&#8217;re facing here?&#8221;\n Define the context. &#8212; &#8220;What are the facts and circumstances that frame this problem?&#8221;\n Enumerate choices. &#8212; &#8220;What are our most plausible three or four options?&#8221;\n Analyze options. &#8212; &#8220;What is our best course of action, all things considered?&#8221;\n List reasons explicitly. &#8212; &#8220;Let&#8217;s be clear: Why we are making this particular choice?&#8221;\n Self-correct. &#8212; &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s look at it again. What did we miss?&#8221;\n\n \n What kind of 'exercise in crimestop' is necessary to have someone in the present day coming to the conclusion that this queasy quasi civic religion is serving the American people? Or, for that matter, any people?\n \n What ever happened to a 'Government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth'?\n \n Has it perished?

I do acknowledge your pride in this distinction Let's hear it for Australia Day Jan 26 the Anniversary of the first convicts arriving to Sydney. I will also give you credit for Men at Work and Quigly down Under, although you had nothing to do with that one.\n \n So we can trade barbs back and forth or you can respond to my question or go stare at your rock and throw sticks at Dingo's",

   "I can say the US has been on the wrong side a few times, but we also are significantly better at fixing what we screw up than Britain. Colonialism by Europeans is still present. When is the last time one of our provinces tried to leave and instigated a war? How long ago was it that we granted independence to a colony or far that matter how many colonies ave we had? 50 years ago Britain still hadn't granted independence to a number of countries.\n\n Phillipines was the last colony that the US granted independence to wasn't it? \n You're still occupying territory on Cuba, I think it's called Guantanamo Bay.\n You're occupying Islands in the British Indian Ocean Territory.\n The movement for independence for Hawaii is ignored by you as are the occupied lands of the Native tribes of America.",

We were granting it commonwealth before WW2, but then the Japanese invaded so didn't happen until after. \n \n Cuba - We signed a lease as part of a deal that recognized the first President of Cuba. It is internationally legal\n \n Which Islands are you referring to, not that it matters as niether instance is much of a case for anything more than a grasp\n \n Hawaii and Indians - Bad move by the white man in both cases. How far back should we go to give conquered peoples back their land. Technically Africa should own the world since we started there and spread out. We made Hawaii a state we can argue if it was worth it for them but far better than cut an run looking at how well that worked for Africa. The indians paid a heavy price but at least the present generation is being compensated very well, again not perfect but better restitution than almost every other colony including the US.",

This is closer to eminant domain. The Brits owned, rounded up the people, shipped them off, only sort of paid them and then got the crown to interfere with appeals. We just moved in once all 2000 were shipped to the neighboring island. So like I said big picture this isn't very much",
