   "There's been a lot of talk lately about mutations being non-random and natural selection being random. I think the easiest way to decide this debate is to look at the evidence. So far, I've seen no evidence that supports directed mutations. But what about evidence that supports Neo-Darwinism?\n Of course there's plenty, but those who reject evolution refuse to look at it.\n Random mutations and natural selection is accepted because it has been completely supported for at least the last 60 years. Experiments have been conducted that support this conclusion. From here:\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luria-Delbruck_experiment\n \n \nLuria-Delbruck experiment (1943) (also called the Fluctuation Test) demonstrates that in bacteria, genetic mutations arise in the absence of selection, rather than being a response to selection. Therefore, Darwin's theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to higher organisms. These experiments also introduced the microbiological method of replica plating. Max Delbruck and Salvador Luria won the 1969 Nobel Prize in part for this work.\n In their experiment, Luria and Delbruck inoculated a small number of bacteria into separate culture tubes. After a period of growth, they plated equal volumes of these separate cultures onto phage (virus) containing agar. If virus resistance in bacteria were caused by a spontaneous activation in bacteria, then each plate should contain the same number of resistant colonies. This, however was not what Delbruck and Luria found. Instead, the number of resistant colonies on each plate varied drastically.\n Luria and Delbruck proposed that these results could be explained by the occurrence of a constant rate of random mutations in each generation of bacteria growing in the initial culture tubes. Delbruck developed a sophisticated mathematical model based on this hypothesis that was entirely consistent with these results. The conclusion was that mutations in bacteria, like higher organisms, are random rather than directed.\n\n \n And from here: http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIIC1aRandom.shtml\n \n \nIn addition, experiments have made it clear that many mutations are in fact \"random,\" and did not occur because the organism was placed in a situation where the mutation would be useful. For example, if you expose bacteria to an antibiotic, you will likely observe an increased prevalence of antibiotic resistance. In 1952, Esther and Joshua Lederberg determined that many of these mutations for antibiotic resistance existed in the population even before the population was exposed to the antibiotic - and that exposure to the antibiotic did not cause those new resistant mutants to appear1.\n\n \n This is textbook evolution. The mutations appear randomly in the population BEFORE the environment changes and only those organisms with that random mutation are selected for to survive. \n For those making the claim that mutations are not random and slection is, I'd like to see the evidence that falsifies the experiments I mentioned (which have been repeated literally thousands of times in the last 60 years). And I'd like to see the experiments that support the idea that all mutations are directed.....",

You won't get falsification of these experiments because creationists don't engage in science, much less experiments.\n \n I've noticed something here. No creationists has the intelligence or courage (or maybe they do?) to stay and argue. This tactic is called \"shotgunning,\" throwing up a wall of arguments hoping one hits.
