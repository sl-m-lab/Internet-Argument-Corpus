   "Had there been some more guns in the Brian Nichols court room, perhaps he'd have not made his escape...and we wouldn't have paid millions to defend him against charges of multiple murders that he was quite evidently guilty of committing.\n \n I like this story. The perp is D_E_A_D__ R_I_G_H_T__ T_H_E_R_E...DRT! The judge was slightly wounded.\n \n Defendant Is Killed After Attacking Judge - CBS News\n \n (CBS/AP) A man accused of killing his girlfriend was shot to death in a Stockton courtroom Wednesday after he attacked the judge presiding over his murder trial, officials said. \n \n David Paradiso, 28, was shot by a police detective after he left the witness stand and began attacking San Joaquin County Superior Court Judge Cinda Fox during a break in proceedings, said Dave Konecny, a spokesman for the sheriff's department. \n \n Paradiso had been testifying around 2 p.m. when his mother, in the audience, left the courtroom upset. Fox called a recess, and as jurors filed out, Paradiso left the stand and approached the judge from behind \"with an unknown cutting instrument,\" Konecny said. \n \n Lodi police detective Eric Bradley, an eight-year veteran and the lead investigator on Paradiso's case, drew his weapon and killed Paradiso, reports CBS13 in Sacramento. He has been placed on administrative leave while the shooting is being investigated, said city spokesman Jeff Hood. \n \n Karen McConnell, a county spokeswoman, said witnesses reported seeing Paradiso lift the judge and begin punching and possibly stabbing her when bailiffs ran to her aid and shots rang out. \n \n Fox, who had a bandage on her left arm as she was carried out of the courthouse on a stretcher, told reporters, \"I'm OK,\" before being taken to a hospital. Calls to her home were not immediately returned. \n \n San Joaquin County officials say she is recovering from non-life threatening wounds, CBS13 reports \n \n The courthouse immediately went on lockdown, although people were allowed to leave after the building was secured, McConnell said. \n \n Konecny said he did not know how Paradiso obtained a weapon. He said at least two bailiffs were on duty in the courtroom at the time of the attack. \n \n Paradiso's mother, Debra, was enraged as she walked out of the courthouse after the incident and told CBS13 that she warned authorities that David was prepared for violence.",

That or put judges on higher pedestals.\nI know judges that carry guns under their robes.\n \n The ACLU has attacked the use of restraints and jail colors in the court room because it appears to prejudge the defendant. I have no problem with it.\n \n I have seen courtrooms where the defendant was confined in a glass box and had no physical access to the court room. It is as much for his protection as anyone else's.\n \n I have seen others where the judge sat in a similar protective box.\n \n These types of constructions are usually peculiar to the higher criminal courts and not common in municipal court rooms.\n \n Brian Nichols obtained the gun outside of the court room from a small woman (I think a grandmother) that either should have had some back-up or should not have had a gun on her while escorting him. It was a procedural error that allowed him to kill several people.",
