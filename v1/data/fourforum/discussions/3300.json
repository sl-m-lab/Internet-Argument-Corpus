   "So, seeing how this is a debate forum, what's our take on the upcoming debates? \n \n From what I understand, they won't even be debates.\n \n The debates for about a decade were run by the league of women voters (NPR Tavis today), who ran the debates in a NON-PARTISAN way..i.e. for the people, by the people, they were real debates. It's different now though.\n \n The bi-partisan powers that be...republicanss and democracts, finally had enough and snatched the debates away, and now we have what we will witness in the coming weeks:\n \n 1. No actual debate between the two candidates. emoticon_xgood \n 2. Notice I said two candidates...they make it nigh impossible for us to hear great ideas from third party..i.e. generally not corrupted candidates.\n 3. Their \"extended discussion\" is 30 seconds on a topic. I can't even type this post in 30s!! \n 4. No rebuting the other candidate's answers\n 5. All questions provided to them before-hand, in detail, basically to be read on camera...i.e. this will just be a big news conference, not a debate.\n 6. While we, the people, have no control over how these debates proceed,..corporate lobbyists (Think beer companies, phillip morris, gambling lobby, etc.) hold the chairs on this committe.\n \n What's not to love? Nadar had it right, either way we lose, it's all rigged by the lobbyists.\n \n -Mach",

Again this goes against everything the man has ever voted in his life.If I were in the military,I'd be scared to death of Kerry getting elected.\n \n Let's get past the smoth talk and presentation and get to the issues. How can Kerry have a shread of repour with any of our current allies after the numerous bashings he has directed at them during his campaign? How is he going to walk into Russia and collect all them nukes in 4 years? \n \n Bush was a deer in the head lights and lost a big chance to kick Kerry while he was down.

   "What a slaughter!\n \n Kerry: Fact, fact, intelligent response.\n \n Bush: Stay the course, er, long pause, er, mixed message, long pause, ...\n\n \n First of all, nobody slaughtered anybody. Bush did well during the first half of the debate, Kerry did well in the second half of the debate. If you don't believe me, look at the new Gallup Poll. 12% of undecided voters who saw the debate said they will vote for Bush, and 10% said they would vote for Kerry. And somebody said that Bush talked on a 5th grade level, but somehow came out with more probable votes. Why is this? Because people want to know what someone stands for and what he is going to do. They don't care if he is the best speaker; they want someone with conviction who will stand for what he believes in.\n \n \n Now for Kerry's absurd comments:\n \n \"And I will hunt down and kill the terrorists, wherever they are.\"\n Yet, he states that he is against the death penalty for terrorists.\n \n \n \"That's why they had to close down the subway in New York when the Republican Convention was there.\"\n I actually went to the RNC and rode the subway from my friend's apartment to Madison Square Garden.\n \n \n \"The president -- 95 percent of the containers that come into the ports, right here in Florida, are not inspected.\"\n Yes they are. Electronic scanning devices scan every container, and the suspect containers are then searched by the authorities. Kind of a \"misleading\" statistic if you ask me.\n \n \n \"This president thought it was more important to give the wealthiest people in America a tax cut rather than invest in homeland security.\"\n Everyone got a tax cut. The rich actually get a smaller percentage tax cut than the middle-class and lower-class, even though they paid more taxes.\n \n \n \"Secondly, when we went in, there were three countries: Great Britain, Australia and the United States. That's not a grand coalition. We can do better.\"\n How could he forget about Poland? What kind of Presidential candidate can't even remember the 3 allies we had going into the war? Talk about isolating nations, that'll do it.\n \n \n \"But what he has said is that, even knowing there were no weapons of mass destruction, even knowing there was no imminent threat, even knowing there was no connection with Al Qaeda, he would still have done everything the same way. Those are his words. Now, I would not.\"\n \"I've had one position, one consistent position, that Saddam Hussein was a threat....I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq, and my position has been consistent: Saddam Hussein is a threat. He needed to be disarmed.\"\n A few sentences after this first statement where Kerry agrees that Iraq and Saddam were not an \"imminent threat\", he says that \"Saddam Hussein was a threat\", and that he has only had 1 position. HE HAD 2 POSITIONS IN 10 SECONDS!!!\n \n \n \"But you can't tell me that when the most troops any other country has on the ground is Great Britain, with 8,300, and below that the four others are below 4,000, and below that, there isn't anybody out of the hundreds, that we have a genuine coalition to get this job done.\"\n Then Kerry said he has all the respect for our allies and he hasn't denegrated them. Well criticizing them for not sending more troops is pretty much denegrating them if you ask me, and then telling the PM of Iraq he is a liar and a puppet.\n \n \n \"But if and when you do it, Jim, you have to do it in a way that passes the test, that passes the global test where your countrymen, your people understand fully why you're doing what you're doing and you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons.\"\n Global test? Looks like Kerry is outsourcing our national security, which earlier in the debate he had a problem with outsourcing? How can you put a global test before our national security?\n \n \n \"And I was probably one of the first senators, along with Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a former senator, go down into the KGB underneath Treblinka Square and see reams of files with names in them.\"\n Treblinka was one of the concentration camps in Germany during WWII!! He meant to say Lubyanka. How can he mess that up? I mean if he apparently went there, don't you think it would be \"seared in his mind\" like Cambodia was?",

   "I think too many of the posters on this thread are trying to spin the debate instead of being objective. Here is what I think of last night.\n \n Kerry and Bush both did very well. Kerry scored more style points while Bush scored more substance. Bush needed this to be a knockout blow to assure victory, Kerry needed a knockout blow to ensure a comeback. Neither camp delivered a knockout blow. Neither really screwed up but neither on really did exceptional either. Kerry probably came out the best from this debate because he proved his is still hanging in there. \n \n Spinster's on both sides will represent this debate as a victory on camera but sometimes the most interesting things on the campaign occur away from the reporters. Last night after the debate, Kerry advisor Joe Lockhart was caught on a C-SPAN mike saying (paraphrasing) \"Well, it looks as if this debate was a draw.\" Shortly before this he had said on camera that his candidate soundly defeated Bush. It's funny how even the idealogues can listen to reason every now and then.\n \n Overall, I think this will have little impact on polls. Kerry will shore up his base but I think most voters views will remained relatively unchanged. We'll have to see in the next week but I guess we will probably see a slight narrowing in the polls but no major change in the momentum in either direction.",

Nearly everyone agreed that Bush won the first half, and Kerry won the second half.

Still says that he's \"been to war.\" Huh?\n VP Cheney - several deferments (1, 2), the last by marriage (in his own words, \"had other priorities than military service\") (1)\n \n \n Former President Bill Clinton - avoided the draft through student deferments; in the autumn of 1969, Clinton entered the draft but received a high number (311) and was never called to serve. (CNN article.) \"...it was his doubts about the morality of the war and the Selective Service system that led him to abandon the ROTC idea and to subject himself to a draft lottery.

   "Everyone, including Kerry missed a golden blunder on Bush's part.\n Maybe I heard him wrong but he said that we achieved control of Baghdad and Iraq so quickly that there were so many Baathists and Saddam loyalists around that after they laid down their arms they blended into the population and we are fighting them now.\n \n Basically he said that we had the enemy and let them go so they could regroup and fight us another day.\n \n I think Kerry just said almost under his breath, 'see there's an example of a miscalculation there.'

   "You mean the one with Bill O'Reilly? Wow, talk about a tough interview for Bush! How could he possibly look good on O'Reilly? I mean that O'Reilly really goes after the tough questions when it comes to Bush!\n\n \n Yea, that's the same interview that John Kerry refused to do.

Nor could any of us have performed well in the debate. And unless you can, Mach, you are in no position to attack someone like that. Bush may not be the smartest person in the world, but he is highly underestimated. \n \n \nRumsfeld served (1954-7).\n GW Bush - decided that a six-year Nat'l Guard commitment really means four years. Still says that he's \"been to war.\" Huh?\n VP Cheney - several deferments (1, 2), the last by marriage (in his own words, \"had other priorities than military service\") (1)\n \n \n Former President Bill Clinton - avoided the draft through student deferments; in the autumn of 1969, Clinton entered the draft but received a high number (311) and was never called to serve. (CNN article.) \"...it was his doubts about the morality of the war and the Selective Service system that led him to abandon the ROTC idea and to subject himself to a draft lottery. Only the luck of the draw - a high lottery number - kept him out. \" (Jeff Greenfield, ABC News, quoting Gov. Clinton.)\n \n So Clinton, after attempted but failed deferrments, put it to chance. \n Kerry, after a single attempted but failed deferment, enlisted in the Navy:\n http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/03/07/wkerr07.xml&sSheet=/news/2004/03/07/ixnewstop.html\n \n Does any of this matter?\n\n \n No it doesn't. But people continue to bring this up and say how Bush dodged the war by going into the Air National Guard. I am tired of debating this because I don't care if someone served in Vietnam or if they served in Alabama. I care what they are doing not, and what they plan to do in the future. Others, like Mach, continue to bring this up. I think it just hurts Kerry even more when people bring up Vietnam era war service, so I don't see why people still bring it up. Judge Bush and Kerry on their records in public service and what they plan on doing, not what they did 30 years ago. But for the record, Bill Clinton was already in Europe when he got drafted, so even if he had been drafted with a lower number, I doubt he wouldn't have went to war. Bill Clinton directly dodged the war. Bush went into a different sector of the military. I hardly consider that dodging the war.",

   "Apparently nearly all of the media has said that the debate was a draw or that Kerry came out a little ahead. Nearly everyone agreed that Bush won the first half, and Kerry won the second half. How could a candidate who is so glib, well-spoken, and articulate have tied or barely squeaked out a victory over someone speaking at a 5th grade level? You would think someone speaking to America could dominate a 5th grader, but apparently Kerry didn't. Just look at the Gallup Poll and it will tell you that Bush spoke to America because 12% of undecideds said they are going to vote for him, compared to 10% for Kerry. I agree that Kerry is more articulate than Bush, but 98% of the people out there aren't going to understand Kerry, and they feel more at home with a President who is just like them.\n\n \n I just walked in the door from work and saw 71% on a CNN poll in favor of Kerry in the debate. I'll certainly look at whatever polls are out there, a CNN poll in itself means little..but 71% \n \n http://www.cumberlink.com/articles/2004/10/01/editorial/rich_lewis/lewis01.txt\n Gallup had 53/37 on this link (statistically a better poll I assume).\n \n \nDid you see the Bush interview on FOX News? He received NO questions beforehand, nothing beforehand. It takes a lot of knowledge and skill to run the United States, and he can't just put all the work off on others. Obviously Bush isn't a joke if more undecideds said they are going to vote for him than Kerry after watching the debate. You are a typical arm-chair quarterback; you think Bush is some stupid person with no abilities, and that you can do better than him. \n \n \n Not sure what you're claiming here. O'Reilly is a die-hard Bush supporter, it's a cake-walk for any conservative with O'Reilly, everyone knows this. Let's see him on Meet the Press or on a show that might actually challenge him and not help him with the answers...and better yet, might PUSH him on the answers. FOX news being pro-Bush is no testament. Interestingly enough, isn't the debate a neutral forum? \n \n \n \nYou are using the same talking point that all Liberals use. \"Look, John Kerry was in Vietnam and he knows what it takes to win a war.\" Apparently you don't know that John Kerry sought a deferment to avoid going to war. Even so, he spent 4 months in Vietnam looking for a reason to come home. That is pathetic if you ask me. If I am in war, I want to feel that my commander is going to do all he can to take care and look out for me, not try to get back home as soon as he can and abandon me. Clinton dodged the war; Bush didn't. Do you call all people during Vietnam who were in the National Guard and Air National Guard draft dodgers? I'm interested to hear your answer.\n\n \n No, I didn't bring up the point. When someone says Kerry is a sissy liberal, they need to be reminded one candidate went to war, killed people, and risked his life, the other didn't. And we're talking about war, so it's quite relevant IF you bring up that one is a sissy. Whatever that means. Don't you agree?",

   "The problem with this debate is that it was centered on the Iraq war. For either candidate to be elected, they will have to convince the American people that they have a better way to bring closure to a mess that was created by this administration. Unfortunately for Kerry, there are no easy solutions at this point, only hypothetical speculation and very questionable outcomes.\n\n Unfortunately, they do not have to convince the American people. They have to convince a majority of undecided voters in 10-12 states. It matters little if they win Democrats in Texas, Republicans in California or New York, Ohio is more important. Most will vote in November exactly as they would have voted last November, regardless of ANY input from any source. Let us hope that the 12% who will determine the next Prez makes the best decision.\n Dono",

   "Kerry's advantage in this debate (and future debates) is that he was not the incumbent.\n \n The comparison of \"what has happened under the incumbent's watch\" and \"what I would do to change it\" is always in favor of the challenger, especially when catastrophic things have occurred and a war is taking our soldiers.\n \n The topics of the debate were supposed to have been the war in Iraq and national security, both highly volatile topics when discussed today by any political opponents. Some say we should not even have gone to war in Iraq, most say national security is lacking in some way or another. There's always room for change and hindsight is always 20/20.\n \n Kerry managed to sneak in another jab at Bush's \"tax cuts for the wealtiest Americans\" even though he should be smart enough to realize that everybody got a tax cut and that those who pay the most in taxes should get the most in cuts. (I'm sure this will be a big part of the upcoming debate on the economy, where it won't actually be off-topic.)\n \n So when Kerry says he would do things differently, people are pleased because they're not satisfied with the apparent outcome of the war in Iraq and they're not comfortable with the current state of national security. (It's ironic how we can be uncomfortable with national security or the lack thereof and still be offended by the Patriot Act because it may personally affect us.)\n \n Kerry has failed to outline any plan for Iraq except to say that he would have us out sooner. He failed to present specific plans for the de-nuclearization of Russia except to say that he would do it in 4 years whereas Bush would take longer. He failed to say how he would pay for his planned expenditures of trillions of dollars. His plan for Korea is bi-lateral talks, shutting out the Chinese and others who have serious interests in that region and the proliferation of nuclear capabilities in Korea.\n \n Kerry still appears to favor international decisions regarding our national interests and safety. He wants a world governing body to make decisions based on what's best for the world, not what's best for the USA.\n \n Bush appeared to hestitate on several occasions. This is not necessarily a bad thing. First of all, he was likely a bit nervous as ANY MAN would have been when confronted by tough questions with the entire world listening with bated breath. It's also tough to be confronted by a misleading opponent such as John Forbes Kerry. Truthful or not, what Kerry says is heard by all. That puts a man on the defensive right away. I would want to carefully choose my words also. A little hestitation doesn't mean he didn't know what to say...he just wanted to put in the most acceptable terms. Quite frankly, I would have called Kerry a lying bastard regardless of the world audience.",
