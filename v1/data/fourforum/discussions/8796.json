   "There are definitely the signs of vigorous diplomatic and other activities by EU countries in the Middle East due to Israeli war in Lebanon. The real reason of it is a bit different imo... and it doesn't make me happy. Note that Americans seem somewhat reluctant to hinder this process and let Europeans get more involved. Isn't that fishy? This war was trap from the very start!\n Well, I feel there is some sophisticated plan of America & Israel devilish alliance to drag Europe into future series of full-fledged wars in the middle east. Iran goes the first in the list surely. The hook is energy resources. \n Now look. EU was really scared and humiliated in the winter of 2006 in gas scandal with Ukraine. Energy blackmailing plan was brilliantly performed then by Jewish tycoon Berezovsky and his Ukrainian prot&#1081;g&#1081; Timoshenko. That was a lesson not missed on Europe I'm sure. EU's been in active search of alternative energy sources since then. Apart from Central Asia where USA is well settled already she is casting her eye to the Middle East huge energy resources. This turned to be Achilles hill of Europe for it was exactly what USA and Israel had founded their plan on. \n Now Europeans are in the Middle East in search of some alternative energy sources to guarantee energy safety of EU. Congratulations! They have swallowed the hook. They are where they should be. Their alliance with USA (first diplomatic and then military) is inevitable as well as the war on Iran and others in which they are going to be participants not just observers or peacekeepers. \n Now we shall live and see.",
