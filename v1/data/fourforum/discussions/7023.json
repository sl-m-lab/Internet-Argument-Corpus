Now I don't know about Christmas in other countries, but in America it has become commercialized. (For example, the concept we have of Santa Claus was based upon a Coke ad. Santa Claus, or actually St. Nick, was a Turkish man back I believe in the 900's A.D. who did some good deeds by tossing coins in the window of some man so he wouldn't have to sell his 3 daughters into slavery and quite possibly prostitution to help pay a debt. I could almost assume that if Christmas were held in August or September, Santa would be wearing a Speedo instead of a red suit.)\n \n Now I don't believe that this is a liberal VS concervative thing.

Chase ordered designs prepared with the inscription IN GOD WE TRUST and backed coinage legislation which authorized use of this slogan. It first appeared on some U. S. coins in 1864, disappeared and reappeared on various coins until 1955, when Congress ordered it placed on all paper money and all coins.\n \n Fearing Communism might cross the Atlantic and engulf America, a feeling arose in Congress and throughout parts of the nation that by acknowledging \"God\" as our national symbol, America would be protected from the Communist menace. The Pledge was amended in 1954 to include the words \"under God;\" after a campaign by the Knights of Columbus to stamp out what the organization regarded as dangerous religious dissent by Americans.\n \n With these acts Congress declared an official US belief in a deity for exactly that purpose and none other.",

What has that got to do with us?\n \n \nDid Grant say \"I declare Christmas a holiday for which we will celebrate one religion\"...probably not.\n\n What did he say? I'd imagine he didn't say much specific to Christmas since it was part of a larger holiday act, HR 2224 making the first Day of January, the twenty-fifth Day of December, the fourth Day of July, and Thanksgiving Day, Holidays, within the District of Columbia. In doing so they made the 25th of December a holiday, not specifically the celebration of Christmas on that day. You can browse the bills and resolutions here and go to the 41st Congress to see the actual bill. You can read from the State Department here:\n \nMost Protestants and Roman Catholics and some Orthodox Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus on December 25. Before the 19th century, many Americans worked on Christmas, but in the industrial era the holiday began also to honor universal values, such as home, children and family life, and to incorporate secular customs like exchanging gifts and cards, and the decoration and display of evergreen \"Christmas Trees.\" Congress proclaimed Christmas a federal holiday in 1870. In 1999, a federal court acknowledged these secular aspects in rejecting a claim that the holiday impermissibly endorsed and furthered a particular religious belief.\n\n You can see that it was not New Year's, Independence Day or Christmas that were made holidays but the dates those days fall on. There was no wording in this act the declared any belief in a deity as a nation. Perhaps you should try to convince the court that you are right and they are wrong.\n \n \nDid the congress say \"I declare Chrisitianity the only religion in the US so lets put 'In God We Trust' on our currency\" probably not. \n\n From the US Treasury:\n \n\n Secretary Chase instructed James Pollock, Director of the Mint at Philadelphia, to prepare a motto, in a letter dated November 20, 1861:\n \n Dear Sir: No nation can be strong except in the strength of God, or safe except in His defense. The trust of our people in God should be declared on our national coins.\n \n You will cause a device to be prepared without unnecessary delay with a motto expressing in the fewest and tersest words possible this national recognition....\n \n The Congress passed the Act of April 22, 1864. This legislation changed the composition of the one-cent coin and authorized the minting of the two-cent coin. The Mint Director was directed to develop the designs for these coins for final approval of the Secretary. IN GOD WE TRUST first appeared on the 1864 two-cent coin.\n \n Another Act of Congress passed on March 3, 1865. It allowed the Mint Director, with the Secretary's approval, to place the motto on all gold and silver coins that \"shall admit the inscription thereon.\" Under the Act, the motto was placed on the gold double-eagle coin, the gold eagle coin, and the gold half-eagle coin. It was also placed on the silver dollar coin, the half-dollar coin and the quarter-dollar coin, and on the nickel three-cent coin beginning in 1866. Later, Congress passed the Coinage Act of February 12, 1873. It also said that the Secretary \"may cause the motto IN GOD WE TRUST to be inscribed on such coins as shall admit of such motto.\"....\n \n\n You can see that this act was for no other reason than a religious one; specifically to recognize a deity effectively declaring the very existance of a deity as an official act of congress.\n \n \n Christmas is and has always been a holiday created for and by Christians...thus CHRIST MASS. It is right there in the name. Yule and Christmas are not the same and to think Christmas was not created by and for religious purposes is insane. \n\n It doesn't matter.

Do you accuse everyone using a definition from a dictionary of plagiarism? How about this one from the Concise Oxford Dictionary?\n \nYule\n \n (also Yuletide)\n \n \u0095 noun archaic Christmas. \n\n As far as the Concise OED is concerned Christmas is the definition of Yule and yet you say they are not the same.

No pagan influences = less traditions on christmas taken from that culture. The holiday is all about Christ, thats the whole reason it is here. \n\n \n But this is the problem. Once it was about Yule and scaring spirits and darkness away*. As christian influence started to penetrate germanic superstition and old traditions, Yule gradually became more and more about the birth of christ. People tended mass and heard the christmas evangelium (if there is such an evangelium) until the old pre-christian traditions lost their meanings. They became mere rituals without any real meaning, like the christmas tree, candles, fire logs and gnomes. And today, the christian and religious meaning of christmas is gradually being replaced by secular meanings such as comfort, friends and family and presents, at least for many of us. Claiming that christmas is about christs birth is not incorrect. The traditions are clearly there (with the baby jesus and the crib and the sermon). But not everyone celebrate christmas this way. For me and my family and friends, chrsitmas is just as much about scaring the darkness and evil spirits away as it is about the birth of christ. The rituals are there, but none of them mean anything other than what we make of them.\n \n * This is from a germanic perspective, as in anglo-saxon, swedish, german etc, etc. The history of christmas where naturally different in Roman and greek cultures.\n \n \nYule was a winter solitice celebration and only started meaning christmas when Christmas was formed. Once again, Austrialia celebrates this during June and July, obviously not the same as Christmas.\n \n\n \n Once again, christmas is the english word for a holiday that is called very differently in various languages. The traditions surrounding christmas also vary from country to country. In the nordic countries, christmas is called Jul (Yule) and our traditions are pretty similiar to that of the anglo-saxons., In Germany it is called \"Weinnachten\" (wine night) and their traditions are pretty similiar to ours as well. In Eastern europe, christmas traditions are very different from yours and ours. In France it is called something about Noel (don`t remeber) and their traditions are different, etc, etc. \n \n Yule is not a mainstream tradition in australia. It is celebrated by neo-pagans only. These are fringe groups who choose to celbrate an archaic tradition that is currently recognized as christmas. The fact that this small group of people (how many can they be, 100?) does this not negate the fact that Yule means christmas.\n \n \n \n\n It was the only reason actually. \n \n HEre is agood link on the orgins of Christmas \n \n http://www.mrrena.com/Christmas.shtml\n\n \n \n Are you saying that a think-piece written by the author of \"The Christian Living and Apologetics Website\" is a good source for the historic origin of christmas? \n \n He doesn`t even bring up the year the bishop in Rome declared 24th of december to be the birthdate of christ or how it relates to the celebration of the Roman god Saturn... Or all of it`s connections to various other pagan festivities around the world... I`m sorry, but I don`t consider that link as an authoritive on anything other than Eric Knickerbockers own viewpoint and memories of christmas.",

If you want to claim that Christmas doesn't have much of a religious meaning anymore you can but at the same time you can't complain about \"In God We Trust\" or \"One Nation Under God\" because those are just as embedded in our society as Christmas is. \n \n Oh, and yes I know Jesus wasn't born on Dec 25th which is why I said \"remember\" instead of \"born on\".

You should also note that the States were not considered to be inhibited by the 1st Amendment to the US Constitution until after the 14th Amendment was passed.\n\n \n There are federal buildings outside of DC though....\n \n And what is your point...it is a leglistation and not the whole reasoning. \n I can give you legislation. http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode05/usc_sec_05_00006103----000-.html\n There is the law for you.\n \n You haven't addressed my Thanksgiving point either. \n http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/thanks.htm",

   " We declared Christmas a national holiday...of course some here believe it was mere coincidence that Dec 25 happened to be Christmas as well. Not only that, but Thanksgiving is going to have to be gotten rid of as well. Lincoln clearly said this is a day for God...\n \n\n \n The fact is, if we did what some would like and eradicated every mention of religion and God from govt., we'd lose a great deal of our nation's history. The biggest problem I have with this witch hunt against any religious reference in any govt. sphere is that it's historically revisionist. The idea that the 1st amendment means the very utterance of \"god\" or \"Christ\" the moment one steps across the property line onto govt. land, a classroom, capitol hill, or a prayer in a govt. meeting is pretty new in the history of our country. Our founders were much more tolerant than that. There's no evidence that those who founded this nation would have felt the freedom of religion should be withheld. In fact the very opposite is true: it is apparent that the founding fathers had great respect and tolerance for people of faith and some certainly WERE deeply religious. Would that those who preach liberal \"tolerance\" today follow their example.",

The Christians stole it from the Pagans, just like they took Easter eggs, Yule logs, Halloween, Easter bunnies, the date for Christmas, the story of Jesus (Mithra came long before Jesus), etc.",

   "Cristmas trees have a colerfull background. Many people belive that it has pagan origins but was turrned into a cristian tradition when people started \n putting religious orniments on it. Cristians normaly use evergreen trees to symbolise eternal live (scince the trees are \"eternaly green\"). The fact is, they are a christian tradition, and in my opinion they should be refered to as cristmas trees. Manoras (sorry if i misspelled it) are a Jewish tradition and should continue to be reffered to as manoras not \"8 holliday candalsticks\" However the government should not make laws about what people can call things like cristmas trees and manoras, if they did, many people would get mad. in all honesty, I take the tearm holiday tree offensive because I think it is an attempt to remove religion from our society.",
