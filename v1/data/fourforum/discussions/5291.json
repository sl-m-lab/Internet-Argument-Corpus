   "That was really well done! Only why waiting so long but anyways very good job! =) The Bush administration has ordered US banks to block any accounts or financial asserts of Al Ihsan Society  said to have served as a front for the Palestinian Iranian-sponsored Islamic Jihad. Now we know terrorism can be fought not only by weapon but also by cutting financial flows.\n \n Now I only wish president Bush also blocked financial assets of those supporting Chechen terrorists who tried to attack him in Tbilisi, for example Boston Committee against Ethnic Cleansing  headed by Dr. Victoria Poupko. And he also needs to learn acting in advance so that terrorists simply have no money to even buy weaponry and armament and recruit new suicide bombers.",
