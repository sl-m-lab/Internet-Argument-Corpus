   "http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/04/27/gas.rebate/index.html\n \n Republican senators want to send every taxpayer $100 check, to offset gas prices. How bizarre is that? The party which prides itself on opposing welfare, which would rather have single mothers go hungry than pass out food stamps, wants to give everyone $100 bucks for gas. Why is \"get a better job\" or \"stop being so wasteful\" a reasonable response when someone can't afford food or clothes, but when it's gas then the republicans are all set to bail people out, whether they need it or not?",

   "Look at the rest of the article. It also includes this:\n \nAs outlined by the senior GOP leadership aide, the energy package would give taxpayers a $100 rebate, repeal tax incentives for oil companies and allow the Federal Trade Commission to prosecute retailers unlawfully inflating the price of gasoline.\n \n The measure would also give the Transportation Department authority to issue fuel efficiency standards for passenger vehicles, expand tax incentives for the use of hybrid vehicles and push for more research into alternative fuels and expansion of existing oil refineries.\n\n At first I thought \"Oh here it goes again, Republicans are trying to hijack a Democratic issue and Dems aren't going to do anything about it as usual.\"\n \n Then I saw this:\n \nThe GOP senators are also calling on the Bush administration to suspend deposits into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for six months to increase the nation's oil supply.\n\n \n In addition to what Dono said earlier, which is accurate, it is an attempt by the GOP to get Dems to vote against this bill by including drilling in Alaska and then say, \"you voted against fuel efficiency standards, hybrid cars, and alternative fuels.\"",

As for the last election, if dumb and dumber were the best our nation could come up with, we are in deep trouble. One thing the next candidates can look forward to ... if our current leader is the benchmark, they will appear to be brilliant.\n Dono",
