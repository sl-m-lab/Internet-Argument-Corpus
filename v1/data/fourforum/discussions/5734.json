   "In 2004, Illinois voters elected Barack Obama to the U.S. Senate as a Democrat. Surprisingly, he is the first black male to become a U.S. Senator as a Democrat. In 1992, Carol Moseley Braun became the first black female Democrat U.S. Senator. How is it possible that the democrats can claim to be \"Champions of Civil Rights\"? The first three black U.S. Senators were Republicans. They were Hiram Revels (R), Blanche K. Bruce (R), and Edward Brooke (R).\n \n Edward Brooke served in the U.S. Senate from 1967 to 1979 and was the first Black American to receive a majority vote. The Democrats say they are the party for Black Americans but their history leads one to believe otherwise. Why did the next black U.S. Senator following the Civil Rights Act of 1964 come from the Republican side? Why do the Democrats parade Carol Moseley Braun around as the first black female U.S. Senator but opposed her during her senate campaign? The Democrats endorsed her opponent, incumbent Senator Alan J. Dixon.\n \n Republicans have no political payoff by endorsing blacks unlike Democrats. Ninety Percent of black voters in 2000 voted for Al Gore. It is difficult for Black Republicans to win elections when Hollywood, the Media, and Handfuls of Has-Been-Race-Baiters are continually calling Black Republicans Uncle Toms, House N*ggers, and Sellouts. Democrats try to point to lack of blacks in the Republican Party as a sign of racism but when majorities of blacks are raised being brainwashed to hate republicans, it is not hard to understand why representation would be low.\n \n \n ________________________________________\n http://www.carnellknowledge.com/ \n ________________________________________",

   "Excellent observations my friend.......Welcome to the forum...Looking forward to your input...........\n\n \n Thank You. I look forward to reading more posts from you as well as the others.\n \n \n \n \nhow is it that every time some organization doesn't have the \"appropriate\" number of minorities, they are automatically labled as 'wrong' or 'against minorities' or 'not supporting minorities'. That's backwards logic. No wait. that's not even logic.\n What should 'being black' have to do with running for political slots??? It shouldn't even matter. \n I just don't understand why people make such a big deal of these things when we're trying to discourage the idea that race matters. \n I'm not even going to argue what this post is about. someone just please tell me what being black REALLY has to do with any of this.\n And no, I'm not racist. I'm about as far from it as you can get, so that not the point I'm trying to make.\n\n \n I also believe in a colorblind society. There are people from all walks of life that I adore and many I can't stand. With that said, I believe you are missing the point. Democrats, with their so-called Civil Rights support, constantly beat up on Republicans. Think about it this way. If a company or corporation in 1964 said it was all rah-rah about Civil Rights then went on TV constantly bashing their competition. The same company says it is working, as a main goal of the company, toward advancing and promoting black people within itself and outside the company. The company, for 41 years, tells blacks that all other companies are evil and to stick with them. After 41 years, someone checks the hiring practice of the company and realizes that the company has only two blacks in upper management. One promoted to the position 28 years after the company initially spoke about promoting blacks and the other promoted almost 40 years after. This is would not be acceptable.\n \n \n And now a quote from The Great Walter E. Williams\n \n \"It's always been my contention that the conservative vision shows far greater respect for blacks than the liberal you-can't-make-it- without-us vision. For decades there have been buy-off-the-black-vote presidential appointments like secretaries of labor, health and human services, education, and housing. But it's been conservative presidents who have appointed blacks to top positions of responsibility and authority such as Secretary of State, National Security Advisor, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Republican presidents didn't make these appointments to buy off the black vote. They chose the best people around who just happened to be black Americans.\"\n (Read The Complete Article) \n \n from Conservatives, Liberals and Blacks\n by Walter E. Williams\n \n \n \n _______________________________\n http://www.carnellknowledge.com/ \n _______________________________",

Where those blacks within the two parties you mention from poor backgrounds or similar to those of their white peers within the parties.\n \n Chances are that most are just going to be republicans/democrats who happen to be black rather than joining a party purely for their past support of civil rights.",

Democrats, with their so-called Civil Rights support, constantly beat up on Republicans.\n\n This has fairly little to do with skin-colour: It's meant to help poor people afaik. Blacks are on average poorer, but that doesn't mean that their poverty is directly related to their skin colour (ie; they can becoe rich). So, the party with the most \"poor\" people in it would be a better way of determining which is actually living up to its word.\n \n Even that doesn't matter though: you should choose the best candidate for the job. If that means you have all black/white/asian/rich/poor people in your party, so be it.\n \n -Wez",

   "Quite often a childs view is shaped by their parents, its not just that 'my parents voted democrat so I will'. Especially as the Democrats are the more liberal party and more popular with the young than the Republicans they are more likely to keep their values than if it were the other way round. \n People are less likely to rebel against their parents who are more liberal than if they are rigid conservatives",
