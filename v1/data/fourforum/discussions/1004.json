Let it fly, i am curious.\n\n \n I've resumed most of what I know in my post adressed to oshi in \"Am I going to Hell?\" thread. From my POV Wicca is not wrong, unless you harm others. I do not personally know any Wiccans but I have spoken to them online. \n One of the Wiccans I met online said they HAD to respect others' free will; that they weren't even allowed to perform a good spell (e.g. a healing one) if said person did not explicitly consent to it. However, despite this, the Wiccan Rede and the three-fold law, they themselves admitted there were people among them who used their power for things 'other than good' (they avoided saying 'evil' b/c they said naming it its giving it power.)\n \n As for the Christian point of view, I guess I've seen both sides. I've seen Christians who quoted the Bible against Wiccans and I have seen counter-arguments to those verses. I have also seen this Christian point of view, so I'd say it is not Christianity to blame, but sometimes it's followers. And even them can be educated.",

I have been bad. Excuse the error of attribution. \n \n I do feel it is wrong from the christian point of view as you say. The idea that magic controls us and the universe and that we can control our circumstances, I find harmful to people. Not meant as an attack but I find that it does not help people to deal with the real world.\n \n Now, one might say that neither does christianity. Especially the christianity where God is the big bad meanie in the sky waiting for us to mess up in order to hammer us. Many people see him that way. \n \n I am a little sensitive to the subject of Wiccans as the person I know has chosen this path for himself. He is doing a lot of drugs, running away from school and every responsibility he has. I do apologize for taking out my sensitivity here and will attempt to keep it under control. He is a dear friend and I care about him greatly and he is only be encouraged to \"do whatever feels right\" by his wiccan friends. \n \n The problem with that is if he feels like destroying someone's house he tries. I do not even know his location at this point. We used to talk weekly and play chess. he refuses to have anything to do with me as he sees me as a christian and because of that I judge him. I do not judge him, I do judge his behavior. However, I do not define him by it. \n \n My experience with wiccans has been mostly of the bad variety. Earlier, I was simply trying to contribute my opinion without debating the issue. Again, innappropriate.\n \n Thank you for your gracious response (I mean that sincerely)",

   "I do apologize for being a little rude myself, sometimes i have the tact of a wrecking ball. I do hope your friend gets the help that it sounds like he needs. With you as a friend, it sounds like he will have a good person to talk to when he is ready. I do understand the frustration of being a friend to someone with self and publically destructive behavior, but I would wager that this behavior is not due to Wiccan philosophy. Wiccan philosophy basically teaches the principle of non-maleficence if you are familiar. (in short, do no harm) This applies to both self and others. I must also say though that Wiccan philosophy teaches \"free will\", the concept that no one person can tell another what to do, how to do it, when to do it, and what not to do. It comes down to a moral argument this case. Whether to interfere and attempt to help, or respect the free will and do nothing. I myself would aire on the side of trying to talk and help my friend, as in this respect i would not be doing any harm. In the end, your friend will have to make up his own mind and chose the path that suits him best. It never hurts to have a friend along the way though. Also one thought in closing, many young people claim to be Wiccan or follow Wiccan belief, yet have very little understanding of Wiccan philosophy. These are the people that unwittingly bring a bad name to the Wiccan religion. Is it possible that your friend fits this category? This usually occurs in people about 15 to 20 years of age, and serves another end, whether it be rebellion or desire for attention. Many people getting their first experience outside their parents home...ie. college freshmen and the like, will experiment with new beliefs. If your friend claims to be a TRUE Wiccan, he needs to examine his beliefs a little closer. For many, this is just a phase that unfortunately brings a bad name to Wicca. Best of luck to you. And THANK YOU for your reply.",

But then I make no bones about the fact that I have no respect for wiccan because it itself has no respect for real ideas - because anyone can be a wiccan, even wiccan Christians. It is too me a muddle. This may seem disrespectful, but I can view it no other way. It is to me a hodge-podge made up in the last century.\n \n \"but most wiccans are more scripted than that\" Only in the west. Magic is practiced in thousands of cultures all around the world. What you hold sacred is foreign to antoher spirtualist group. That too is why I have little respect for it as a 'faith'.\n \n I am not trying to convert. But I am trying to state things as I see them. And that is how I see wiccan. These comments of course may not be welcome, but in part because I believe what I believe to be the truth, then I can not believe that other things are also the truth... otherwise that undermines the very notion of truth... I am not a relativist.\n \n I know someone once said \"Now, the world don't move to the beat of just one drum, \n What might be right for you, may not be right for some. \n A man is born, he's a man of means. \n Then along come two, they got nothing but their jeans. \n But they got, Diff'rent Strokes. \n It takes, Diff'rent Strokes. \n It takes, Diff'rent Strokes to move the world. \n Everybody's got a special kind of story \n Everybody finds a way to shine, \n It don't matter that you got not alot\n So what, \n They'll have theirs, and you'll have yours, and I'll have mine. \n And together we'll be fine.... \n Because it takes, Diff'rent Strokes to move the world. \n Yes it does. \n It takes, Diff'rent Strokes to move the world.\"\n \n But, that was just a tv show. You might believe this sort of idea. I don't.\n \n How do you tolerate my intolerence?",

It is officially recognized as a religion by the U.S. government. \n This is a diverse movement that knows no central authority. Practitioners do not all have the same views, beliefs and practices. \n Note that while all witches are pagans, not all pagans are witches.

Wiccans throw some fun Halloween parties. Your loss.\n\n \n As I believe I've mentioned, I'm not in religion for fun, and what I can get out of it. I think that's rather shallow. For you, faith is like an argument over which tastes better, Pepsi or Coke, nothing of any real substance. Hey, join Wiccan, they have some really cool parties! You could make that your campaign slogan.*\n \n Ah, but for the open minded person who is supposedly tolerant of other faiths! What a hypocrite. This is the very problem with Wiccan... you believe in a faith that believes in a plethora of contradicting beliefs! It's all good - well not quite, you dislike faiths that actually are exclusive, such as mine! How do you say you should be tolerant of my beliefs? Or do we get to the real issue, that you're pretending to be tolerant, because it makes you feel good? You should like evolution, it's able to hold onto a plethora of beliefs so long as it's all called evolution... even accepts people who believe in God, when it can't even prove that God exists.\n \n See I hold that my faith is the truth and you hate it! You'd rather believe in a whole bunch of stuff as long as none of them dare make a claim to truth, therefore your faith is about believing passionately in something because it's not the truth! That makes sense, not!\n \n I believe what I believe to be the truth. To say that your faith is also the truth, even though it contradicts with mine would make me a hypocrite. But I don't do this, and you can't stand it.\n \n \n \n But, why do I believe wiccan is evil? Do you really want to know...? I ask, just to again test whether you're as tolerent as what you claim to be.\n \n \n *Ours, \"Come back to God\".",

When i originally stated that more people have died in the name of god, i meant god to mean any god in which a religion bases themselves on, not just a christian god.\n \n \nI don't want to 'control' what you believe either. I think though what you believe is silly. Given the fact that you can believe in mutually exclusive beliefs, and at the same time say you tolerate other faiths, even the ones that you think are pretty bad.\n \n \n Damn, you are at it again! I do tolerate other faiths...most importantly people right to believe in them. I don't pass judgement on whether they are good or bad. Again...your words not mine. Are you seeing the pattern here yet?\n \n \nYes, I accept you have rules, and they might even be held in common with a few other Wicca. But ultimately, you just hold what you believe to be true, and you are the supreme arbiter of what is right. That's what I find odd. It's so relativist. What if you sneeze and start believing in something else?\n \n \n Yes, this is correct. I do determine what is right and wrong FOR ME, NOT FOR YOU. I base my concept of wrong and right on my experiences and the experiences of others before me, but ultimately I still must decide for myself what is right and wrong. Relativist or not, I consider thinking for myself a gift of nature.\n \n In other words, stop taking what I say out of context. Stop twisting words to serve your end. Stop putting words in my mouth. Listen. Think. Live.",

But the truth remains, that although we do not view the Nazi's as good, wholesome christians, it cannot be disputed that they were mostly christian.

That comment was a bad stereotype- victims of violent crimes or police brutality do NOT deserve it, and it's pretty scary to think there are paramedics going around who believe otherwise. Makes me wonder why they don't just switch jobs, for everyone's sake.\n \n \nMizmaxx also keeps criticising Catholics and directing this criticism to me; even though I'm not Catholic.

Not all pagans are wiccans, but all wiccans are pagans. Maybe if you wrote it down or something it would save us both some wasted energy.\n \n \nWicca seems to be very much against Christianity.\n\n \n Odd. I found those quotes proved more about how Christianity is against wiccanism and paganism in general (which you readily admit).\n \n \nThe Romans had child-prostitution which was ended by Christians.\n \n The Celts used to burn people in giant 'Wicker Men' to appease their nature gods.\n\n \n\"Christianity on Trial: Arguments Against Anti-Religious Bigotry\"\n\n Evidence from a non-ecclesiastical source?\n \n Interesting, this review came up while I was looking up the book-\n \nI couldn't believe that Carroll and Shiflett would put so many controversial topics into print - and then so weakly try to dismiss their validity! The mass history of atrocities blamed on attendants of our faith that translate into a virtual horror stories for a proud Christian, are NOT defended in this treatise as I'd hoped! It's too easy to dismiss each point they try to make;(...)This book won't help a Christian defend heinous acts done in the past in the name of Christianity - it will only give the opposition more fuel against us.This book is full of \"pats on the back\" for positive contributions that are embellished through the author's eyes, or downright fabricated. Critics will be eager to poke holes in this one. I can't recommend this book. \n\n \n Another says-\n \nIn all frankness, the authors were very sloppy in their referencing approach, and in a book like this, this is a huge problem. In every chapter of the book, there are quotes the authors use to try and advance their points which are not referenced back to any source material. This serious oversight leaves the book very susceptible to criticism from those who dont like what they read in here.\n\n \n Personally, I find the entire premise of the book as well as the excerpts I've read problematic.\n \n Instead of acknowledging the wrongs of Christianity's past and encouraging people to find ways not to repeat the mistakes of history, the author tries to argue with defenses (such as moral relativism- who knew you were a fan?) and outshine the horrors with \"benefits\" brought about in the name of Christianity.\n \n I don't believe that this is a good strategy for Christians or Christianity. If you look at Columbus and defend him with Bartolome De Las Casas, you will be inclined to repeat Columbus' mistakes. Instead of saying \"they weren't really Christian\" when someone has done something wrong, the ethical Christians I know take responsibility to try to make sure reparations are made and future wrongs are avoided.",

This puts me at odds with so many people I chose the username \"Montalban\" from mythology; a castle for misfits...\n \n \n I have a problem with conservative politics because they play up to religious 'morals' to benefit themselves. The left aren't courting the people the same way, and I think are far more honest. I also find that most right-wing moralistic politicians are the biggest bag of hypocrites! They use Christians, and Christianity as a shield.\n \n A case in point; our Prime Minister, John Howard, attended the opening of HillSong, a born-again Christian place. They had a mutual admiration session going with compliments passed back and forth. At the same time, John Howard is locking up refugees, taking funding away from hospitals and universities, giving money to media owners and mining companies and still no born-again outside the Uniting Church seems to notice his patent hypocrisy.\n \n I believe Jesus was here primarily to save our souls, and thus the saving of my own soul is my prime task. However, he did go into bat for the little people, he did support women and children. If you ever read Acts of the Apostles, they pooled their money and gave each according to their needs. However, I won't support Marx because he's intrinsically anti-religious.\n \n I have two friends with whom I disagree with their views of a worker's paradise, because I don't believe man is perfectible by his own efforts. However I do think that social justice is preferable to the adversarial de-humanising rampant capitalist system that most people seem to crave.\n \n In saying this, you are now free to say that I am inconsistent. I won't mind. I won't agree either. I believe I am being as consistent to the teachings of Christ as I can be. A Christo-moralistic socialist, if you will.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Or a madman!",

It was meant to provoke thought, not be an insult. If this was taken as an insult, I do appologize. I guess it is hard to understand the context of what my friend meant. As paramedics we see some of the worst that happens to society, and we also see simply some of the worst people in society. I have seen many, many women who have been beat by their husband/boyfriend, call the cops, call the ambulance, and then when they realize he will go to jail suddenly change their mind and state that he did not hit her. We continuously councel these women before we leave telling them that it will happen again, and we give them phone numbers and locations of safe shelters and other places to go. Do they ever go? Rarely. Do we go back to see them the next time they are beat senseless by Billyjoebob? Usually within a week. The problem is that these women keep getting burned, running 5 feet away from the fire, then slowly inch back towards it until the get burned again. In your case, I don't know. I don't know you, I don't know what you were doing, I don't know if it was a peaceful protest, I don't know if you became threatening to a cop. If you were simply attacked out of the blue, then you did not deserve it. If you were not peacefully demonstrating, and a cop percieved you to be threatening, then maybe you did deserve it. Either case, my initial comment was written more as a joke than a serious comment (granted I did not explain this at that time, and I do understand how that could be taken the wrong way...again, i appologize). I of coarse do not think that a rape victim deserved what they got, nor an innocent murder victim. A gang member murdered by a rival gang...well?

   "Slavery, child prostitution and human sacrifice (including of children)\n \n It has been brought to our attention that Wicca pre-dates Christianity. So does, naturally enough, paganism.\n \n \nEvidence from a non-ecclesiastical source?\n\n \n Actually in \"The Twelve Caesars\" by Seutonius there is several instances of Roman emperors freely practicing sexual deviance. Tiberius had his 'minnows' who used to swim with him and play with him in a giant pool. There is also how he used nursing babies for gratification.\n Seutonius was a pagan.\n \n \"Slavery is older than recorded human history and probably occurred in some form or another almost everywhere in the world at some time. It was common in ancient Babylon, Persia, Egypt and the Roman Empire. It was found in Asia and Africa.\"\n http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/stop-traffic/1998/0124.html\n \n Ancient Greece and Rome, however, were far worse than Israel in this regard. Infanticide was common to both, and in Greece it was a widely accepted practice for older men to have relations with young boys. Boy brothels flourished in every ancient Greek city. In the Roman Empire, child prostitution was so prevalent that special taxes and holidays were set up specifically for that trade. In the arenas, girls were raped and forced into acts of bestiality. Similar atrocities were prevalent in many other ancient nations. Certainly that had child slavery as well.\n \n \"Graeco-Roman domestic sexuality rested on a triad: the wife, the concubine and the courtesan. The fourth century BC Athenian orator Apollodoros made it very clear in his speech Against Neaira quoted by Demosthenes (59.122) that 'we have courtesans for pleasure, and concubines for the daily service of our bodies, but wives for the production of legitimate offspring and to have reliable guardians of our household property'. Whatever the reality of this domestic set-up in daily life in ancient Greece,[2] this peculiar type of 'm\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois' pursued its course unhindered into the Roman period: monogamy de jure appears to have been very much a fa\u00e7ade for polygamy de facto.[3] The advent of Christianity upset this delicate equilibrium. By forbidding married men to have concubines on pain of corporal punishment, canon law elaborated at Church councils took away from this triangular system one of its three components.[4] Henceforth, there remained only the wife and the courtesan.\"\n [2]In particular, see the discussion in M. Lloyd, Euripides Andromache (Warminster, 1995), pp. 6 ff. \n [3]P. Salmon, Population et d\u00e9population dans l'empire romain (Bruxelles, 1974), p. 45. \n [4]In particular Canon 87 of the Council in Trullo of 692. See C.J. H\u00e9f\u00e9l\u00e9 and H. Leclercq, Histoire des Conciles, T. III.[1] (Paris, 1909), p. 573. \n \"When Christians finally became rulers, they made concerted efforts to stamp it out...\"Already in 529, Justinian had attempted to put a curb on female child prostitution by penalising all those engaged in that trade, in particular the owners of brothels (CJ 8.51.3). In 535, he invalidated the contracts by which the pimps of Constantinople put to work peasant girls whom they had bought from their parents (Novell. 14). The prostitution of adult women, however, does not appear to have unduly worried the imperial legislator. The punishment inflicted on pimps who ran the child prostitution network, varied according to their wealth and respectability. Paradoxically, Byzantine administration considered the job of Imperial Inspector of the Brothels as eminently honourable, so much so that in 630 the Bishop of Palermo was appointed to this post.\"\n \n All quoted from http://www.ucd.ie/classics/96/Dauphin96.html\n And this site isn't exactly glowing about some Christians!\n \n It's well known that child prostitution continues to this day... It is important to note a very critical point; the difference was in pagan times it was accepted and practiced because of the religious beliefs. In modern times it's practiced in spite of Christian beliefs.\n \n Pagan Aztecs and Celts practiced human sacrifice. Whilst our sources for the former are mainly Spanish (therefore Christian), our sources for the latter are pagan Roman. As well, we have corroboration by the finding of skulls and remains of children at Aztec religious sites. It is possible to suggest the Old Testament might contain such, but they weren't Christian, and therefore is superfluous to this argument.",

Both in their religion and administration of justice the Aztecs seems to have been about the most unfeeling people known to history with the possible exception of the Assyrians. Slanderers were punished by singeing their hair to the scalp with a pine torch; one who stole gold or silver was flayed alive and sacrificed to the god of the goldsmiths and the silversmiths...On the tops of the truncated pyramids the Aztec priests slashed open the breasts and tore out the hearts of human victims whose bodies were then eaten. There were festivals when infants with painted faces and paper wings were sacrificed, or when men were flayed and others danced in their skins\" (pages 394-395 emphasis mine). \n Tierney, Patrick.

   "A bibliography is not very helpful. Quotes are.\n\n \n Sorry, this is really a difficult topic to research.\n \n \nIt strikes me that Christians \"sacrificed\" people as well, \"in exceptional cases\".\n\n \n Well certainly one of the first criticisms levelled at Christians has always been 'human sacrifice'. The pagan Romans said Christians were cannibals - because we 'eat the body of our Lord'. Orthodox and Catholics believe that the Eucharist is the actual Body of Christ. Other Christians hold it to be bread - and is merely symbolic.\n \n In the 1800s in China, missionaries were suspected of burying Chinese babies under their churches - in order to protect them from evil spirits. But then again, in the Middle Ages, Christians said that about the Jews.\n \n In exceptional cases a Christian may lay his life down for his 'brother'; which is termed 'the ultimate sacrifice'. Jesus Himself lead the way by acting as a sacrifice.\n \n \n Furthermore Christians have taken the lives of other people in wars and self-defence, but whether these acts are Christian or not is highly debateable. (I find it quite remarkable, in a disgusting sort of way, just how many Christians there are who are happy to have the death penalty. I believe that this is inconsistent and therefore hypocritical of Christians.)\n \n \n \nA summary of the apparent claims of \"pagan sacrifices\" are that they are taken by either writings by conquerors (pagan or not, the Romans didn't have any respect for the people they invaded), or by human remains.\n\n \n There is a bit of sifting to do here, because although the Romans themselves were pagan, they wanted to show that the Celts (for example) were more barbaric than themselves. And unfortunately, the Celts left us no written records of their religious practices. \n \n However, we have human remains...\n \n \nIn the cases of human remains, so few have been found as to make it unlikely that these were common occurrences. The descriptions by invading Spanish or Roman invaders have not been supported by the kind of numbers of remains which were described. Instead, it is possible that the remains were ritually executed criminals. Which, btw, \"Christians\" still practice today (in Texas for example).\n\n \n They have discovered in bogs in Ireland the preserved corpses of people. They were found with their hands tied and their necks still carried the rope that they were strangled with.\n \n \nAt any rate, paganism is a very broad term, and encompasses many beliefs, some of which I agree with, others not. Paganism is not a religion, it is a descriptive term for any kind of earth-based spirituality. \n \n\n \n I enjoy pagan myths. I especially like reading about Greco-Roman gods (consult Bullfinch's Mythology), as well as Aboriginal mythology.\n \n I don't ascribe to any essentialist theory that modern pagans are 'essentially' free-thinkers and lovey-dovey nice people though. Likewise be wary of Christians that vote conservative!\n \n \n \n This isn't meant to be funny, and I promise I won't argue... but does your pagan beliefs take into account aliens?\n \n My Orthodox Christianity has not delved too much into them, but the late Fr Seraphim Rose describes them as demonic in origin.\n \n \n \n \n \n My first name isn't Christian! I won't mention what it is, but because it is Celtic, and pre-Christian, I can't claim I was named after a saint, or a biblical character.\n \n \n \n You mentioned on a previous post about Liberation Theology. I am reminded of a quote by a priest (who's name escapes me).\n \"When I fee the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask 'why are they poor?' they call me a communist\"",

We didn't even consider Aborigines as citizens until 1967... the constitution had to be amended because it stated that in terms of national census, Aborigines were to be counted with wildlife! Fortunately, our national soul was restored when the largest majority on any constitutional issue voted to change this... 90.8% (though you could look on this and say that there were 10% of Australians who voted to keep this)... this too when the majority of Aborigines were converts to Christianity.\n \n A few years ago I was doing some research for work in going through lots of old records of Aborigines here in NSW. Up until the 1950s there were special laws to treat Aborigines under 'protection' of selected white people appointed by the government. Aborigines could seek exemption from this law - that is, to be treated like anyone else, but this didn't always happen, and the law shouldn't have been there anyway.\n \n Another film you might want to see is \"Rabbit Proof Fence\".\n \n \n \n \n People who call themselves Christian!",
