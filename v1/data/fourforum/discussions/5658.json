How they (and the rest of mature Europe) deal with labor rigidity will be a primary issue in future growth potential. Germany has seemingly forever used contract resident workers to blend their labor costs without granting citizenship, which could be expanded or further utilized much as Japan does, locating production within countries being serviced to regain capital and take profits for tax base contribution to absorb domestic social costs. They also have debt capacity and the ability to service it for infrastructure purposes without endangering their balance as a reserve. I'm in agreement with you in that German culture, confidence, will put them on top with regard to quality and efficiency. I personally enjoy solid engineering and quality control in this throw-away world.",

   "Germany still is the industrial giant of Europe, and still is the at the top for mechanical engineering for the most part. As a major exporter, it still has good economic fundamentals ( large trade surplus mostly value added).\n \n Germany's main problem is the uncertainty of the German people. East Germany still has mass unemployement, and now the German government is talking about reforms ( Germans like Stability in general as stability equals organization).This uncertainty is causing the German people to save probably an amount of money that is causing the domestic slowdown. \n \n Overall German productivity has increased by ( by memory) about 30% in the last 4 years or so making German workers again near the best. What needs to be done is allowing less strict hiring and firing rules for German companies, flexibility is not a strong point of German labor laws. Also the somewhat overly generous welfare programs in Germany need to be reduced to encouraged more people to at least look for work.",

   "alright, here's what I remember.\n \n Germany's unemplyoment rate is hovering around 11%, which by all means is not good for the economy. Even worse is Germany's socialistic benefits which, unlike in the states go on for significent periods of time, thus reducing the motive for getting a job. That leads to a serious problem, Germany's hiring practices make it very difficult to fire, forcing employers to pay large severences to fired employees which makes them very hesitant to hire, thus compounding the first problem. With a aging populace, a decline birth rate, long ranging liabilities in health care and welfare, and a virtually stangant economy Germany has some real problems to deal with. \n \n Still, Germany is the powerhouse of Europe.
