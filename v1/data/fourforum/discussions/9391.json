   "I've been thinking of the reasons people go pro-choice or pro-life, and to me it seems that the pro-choice stance has overwhelming proof on their side. Lets take a look:\n \n \n Reasons for Pro-life:\n \n 1)Protecting the \"innocent\" baby or embryo or whatever\n \n 2)Earining brownie points in heavan\n \n I can't think of anymore, please post and i'll add to the list.\n \n Reasons for pro-choice:\n \n 1)This is a woman's body, not yours, not mine, and certainly not the governments.\n \n 2)An embryo can not make a decision, but a mother knows her circumstances best, therefore she should choose for the both.\n \n 3)An Embryo is not a sentient life form, and does not posses self awareness or consciousness, or to quote Another Opinion: \"Mentally exist\". \n \n 4)The only thing an embryo and humans have in common is a strand of DNA.\n \n 5)Abortion has some positive effects on society, as in the book Freakonomics by um... forgot the guy, Steve something, the author cites that the legalization of abortions caused a rapid decrease in crime, which makes sense if you think about it. Unwanted children are 10X more likely to become criminals.\n \n 6)And embryo does not have a 100% possiblilty of growing into a human being. 20% of pregnancies end in a miscarrige.\n \n 7)Birth control is not 100% effective. As I have said before, my friend's mom had her sister on the pill. Even though this makes up a small percentage of abortion, it still makes up some percentage, which is reason enough.\n \n 8)Being forced to carry through and unwanted pregnancy can have devastating effects on a women, namely financially and emotionally.\n \n \n In conclusion, I quote Mr. Richard C. Carrier:\n \n \"First, abortion is a notable benefit to society. The harm to a society that is caused by an excess of unchecked population growth is severe and well-documented. The ability of societies to check population growth without legalizing abortion has proven nearly non-existent: there are few countries in which abortion is outlawed or stigmatized that are not suffering harshly from overcrowding, with all the attendant economic, criminal, or political troubles. In contrast, most nations that allow the procedure are maintaining stable populations with nearly zero growth, and exhibiting more or less general prosperity. From a purely pragmatic perspective aimed at the interests of the commonwealth, abortion is at best a great benefit to mankind and at worst a necessary evil. And for women who regard zero growth as a moral imperative, abortion can even be a moral necessity from their point of view--although this would be better called a matter of principle, so as to distinguish this personal belief from the morally universal.\n \n Second, abortion is a significant benefit for the individual woman. The risks of death or permanent disability certainly must be greater for a woman who carries a fetus to term and bears a child, prematurely or not, than for a woman who aborts before the third trimester of her pregnancy. And the social and economic ruin that can ensue from an untimely motherhood is a serious harm as well, and although this could be alleviated by recourse to adoption, free medical care for pregnant women, and public welfare for women unable to work as a consequence of their pregnancy, these solutions are not as simple as they sound, and are not so universally available as people might think (even the United States, among the wealthiest of nations, has no such welfare system in place, not to mention a very poor excuse for a medicare system, and there is no desirable option for orphans in nations like India or Chad). Moreover, the potential physical harm from bearing a child simply cannot be alleviated. Abortion thus supplies some benefit for many women.\n \n \n An act that causes no involuntary harm and produces some benefits for individuals and society in general should never be outlawed. This is based on the principle that laws should only exist to preserve and protect the liberty of individuals and, when no liberty is at stake either way, to increase the general welfare of all citizens. Whether that principle is misinformed remains to be seen. But from the above analysis, there appears no way in which outlawing abortion would even indirectly preserve or protect the liberty of any individual, or provide any general benefit to the citizen body without uneccessarily depriving individuals of their liberty.\"",

You can't have one without the other. Better to swallow that and go on, rather than trying to convince yourself otherwise. If you really believe in your cause, they you shouldn't be taking a statement like \"anti-lifer\" in a negative way to begin with.\n \n \nThe way I see it, the medical requirement for death is when there is no brain activity. Therefore, the medical requirement for life would be when there IS brain activity (around the third trimester or so if I recall correctly).\n\n \n Brain activity as defined how? Certainly there is brain activity much earlier than the the 3rd trimester in terms of involuntary control of things like heart rate and synapses firing. My preferred way to think of it is viability outside the womb. At what point are premature babies viable? To me that's when the line should be drawn; What you call a fetus is in fact a premature baby.\n \n \nHowever, your movement IS trying to take away that choice from the woman to have an abortion, hence anti-choice being accurate.\n\n \n Just as your movement is for destroying unborn life in some situations. Still fits--it's IS 'anti-life.'\n \n \nOh, and, even if your definition was correct (which I have proven it is not), it would still be inaccurate, as we are not making people have abortions, merely making sure they have a choice.\n\n \n Well you're certainly making it to where a lot of unborn babies will have to die rather than even factoring their viability and potential life ahead into the equation..",

Unwanted children are 10X more likely to become criminals.\n \n 6)And embryo does not have a 100% possiblilty of growing into a human being. 20% of pregnancies end in a miscarrige.\n \n 7)Birth control is not 100% effective. As I have said before, my friend's mom had her sister on the pill. Even though this makes up a small percentage of abortion, it still makes up some percentage, which is reason enough.\n \n 8)Being forced to carry through and unwanted pregnancy can have devastating effects on a women, namely financially and emotionally.\n \n \n \n\n \n Here is another perspective for the prolife argument, from feministsforlife.org: \"Feminists for Life of America recognizes that abortion is a reflection that our society has failed to meet the needs of women.\" Also, \"[We] believe no woman should be forced to choose between pursuing her education and career plans and ...her child\".\n \n I absolutely agree with these tenants, however I find it mildly ironic that a feminist organization wants to tell me what to do with my uterus.

At least I assume that when I hear the term \"a human\" and I know that this is a very common assumption - as demonstrated by the frequent disputes about the use of this term. Therefore, the term \"a human\" automatically generates a certain amount of sympathy because of these unofficial conotations of mental existence that are added to the definition. \n \n Steeeeve: I know you might feel justified in using the term \"a human\" and trying to force pro-choice people to admit to discriminating against humans since you stand firm on the official definition. However, you have to admit that it is somewhat disingenuous of you to ignore the fact that this term has many unofficial conotations attached to it that do not apply to a zygote or embryo - mental existence being one of them.

Since there exists this difference between common use and official definition, wouldn't it be better for you as well to find some term that you and Steeeeve (and other pro-life proponents) could agree on?",

I suppose it could mean \"has mental existence\" though just like the word \"baby\" can mean newborn or a fetus.\n\n Yes, for cummunication to work, we do have to use the same meaning for words. However, we have to be very careful in using a word such as \"a human\" since it carries so much extra emotional baggage that is not part of its dry, official, scientific definition. If the official definition does not match the common use definition, then there is an obvious problem with that word that causes it to be so useless in discussions on the abortion topic. \n \n I can assure you that there are very many people who do not view a zygote or early embryo as \"a human\" unless you educate them on the official definition. I was surprised when I first recently read that official definition of \"a human\" since I always had equated the term \"a human\" with \"a person\". I am obviously far from being alone in this view. Even if people were all informed of the official definition of \"a human\", it would be very difficult to just drop the connotations that go along with the term \"a human\" - we are not robots that can automatically change definitions.

A person: the extraordinary humans who explored Antarctica. \n \n These include: http://www.answers.com/topic/human-1, http://www.bartleby.com/61/78/H0317800.html (from the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language), etc. Most on-line dictionaries defined human (noun) as human being, which doesn't help.

   "I can assure you that there are very many people who do not view a zygote or early embryo as \"a human\" unless you educate them on the official definition. I was surprised when I first recently read that official definition of \"a human\" since I always had equated the term \"a human\" with \"a person\". I am obviously far from being alone in this view. Even if people were all informed of the official definition of \"a human\", it would be very difficult to just drop the connotations that go along with the term \"a human\" - we are not robots that can automatically change definitions. If your purpose is communication and not distortion then use a term that we can all agree on that carries no unofficial unrelated emotional baggage.\n Well what others carry as emotional baggage is of no concern to me. We have a dictionary and those that choose to use it will have the upper hand in a debate. \n \n Oddly enough, the word \"person\" also doesn't have to presuppose a mental existence. Person is often used (and thus is the first definition) as an informal way to say human being.\n \n \nWhen you say a sentence \"I discriminate against certain humans\" that means one thing to you and another thing to many other people - there is miscommunication going on and I think you know this.

   "Not in the fact that they both have mental existance while a zygote and foetus do not.\n ok? and?\n \n \nSo, by the definition you seem to be going by, according to your responses, of a foetus being made of living human cells and thus it is a human, I'm pointing out that all of my organs are made of living human cells, so they should be considered human according to what you seem to be expressing. \n \n well of the above are considered human..but I said a human or \"human being\".

Furthermore, I don't use development a standard classifying what is or isn't human. \n \n \n\n Oh, and I'm not going to bother to continue arguing semantics, as another_opinion said, it's a waste of time to argue over dictionary definitions as there are \"official\" (also changeable) definitions and every-day definitions. It is the everyday that really matters when addressing people. I think that in the years to come, that \"official\" definition that you seem to hold so dear (which is in fact quite vague) will become much better defined. Here's an essay I found relating to that definition: http://home.att.net/~star_child/essay7.html\n \n I found it quite fascinating, and if things continue as they are with artificial intelligence, that definition might change sooner than you like. I'm not supplying it as any sort of \"proof\" or anything, but it really interested me.\nI don't hold on to the definition other than to use it in a proper fashion. Words are always changing meaning (take the word \"gay\" for example) and I will use the most current form of the word.

(This is as opposed to discrimination against people based on their actions - ex. crimes - being permissible, as well as discrimination against people based on their inability to control their actions - ex. limiting the rights of children - being permissible.). Discrimination against human life forms with no mental existence is irrelevant to my moral stance of empathy and \"do unto others\" since there is no \"somebody\" there with which to empathize and no \"other\" who I would be treating as myself.",

   "Steeeeve, dislexia, Shooterandproud, and ShadowPikachu:\n The four of you seem to be engaged in yet another unresolveable battle of semantics - in this case about the definition of the term \"a human\". The trouble is that there are really TWO definitions of the term \"a human\" - the official definition and the common-use definition.\n \n One can legitimately argue, as Steeeeve does, that the official definition of a human as a \"member of the species homo sapien\" would only require a complete set of human DNA and the beginning of the growth process - so a zygote would then qualify under the official definition.\n \n However, nearly all uses of the term \"a human\" in common discussion are on topics other than abortion, where \"a human\" is discusses as a born human and, at the very least, the assumption is made that the being in question possesses a mental existence. At least I assume that when I hear the term \"a human\" and I know that this is a very common assumption - as demonstrated by the frequent disputes about the use of this term. Therefore, the term \"a human\" automatically generates a certain amount of sympathy because of these unofficial conotations of mental existence that are added to the definition. \n \n Steeeeve: I know you might feel justified in using the term \"a human\" and trying to force pro-choice people to admit to discriminating against humans since you stand firm on the official definition. However, you have to admit that it is somewhat disingenuous of you to ignore the fact that this term has many unofficial conotations attached to it that do not apply to a zygote or embryo - mental existence being one of them. Since words, after all, are used for COMMUNICATION, the use of the word \"a human\" in this way is a purposeful distortion of the message. Can't you try to find some term that you can all agree on?\n \n Shooterandproud and ShadowPikachu: Since the official definition of \"a human\" probably does include a zygote, Steeeeve is technically right, but I fully sympathize with you that the term \"a human\" is loaded with meanings that are attached to it due to its common use. Since there exists this difference between common use and official definition, wouldn't it be better for you as well to find some term that you and Steeeeve (and other pro-life proponents) could agree on?\n\n \n Thanks, but to clear some things up, I am not disputing the scientific status of the embryo. The debate is whether or not it possesses intelligence. If it does, then it deserves rights just like any other human. If it doesn't, then it doesn't deserve rights. We are trying to establish whether its a being or not, because if it is not a being or \"person\", as in possessing intelligence, then there is no reason why it should overpower a being who does.",

For one, it is hard to be a member of something when you are dead. Secondly, the definition is what it is. Are you proposing that we just each find our own definition for every word and go with it? If the answer is yes then I must admit that I don't understand your post as I have not learned the ancient ShadowPikachu language.\n \n \nIf you look at the second and third listings in the definition another_opinion was talking about, you can see it clearly implies mental existence. Just because one definition is at the top doesn't mean it is more commonly used, it just means they had to write them out in a list. A foetus cannot be worthy of life as it does not mentally (and in many other ways) live.\nMy cat mentally lives...she must be a human :)\n \n Anyway, they don't imply mental existence. There is no way to assume mental existence is a requirement out of any of those. This one fails due to fallacy.\n \n \nDiscrimination against a life form that is made of human cells yet is without mental existence does not provide a sense of empathy, and that is why you try to get us to give the appearance of a mental existence, which I for one will never do.\nhaha, I never claimed to give the appearance of mental existence. I clearly admit that it does not exist for the embryo and most of the life of the fetus. I just happen to think that mental existence doesn't matter.",

   " You shouldn't worry about other people that read our back and forth conversation :p They will miss context no matter what as they don't read the entire conversation normally.\n\n I am concerned how others read our discussion because of the nature of forums themselves. I myself will occasionally read other people's discussions in a wide range of topics in this forum to get a feel for the arguements presented on both sides, even if I don't participate in those discussions. It helps when those debaters have the general readers in mind as well when they have these discussions. Similarly, I also try to keep the general reader in mind when I have debates with you and others. These are not private messages or e-mails, these are forum debates which are, by their nature, public.\n \nActually I just find it funny that people can't admit to discriminating...we all do it including me. The fact that some don't admit to it is amusing and brings up questions about whether they feel it is wrong or not deep inside. \n\n We all discriminate in one way or another to varying degrees but the word \"discriminate\" carries a negative conotation so we admit to it carefully and when it is truly applicable. Do I discriminate against a shirt because I choose to throw it away? Do I discriminate against an egg or sperm when I choose to use contraception? I would say that, in both those situations, \"discrimination\" is not an accurate word to use since, as Shooterandproud noted, the definition of \"discriminate\" is \"To make distinctions on the basis of class or category without regard to individual merit; show preference or prejudice: was accused of discriminating against women; discriminated in favor of his cronies\". \"Individual merit\" as I understand it refers to mentally existing beings, not to objects - a shirt doesn't have a high individual merit by being well-made. You can discriminate against mentally existing beings (that can have individual merit). It is irrelevant to talk about \"discrimination\" against objects since objects cannot have such individual merit, in my understanding. \n \n But here, we would be launching into semantics again. Bottom line is that pro-choice supporters don't want to give the wrong impression in what they say because of your insistence on using a specific word definition. Ask them if they discriminate against criminals, and I am sure most would say yes because that is an accurate statement. They just don't want to make inacurate statements.\n \n I believe we can discriminate based on sex...probably very rarely race. Men and Women are different and that requires discrimination sometimes. Take the draft for example or just simply segregation of bathrooms. Race would be a hard one but if you support affirmative action you are for discrimination.\n \n\n Discrimination usually involves keeping individuals of a specific group away from something they want because of irrational reasons. If women started clamering to get drafted, then the draft laws might need to be re-examined. I have often been surprised why men don't complain more about women not being draftable. Anyway, the issue of discrimination comes up when there is a differential treatment of a group that is resented by that group. We do treat various groups in various ways but, where laws are concerned, we generally try to give rather good reasons for different treatment - not arbitrary ones based on incorrect steriotypes.\n \nThis is off topic but if you had the same approach (treat others as you wish to be treated) then if you would not want to be aborted then wouldn't it be logical to treat others the same way?\n\n Morality has to be self-consistent. I would not have wanted to be aborted, but (in applying that general rule) that would mean that each pregnancy would have to be forced to term - that is a balance where I would favor freedom of body. I would not have wanted to have my conception stopped with contraception, but that would mean that I would have a general law forcing no contraception - I choose freedom of using contraception. There are many things that came together to facilitate my coming into being, I am glad that they happened but I cannot EXPECT that they HAD TO happen. \n \nWell, I still don't get the mental existence thing...it isn't unique to humans and it certainly leaves things open for picking a different point of development for obtaining rights.\n\n Yes, it isn't unique to humans and I, personally, support some level of animal rights. I openly acknowledge that I discriminate in favor of humans over animals - I am biased toward my own species. I do not have full logical reasons why a severally mentally deteriorated human should be treated better than a highly mentally developed ape, but I haven't had to defend these choices yet, so I let the illogic stand for now.",

Unwanted children are 10X more likely to become criminals.\n \n 6)And embryo does not have a 100% possiblilty of growing into a human being. 20% of pregnancies end in a miscarrige.\n \n 7)Birth control is not 100% effective. As I have said before, my friend's mom had her sister on the pill. Even though this makes up a small percentage of abortion, it still makes up some percentage, which is reason enough.\n \n 8)Being forced to carry through and unwanted pregnancy can have devastating effects on a women, namely financially and emotionally.\n \n\n \n It's very nice how you have enumertated your own pro-choice points so eloquently and elaborately yet put words into the mouths of the pro-life movement. Of course, you have not put forth the pro-life words so eloquently or elaborately. Of course, you seek to reduce our reasons to some implied childish motivation to get \"brownie points\" with God. \"But unless you become like a child you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.\" Matthew 18:3, \"I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.\" Matthew 11:25\n \n But let's address your points specifically:\n \n \n1)This is a woman's body, not yours, not mine, and certainly not the governments.\n\n Freedom is not the ultimate good of this world. Your freedom revolves only about the mother. You fail to acknowledge that there is a truth existent outside of the realm of a mother's freedom of body yet intimately related to her freedom. Your freedom operates without recognition of this truth. Outside of your freedom there is an objective truth. You neglect the truth that there is another being in the womb, a being with inherent value and dignity. This truth must be considered in all acts of freedom. \n \n Abortion is not an act of freedom but an abuse of freedom. We can put it into the context of many other abuses of personal freedom. Freedom cannot exist without truth. \n \n \n2)An embryo can not make a decision, but a mother knows her circumstances best, therefore she should choose for the both.\n\n The mother (and often the father) obviously have to choose for both herself and her child. The question remains, though, what is a right, good choice? What is a legitimate, just choice? What is a choice that considers the full well-being of mother and child? Is the violent choice of abortion a beneficial choice in a civilized society?\n \n \n3)An Embryo is not a sentient life form, and does not posses self awareness or consciousness, or to quote Another Opinion: \"Mentally exist\". \n\n Lack of mental awareness or self-awareness is not a justification for killing these beings.\n \n \n4)The only thing an embryo and humans have in common is a strand of DNA.\n\n I think the comparison and contrast is more stark. \n \n \n5)Abortion has some positive effects on society, as in the book Freakonomics by um... forgot the guy, Steve something, the author cites that the legalization of abortions caused a rapid decrease in crime, which makes sense if you think about it. Unwanted children are 10X more likely to become criminals.\n\n Abortion has positive effects on society? Many evils may appear to have good effects. What good does gang violence bring about? It eliminates another individual who might commit crime, it decreases the population so there is less scarcity of resources, etc. We cannot commit evil to do good.\n Abortion has \"positive\" effects so let's eliminate these beings and not give them a chance at living the American Dream. There are a lot of others we can eliminate to decrease crime. \n \n Why not address the real problem, the treatment and rearing of children, instead of getting rid of the children. Why not address the idea that moral actions (or immoral actions--crime) are not determined by scarcity of resources. Why not discuss the breakdown of the traditional family (who has had the responsibilitiy of educating and raising these children for thousands of years) and the effect on society resulting from this.\n \n \n6)And embryo does not have a 100% possiblilty of growing into a human being. 20% of pregnancies end in a miscarrige.\n\n 100% of 5 year olds do not make it to be 10 years old, 100% of 20 year olds do not make it to be 30 year olds, 100% of 50 year olds do not make it to be 65 years old. Does this justify killing them?\n \n 20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. So let's kill some more? But abortion and miscarriage are different in kind, not degree. An active action to kill a living human being in the womb is different than a spontaneous abortion due to inability to survive.\n \n \n7)Birth control is not 100% effective. As I have said before, my friend's mom had her sister on the pill. Even though this makes up a small percentage of abortion, it still makes up some percentage, which is reason enough.\n\n I'm not sure what you're saying here. Are you saying that due to birth control's failure, abortion is needed as a safety net? Are are you acknowledging the abortive aspects of artificial contraception?\n \n \n8)Being forced to carry through and unwanted pregnancy can have devastating effects on a women, namely financially and emotionally.\n\n I can think of no more devastating effect than the end of life prematurely, a destruction of one's being and existence. That is what the being in the womb goes through. This is not to mention the devastating effects on women who have undergone abortion.\n \n http://www.silentnomoreawareness.org/",

I'm not surprised that you don't follow the concept of trust a child automatically, by instinct, places in it's mom.\n\n \n I have the instinct to kill anyone that I don't like. Its a human trait that we've learned to control. Does that mean I should kill you because its my instict? I think humans have learned by now that instinct is not always the wisest thing to follow.\n \n \n \n \nYou are assuming what an embryo can or can not feel.

It is not sentient deserving of rights. Where in there is anything about communication?\n \n \n \n \nAre you stating that any being that can not communicate is expendable? I would bet that you would go to extremes to protect a baby seal about to get it's head bashed in by an eskimo hunter to sell it's coat.\n\n \n A baby seal has self awareness, consciousness, and intelligence. Nope, not expendable. It is a valued life form, that does deserve rights.\n \n \n \nRegardless of it's inability to say I want to live. \n By the way, I support hunting. But I do not take killing lightly.\n\n \n I am a hunter too, but animals have feelings. That is why I do not take killing lightly. However, we, as humans, were designed to hunt and kill animals for food. I think hunting is wrong if you are not going to eat the animal, but if you are, then it is OK. Just like foxes hunt rabbits, or snakes hunt mice. We are no different. However, animals have self awareness, consciousness, and... oh brother, do I have to go over this every time? Do you get the point?\n \n \n \n \n \n3. The subject of my topic is children. You are throwing others in as your argument is weak.\n\n \n What do you mean by throwing \"others\" in?

Furthermore, the only thing I said biology proves you wrong on is that a sperm is classified living organism as opposed to a part of. \n \n I also like how I'm the only one with a definition for a human that has any kind of backing.

   "12 weeks was the first time I ever saw my daughter in a scan, so it's basically an example of the time when I felt my baby was developed, as I could see her kicking her legs, etc. Obviously you can give or take a few weeks development from that but I basically wanted to have the abortion as soon as possible for both the humanity of the foetus and for my own mental health, as I would have found it a lot more difficult at that stage, having already gone through a pregnancy. \n \n There are married couples out there who don't ever want to have kids of their own, I'd still call them a family.\n\n \n \n Looking at your own ultrasound is hardly the way to answer the question of the age at which fetal perception occurs.

The search was performed without date limitations and was current as of June 6, 2005.\n \n Evidence Synthesis \n Pain perception requires conscious recognition or awareness of a noxious stimulus. Neither withdrawal reflexes nor hormonal stress responses to invasive procedures prove the existence of fetal pain, because they can be elicited by nonpainful stimuli and occur without conscious cortical processing. Fetal awareness of noxious stimuli requires functional thalamocortical connections. Thalamocortical fibers begin appearing between 23 to 30 weeks' gestational age, while electroencephalography suggests the capacity for functional pain perception in preterm neonates probably does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks. For fetal surgery, women may receive general anesthesia and/or analgesics intended for placental transfer, and parenteral opioids may be administered to the fetus under direct or sonographic visualization. In these circumstances, administration of anesthesia and analgesia serves purposes unrelated to reduction of fetal pain, including inhibition of fetal movement, prevention of fetal hormonal stress responses, and induction of uterine atony.\n \n Conclusions \n Evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester.

Any of the material below, if not otherwise attributed, can be attributed to NRLC Legislative Director Douglas Johnson (Legfederal@aol.com), who prepared this memorandum.\n \n See this here: \n http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/Fetal_Pain/NRLCrebuttalJAMA.html\n \n The following excerpt is from:\n http://abort73.com/HTML/I-A-2a-pain.html\n \n \"Sir Albert Lilley, widely considered the \"Father of Fetology\", and unabashedly pro-life (as anyone with his vast knowledge of fetal development should be) makes some remarkable statements about fetal pain in an interview he conducted for the book The Tiniest Humans.\n \n Question: In the case of an 8- to-10-week fetus, if you apply pressure will it tend to try to get out of the way?\n \n Answer: Normally it would be extremely difficult, apart from putting a foreign instrument or needle into the uterus to apply pressure, but with a fetus at that maturity you have a very small fetus in a larger capsule of fluid. However, as the famous work of Dr. Davenport Hooker shows, in his many thousands of feet of film, babies at this maturity are responsive to touch.\n \n The fetus also responds violently to painful stimuli-needle puncture and injection of cold or of hypertonic solutions- stimuli which you and I find painful, children will tell you are painful, and the neonate, to judge from his responses, finds painful.\n ---\n I have been told by advocates of abortion that we have no proof that the fetus actually feels pain. Strictly, they are quite correct. Pain is a peculiarly personal and subjective experience and there is no biochemical or physiological test we can do to tell that anyone is in pain - a phenomenon which makes it very easy to bear other people's pain stoically, which is an important point for obstetricians to remember. By the same token we lack any proof that animals feel pain. However, to judge from their responses, it seems charitable to assume they do. Were this not so there would be no point in having an organization like the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and I for one would be unhappy to think we would withhold from the human fetus a charitable consideration we were prepared to extend to animals.\n \n Question: The question, then, of pain felt by the fetus - it is your personal opinion, I gather from what you say in your paper, that in effect the fetus does feel pain?\n \n Answer: I can only say that the fetus responds violently to stimuli that you and I would find painful. Bertrand Russell once remarked that a fisherman had told him that fish had neither sense or sensation, but how he knew that the fisherman would not tell him.\"\n \n The following excerpt is from:\n http://www.theinterim.com/2000/nov/21fetalpain.html\n \n \n \"Dr. Glover's research in the area of fetal pain is hardly groundbreaking. Sir Albert W. Liley, the pre-eminent fetologist from New Zealand, had no doubt, on the basis of objective evidence, that the fetus has a capacity to feel pain. In 1963, Dr. Liley, the founder of fetology, developed the first surgical technique for administering intrauterine blood transfusions to the fetus. According to Liley, the fetus feels pain as early as three months. In offering instructions for carrying out the surgical technique of fetal blood transfusions, he advised his colleagues to take into serious consideration this fact of fetal pain. During the actual surgical procedure, the child must be sedated and given pain-relieving medication. Dr. Margaret Liley, wife and assistant to her husband, and a distinguished fetologist and pediatrician in her own right, remarks in her well-known book, Modern Motherhood: \n When doctors first began invading the sanctuary of the womb, they did not know that the unborn baby would react to pain in the same fashion as a child would. But they soon learned that he would. By no means a 'vegetable' as he has so often been pictured, the unborn knows perfectly well when he has been hurt, and he will protest it just as violently as would a baby in a crib. \n \n In referring to aborting a 12-week-old fetus by dilatation and curettage, (in which the neck of the womb is dilated and the fetus removed in pieces after the womb has been scraped by a sharp instrument called a curette), Dr. Eugene Diamond stated in 1971: \"When this procedure is done, there is little doubt that the fetus, in fact, feels what is done to it.\" In a comprehensive treatment of fetal pain, published in 1985 in the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. K. Annand, a Harvard physiologist, stated that the fetus first perceives pain as early as 12 weeks. \n \n In a May 1975 piece in Atlantic, Willard Gaylin and Marc Lappe argue for fetal experimentation, which they contend is far less traumatic for the unborn than certain forms of abortion. If society allows a child in the womb to be subjected to \"unimaginable acts of violence,\" they write, such as \"dismemberment, salt-induced osmotic shock, or surgical extirpation,\" how can it balk at fetal experimentation, most forms of which are incomparably more benign. \n \n Fetal pain, of course, is a matter of fact, not ideology. Science, of course, should be based on fact, not political correctness. We live in a Therapeutic Culture in which popping pills has become a national pastime. We are only too sensitive about pain, inconvenience, and possibly offending someone. Yet our own ultra-sensitivity to pain does not, in general, extend to the unborn. Are we inconsistent in our war against pain? Is there a blatant contradiction that runs through the very heart of our Therapeutic Culture? \n \n The answer to this apparent dilemma lies in the fact that there are different levels of pain. Pain exists on a spiritual as well as on a physical level. Of the two, as many psychologists and psychiatrists have averred, the spiritual kind is more difficult to bear. The difference between the two is akin to the difference between pain and suffering. The suffering in one's soul that can arise from humiliation, guilt, despair, and terror, are formidable. An athlete would rather risk breaking his neck driving for a fly ball than feel the humiliation of being called a wimp. A soldier would rather risk injury and even death, than suffer the shame of dishonor. A Christian would rather mortify himself than experience the disgrace that comes with mortal sin. Defeat, dishonor, disgrace, as a rule, are far more devastating than physical pain. \n There is a pain that goes with being egregiously wrong (shame) or being recklessly immoral (disgrace) or being purposely obtuse (humiliation) that is more acute than physical pain. Our Therapeutic Culture is not inconsistent. Those who promote abortion want to spare themselves the pain that goes with suffering shame, disgrace, and humiliation. Because of that, they are willing to deny the pain that the aborted baby feels. To acknowledge what abortion really means is too painful for them. They would rather retreat into the presumed security of their comforting ideology. \n \n Pain and birth go together in a mysterious way, like death and life, fall and redemption. The birth of a child or the rebirth of an adult requires a certain amount of pain. Birth and redemption both demand pain. Abortion was instituted in an attempt to avoid pain. But it has magnified the very thing it had sought to reduce. We are drowning in a sea of tranquilizers while we increase our suffering. We thought we could eliminate physical suffering, but brought about spiritual torment. The abortion issue, like an ellipse, has two foci: one is the birth of the child (which is accompanied by pain); the other, the rebirth of the pro-abortionist (which is accompanied by suffering). Part of the painful truth about the abortion issue is that it includes both the unborn and the unrepentant.\" \n Dr. DeMarco is a professor of philosophy\n at St. Jerome's University in Waterloo, Ont.",
