Bush unveiled a (to me, at least) entirely new facial movement, and it was a trimphant debut, since the movement/tic/signal was repeated more than a dozen times. \n \n This seems to be a lightearted remark, not meant to inspire any deep thoughts. But many of Shearer's readers find a darker truth behind this minor observation. And this is where it gets strange.\n \n Here's a sampling of their comments, which were apparently meant to be taken seriously:\n \n Many have noticed Bush's tics before- this is a new one to me, but it definitely looks like a facial tic. Now the cause of the tics could be many: some have surmised mild tourette syndrome ... or his prior cocaine abuse. I'm no neurologist, but I'd guess a combination of both.\n \n Maybe he did some of his old cocaine and was just grinding his jaw like mad.\n \n Yes, I was so distracted by Bush's jaw moving down & to the left, every time there was a pause in his speech! Seems to me that during one of the Kerry debates, that Bush was drooling from the edge of his lip also. At that time, a doctor who watched the debate, said it was some ? condition, & the doctor seemed very concerned there was something medically wrong with him & the White House was keeping it from the public. He also mentioned possibility of a particular medication he (Bush) might be on....& it had something to do with all those years of alcohol/drugs?? \n\n Michael Prescott's Blog: It's just weird",

Party!!!emoticon_xhoho\n\n It would appear that members of the Palin family party:\n \nOn December 13, a Wasilla homeowner discovered that the home they had for sale, but were no longer living in, had been broken into and vandalized.\n \n The lock had been forced, five wooden doors had been so badly damaged they needed to be replaced, the walls and floors had been gouged with knives, and vodka and orange juice containers were strewn all over the house. It also appeared that sexual activity had taken place on some of the beds, and a computer, some winter gear, and clothing had all been stolen.\n \n Calculations are that the home suffered between twenty to thirty thousand dollars in damage. Sources say it appeared the teens stayed in the house for several hours, perhaps even overnight.\n \n The Troopers were quickly notified and the investigation began. And at first there were very few leads.\n \n Then in January some information came to light which identified one of the perpetrators. This led to the revelation that the participants were 12 local teens who had used the empty house for a party, a party which had clearly spun badly out of control.\n \n As you have undoubtedly surmised by now one of the teenagers identified was Willow Palin.\n\n The Immoral Minority: The Law, the Willow, and the Wicked Witch of Wasilla.",
