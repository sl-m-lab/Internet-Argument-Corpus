It brings together twenty groups whose members self-identify variously as rationalist, humanist, ex-Muslim, skeptic, atheist, secular, and freethinker.\n \n Small local groups like the Seattle Atheists began organizing members to donate blood, contribute to homeless shelters, and even wrap Christmas packages to raise money for a regional children's hospital.\n \n Just a few Example of Good Atheist people doing good things. Unlike religious people Atheists don't flaunt their good deeds to make sure they get credit for doing good. An Atheist might feed a homeless person and then send them on their way. A religious person will feed a homeless person and then go tell everyone of his good deed, so that \"God\" can write it down in his book of good deeds. \" GOD\" forbid you do something good and not get credit for it< I mean you may need that good deed to make up for some unrepentant sin you forgot about . \n \n Religion promotes Delusion..

Outside the obvious fact that religious people make up over 3/4 of the population, atheism simply has no answer to churches. Religion is at its core about groups of people gathering together, whereas atheism is very much an individual thing.\n \n Also, the whole Arthur C. Brooks survey thing (what you posted was in a book called 'Who Really Cares') isn't proof of anything. Surveys, especially ones like this (involving a small percentage of the population and involving self reporting), are not a very good way to make your point. I've heard it said that you can just about prove any point you want to prove through the use of surveys, and this seems no different. \n \n From wiki:\n \n \nWho Really Cares was widely reviewed and critiqued. Many commentators thought that Brooks played up the role of religion too much, arguing that a charity gap is largely erased when religious giving is not considered. Jim Lindgren writes, \"Although the liberal v. conservative split is the hook for the book, the data are not nearly as stark as the hype surrounding the book might indicate.\"[5] In February 2007, after the release of Who Really Cares, Brooks briefed President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush on his findings.[6] Later that year, Brooks joined the American Enterprise Institute as a visiting scholar.\n \n Another common objection to Brooks' claims is that his entire position is based on self-reporting. Strictly speaking, the surveys that Brooks cites do not show that conservatives give more to charity than liberals; they show that conservatives report giving more money to charity than liberals report. This is an important distinction; for Brooks' conclusions to be valid, it must be demonstrated that both parties accurately report their charitable giving. Pollsters have found in the past that people often over-report their participation in activities considered desirable. For example, various polling organizations have consistently found that about 40% of the American public claims to go to church weekly.[7] When pollsters measured the number of Americans who actually go to church every week, however, they found that only 20% of the public actually attends church on a weekly basis.[8] Along similar lines, it is possible that individuals over-report donations to charity. However, the implications of this possibility are unclear, given that both liberals and conservatives may engage in over-reporting of charitable donations.\n \n \n Arthur C. Brooks - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n The emphasis was my own, to point out the obvious fact that people who go to church weekly also would be subject to giving/tithing weekly. Also, the article you linked showed that even believer who didn't go to church were lumped in with actual non believers, and the group studied was less than 18k people.",

I would have to have omniscience in order to prove something doesn't exist. What Christians don't know , or refuse to acknowledge is that omniscience is not needed in order to prove that a thing whose nature is a self- contradiction cannot, and therefore does not exist.

These properties are completely incompatible and cannot be held simultaneously by the same object. Therefore I know that cubic Spheres cannot, and do not exist. \n The Christian Bible is so contradictory even the various religions that use the same basic Bible cannot agree on who God is. God himself is self contradictory to his own nature. An all powerful God who either cannot or refuses to end world hunger. An all knowing God who doesn't seem to know anything. A merciful God who will send you to burn for eternity. A perfect creator who created imperfection for his own selfish, jealous desire to see his creation suffer. \n No reasonable and freethinking individual can accept the existence of a being whose nature is so contradictory as that of \"GOD\" the \"perfect\" creator of our imperfect universe.

The results are the results, regardless of motivation. I also wonder where you're getting the idea that this study includes giving to help the church itself--that's called tithing, after all.\n\n \n \n \n Here is a random comment I found from some article about the Arthur C. Brooks study that does a good job explaining why it's not proof of anything:\n \n \nI question the validity of the study for several reasons...\n \n 1) This is the opinion of one professor based on one study. The research hasn't been replicated by any other researchers.\n \n 2) I looked for the scientific method used in this study. Real researchers will publish definitions of their terms-- for example whether Mr. Brooks counted tithing to a church as \"charitible giving\" is unclear. It is possible that there is a valid scientific description of the research that Mr. Brooks doesn, but it certainly doesn't seem to be available.\n \n 3) This contradicts other reasearch. You would think from this puff piece that People in the Bible Belt would be the most generous (since they are more religious).\n \n The Center on Wealth and Philanthropy numbers say that the North East, and particularly New England is the most charitible region. These number are on taxable contributions and are measured by percentage of income.\n \n 4) It is clear that Brooks had the opinion that Religious people were more charitble BEFORE he started this research. A quick Google search reveals his position and that he has been writing about the superiority of religious people to non-religious people for some time.\n \n There is the at least possibility that he was looking for research that merely validated his previous beliefs.\n \n \n I have an open mind, and I would love to see any link to his scientific method-- particularly what techniques he used to make sure that his findings were objective (i.e. not tainted by his personal bias). There are ways to do this and any good scientist will make these available.\n \n But I think there is good reason to be skeptical.\n \n \n URL: Conservatives Are More Generous Than Liberals\n\n \n About the tithing, that seems to be one of the biggest complaints about his study. You have to remember this was a survey, and people reported what they themselves gave... As the comment I posted above shows, it's hard to find any real details about his study, but I found a couple articles where he is discussing the study/book, and specifically mentions tithing:\n \n Who Gives More: Democrats or Republicans? - Live Discussions - The Chronicle of Philanthropy- Connecting the nonprofit world with news, jobs, and ideas\n \n The Culture of Charity\n \n Again, these don't specifically state that tithing was counted, but to discuss tithing in interviews about a study of this nature seems to give that impression. This is important because many would argue that tithing isn't really charity, since it goes to pay preacher/teacher wages, building costs and upgrades, etc.\n \n The motivation also DOES have some bearing. Churches are in public, and they pass around the collection plates... there is significant pressure to give in a church environment.\n \n \nYour other concern--that it throws out all the believers who don't go to church every week actually helps the numbers for atheist giving--after all it leaves out the giving of a whole other subset of Christians. But if it makes you feel better, I certainly have no problem calling to study A Comparison of Church-going Christians versus Atheists. The results are not exactly a glowing endorsement of atheism, either way. \n\n \n You're looking at it through your rose colored glasses of course. Only a very small percentage of Americans consider themselves atheists (less than 5% I think), while the percentage of people in the 'atheist' (as you call it) category was 26% of the study. Therefore, the majority of the people included in the group that gave less money would have been non-church going believers. How do you know that these non-church going believers aren't dragging down the numbers of the actual atheists? You don't! This isn't an article that pits the religious against the atheists, it pits the church goers against the non-church goers, and a lot of those people are self described Christians (I've read that around half of self-described Christians don't attend church regularly). \n \n I mean seriously, can you not see why this study is biased? It is taking the 'cream of the crop' as far as religious people goes (the people who attend and likely tithe/give weekly), and pitting them against a mix of religious non-church goers (and thus, non tithers/weekly givers) and non religious people. \n \n \nFinally--a survey conducted because someone had something they wanted to prove? By that criticism, we'd probably have to throw out any survey that's EVERY been conducted.\n\n \n Throw out? No. Take with a grain of salt?

So if you judge Christianity without taking into account the real good it does do every single day, you show yourself to be a very poor analyst.\n\n \n But you can say the same thing about the bad it does every day with prejudice against other beliefs and the harm done through religious beliefs (condoms in Africa being probably the most notable evil of late). \n \n The problem is that religion has constantly been responsible for bad things. Yes, I accept that it has done good things, but I also see that these good things could come about on their own through compassion without religion. But I can't and shouldn't ignore all the bad things that are done directly because of religious beliefs and interpretations of holy texts. By judging Christianity (or other religions) without taking into account the evils it is responsible for, you are guilty of being a very poor analyst yourself. \n \n \nLike I said, with athiests and non-believers doing Christian works and acts of Christian charity, everyone wins. Including Christianity. emoticon_xgood Welcome on board.\n\n \n Why do Christians feel like they need to take credit for every good deed? There are good, nice, charitable Christians, and there are bad, mean, selfish (self described) Christians. There are good, nice, charitable atheists (or non-Christians in general) and there are bad, mean selfish atheists. \n \n You can play \"No True Scotsman\" until you are blue in the face, but 'good' actions are simply good actions. They aren't 'Christian' anymore than they are Buddhist or Hindu ideas. Every major religion tries to teach people to act morally and in unselfish ways, and there are plenty of similarities between them.",

This is not begging the question. Plenty of non-promiscuous people use condoms... Condoms do not promote promiscuity, they promote safe sex and birth control. Something the people of Africa need desperately. Withholding condoms is obviously not causing these people to stop having sex, they just continue having unsafe sex, spreading AIDs and STDs, and passing it on to newborns. There is no escaping the horrible view of the Vatican being pushed on these people that \"AIDS is bad, condoms are worse.\" \n \n \nThere's a difference between using something to justify evil, and that something being the cause.

But the 'good morals' (the giving, the golden rule, honesty, anti-murder/stealing/adultery, etc.) also predate Christianity and Jewish Law. \n \n Jesus' teachings (as reported by the gospels... especially of Matthew) show that he agreed with the importance and correctness of Jewish law. You act as if the things I have mentioned are mere misinterpretations of the bible, or purposefully twisted passages to fit others' beliefs, but the bible is pretty clear of crime and punishment (especially with blasphemers, homosexuals, and witches). Jesus scolded the Jews about ignoring the law about stoning unruly children. The punishments of Ananias and Sapphira are another example that shows the New Testament wasn't all happiness and forgiveness. \n \n The point is that teachings of the bible can be used as a basis for these deeds, even if the actions aren't entirely original (although the the whole 'land rights' of the Holy Land and the ongoing bloodshed can definitely be blamed on the bible). \n \n \nI think that even in cases of \"secular\" culture doing good, it is culture that has been enormously influenced by Christianity.

You have nothing to back up your claims, as there are plenty of examples of altruism in non-Christian cultures. \n \n Of course there were religious people involved in the Enlightenment, but the Enlightenment did not come from Christian teachings, and was actually pretty hostile to organized religion and the idea of blind faith, and promoted free thinking and reason. It was also largely responsible for the spread of deism and the rejection of the supernatural claims (such as the miracles in the bible). \n \n And how do you possibly give credit for the freedom of speech to Christianity? The bible itself is adamantly against freedom of speech (blasphemy is pretty much the worst sin there is, and is constantly shown to be punishable by death). Jesus himself didn't even approve of freedom of thought! (See the sermon on the mount).\n \n Voltaire, who was adamantly anti-Christian, was one of the main sparks that helped to start the Enlightenment and popularize the idea of freedom of speech (and religion). Before him, the idea of freedom of speech is thought to have originated in Ancient Greece, by no means a Christian nation. It would be easier (and likely more accurate) to assert that the freedoms of today have happened in spite of religion and religious thinking.\n \n That said, I don't underestimate Christianity's influence.

Have you ever compared the earlier laws such as Hammurabi law with that of Judeo-Christian laws and values? There's no comparison--Hammurabi's is barbaric by comparison. But I'll grant you that the OT law was harsher in punishment than the changes Jesus made.\n \n \nJesus' teachings (as reported by the gospels... especially of Matthew) show that he agreed with the importance and correctness of Jewish law. \n\n \n Not in terms of punishment which is where the key difference lies. If that were truly the case he wouldn't have effectively set the adulteress free from those who were going to stone her.\n \n \nJesus scolded the Jews about ignoring the law about stoning unruly children. The punishments of Ananias and Sapphira are another example that shows the New Testament wasn't all happiness and forgiveness.\n\n \n He did that to show they were exhibiting a double-standard.\n The Ananias and Sapphira example was not about any punishment that people should or shouldn't engage in. It was simply an act of God. By your logic of using that example in the context of HUMAN behavior, anytime anyone is killed in a storm, we should assume God is saying it's ok to kill other people. After all, He's a omnipotent God. But that would be very poor logic and as such, Christians don't interpret such acts of God as ascribing a human behavior.\n \n \nWhat about places like Japan?\n\n \n You mean a culture that divinized war ('budo') and was largely a completely totalitarian isolated culture until the arrival of Christianized culture started influencing it? I'm not sure you want to use that example. The far East was considerably less inclined toward individualistic freedoms than the Christian culture on the move in the West.\n \n \nWhat about other non-Christian societies throughout the world (specifically throughout Asia)?\n\n \n Believe me, I've compared many cultures and movements (including secularism in general), and I have yet to find one that stacks up to real Christian teaching. Those comparisons are one of the main reasons I am Christian.\n \n \nOf course there were religious people involved in the Enlightenment, but the Enlightenment did not come from Christian teachings, and was actually pretty hostile to organized religion and the idea of blind faith, and promoted free thinking and reason.\n\n \n That is incorrect, and is an all-too-oft' revisionist view of history. The reality is that most enlightenment scientists were devoutly religious and the most influential social philosophers of the enlightenment were theist in some way. It would be absolutely irresponsible to pretend that their religion didn't influence them greatly in this. Modern revisionism has marginalized many of these people, such as John Locke, and played up the far fewer less-theistic ones like Jefferson. The irony is that even the less theistic ones were in fact pretty tolerant of theism by comparison to the atheistic movement going on today (the likes of Hitchens for instance).\n \n \nAnd how do you possibly give credit for the freedom of speech to Christianity? The bible itself is adamantly against freedom of speech (blasphemy is pretty much the worst sin there is, and is constantly shown to be punishable by death). Jesus himself didn't even approve of freedom of thought! (See the sermon on the mount).\n\n \n I'm not sure what Jesus you've read--the one in the gospels was, himself accused of blasphemy. The principles of Christianity--Christian compassion--naturally lends itself to individual freedom when applied in the way Christ would have. If you don't want to believe me, then don't take my word for it--take ML King Jr., who attributed his religious faith as the basis for his views on several occasions. Or take Desmund Tutu's word for it. Take Mel White's of Soulforce. \n \n Take the word of enlightenment era thinkers like Issac Newton when it comes to science, or Kelvin, or Faraday, or numerous others. No, I'm convinced the enlightenment quite simply wouldn't have happened without Christianity, particularly the Protestant Reformation (which, again, returned much of Christianity to a purer form via sola scriptura)\n \n \nVoltaire, who was adamantly anti-Christian\n\n \n He was much the exception though, in being anti-Christian.\n \n \nBefore him, the idea of freedom of speech is thought to have originated in Ancient Greece, by no means a Christian nation.\n\n \n Don't misunderstand ...

There are preventative measures to protect these people and it is being denied to them! \n \n And \"secularism's take\" on the issue is sex education and responsible sex, which isn't the same thing as promoting promiscuity or even being okay with it. \n \n \nOn this I believe you are simply incorrect. Have you ever compared the earlier laws such as Hammurabi law with that of Judeo-Christian laws and values? There's no comparison--Hammurabi's is barbaric by comparison. But I'll grant you that the OT law was harsher in punishment than the changes Jesus made.\n\n \n I never said that earlier laws were better or any less barbaric. I said that the Bible did not introduce any new moral ideas that weren't already around. Murder, stealing, lying, cheating, and the like were all 'wrong' well before Mosaic Law came to be. \n \n And that being said, Hammurabi's code has a lot in common with Mosaic Law, which was also fairly barbaric (beating slaves was okay, stoning unruly children, animal sacrifices, etc.)\n \n \nNot in terms of punishment which is where the key difference lies. If that were truly the case he wouldn't have effectively set the adulteress free from those who were going to stone her.\n\n \n The story of Jesus and the adulteress is commonly accepted as a later forgery as it is not found in the earliest manuscripts. Even so, the story itself, and the lesson taught, is a silly one that implies that a 'sinner' can't be punished unless the 'punisher' is sinless himself. If this was the case, there would be no punishment for any crime. \n \n Even so, I can point to the verses like Luke 16:17, which show that Jesus agreed with all aspects of the Law (and why shouldn't he, since if he is God, he made the laws himself): \n \n \nAnd it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.\n\n \n \nHe did that to show they were exhibiting a double-standard.\n The Ananias and Sapphira example was not about any punishment that people should or shouldn't engage in. It was simply an act of God. By your logic of using that example in the context of HUMAN behavior, anytime anyone is killed in a storm, we should assume God is saying it's ok to kill other people. After all, He's a omnipotent God. But that would be very poor logic and as such, Christians don't interpret such acts of God as ascribing a human behavior.\n\n \n With the issue of the children being put to death; he was pointing out their hypocrisy, showing that they weren't obeying the law when it wasn't profitable for them to do so. If Jesus didn't agree with the Law in this instance, why would he mention it? He is obviously showing support for the Law. \n \n And that brings up the other question... how could Jesus, if he was indeed the same God who came up with the law, disagree with it?\n \n Which brings up the Ananias and Sapphira point... An act of God is an act of Jesus according to popular Christian doctrine. If Jesus didn't believe in the punishment, why would he do it? I wasn't saying anything like what you alluded to in your storm analogy, I was just showing that not everything changed because of Jesus. There were still harsh punishments dealt out. \n \n \nYou mean a culture that divinized war ('budo') and was largely a completely totalitarian isolated culture until the arrival of Christianized culture started influencing it? I'm not sure you want to use that example. The far East was considerably less inclined toward individualistic freedoms than the Christian culture on the move in the West.\n \n Believe me, I've compared many cultures and movements (including secularism in general), and I have yet to find one that stacks up to real Christian teaching. Those comparisons are one of the main reasons I am Christian.\n\n \n I was talking about how a place like Japan, which has never been a Christian country, is doing just fine on their own (freedoms, morals, etc). If you want to take a blast to the past, it took 1,700 years after Christianity came about before Christian societies started to veer away from their tyrannical ways. \n \n You've basically spread your argument out so that anything and everything positive in society you can attribute to being caused by a Christian influence, which is preposterous and without evidence. \n \n \nThat is incorrect, and is an all-too-oft' revisionist view of history. The reality is that most enlightenment scientists were devoutly religious and the most influential social philosophers of the enlightenment were theist in some way. It would be absolutely irresponsible to pretend that their religion didn't influence them greatly in this. Modern revisionism has marginalized many of these people, such as John Locke, and played up the far fewer less-theistic ones like Jefferson. The irony is that even the less theistic ones were in fact pretty tolerant of theism by comparison to the atheistic movement going on today (the likes of Hitchens for instance).\n\n \n Here is a list of a few of the major figures of the Enlightenment who were either non-religious, non-Christian, or deists: \n \n Jean Le Rond d'Alembert\n Francis Bacon\n Balthasar Bekker\n Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle\n Christian Wolff\n Dositej Obradovi&#263;\n James Burnett\n Gotthold Ephraim Lessing\n Marquis de Condorcet\n Denis Diderot\n Benjamin Franklin\n Edward Gibbon\n Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n Claude Adrien Helv\u00e9tius\n Baron d'Holbach\n David Hume\n Immanuel Kant\n Thomas Jefferson\n Thomas Paine\n Adam Smith\n Baruch Spinoza\n Olympe de Gouges\n Mary Wollstonecraft\n Voltaire\n \n I'm sure you could make arguments against a couple of them, but this was a quick list I compiled. I'm also sure that you could point to the obvious influence of Christianity in the places these people lived, which wouldn't be incorrect. And many people, like Jefferson and Paine for instance, would have agreed with many of the teachings of the New Testament. I would even agree that some of the teachings are good (the Golden Rule, the immorality of cheating, dishonesty, murder, stealing, etc.) This doesn't mean that I get my morals from the bible or Christianity, as I really don't need the bible to tell me that those things are good or bad. \n \n You are also correct that the majority of the deists and non-Christians were tolerant, for they lived in a time of religious intolerance. In those days if you disagreed with the orthodox doctrine, you were in trouble. Since they wanted tolerance of their own beliefs, of course it would make sense of them to promote tolerance for others' beliefs as well. \n \n \nI'm not sure what Jesus you've read--the one in the gospels was, himself accused of blasphemy. The principles of Christianity--Christian compassion--naturally lends itself to individual freedom when applied in the way Christ would have. If you don't want to believe me, then don't take my word for it--take ML King Jr., who attributed his religious faith as the basis for his views on several occasions. Or take Desmund Tutu's word for it. Take Mel White's of Soulforce. \n\n \n Jesus was accused (and killed) for it, but of course in his mind, he believed what he said was true, and therefore not really blasphemy. \n \n I've never asserted that people couldn't be influenced positively by Christianity. I'm saying that giving it credit for all the positive things is silly, and pointing out that there are many people who called themselves Christians who hold completely different views than people like MLK. \n \n You could also argue that the principles of Christianity would lead to a communal type of utopia without materialism and the like, but that hasn't happened. \n \n People naturally see what they want to in the teachings of Christianity. Take slavery for instance... the bible says nothing that would lead a person to believe that the practice is wrong (and was obviously used to support slavery in many cases), but when the ideas of equality and freedom started entering peoples' minds, it became apparent that slavery was wrong, so they used the bible to support that view (with the mindset that an all loving God couldn't support such a barbarous institution). \n \n \nTake the word of enlightenment era thinkers like Issac Newton when it comes to science, or Kelvin, or Faraday, or numerous others. No, I'm convinced the enlightenment quite simply wouldn't have happened without Christianity, particularly the Protestant Reformation (which, again, returned much of Christianity to a purer form via sola scriptura)\n\n \n The enlightenment probably wouldn't have needed to occur if religion hadn't have existed (at least the philosophical part... a huge part of the enlightenment was the idea that the Church has too much power). \n \n \n \n \nHe was much the exception though, in being anti-Christian.\n\n \n Christians with the \"enlightened\" views were also in the vast minority among themselves. Most Christians of the time did not share the philosophy of religious freedom or skepticism and reason (and the other views of the enlightenment). \n \n You also can't escape that the Enlightenment promoted skepticism of religion and spread the popularity of deism and the rejection of the supernatural things like miracles.\n \n \nDon't misunderstand ... I've not argued that freedom of speech originated in the human race with Christianity.\n\n \n But if freedom of speech, republicanism, and many other ideas in science and philosophy originated in a pre-Christian, (basically) secular society, then what is your point? If these types of good, moral ideas arose elsewhere, and there are plenty of modern, morally acceptable, secular or non-Christian nations, how do you justify giving credit to Christian influence for all these things? I was showing that Christianity was not at all necessary for these ideas and freedoms to evolve or be practiced, which is undeniably true.",

   "If we did a good act merely from the love of God and a belief that it is pleasing to Him, whence arises the morality of the Atheist? It is idle to say, as some do, that no such thing exists. We have the same evidence of the fact as of most of those we act on, to wit: their own affirmations, and their reasonings in support of them. I have observed, indeed, generally, that while in Protestant countries the defections from the Platonic Christianity of the priests is to Deism, in Catholic countries they are to Atheism. Diderot, D'Alembert, D'Holbach, Condorcet, are known to have been among the most virtuous of men.

   "It's idiotic to suggest that rules such as \"Do not kill\" and \"Do not steal\" were unknown before the advent of Christianity. \n \n The human species would not have survived and thrived to the extent it did for the tens of thousands of years that pre-date Moses and even written history, if man had not developed--either by reason, instinct, or a combination of the two--a realization that killing, stealing, etc., even if occasionally beneficial in the short run, were detrimental in the long to the survival and well-being of both himself and his community, and were therefore to be discouraged as \"wrong.\" \n \n The idea that people, pre-Moses, went around killing and stealing pell-mell without any notion that these were not good things to do, is imbecilic in the extreme.\n \n Also, note in the Jefferson quote, the emphasis on the apparently prevalent (at the time) notion that people only did good from \"the love of God.\"\n \n These days--at least on this forum--the emphases seem entirely to be on behaving \"morally\" out of the fear of God. In other words, people do good because an Invisible Man is holding a metaphorical gun to their heads, and our fearfully obeying \"or else\" somehow makes us more admirable and \"moral\" than would doing good out from an intelligence, reason, and an innate compassion for one's fellow man.\n \n It's frighening to contemplate that a possible reason the most fervent of those who hang on to this contradictory, literalist (when it suits them), non-loving form of Christianity so fervently and in denial of all reason, is some sort of unconscious fear of horrible things they might feel compelled to do if their all-powerful, threatening Man In The Sky was proven not to exist, meaning that all \"morality\"--as they define it--would promptly disappear in a puff of logic.",

That has nothing to do with defending anyone's faith. But don't be surprised when someone points it out the inconsistency.\n \n \nThe cause of STDs is sex. Plain and simple. You are completely missing the point. Condoms ARE the issue here. It makes no difference if promiscuity is the reason people contract AIDS. \n\n \n Um, no. If sex just magically caused STDs, then no one could even get married and be monogamous. The SPREAD of STDs is caused by promiscuity. The point I'm making is that its an oversimplification to just blithely use this issue as an example of church not acting morally. It's much more complicated than that. If the church is acting immorally by avoiding the issue of condoms, then secularists too are acting immorally by avoiding the more basic issue of promiscuity.\n \n \nDenying condoms to people in a society where over 6% of the population have AIDS and saying they should just stop having sex (which has always been an ineffective method)\n\n \n ???? Not having sex is, by its very nature, automatically effective. If it's \"ineffective\", it's because someone hasn't done that. They HAVEN'T avoided sex. Besides, what you mean by \"deny\" condoms, anyway? People are free to use condoms in terms of personal freedom--the Church doesn't make those rules. They take religious stances on things. \n \n \nAnd \"secularism's take\" on the issue is sex education and responsible sex, which isn't the same thing as promoting promiscuity or even being okay with it.\n\n \n Really?? I have never seen any movement outside religion that makes an issue to discourage and condemn promiscuity. If you can show such, I'd love to see it. So if it's not okay with it, it sure doesn't indicate such.\n \n \nAnd that being said, Hammurabi's code has a lot in common with Mosaic Law, which was also fairly barbaric (beating slaves was okay, stoning unruly children, animal sacrifices, etc.)\n\n \n No, there is really not that much in common at all.\n Here is a sample of the Hammurabi code: Code of Hammurabi - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n It is much more eye-for-eye, or worse.

He was, again, demonstrating the hypocrisy of her punishers, and showing that in terms of God's law, all people would be guilty since all sin and fall short of the glory of God, therefore in Christ there is forgiveness. What tends to set elevate Christian culture, IMO, is this grasp of broader, positive principle. It's not just about crime and punishment. Does Hammurabi's law use a forgiveness principle? I don't think so.\n \n \nWith the issue of the children being put to death; he was pointing out their hypocrisy, showing that they weren't obeying the law when it wasn't profitable for them to do so.

Clearly, the answer is yes. An omnipotent God can do pretty much what he wants to.\n \n \nWhich brings up the Ananias and Sapphira point... An act of God is an act of Jesus according to popular Christian doctrine. If Jesus didn't believe in the punishment, why would he do it?\n\n \n Maybe he did. You're ignoring my point though that such doesn't speak to whether or not He prescribes that as actions for PEOPLE to take. \n \n \nI was talking about how a place like Japan, which has never been a Christian country, is doing just fine on their own\n\n \n They are now, at least as the 20th century went on. This is consistent with the transforming effect of the influence of exposure to Christian culture.\n \n \nIf you want to take a blast to the past, it took 1,700 years after Christianity came about before Christian societies started to veer away from their tyrannical ways.\n\n \n It depends on what reign you're referring to. Elizabeth I was a protestant Christian monarch, but most don't think of her as a tyrant. What is telling is that most of the ones that people DO think of as tyrants tended to not be very true to Christian teachings. Henry the 8th, for instance, who had a penchant for killing wives and ignoring the Church's insistence that he stop doing that. \n At any rate, it isn't very hard to see that tyrannical actions are not in keeping with Jesus' teachings, even if such kings and queens called themselves \"Christian\".\n \n \nYou've basically spread your argument out so that anything and everything positive in society you can attribute to being caused by a Christian influence, which is preposterous and without evidence.\n \n \n Not quite; I'd say it would be more accurate to call positives Christian. Not necessarily \"caused\" by Christianity.\n \n \nI'm also sure that you could point to the obvious influence of Christianity in the places these people lived, which wouldn't be incorrect. And many people, like Jefferson and Paine for instance, would have agreed with many of the teachings of the New Testament. \n\n \n As you sort of point yourself, it would have been pretty much impossible for any of these people to operate in a way that was independent of Christianity's influence, even if they didn't self-describe as Christian. You say you don't get your morals from Christianity, but I suspect you in fact do so a lot more than you think, due to the undercurrents in culture influencing your upbringing.\n \n \nPeople naturally see what they want to in the teachings of Christianity. Take slavery for instance... the bible says nothing that would lead a person to believe that the practice is wrong\n\n \n I don't agree. It doesn't have to directly reference it's wrongness for one to infer from Jesus' principles of love and putting others first that slavery would be wrong.\n \n \nChristians with the \"enlightened\" views were also in the vast minority among themselves. Most Christians of the time did not share the philosophy of religious freedom or skepticism and reason (and the other views of the enlightenment).\n\n \n Where do you get this idea from? The whole reason the protestant reformation happened was due to these issues. Clearly, many did hold to these ideas.\n \n \nYou also can't escape that the Enlightenment promoted skepticism of religion and spread the popularity of deism and the rejection of the supernatural things like miracles.\n\n \n It's true that Jesus' teachings of love toward one's fellow human beings mean people have to be free to decide against religion if they want, and make up their minds. But I'm not sure that proves anything for you.\n \n \nBut if freedom of speech, republicanism, and many other ideas in science and philosophy originated in a pre-Christian, (basically) secular society, then what is your point?\n \n \n Well, freedom of speech, at it's simplest, just means someone can say what they want. Was there really a pre-Judeo/Christian culture where full freedom of speech existed? I doubt it. It was probably a damning thing in any culture to speak out against the king, for instance. What you call 'secular' society (really one with individual freedoms due to Christian influence) probably didn't exist back then at all.",

Much is required from those to whom much is given, and much more is required from those to whom much more is given.\" (Luke 12:47-48 NLT)\n \n And Slavery was excepted throughout the new Testament as well as the old. Not only did Jesus condone it, he never once spoke out against it. \n \n Here's a couple of scriptures from the New Testament.. Can't deny Slavery was a Christian practice until they decided on their own it was Immoral. Defending their Slave trading God and his Slave beating son isn't helping the Christian Cause.\n \n  Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear. Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ. (Ephesians 6:5 NLT)\n \n Christians who are slaves should give their masters full respect so that the name of God and his teaching will not be shamed. If your master is a Christian, that is no excuse for being disrespectful. You should work all the harder because you are helping another believer by your efforts.

But don't be surprised when someone points it out the inconsistency.\n\n \n I'm not even sure what you want from me. I've said I don't support it, and that's all I need to do. I don't need to go and interject myself into every conversation that I don't agree with... that said, whether I am consistent or not doesn't matter. You are dodging the whole issue of you being guilty of these generalizations. Just because 'other people do it' doesn't make it an acceptable tactic. \n \n \nUm, no. If sex just magically caused STDs, then no one could even get married and be monogamous. The SPREAD of STDs is caused by promiscuity.

If the church is acting immorally by avoiding the issue of condoms, then secularists too are acting immorally by avoiding the more basic issue of promiscuity.\n\n \n Sex does cause the spread of STDs. I don't buy into the idea that sex is immoral outside of marriage, and I don't buy into the definition of promiscuity being applied to all sex outside of marriage (which is what you seem to imply here). Can you explain how responsible sex between two unmarried people (like a boyfriend and girlfriend who know each other and are using the necessary means to prevent unwanted pregnancy)? In the example of Africa and the Catholic Church, even people in committed relationships can't use condoms because of the church. People with an STD apparently can't ever safely have sex because of this. \n \n \n \n???? Not having sex is, by its very nature, automatically effective. If it's \"ineffective\", it's because someone hasn't done that. They HAVEN'T avoided sex. Besides, what you mean by \"deny\" condoms, anyway? People are free to use condoms in terms of personal freedom--the Church doesn't make those rules. They take religious stances on things. \n \n\n \n Obviously abstinence is effective; I was referring to abstinence only education being ineffective. Many studies support this. As far as 'denying' condoms, that was a poor word choice on my part, but I was referring to the effects of the church's ban, which besides attaching the stigma to contraceptives, has also decreased the availability of condoms and sex education in some of those countries (things have changed a bit in recent years).\n \n \nReally?? I have never seen any movement outside religion that makes an issue to discourage and condemn promiscuity. If you can show such, I'd love to see it. So if it's not okay with it, it sure doesn't indicate such.\n\n \n It may not specifically tell people to wait until marriage, but it certainly doesn't promote sleeping around. I've had a sex ed class, and they promote being responsible, not only about the use of contraceptives, but about being careful about choosing your partners (actually knowing them as opposed to having sex with strangers). Even if a school does promote abstinence, what sense would it make to deprive students of sex education to go along with it, or to not make condoms available in the likely case that students will have sex anyway? \n \n \nNo, there is really not that much in common at all.\n Here is a sample of the Hammurabi code: Code of Hammurabi - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n It is much more eye-for-eye, or worse. The Judeo-Christian law was based on a love for God. \n\n \n I never said they were identical, but they are similar, and the Mosaic Law was most certainly harsh in punishments (in the examples you gave from the wiki page, there are several punishments that are the same as in Mosaic Law), and Mosaic Law very much had an 'eye for an eye' mentality. I would also say that the Mosaic Law was much more about fear of God than love of God (death penalty for desecrating the Sabbath, blasphemy, idolatry, etc.)\n \n \nYou're begging the question again.\n\n \n How so? I was just saying that this particular story, the only one ever used to support the argument that Jesus was anti-Mosaic Law, is a likely forgery. I didn't use this as an assumption to dismiss your claim (which is why I then said \"even so,...\" I was simply letting you know that you were using a controversial passage. \n \n \nPlease tell me you have a little more insight into the point Jesus was making than that. He was, again, demonstrating the hypocrisy of her punishers, and showing that in terms of God's law, all people would be guilty since all sin and fall short of the glory of God, therefore in Christ there is forgiveness. What tends to set elevate Christian culture, IMO, is this grasp of broader, positive principle. It's not just about crime and punishment. Does Hammurabi's law use a forgiveness principle? I don't think so.\n\n \n My point still stands. I understand the idea that 'every man sins and falls short of the glory of God,' but this is worthless in terms of law. If only God is worthy of punishing someone, than no man can be punished except through God (which would be terribly inefficient). The story itself can be seen more as a parable to show the point of 'being saved' through Jesus, but in terms of its relation to Jewish Law, I fail to see it as a convincing argument against it. Jesus was simply being pressured/tempted/harassed by the Jews in this situation, and he gave them a verbal middle finger. \n \n Did Mosaic Law use a forgiveness principle? No! You paid the punishment for your crime, and often something or someone had to be killed and sacrificed. We're talking about the law here, the crime and punishment, not the idea of eternal life and forgiveness, which of course wouldn't be involved in a normal set of laws. \n \n \nWow, are you really saying you think Jesus believed children should be put to death? \n\n \n See, this quote here goes to prove my entire point. The bible specifically says that unruly children should be stoned. It specifically has many instances of children being killed either by order of God (Jesus)or by God (Jesus) himself (Israelites invading the other countries, the deaths of the first born children in Egypt, Elisha and the bears, etc.). \n \n Your morality is better than that, though. You know that killing children is wrong (much as you understand that slavery is wrong), so you are forced to think that Jesus would never approve of something like this. You, using your own reasoning, read past the scripture to have it agree with your own beliefs. \n \n It's the same thing that many Christians do with the un-scriptural doctrine of the 'age of accountability' where a child is basically not in danger of hell until he reaches a critical age where he understands right and wrong. It's never mentioned in the bible, and in fact, a passage (in Psalms or Proverbs, I don't remember which) which states that even children are known by their actions would seem to contradict that view. However, people use their own reasoning to justify this... it just can't be possible that God would be so callous as to send a child to hell, so there must be an age of accountability.\n \n But to answer your question, if Jesus was in fact God, then of course he agreed that children should be put to death when they were disobedient. He was the one who came up with the law! \n \n \nI think the more accurate question is, can the one who came up with the law decide to change the focus of it, or change it, period? Clearly, the answer is yes. An omnipotent God can do pretty much what he wants to.\n\n \n Clearly then, he would not be perfect or omniscient, as a perfect, omniscient being would have gotten it right the first time. I still find it odd that Jesus never mentioned that the law changed, and in fact stated on multiple occasions that the law would remain intact. \n \n \nMaybe he did. You're ignoring my point though that such doesn't speak to whether or not He prescribes that as actions for PEOPLE to take. \n\n \n Maybe not, but since the law that this very same God wrote approves of similar punishments, I would think so. \n \n \nThey are now, at least as the 20th century went on. This is consistent with the transforming effect of the influence of exposure to Christian culture.\n\n \n Do you have any evidence that it was Christian culture that influenced this? Christian societies in the not so distant past were often cruel themselves... it seems as if something else started to drive this transformation around 300 or so years ago (I would say it was reason and free thinking, which are not Christian principles). \n \n \nIt depends on what reign you're referring to. Elizabeth I was a protestant Christian monarch, but most don't think of her as a tyrant. What is telling is that most of the ones that people DO think of as tyrants tended to not be very true to Christian teachings. Henry the 8th, for instance, who had a penchant for killing wives and ignoring the Church's insistence that he stop doing that. \n \n At any rate, it isn't very hard to see that tyrannical actions are not in keeping with Jesus' teachings, even if such kings and queens called themselves \"Christian\".\n\n \n You are again playing the \"No true Scotsman\" game. The Bible, even the New Testament talks about the divine rights of kings; that kings get their authority from God himself. \n \n This is getting annoying, though. You are simply excusing evildoers by saying they weren't really Christians, and ignoring non-Christian 'good'-doers as being influenced by Christians. You have again argued yourself into a position that can't be attacked or supported by evidence. It does make me wonder how this \"Christian influence\" became so widespread if it was apparently so dependent on the righteousness of the individual rulers of each country. And why did it take so darn long for these Christian ruled countries to introduce freedom and ideas like democracy and republicanism?\n \n \nNot quite; I'd say it would be more accurate to call positives Christian. Not necessarily \"caused\" by Christianity.\n\n \n See? This isn't supportable, and it's getting you nowhere. Of course if you define Christianity as \"all good deeds,\" then that's that. But what point is there? You could do the same thing for literally any religion or ideology. \n \n \nAs you sort of point yourself, it would have been pretty much impossible for any of these people to operate in a way that was independent of Christianity's influence, even if they didn't self-describe as Christian. You say you don't get your morals from Christianity, but I suspect you in fact do so a lot more than you think, due to the undercurrents in culture influencing your upbringing.\n\n \n No! I certainly don't! There are some things that any sane person is going to agree with. Being for treating others well, and being against murder, theft, and rape, for example. \n \n But of the teachings of thought crimes, women being subservient to men, treatment of slaves, teaching that this life really doesn't matter, the idea of moral absolutes, that you should always give people whatever they ask of you, that you should always forgive and forget, that you should love your enemies, that you should always turn the other cheek, that you should do things for the glory of God as opposed to doing things for the good of others, the idea that you shouldn't worry about tomorrow or about material things and just to let God take care of you, the idea of plucking our your eye if it offends you as opposed to learning to control your urges and understand them, and the idea of faith as opposed to reason... I think all these things are either wrong, immoral, naive, or some combination of three. \n \n How could anyone honestly say that someone like me, who disagrees with all these Christian teachings (as well as simply not believing any of the supernatural aspects to being with), derives some of their morals from Christianity? The morals that I share with Christianity are also shared by many other religions, many non-Christian ethics, and even pre-Christian non-Jewish cultures. \n \n \n \nI don't agree. It doesn't have to directly reference it's wrongness for one to infer from Jesus' principles of love and putting others first that slavery would be wrong.\n\n \n But the bible itself, even in the New Testament, does directly reference slavery and confirms the slave owners' rights to own, and the slaves' responsibility to serve (even to a cruel master). This is yet another example of using reason to see that something is immoral, and reading past the scripture to align your morals with your religious views. \"God just couldn't possibly think slavery is okay.\" \n \n \n \nWhere do you get this idea from? The whole reason the protestant reformation happened was due to these issues. Clearly, many did hold to these ideas.\n\n \n And how very Christian of them to battle and kill each other over their beliefs... Even today, Catholics make up over half of the Christians in the world (over 1.1 billion of the 2.1 billion total Christians). Obviously at the time of the Reformation, the percentage of Catholics would have been much greater. I wasn't denying that many held those beliefs, but they were undeniably in the minority, and you were using majority/minority rules to try to play down the roles of non-Christians in the Enlightenment.\n \n \nIt's true that Jesus' teachings of love toward one's fellow human beings mean people have to be free to decide against religion if they want, and make up their minds. But I'm not sure that proves anything for you.\n\n \n Jesus was definitely a pretty peaceful guy (outside the whole 'whip in the temple' thing), and did basically let people believe or not in peace. But the seeds of intolerance are there in the teachings.\n \n Matthew 10:12-15\n \n \n12 And when you go into a household, greet it. 13 If the household is worthy, let your peace come upon it. But if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. 14 And whoever will not receive you nor hear your words, when you depart from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet. 15 Assuredly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!\n\n \n This is Jesus talking to the apostles about going into a city to teach. If they believe and accept them, they are blessed, if not, the blessings are taken back... 'let the peace return to you'... they aren't 'worthy'... they'll get their punishment. It's not all that tolerant. To be fair, it's not all that harsh, either. \n \n \nWell, freedom of speech, at it's simplest, just means someone can say what they want. Was there really a pre-Judeo/Christian culture where full freedom of speech existed? I doubt it. It was probably a damning thing in any culture to speak out against the king, for instance. What you call 'secular' society (really one with individual freedoms due to Christian influence) probably didn't exist back then at all.\n\n \n Ancient Greece, long before Christianity, had more freedoms than any Christian countries did for the next 2,000 years. I'm sure you probably have some predetermined definition of \"full freedom\" to try to restrict the idea to something modern, but the Ancient Greeks were far, far ahead of their times with no help from Christianity. And please stop begging the question with phrases like \"really one with individual freedoms due to Christian influence.\" Can you provide any evidence to support these claims? If the freedoms originated without Christianity, and can exist in non-Christian countries, I do not see how you can honestly keep asserting that the freedoms are due to Christianity.",

   "Sex does cause the spread of STDs. I don't buy into the idea that sex is immoral outside of marriage, and I don't buy into the definition of promiscuity being applied to all sex outside of marriage (which is what you seem to imply here). Can you explain how responsible sex between two unmarried people (like a boyfriend and girlfriend who know each other and are using the necessary means to prevent unwanted pregnancy)? \n\n \n The issue is more long-term than that. If a person lives a life of monogamy, then the spread of STDs becomes much less of a problem for that person. A couple who is faithful to each other long-term have the benefit of each of them not running the risk of STDs that are out there. Look, I'm not trying to tell people how to live their life. But clearly, if people are monogamous long-term, they are far better protected. It works, and so religion is right on this one. A committed marriage DOES protect one from STDs.\n \n \nIn the example of Africa and the Catholic Church, even people in committed relationships can't use condoms because of the church. \n\n \n But of course they're much less necessary to prevent STDs in such cases, anyway.\n \n \nIt may not specifically tell people to wait until marriage, but it certainly doesn't promote sleeping around. I've had a sex ed class, and they promote being responsible, not only about the use of contraceptives, but about being careful about choosing your partners (actually knowing them as opposed to having sex with strangers). Even if a school does promote abstinence, what sense would it make to deprive students of sex education to go along with it, or to not make condoms available in the likely case that students will have sex anyway?\n\n \n I think liberals would get a better rap on this if they engaged in anywhere near equal time and attention between condoms and avoiding promiscuity. They are so horrified at the prospect of actually having make a moral prescription toward anyone that they end up focusing pretty much entirely on how people can limit consequences rather than address the root behavior itself. \n \n \nI never said they were identical, but they are similar, and the Mosaic Law was most certainly harsh in punishments (in the examples you gave from the wiki page, there are several punishments that are the same as in Mosaic Law), and Mosaic Law very much had an 'eye for an eye' mentality. I would also say that the Mosaic Law was much more about fear of God than love of God (death penalty for desecrating the Sabbath, blasphemy, idolatry, etc.)\n\n \n True, but that was what Jesus changed. He specifically summed the law up in loving the Lord God, loving others. Critics of the religion need to undertand that Christianity is much less like a law code, and more like a relationship.\n \n \nHow so? I was just saying that this particular story, the only one ever used to support the argument that Jesus was anti-Mosaic Law, is a likely forgery.\n\n \n Many skeptics argue that the whole Bible is a 'forgery' in a sense. It's beside the point. (Not to mention that the reasons skeptics have argued this passage a a forgery is bad logic anyway.)\n \n \nDid Mosaic Law use a forgiveness principle? No! You paid the punishment for your crime, and often something or someone had to be killed and sacrificed. We're talking about the law here, the crime and punishment, not the idea of eternal life and forgiveness, which of course wouldn't be involved in a normal set of laws.\n\n \n Yet Jesus changed that. He DID have a forgiveness principle. This is WHY Christianity came about as an evolution of sorts from Judaism. I don't think you're going to find too many Christians disagreeing that the old law of the OT was different in terms of punishments. That's part of the whole reasoning BEHIND Christianity.\n \n \nYour morality is better than that, though. You know that killing children is wrong (much as you understand that slavery is wrong), so you are forced to think that Jesus would never approve of something like this. You, using your own reasoning, read past the scripture to have it agree with your own beliefs. \n\n \n But my view about Jesus in this incident is also guided by EVIDENCE. There are passages that are very specific showing how he treated children. More importantly, the logic you are employing here can be applied to your own (mis)use by assuming Jesus WOULD be for stoning children. We KNOW how Jesus acted because we have scripture about his life. In order to get the idea that Jesus would stone children, you have to ignore the life of Jesus in scripture. \n \n \nBut to answer your question, if Jesus was in fact God, then of course he agreed that children should be put to death when they were disobedient. He was the one who came up with the law!\n\n \n Again, that idea doesn't take into account the differences between certain times, situation, and context. Jesus clearly came to change some things.\n \n \nClearly then, he would not be perfect or omniscient, as a perfect, omniscient being would have gotten it right the first time. \n\n \n Not if the differences were not a mistake, but rather intentional from the beginning. Only prejudice would cause someone to automatically assume change = fixing a mistake. \n \n \nDo you have any evidence that it was Christian culture that influenced this? Christian societies in the not so distant past were often cruel themselves... it seems as if something else started to drive this transformation around 300 or so years ago (I would say it was reason and free thinking, which are not Christian principles). \n\n \n Yes, but we already covered that--they were cruel in cases where one could clearly see a difference from what Jesus taught. It's not like it's hard to see the contrast between the teaching of 'loving one's enemies' from the actions of being cruel to one's enemies.\n \n The evidence of Christian culture having influence the far east is there because the changes started coming about after they were exposed to it.\n \n \nSee? This isn't supportable, and it's getting you nowhere. Of course if you define Christianity as \"all good deeds,\" then that's that. But what point is there? You could do the same thing for literally any religion or ideology. \n\n \n No, in the case of Christianity, the teachings of the founder of the religion are indeed about good deeds and being kind. It's THERE. Why deny the obvious rather than give credit where credit is due?\n \n \nNo! I certainly don't! There are some things that any sane person is going to agree with. Being for treating others well, and being against murder, theft, and rape, for example. \n\n \n \"Any sane person\" NOW, because of the influences of enlightened Christian culture. It's easy point out those things as the norm because that's the culture you were raised in. \n \n \nBut of the teachings of thought crimes, women being subservient to men, treatment of slaves, teaching that this life really doesn't matter, the idea of moral absolutes, that you should always give people whatever they ask of you, that you should always forgive and forget, that you should love your enemies, that you should always turn the other cheek, that you should do things for the glory of God as opposed to doing things for the good of others, the idea that you shouldn't worry about tomorrow or about material things and just to let God take care of you, the idea of plucking our your eye if it offends you as opposed to learning to control your urges and understand them, and the idea of faith as opposed to reason... I think all these things are either wrong, immoral, naive, or some combination of three. \n\n \n Look, this isn't a discussion, as far as I'm concerned, about every possible Christian view or teaching. To me, the bottom line is that the culture you are in was profoundly influenced by Christianity to the extent it is unavoidable. And that includes its MORAL standards. \n \n \nBut the bible itself, even in the New Testament, does directly reference slavery and confirms the slave owners' rights to own\n\n \n The correct reading of these passages is that they speak of operating in a world where slavery is an unfortunate reality. The NT does not CONDONE slavery. Ant it certainly doesn't help your case that one of the biggest self-described influences in the abolitionist movement was the Bible and their Christian religion.\n \n \nAnd how very Christian of them to battle and kill each other over their beliefs... \n\n \n That won't work. We could as easily argue (more easily so, actually) that they battled and killed each other due to departure from Jesus' teaching.\n \n \nAncient Greece, long before Christianity, had more freedoms than any Christian countries did for the next 2,000 years.\n\n \n Ancient Greece with all its pederasty, it's OWN slavery, etc.? No, I think ancient Greece couldn't hold a candle to Jesus' teachings. Remember, freedom and morality are not synonymous.\n \n That one could argue morality can come about in other cultures is beside the point. In western culture, it DID come about with infusion of Christianity--a religion about forgiveness, love of others, etc. It only makes sense such a widespread adoption of a religion would influence people.",

It's the responsibility of the parents. The parents can't be counted on to teach about sex itself and contraceptives, and that's why we need sex ed. Either way, removing the teaching of condoms is nothing less than stupid. \n \n \nTrue, but that was what Jesus changed. He specifically summed the law up in loving the Lord God, loving others. Critics of the religion need to undertand that Christianity is much less like a law code, and more like a relationship.\n\n \n I don't disagree, but the idea that Jesus got rid of the Mosaic Law or that the morals and punishments were somehow un-Christian is something I do disagree with (not that you've exactly stated this much, but I've heard others who have, and our discussion on punishment were somewhat reminiscent of this view).\n \n \nMany skeptics argue that the whole Bible is a 'forgery' in a sense. It's beside the point. (Not to mention that the reasons skeptics have argued this passage a a forgery is bad logic anyway.)\n\n \n By forgery, it is meant that a passage or story was a later addition to the original by someone other than the author (or a book that is written by someone who claims to be someone else). The Book of John most definitely is a later book (compared to the original gospels) and is obviously a lot different than the Synoptic Gospels, but in and of itself it isn't a forgery. I don't see how the logic is faulty as to why that particular passage is questionable, however. From the wiki page:\n \n \nDuring the 16th Century, Western European scholars - both Catholic and Protestant - sought to recover the most correct Greek text of the New Testament, rather than relying on the Vulgate Latin translation. At this time, it was noticed that a number of early manuscripts containing John's Gospel lacked John 7:53-8:11 inclusive; and also that some manuscripts containing the verses marked them with critical signs, usually a lemniscus or asterisk. It was also noted that, in the lectionary of the Greek church, the set gospel reading for Pentecost runs from John 7:37 to 8:12, but skips over the twelve verses of this pericope.\n\n \n Jesus and the woman taken in adultery - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \nYet Jesus changed that. He DID have a forgiveness principle. This is WHY Christianity came about as an evolution of sorts from Judaism. I don't think you're going to find too many Christians disagreeing that the old law of the OT was different in terms of punishments. That's part of the whole reasoning BEHIND Christianity.\n\n \n Well the 'forgiveness clause' is basically an offshoot of the Old Law, though. It's just that your 'sacrifice' has already been made. As for Christians disagreeing, it really doesn't matter. Christians usually can't even agree among themselves when it comes to doctrine. The early churches had different views. Guys like Paul believed that the Old Law was to be completely discarded, whereas other groups of early Christians (ex-Jews) continued to obey the Jewish Law (mostly in regard to things like Sabbath and circumcision). Throughout history (up until relatively recently) you will still find that a lot of Christian countries still used many of the same punishments from the Old Testament (death penalty for things like adultery, witchcraft, blasphemy, etc.) Of course, I'm sure these weren't \"true\" Christians, so I guess it doesn't matter.\n \n \nBut my view about Jesus in this incident is also guided by EVIDENCE. There are passages that are very specific showing how he treated children. More importantly, the logic you are employing here can be applied to your own (mis)use by assuming Jesus WOULD be for stoning children. We KNOW how Jesus acted because we have scripture about his life. In order to get the idea that Jesus would stone children, you have to ignore the life of Jesus in scripture. \n\n \n But if Jesus is God, we also have a whole bible discussing HIS actions, and showing that he wrote the laws in the first place! That's the whole point. And I don't really remember any instances of Jesus dealing with unruly children, especially his own children (and the Law called for the parents to do the stoning, so it's not like Jesus would have ever had to have done this). The only mention (that I remember offhand, correct me if I'm wrong) Jesus makes of unruly children is when he is calling the Jews out for ignoring the law. \n \n \nAgain, that idea doesn't take into account the differences between certain times, situation, and context. Jesus clearly came to change some things.\n\n \n Yes, according to Scripture he came to fulfill 'prophecies' and become a sacrifice that allowed Gentiles and Jews alike to find salvation. In that sense, he did come to change a great deal of things; it had nothing to do with crime and punishment, however, and Jesus himself said as much.\n \n \nNot if the differences were not a mistake, but rather intentional from the beginning. Only prejudice would cause someone to automatically assume change = fixing a mistake. \n\n \n Like YHWH repenting for ever making man, then getting talked out of destroying mankind by Noah and only partly doing a do-over with the flood, only to see things go straight back to hell in a handbasket? The Bible is full of God's mistakes. Only blind faith could keep a person from seeing this.\n \n \nYes, but we already covered that--they were cruel in cases where one could clearly see a difference from what Jesus taught. It's not like it's hard to see the contrast between the teaching of 'loving one's enemies' from the actions of being cruel to one's enemies.\n \n The evidence of Christian culture having influence the far east is there because the changes started coming about after they were exposed to it.\n\n \n What is hard is trying to find any major Christian group throughout history that has lived and ruled by these principles that you call \"Christian.\" \n \n You also gave no evidence for your claims yet again; correlation does not equal causation. And again, \"Christian\" culture took 1,700 years after being exposed to Christian teaching before it started to become \"Christian\" (meaning free, democratic, less cruel, etc). \n \n I'm not buying your arguments at all. It's not much different than a communist apologist who would say that all the failures of communism were because of people not being true to communism.\n \n \n \nNo, in the case of Christianity, the teachings of the founder of the religion are indeed about good deeds and being kind. It's THERE. Why deny the obvious rather than give credit where credit is due?\n\n \n Because Jesus' teachings did not cover everything. They weren't specific in regards to the Old Law, slavery, punishment for crimes, ruling nations, or many other issues. Many issues were also up for interpretation. Listen, loving your neighbors and enemies is all fine and dandy up to a point, but even Jesus got angry, built a whip, and kicked arse from time to time. \n \n \n\"Any sane person\" NOW, because of the influences of enlightened Christian culture. It's easy point out those things as the norm because that's the culture you were raised in. \n\n \n OTHER NON-CHRISTIAN AND PRE CHRISTIAN CULTURES ALSO HAD LAWS AGAINST THEFT, RAPE, MURDER, ETC! These are undeniably bad, and have been for a LOOOONG time... well before the spread of any Christian culture. If any culture didn't follow these basic morals, they would destroy themselves.\n \n \nLook, this isn't a discussion, as far as I'm concerned, about every possible Christian view or teaching. To me, the bottom line is that the culture you are in was profoundly influenced by Christianity to the extent it is unavoidable. And that includes its MORAL standards. \n\n \n It isn't a discussion because I proved you wrong. Murder, rape, the golden rule, etc. are all ideas that originated before Christianity in many other parts of the world. If I agree with those things (which any sane person does, Christian or not, exposed to influence or not), but disagree with so many of the distinctly Christian teachings, then your premise that my morals are based off of Jesus is complete bunk.\n \n \nThe correct reading of these passages is that they speak of operating in a world where slavery is an unfortunate reality. The NT does not CONDONE slavery. Ant it certainly doesn't help your case that one of the biggest self-described influences in the abolitionist movement was the Bible and their Christian religion.\n\n \n Paul returning an escaped slave doesn't condone slavery? Telling slaves to obey cruel masters doesn't condone it? Never once condemning this very common institution and using holy books (the Torah) which specifically condone the selling and beating of slaves doesn't condone it? Abolitionists were both Christian and secular (Thomas Paine is one prominent example). Slave owners also used scripture to promote their views... The abolitionists using Christianity to support their views just furthers my point that when a person's own morality exceeds that of the bible, they are forced to conflate these ideas and try to make the text fit the obvious truths. \n \n \nThat won't work. We could as easily argue (more easily so, actually) that they battled and killed each other due to departure from Jesus' teaching.\n\n \n How is that better!???? A departure of the scripture, i.e. a difference of beliefs, is a good reason for slaughtering each other? Is that Christian?\n \n \nAncient Greece with all its pederasty, it's OWN slavery, etc.? No, I think ancient Greece couldn't hold a candle to Jesus' teachings. Remember, freedom and morality are not synonymous.\n\n \n But we were talking about freedoms, and it is undeniable that many of these ideas originated in ancient Greece. I never said they were a perfect culture, there wasn't a perfect culture 2500 years ago. But at the same time as this was going on, the Jews were owning slaves, practicing polygamy, owning concubines, and doing various other things. I understand that slavery was seen in a different light thousands (even hundreds) of years ago. They were humans, however, and they were discovering philosophy and morals on their own. My point in bringing up slavery is that if there WAS a God who regulated morality (as opposed to people learning and discovering things as they went) and who gave complex and long lists of specific laws, and he DIDN'T mention slavery as being wrong, then he is not a moral God at all.\n \n \nThat one could argue morality can come about in other cultures is beside the point. In western culture, it DID come about with infusion of Christianity--a religion about forgiveness, love of others, etc. It only makes sense such a widespread adoption of a religion would influence people.\n\n \n And it makes no difference that Christians eventually came around to what we see now as modern morals. So did many other religious groups. It's not as if Christianity immediately changed the way people treated eachother... it took 1,700 years!",

   "So does abstinence for life, castration, or being responsible in choosing your partners and having safe sex. \n\n \n Wow, you're comparing a committed marriage to castration? Geez. It's not like I'm not pointing out something reasonable as helping STDs. You're using unreasonable things to argue by analogy against the reasonable.\n \n \nHow so? In a population where over 6% of people have HIV, many people won't know that they have it. If a person you are marrying has HIV and you don't know it, you are SOL.\n\n \n Because monogamy = one partner; promiscuity = more. This really isn't rocket science.\n \n \nTeaching morals isn't the responsibility of a school.\n\n \n Teaching about the most obvious way to avoid STDs isn't morality, it's public safety. Liberals don't like it emphasized since it also happens to BE a moral teaching. The point is that its the height of hypocrisy to complain that the church won't address condoms when secularism avoids monogamy and only takes an approach to STDs to involves trying to avoid consequences rather than the root of the problem.\n \n \nWell the 'forgiveness clause' is basically an offshoot of the Old Law, though. It's just that your 'sacrifice' has already been made. \n\n \n Then by your own admission, the OT law and Christianity are related in a good way. It certainly doesn't hurt my case any that the forgiveness principle of Christianity can be traced back into the OT. It can only hurt yours.\n \n \nBut if Jesus is God, we also have a whole bible discussing HIS actions, and showing that he wrote the laws in the first place! That's the whole point.\n \n Like YHWH repenting for ever making man, then getting talked out of destroying mankind by Noah and only partly doing a do-over with the flood, only to see things go straight back to hell in a handbasket? The Bible is full of God's mistakes. Only blind faith could keep a person from seeing this.\n \n\n \n Your whole approach doesn't take into account the creation of humankind with free will. What you allude to as some sort of \"mistake\" is an obvious demand of having creatures capable of making choices. The only way for history to follow the prescription you're demanding to avoid a double-standard on God's part is for us to have been created as automatons. \n \n \nWhat is hard is trying to find any major Christian group throughout history that has lived and ruled by these principles that you call \"Christian.\"\n\n \n Yep, it's a high standard after all. Funny thing is that on one hand secularists argue that what Christ teaches in terms of morals is so non-exclusive, yet then they can't figure out why no one can live up to it. The problem for your view is that no one outside of Christ can live up to it either. For the believer, the idea that humans can't live up to Christ's teachings is completely not a surprise--the scriptures themselves makes it clear the holiness required could only have been achieved by Christ himself. That's actually pretty fundamental to the religion.\n \n \nYou also gave no evidence for your claims yet again; correlation does not equal causation. And again, \"Christian\" culture took 1,700 years after being exposed to Christian teaching before it started to become \"Christian\" (meaning free, democratic, less cruel, etc).\n\n \n To paraphrase Spock: 'Once you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.' There are no better explanations than the influence of Christianity--what is quite possibly the most influential philosophy upon certainly western culture. Since what was earlier was even more barbaric (the Roman empire!) we can pretty much eliminate THAT as the cause of a higher moral culture. Given the huge influence Christianity is to our culture, to pretend Christianity is not the main reason is like raising a child to always give things away, then insisting that upbringing isn't the reason the child grows up to be generous. Yes, it has been a slow process. No, it has not been perfect. Yes, there have been self-professed Christians who did very bad things. But to define the religion that way is to ignore the founder of the religion itself. It's also interesting that you've injected democracy into this discussion. I don't bring that up. \n \n \nBecause Jesus' teachings did not cover everything.\n\n \n True, at least in terms of covering every specific instance that could come up. But that would involve volume after volume of writing, wouldn't it? Being loving toward other people does cover much. It's not hard at all to see that when self-professed Christians did very cruel things, they weren't being 'Christian' in terms of obeying what they founder said. So no, I don't think it lets you off the hook with your argument to be able to point to mean christians in history.\n \n \nIt isn't a discussion because I proved you wrong. Murder, rape, the golden rule, etc. are all ideas that originated before Christianity in many other parts of the world.\n\n \n No, you haven't. \n And the teachings of Jesus are more than the golden rule and avoiding rape and murder. If that's all it was, then you'd be right. Those are examples of nothing more than avoiding external actions. Christ went much farther, which you'd would get if you more carefully read Matthew 5-7.\n \n \n If I agree with those things (which any sane person does&#8230;\n\n \n Really??? Any sane person agrees that a man shouldn't look at a woman lustfully? Any same person agrees that someone shouldn't call a person a 'fool' in his heart? No offense, but I really think you've missed the teachings of Jesus by miles in terms of their significance, and WHY they've so influenced history. it's not because they're just like earlier versions of the ethic of reciprocity--it's rather because they AREN'T like earlier versions.\n \n \nPaul returning an escaped slave doesn't condone slavery?\n\n \n You aren't taking the reality into consideration of the cultural context: if the slave had not been returned, he would have eventually been arrested in the end and very possibly killed anyway. And I think you need to look into the ultimate end of the story of Onesimus before you pass judgement so easily.\n \n \nTelling slaves to obey cruel masters doesn't condone it?\n\n \n What were they supposed to do in that cultural context, where they would be killed if they didn't?\n \n \nNever once condemning this very common institution and using holy books (the Torah) which specifically condone the selling and beating of slaves doesn't condone it? Abolitionists were both Christian and secular (Thomas Paine is one prominent example). \n\n \n I have no problem acknowledging that slaveowners used scripture, but you're the one arguing the greater burden here by arguing that the Bible is effectively pro-slavery. Jefferson had slaves too. By the standards and logic you're using, we should be condemning just about every founding father of the enlightenment in the same way. But I never hear so-called 'enlightenment' proponents ever as eager to do that as they are to condemn the Bible for being supposedly pro-slavery. The point being that you should be able to understand the concept of having to operate in a cultural context, because you understand later generations had to do that as well. The changing of culture took a long time. Could God have magically made slavery vanish from the face of the earth? I suppose so. Could that have been done and maintain free will (and thereby avoiding humans effectively becoming automatons)? No.\n \n \nMy point in bringing up slavery is that if there WAS a God who regulated morality (as opposed to people learning and discovering things as they went) and who gave complex and long lists of specific laws, and he DIDN'T mention slavery as being wrong, then he is not a moral God at all.\n\n \n Only if you demand God operate in some instant way that denies humanity the ability to make choices.

   "Wow, you're comparing a committed marriage to castration? Geez. It's not like I'm not pointing out something reasonable as helping STDs. You're using unreasonable things to argue by analogy against the reasonable.\n\n \n I was not comparing the two. I was showing that there is more than one way to skin a cat, some more reasonable than others. Responsibility and safe sex being one of the methods. \n \n \nBecause monogamy = one partner; promiscuity = more. This really isn't rocket science.\n\n \n First of all, I don't agree with your definition of promiscuity. Having more than one sexual partner in a lifetime is in no way \"promiscuous\" in and of itself.\n \n From Dictionary.com:\n \n 1. characterized by or involving indiscriminate mingling or association, especially having sexual relations with a number of partners on a casual basis.\n 2. consisting of parts, elements, or individuals of different kinds brought together without order.\n 3. indiscriminate; without discrimination. \n \n Second of all, how are you to be sure that your partner has never had sex? If everyone could be trusted, promiscuity wouldn't be a problem in the first place.\n \n \nTeaching about the most obvious way to avoid STDs isn't morality, it's public safety. Liberals don't like it emphasized since it also happens to BE a moral teaching. The point is that its the height of hypocrisy to complain that the church won't address condoms when secularism avoids monogamy and only takes an approach to STDs to involves trying to avoid consequences rather than the root of the problem.\n \n\n \n Sex education classes teach that STDs are spread by sexual contact. By definition that tells you you won't get them if you don't have sex... and as I've said before, sex ed classes don't promote promiscuity and tell students to be responsible in choosing their partners and taking the necessary precautions. Again, like my \"extreme\" example from above, the safest way would be to stay celebate for life. It's just not realistic. I have no problem with telling students about abstinence, but to not teach them about safe sex practices is counter-productive and irresponsible.\n \n And in the case of sex, if two people can trust each other, have sex, and avoid any unwanted consequences by taking the necessary precautions, what is the problem?\n \n \nThen by your own admission, the OT law and Christianity are related in a good way. It certainly doesn't hurt my case any that the forgiveness principle of Christianity can be traced back into the OT. It can only hurt yours.\n\n \n How does it hurt my case? Forgiveness through the sacrifice of innocent animals (or innocent humans) is not moral in my book, and it still has nothing to do with many of the immoral laws and punishments.\n \n \nYour whole approach doesn't take into account the creation of humankind with free will. What you allude to as some sort of \"mistake\" is an obvious demand of having creatures capable of making choices. The only way for history to follow the prescription you're demanding to avoid a double-standard on God's part is for us to have been created as automatons. \n\n \n So God isn't omniscient? What about all the prophesies, the divine intervention, etc.? All go against the concept of free will (as do plenty of other biblical things, like heaven itself, but that's a different discussion entirely).\n \n \nYep, it's a high standard after all. Funny thing is that on one hand secularists argue that what Christ teaches in terms of morals is so non-exclusive, yet then they can't figure out why no one can live up to it. The problem for your view is that no one outside of Christ can live up to it either.

But to define the religion that way is to ignore the founder of the religion itself. It's also interesting that you've injected democracy into this discussion. I don't bring that up. \n\n \n Your ignoring so many other options. I would say the spread of reason and free thought was largely responsible. Once those ideas became prevalent, culture was quick to change. As I've stated over and over, Christianity was the world's major religion for well over a thousand years before the major modern philosophical changes took place. If Christian culture was truly the cause, I would not expect over a thousand year delay.\n \n \nTrue, at least in terms of covering every specific instance that could come up. But that would involve volume after volume of writing, wouldn't it? Being loving toward other people does cover much. It's not hard at all to see that when self-professed Christians did very cruel things, they weren't being 'Christian' in terms of obeying what they founder said. So no, I don't think it lets you off the hook with your argument to be able to point to mean christians in history.\n\n \n The exact argument could be made for a follower of Confucius or any other moral teacher.\n \n \nNo, you haven't. \n And the teachings of Jesus are more than the golden rule and avoiding rape and murder. If that's all it was, then you'd be right. Those are examples of nothing more than avoiding external actions. Christ went much farther, which you'd would get if you more carefully read Matthew 5-7.\n\n \n I never said that those were the only things Christ taught. You again completely miss my point. I said that those were the only ones that I and a lot of other people (if not most people) believe and follow. The basic teachings (such as murder and rape) are not unique to Christianity or Judaism, and the other teachings are largely ignored by society. If the teachings that everybody agrees with are not unique to Christianity, and the ones that are unique are usually ignored, then you're argument has been defeated (actually, your original premise would be wrong even if I was the only one who didn't believe those morals, but I digress). \n \n I mean, it's obvious you ignored my entire post where I disagreed with point after point from the Sermon on the Mount... I can guarantee you that I've 'carefully' read it multiple times. Many of the main themes (such as don't worry about tomorrow, Matt 6:25 to the end of the chapter) are downright naive and wisely ignored by even the most devout Christians. Bank accounts, homes, education, jobs, fiscal responsibilty... all these things go against Jesus' teachings. \n \n \nReally??? Any sane person agrees that a man shouldn't look at a woman lustfully? Any same person agrees that someone shouldn't call a person a 'fool' in his heart? No offense, but I really think you've missed the teachings of Jesus by miles in terms of their significance, and WHY they've so influenced history. it's not because they're just like earlier versions of the ethic of reciprocity--it's rather because they AREN'T like earlier versions.\n\n \n Have you even read my posts? I DO NOT agree with those morals! That was the point I was making in the last post that you ignored; that these morals are not part of the general society. The 'sane' person believes in the basic things like being anti murder/rape. I don't think I could have been much more clear, but my entire argument has apparently flown over your head. \n \n \nYou aren't taking the reality into consideration of the cultural context: if the slave had not been returned, he would have eventually been arrested in the end and very possibly killed anyway. And I think you need to look into the ultimate end of the story of Onesimus before you pass judgement so easily.\n\n \n Who is to say that he would have been arrested? Would that have been a good enough reason to return escaped slaves in America in the 1800s? I think not. The 'end of the story' isn't very clear anyway. Philemon is a letter from Paul, and it says nothing of what actually happened to Philemon and Onesimus other than Onesimus converting to Christianity. Even if everything worked out beautifully, I don't buy that the end always justifies the means. \n \n \nWhat were they supposed to do in that cultural context, where they would be killed if they didn't?\n\n \n Hide them and care for them? At the very least they could have forbade Christians from owning slaves or in some way mentioned the immorality of it.\n \n \nI have no problem acknowledging that slaveowners used scripture, but you're the one arguing the greater burden here by arguing that the Bible is effectively pro-slavery.

And owning slaves should be condemned, even if it was by otherwise great men. The difference in the issue of biblical condemnation versus that of 18th century thinkers is, however, that the thinkers were men, who are imperfect. The Bible and the laws therein supposedly come from a higher power, who is supposed to have perfect morals. You can't see the difference here?\n \n You're argument about free will is extremely weak. Outlawing slavery would have no more destroyed free will than outlawing murder, rape, or any of the other laws. I'm not asking for divine intervention, or slavery never taking place, I'm asking for a mere hint of anti-slavery in the biblical moral code. How does a law or discouraging a practice violate free will?\n \n -------\n \n I know you didn't address every point I made (which is fine, since things were getting a little out of hand, length-wise), but I have to bring this back up since it is such a perfect point of hypocrisy. \n \n Referring to the Protestant Reformation:\n \n \nPosted by me\nOriginally Posted by jyoshu View Post\n That won't work. We could as easily argue (more easily so, actually) that they battled and killed each other due to departure from Jesus' teaching.\n\n How is that better!????

Having more than one sexual partner in a lifetime is in no way \"promiscuous\" in and of itself\n\n \n Fair enough, that's your prerogative. I don't think most people out there would agree with you though. People generally aim towards monogamous relationships as the ideal. And that's a good thing. There are reasons that most marriage vows include the words \"till death do us part.\" Marriages almost always start with good intentions--we should encourage couples, not merely only try to accommodate them getting out if they want or empowering them to be have other partners.\n \n \nSecond of all, how are you to be sure that your partner has never had sex? If everyone could be trusted, promiscuity wouldn't be a problem in the first place.\n\n \n You can't, but that is all the more reason to encourage monogamy.\n \n \nAnd in the case of sex, if two people can trust each other, have sex, and avoid any unwanted consequences by taking the necessary precautions, what is the problem?\n\n \n Careful!!--by adding qualifiers such as \"two people\" you are engaging in adding moral standards just like you take issue with religion doing. emoticon_xangel\n At any rate, you basically just described the marriage relationship, at least in terms of the physical component. By \"trust\" I assume you mean trust that neither will sleep around on the other and remain true to their partner?\n \n \nHow does it hurt my case? Forgiveness through the sacrifice of innocent animals (or innocent humans) is not moral in my book, and it still has nothing to do with many of the immoral laws and punishments.\n\n \n That's a gross oversimplification of animal sacrifice in the OT.\n \n \n \nSo God isn't omniscient? What about all the prophesies, the divine intervention, etc.? All go against the concept of free will (as do plenty of other biblical things, like heaven itself, but that's a different discussion entirely).\n\n \n Indeed it is. One that I'm more than happy and confident to engage in if you so choose.\n \n \nThat's not the point (again). I'm showing you your hypocrisy, in that no one can live up to the teachings of Christ, and no major Christian group even came close for hundreds and hundreds of years, yet you're giving all the credit to Christianity for every good deed.\n\n \n Yes, yes, I know what you're TRYING to say. The problem with your argument, again, is that no one else as done as good as the teachings of what Jesus taught.\n If 'reason' says love thy neighbor, and that happens to also be the teachings of Jesus, then for all practical purposes reason IS Christian, and Christian IS reason. You want to ensure the separation, when in fact your are using their similarities to make some point. And in doing so you show they ARE similar.\n \n \nYour ignoring so many other options. I would say the spread of reason and free thought was largely responsible.\n\n \n Which really took off--surprise, surprise--as Christianity spread around the world, and with things like the Bible being translated into vernacular, and being able to be printed. Imagine that. ;) \n \n \nHave you even read my posts? I DO NOT agree with those morals! That was the point I was making in the last post that you ignored; that these morals are not part of the general society. The 'sane' person believes in the basic things like being anti murder/rape. I don't think I could have been much more clear, but my entire argument has apparently flown over your head.\n\n \n Fine, then at least stop debating this as if Jesus' teachings were the same as any other society's in ancient times. They weren't they clearly went above and BEYOND the typical ethic of reciprocity. There's a REASON his teachings became more popular than other philosophies.\n \n \nHide them and care for them? At the very least they could have forbade Christians from owning slaves or in some way mentioned the immorality of it.\n\n \n And they could have mentioned every single sin that would ever be committed by humankind. That would have made for an even much longer book!\n \n \nWhat does Jefferson have to do with it? I said Thomas Paine, who did not own slaves. And owning slaves should be condemned, even if it was by otherwise great men. The difference in the issue of biblical condemnation versus that of 18th century thinkers is, however, that the thinkers were men, who are imperfect. The Bible and the laws therein supposedly come from a higher power, who is supposed to have perfect morals. You can't see the difference here?\n\n \n I've already addressed this. And you keep accusing me of not addressing things???\n The \"perfect morals\" doesn't apply to God any more than it would apply to a parent to have to not watch R-rated movies, or many other rules, just because their kids have to.

People just haven't done a very good job obeying what he said.\n \n \nI know you didn't address every point I made (which is fine, since things were getting a little out of hand, length-wise), but I have to bring this back up since it is such a perfect point of hypocrisy. \n \n So tell me, what happened to loving your enemy?\n\n \n What happened to 'love your enemy' is that those who killed others didn't abide by Jesus' teaching. After all, he taught 'love your enemy.' I'm not sure why you're having such trouble getting this.",

   "I really think everyone here already knows that.\n\n \n Apparently you didn't, since you suggested I was comparing castration to marriage.\n \n \n \nFair enough, that's your prerogative. I don't think most people out there would agree with you though. People generally aim towards monogamous relationships as the ideal. And that's a good thing. There are reasons that most marriage vows include the words \"till death do us part.\" Marriages almost always start with good intentions--we should encourage couples, not merely only try to accommodate them getting out if they want or empowering them to be have other partners.\n\n \n It's the definition of the word! Like it or not, waiting until marriage to have sex, and only having one sexual partner for life is not common at all, and is not even the most common view of sexual morality. Promiscuuity is seen as 'casual sex,' not \"everything outside of marital sex.\" \n \n And yeah, once people get married they generally want to stay together for life, but staying faithful to marriage vows isn't in any way related to our discussion.\n \n \nYou can't, but that is all the more reason to encourage monogamy.\n \n \n \n Careful!!--by adding qualifiers such as \"two people\" you are engaging in adding moral standards just like you take issue with religion doing. emoticon_xangel\n At any rate, you basically just described the marriage relationship, at least in terms of the physical component. By \"trust\" I assume you mean trust that neither will sleep around on the other and remain true to their partner?\n\n \n By 'trust,' I meant being able to trust someone when he/she tells you that he/she doesn't have an STD or is on birth control, etc. (as opposed to one night stands and the like). I'm not describing marriage here at all. \n \n It doesn't help by getting into a committed relationship if you don't know if your partner has an STD or not to begin with.\n \n \nThat's a gross oversimplification of animal sacrifice in the OT.\n\n \n How so? It wasn't actually 'forgiveness' so to speak, but there isn't any way to make animal sacrifice into a moral practice. Killing something innocent for the bad deeds of someone else is repugnant, and for a God who is supposed to be all forgiving and all loving, what was the point of the bloodshed? He could have simply been forgiving from the start without any bloodshed.\n \n \nIndeed it is. One that I'm more than happy and confident to engage in if you so choose.\n\n \n You didn't answer my question about God being omnsiscient. Your claim was that God didn't make mistakes, and that he had to make changes based on man's free will. This implied that God could not know the future, and was therefore not omniscient. \n \n I'd like you to answer that, and I'd be happy to discuss free will, although your stance that God isn't subject to his own laws (and thus not responsible or deplorable for his own evil deeds, like murdering children) could make this a little difficult. \n \n Basically, I'll just start by asking you if you agree with this (and if not, explain what you disagree with): free will is the reason for sin (and that if sin is not an option, free will doesn't exist). I've found that this is the generally accepted view of free will among Christians, and the oft used justification for the existence of sin. Do you agree with this view?\n \n \nYes, yes, I know what you're TRYING to say. The problem with your argument, again, is that no one else as done as good as the teachings of what Jesus taught.\n If 'reason' says love thy neighbor, and that happens to also be the teachings of Jesus, then for all practical purposes reason IS Christian, and Christian IS reason. You want to ensure the separation, when in fact your are using their similarities to make some point. And in doing so you show they ARE similar.\n\n \n Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man. I don't agree that the teachings exclusive to Jesus are superior to others, and I bet most people would agree with me (if you posed to them some of the ideas without mentioning Jesus... by mentioning Jesus I would of course fail, since no believer wants to admit to disagreeing with him). \n \n Your logic in the second part is faulty. Confucius taught the Golden Rule 500 years before Jesus was born. So you could simply be arguing that Jesus' teachings are a result of Confucius' teachings, and that Confucius should get all the credit for every good deed ever done. But beside that point, just because Jesus also taught that idea doesn't mean he is the cause of it. \n \n And your little transitive relation doesn't work, because Christianity is way more than just the Golden Rule. There are a lot of strings attached, and 'reason' does not lead to all the teachings, ideas, and doctrines of Christianity. They are not one in the same, which is why 'reason' in the enlightenment led to a lot of religious skepticism and even the spread of deism and free thought.\n \n \nWhich really took off--surprise, surprise--as Christianity spread around the world, and with things like the Bible being translated into vernacular, and being able to be printed. Imagine that. ;)\n \n \n The printing press had been around for over 200 years and to imply that Christians had been in the dark regarding Jesus' teachings up until the 1700s is a joke. Those teachings had been widespread for a long time. \n \n And don't you think it's odd that an atheist (Francis Bacon) was largely responsible for starting the whole shebang with his invention of the scientific method and his 'Novum Organum'?\n \n \nFine, then at least stop debating this as if Jesus' teachings were the same as any other society's in ancient times. They weren't they clearly went above and BEYOND the typical ethic of reciprocity. There's a REASON his teachings became more popular than other philosophies.\n\n \n And that reason was Constantine the Great. \n \n \nAnd they could have mentioned every single sin that would ever be committed by humankind. That would have made for an even much longer book!\n\n \n We're not talking about every single sin, we're talking about one. One of the largest, most oppressive institutions in the history of humankind... God can find time to regulate bestiality, homosexuality, circumcision, and shellfish, but discouraging slavery just didn't seem that important? And it's not that slavery wasn't mentioned; The law completely regulated slavery, how hard you could beat them, etc. This isn't some slippery slope fallacy here. \n \n \nI've already addressed this. And you keep accusing me of not addressing things???\n The \"perfect morals\" doesn't apply to God any more than it would apply to a parent to have to not watch R-rated movies, or many other rules, just because their kids have to. God is not held to the same standard humankind is. He has the benefit of omniscience, and therefore SETS the rules for humankind. Your approach sounds like the child who's mad because his parents don't have to abide by the same rules he does.\n\n \n I never said that God couldn't have slaves... I mean according to the bible we are all his slaves. But if God is regulating morality and rewarding and punishing based on it, and you (or other Christians) are implying that the bible has the best morality, then regulating slavery instead of discouraging it is unforgivable. Slavery was obviously wrong, and has been a huge deal even back in Old Testament days, yet God still accepts it.\n \n \nAgain, you're pretending my point was something other than what it is. Slavery DID effectively get outlawed eventually with Christian culture--it just took a very long time. It's the immediate-pulling-the-rug-out-from-things that I'm referring to when I say it would circumvent the freewill of humankind.\n\n \n No it didn't get effectively outlawed. The New Testament makes it seem like slavery is fine and dandy as long as you weren't cruel (which is at least an improvement over the Old Testament). \n \n Again, if the Old Testament had originally put \"Thou shalt not own another human being\" into the 10 commandments instead of one of the repetitive 'jealous God' commandments, how would it have circumvented free will at all? How would it have been any different from regulating murder, rape, or dietary laws?\n \n \nAnd I'm telling you that's already covered in the general teaching of Jesus, in the admonitions to love others. There are many, many very specific actions Jesus didn't single out; if He had it would have been rather silly to try and spell with every single sin mankind ever will commit. he summed it up rather nicely. People just haven't done a very good job obeying what he said.\n\n \n So you couldn't love a slave? This just makes it seem like as long as you treated a slave well, it was fine. It doesn't apply to the institution itself at all. \n \n \nWhat happened to 'love your enemy' is that those who killed others didn't abide by Jesus' teaching. After all, he taught 'love your enemy.' I'm not sure why you're having such trouble getting this.\n\n \n I read your other post wrong. You said \"We could as easily argue (more easily so, actually) that they battled and killed each other due to departure from Jesus' teaching,\" which I took to be a justification for the killing since the Catholic Church had strayed from the 'true' Christian teachings. \n \n Regardless of my misunderstanding, you were trying to give Christianity all the credit for the Enlightenment, and pointing toward the good of the Protestant Reformation (which obviously showed that you thought this was Christian in nature), yet that reformation was responsible for a ton of bloodshed, which you then claim was a departure from Christian teachings.\n \n I'm sorry, but all you are doing is picking and choosing. The whole premise that modern freedom and humanity are the result of Christian culture, when no Christian (let alone an entire nation) has even come close to following Christian teachings, is just ridiculous.",

This implied that God could not know the future, and was therefore not omniscient.\n\n \n No, you're not taking into account the idea of God intentionally not usurping free will by deciding not to engage in that. There are two potential possibilities that religious people have worked out over time:\n - God knows the future, but allows bad things to happen due to the preservation of humankind's free will\n - God intentionally allows himself to be limited somewhat to preserve humankind's freewill\n \n You want to call God evil for letting bad things happen. But the reality is that he didn't allow bad things to happen, we'd live in some automotonic existence where there was no true free will. We couldn't really make choices because there would never be a bad choice, and therefore choices wouldn't matter anymore. Somehow, on a philosophical level, bad things are necessary for the human experience in a broad sense. Part of what makes us human is deal with and rising above bad events and consequences. In effect, your arguments are rife with oversimplification. This is a very complex philosophical topic.\n \n \nBasically, I'll just start by asking you if you agree with this (and if not, explain what you disagree with): free will is the reason for sin (and that if sin is not an option, free will doesn't exist).

(the morality YOU said you don't agree with.)\n \n \nThey are not one in the same, which is why 'reason' in the enlightenment led to a lot of religious skepticism and even the spread of deism and free thought.\n\n \n Along with the French revolution (lots of beheadings), two world wars, and various other atrocities. I never meant to imply that sterile \"reason\" in the enlightenment was simply synonymous with Christ's teaching. But clearly the better elements of the enlightenment are more compatible with it. Part of the problem is that people--particularly secularists--tend to throw the term \"reason\" around way too much, as if it's very well defined. What that means to one may not be to another. Secularists sometimes use the term as if it's some alternative to religion, when in fact that's completely unnecessary. There are times religion IS reason, such as the teachings of Christ. But reason is problematic because there's no \"reason-committee\" deciding the standards. The standards of what defines what is reasonably are completely arbitrary, if not existent. \n \n \nThe printing press had been around for over 200 years and to imply that Christians had been in the dark regarding Jesus' teachings up until the 1700s is a joke. Those teachings had been widespread for a long time.\n\n \n No, you missed my point.

But if Bacon was raised in western culture, he was greatly influenced by Christianity even if he didn't realize it. Does that mean Christianity was a direct cause of the scientific method? No, I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is that indirectly because of the Christian culture, Bacon was able to flourish and do these things.\n \n \nAnd that reason was Constantine the Great.\n \n \n That doesn't refute anything I'm saying. Constantine was a follower of Christ, after all.\n \n \nWe're not talking about every single sin, we're talking about one.

God can find time to regulate bestiality, homosexuality, circumcision, and shellfish, but discouraging slavery just didn't seem that important?\n\n \n And when God says to love others, and that he has come to free the captives, those are liberating passages.\n Has it not occurred to you that the Bible was not intended for the purpose of being a manual of social and government reform? Why should the Bible specify slavery specifically when it is about other purposes? Anything it does speak out on is over and above what it certainly needs to do, given its purpose.\n \n I also point out that slavery in the near eastern culture was more similar to servitude. They were in a culture where servitude was necessary. Let me explain with a personal story that was rather eye opening ...\n A few years ago I was in a 3rd world country in east Africa. I was with a group of 2 or 3 others and we were staying at a compound in the city. We were asked about getting some servants, and we naturally said no because we didn't want locals to feel like they were being used or having to obey us 'white people' from the U.S. But in fact they were offended by this, as it turns out that they expect anyone with means to take on servants (what you would probably call 'slaves', as they don't get pay). The reason for this is that a servant or slave has food and lodging. It's, in a sense, a way to work for the subsistence of life. People from a modern country like the U.S. don't get this, because they don't have thousands of people in the streets who will literally DIE soon from malnutrition and exposure to the elements. In such a world, slavery is (ironically) a HELPFUL thing, and that was the culture of the Bible. We always filter the word \"slavery\" through the idea of 19 century antebellum cotton plantations and so forth. When you have a culture where thousands live in landfills scraping for diseased-ridden food, or worse, begging on the street with no shelter or water, \"slavery\" in the Bible takes on a different meaning. So you using that against Christ because he didn't forbid slavery doesn't hold much water. \n \n \nAnd it's not that slavery wasn't mentioned; The law completely regulated slavery, how hard you could beat them, etc. This isn't some slippery slope fallacy here.\n\n \n Again, Christ's changes involved more the punishments of the OT law.\n \n \nI never said that God couldn't have slaves... I mean according to the bible we are all his slaves.\n\n \n Well.... that's a pretty weak argument on your part. Slavery is being used as an analogy in that teaching.\n \n At any rate, I stand by my assertion that Christ's teaching profoundly affected the Western world, and indirectly eventually affected culture in such a way that allowed the enlightenment to take place.",

I think it's pretty reasonable to expect anyone with an STD to divulge that info when a monogamous relationship forms.\n\n \n Sometimes they might not know.

Let's just say the sacrifice system wasn't just about that sacrifice, but pointing to a much greater reality.\n\n \n Please, go on. If you are pointing to the idea that sacrifices just pushed sin forward until the perfect sacrifice (Jesus) could be offered to actually atone for them, then I am already aware of it. And you are right, I don't 'get it.' It makes no sense to kill an innocent animal for any other reason than food, protection, etc. Modern tribes and natives that practice sacrifice are looked at as crazy, but somehow having a woman give sacrifice after menstruation or childbirth in the Old Testament isn't seen that way. \n \n \nNo, you're not taking into account the idea of God intentionally not usurping free will by deciding not to engage in that. There are two potential possibilities that religious people have worked out over time:\n - God knows the future, but allows bad things to happen due to the preservation of humankind's free will\n - God intentionally allows himself to be limited somewhat to preserve humankind's freewill\n\n \n This is confusing... How is God flooding the world and killing everyone not usurping free will? Or prophecies? Or 'hardening Pharoah's heart' in Egypt? Or creating the different languages at the Tower of Babel? Or impregnating Mary? Allowing Satan to mess with Job? Or the numerous verses about predestination in the New Testament? \n \n If the Bible is to be believed, God doesn't care at all about intervening in personal affairs and destroying free will. \n \n \nYou want to call God evil for letting bad things happen. But the reality is that he didn't allow bad things to happen, we'd live in some automotonic existence where there was no true free will. We couldn't really make choices because there would never be a bad choice, and therefore choices wouldn't matter anymore.

In effect, your arguments are rife with oversimplification. This is a very complex philosophical topic.\n \n \n I think so. It seems a pretty logical approach to me.\n\n \n This is basically what I thought you would say, as it is the standard explanation for the existence of evil. Here is the problem, though:\n \n The whole point of everything is to try and get to heaven, where there is no sin. With the point of view that you just accepted, free will ultimately leads to sin. You have to have the choice to sin, or else you are nothing more than a robot. So in heaven, how are you anything but a robot?\n \n Let me go over the different possibilities here.\n \n If there is free will in heaven, there will be sin (it is an infinite amount of time, after all), and so it would just be another 'fall' and not really a great reward at all (after all, Satan rebelled, so what's keeping the Christians or the angels from turning away from God?) In this scenario, heaven, as a perfect place, can't exist.\n \n If there is not free will, and God is willing to have a bunch of robots for an eternity, what was the point of allowing so much pain and suffering for such a short, insignificant amount of time, only to turn the saints into robots? In this scenario, God didn't give man free will as some sort of gift (since he would have no problem snatching that free will away as soon as someone dies), he did it as some sort of sick experiment.\n \n If there is somehow the possibility of free will without sin (which doesn't seem possible), then why didn't God create Earth in a free, sinless state from the get go? In this scenario, he is absolutely guilty since he could have allowed man free will without the possibility of pain and suffering. \n \n \nBut Jesus wasn't teaching the golden rule--to say that's all he was getting at is to greatly miss a lot of what he was saying--matters of the heart. (the morality YOU said you don't agree with.)\n\n \n Saying that thinking about doing something (being angry or lustful) is as bad as doing it, teaching people not to be responsible and to not care about the future, etc are matters of the heart?\n \n I can grant you the golden rule, the loving your neighbor as yourself, but this is not a new concept.

From wiki: \"Freethought is a philosophical viewpoint that holds that opinions should be formed on the basis of science, logic, and reason, and should not be influenced by authority, tradition, or dogma.\" From Dictionary.com: \"Thought unrestrained by deference to authority, tradition, or established belief, especially in matters of religion.\"\n \n Can you explain to me the rationality behind some of the things in Christianity that I disagree with, specifically something like, \"Take no thought for the morrow?\" (And if you try to make it seem like a non-literal, softcore 'don't be too vain' message, you are ignoring his teachings of giving away all your belongings, and the immediate context about how God feeds the birds and clothes the grass.)\n \n \nNo, you missed my point. The invention of the printing press began a move of the church away from totalitarianism via the protestant reformation. Because, for the first time, the Bible WAS more available to the masses.\n\n \n I didn't miss your point. I just disagree with the premise that it spread 'Christian' morals. I would argue that the widespread use of the bible itself spread as much evil (even if it is simply misinterpretations of its message) as it did the actual good teachings. This can be seen by the last example of the Protestant Reformation and the violence involved. \n \n \nAnd a Christian effectively discovered gravity.

Of course Christianity has indirectly influenced everything, and without it, things would be quite different (whether things would be better or worse is up for debate, although it's a debate I'm not interested in.)\n \n Your original statements (like this one),\n \n \nHitchens and Dawkins, for instance, have Christianity to thank for the culture that allows them the tolerance to be openly and virulently atheist. The \"enlightenment\" wouldn't have happened without religion[...]\n\n \n seem to imply a very direct causation of all these things. I'm willing to concede 'indirect' influence, of course, although undoubtedly still less so than you would. \n \n \nThat doesn't refute anything I'm saying. Constantine was a follower of Christ, after all.\n\n \n I find it somewhat humorous how you restrict Christian actions and influence to such narrow terms (only involved with good deeds), yet your definitions of so called 'Christians' and 'Christian culture' are extremely broad and all-encompassing. Constantine was a bloodthirty conqueror who was willing to battle anyone who stood in his way. His conversion (as it is told) was only because he thought it helped him win a battle (not because of the teachings). \n \n The post that I responded to:\n \n \n[Jesus' teachings] clearly went above and BEYOND the typical ethic of reciprocity. There's a REASON his teachings became more popular than other philosophies.\n\n \n I was simply stating that it wasn't the teachings that caused it to spread, it was because a Roman emperor converted and it eventually became the state religion. \n \n \nAnd when God says to love others, and that he has come to free the captives, those are liberating passages.\n Has it not occurred to you that the Bible was not intended for the purpose of being a manual of social and government reform? Why should the Bible specify slavery specifically when it is about other purposes? Anything it does speak out on is over and above what it certainly needs to do, given its purpose.\n\n \n Because if slavery is wrong (and a sin), and the bible references God's people owning slaves, Christians owning slaves, and telling people how they should treat slaves instead of telling them not to own them in the first place, then it is misleading people (as it did the Christian slaveowners in America who believed slavery was sanctioned by God) and could cause them to go to hell. \n \n And since when is speaking on morality above the purpose of the bible? The purpose of the bible is to teach people how to obtain salvation and obey God, which is based largely on morals (as seen in the Old Law, and Jesus giving his interpretations of the Law). \n \n \nI also point out that slavery in the near eastern culture was more similar to servitude. They were in a culture where servitude was necessary. Let me explain with a personal story that was rather eye opening ...\n A few years ago I was in a 3rd world country in east Africa. I was with a group of 2 or 3 others and we were staying at a compound in the city. We were asked about getting some servants, and we naturally said no because we didn't want locals to feel like they were being used or having to obey us 'white people' from the U.S. But in fact they were offended by this, as it turns out that they expect anyone with means to take on servants (what you would probably call 'slaves', as they don't get pay). The reason for this is that a servant or slave has food and lodging. It's, in a sense, a way to work for the subsistence of life. People from a modern country like the U.S. don't get this, because they don't have thousands of people in the streets who will literally DIE soon from malnutrition and exposure to the elements. In such a world, slavery is (ironically) a HELPFUL thing, and that was the culture of the Bible. We always filter the word \"slavery\" through the idea of 19 century antebellum cotton plantations and so forth. When you have a culture where thousands live in landfills scraping for diseased-ridden food, or worse, begging on the street with no shelter or water, \"slavery\" in the Bible takes on a different meaning. So you using that against Christ because he didn't forbid slavery doesn't hold much water. \n\n \n The Bible discusses selling... this is not what you are talking about, which is an indentured servant. The Old Testament also talks about how you could beat a slave to within an inch of his life. Also not the same thing. Very poor people, becoming indentured servants willingly for food and shelter by their own accord, is not the same as trading and selling human beings. This will never be moral, and is one of the most deplorable ideas man has ever had. \n \n \nAgain, Christ's changes involved more the punishments of the OT law.\n\n \n Outside the adulteress, do you have any examples? As I've mentioned, there are multiple stories in the gospels that indicate that Jesus did not come to change the law. \n \n Paul popularized the notion that the Old Law was to be abandoned (by Gentiles, at least), but this idea is never stated by Christ.\n \n \nWell.... that's a pretty weak argument on your part. Slavery is being used as an analogy in that teaching.\n\n \n You were saying that I was expecting God to follow the same principles that man does (which honestly, if he didn't, it would seem hypocritical to me). I was simply telling you that you were putting words in my mouth, and that I never said anything about God owning slaves.\n \n \nAt any rate, I stand by my assertion that Christ's teaching profoundly affected the Western world, and indirectly eventually affected culture in such a way that allowed the enlightenment to take place.\n\n \n And as I mentioned earlier, I don't really take offense this softened stance. The idea that Christianity was the primary cause, and that other things were very much secondary, and that we should be \"thanking our lucky stars\" for Christian culture is what I disagreed with.",

   "Getting married (eventually) and staying together faithfully is the ideal... Being a virgin on your wedding day is not the ideal anymore, especially for men.\n\n \n So your hangup here is just premarital-sex? \n You're still arguing frequency here. That promiscuity happens or is widespread doesn't change the fact it is promiscuity. It just means promiscuity is more popular than it should be. Again, monogamy is the opposite of promiscuity. Monogamy is the only sure-fire way to prevent the spread of STDs.\n \n \nThis is confusing... How is God flooding the world and killing everyone not usurping free will? Or prophecies? Or 'hardening Pharoah's heart' in Egypt? Or creating the different languages at the Tower of Babel? Or impregnating Mary? Allowing Satan to mess with Job? Or the numerous verses about predestination in the New Testament? \n\n \n The Bible is quite clear--if you truly read it--that every single one of those events were the result of people exercising their free will--then, therefore, God acting accordingly. The downside of free will is that ultimately, there are consequences. If all choices lead down a road to the very same destination, they are aren't choices to begin with. For example, Christians generally understand exactly the need for the Incarnation (\"God impregnating Mary\")--that's why they're Christian--and even predestination is still balanced against God allowing people freedom of choice. Again, you're not going to bring anything new to the table here; we as Christians have dealt with all these. Not to say it's always been clear-cut, but the Church is well aware of all this, and have yet to find it compelling enough to overturn anything. \n \n \nIf the Bible is to be believed, God doesn't care at all about intervening in personal affairs and destroying free will. \n\n \n You're right that he doesn't want to destroy free will, but he clearly cares about intervening. That's the whole message of the Christian gospel, after all.\n \n \nThis is basically what I thought you would say, as it is the standard explanation for the existence of evil. Here is the problem, though:\n \n The whole point of everything is to try and get to heaven, where there is no sin. With the point of view that you just accepted, free will ultimately leads to sin. You have to have the choice to sin, or else you are nothing more than a robot. So in heaven, how are you anything but a robot?\n \n .... If there is somehow the possibility of free will without sin (which doesn't seem possible), then why didn't God create Earth in a free, sinless state from the get go? In this scenario, he is absolutely guilty since he could have allowed man free will without the possibility of pain and suffering. \n\n \n The short version of the most accepted answers to that is a.) God ultimately allowed the creation of the universe with the potential for evil in order to ultimately let humans be created first as capable of real choice (in an fallen universe), lest they not be human in the later more perfect 'heaven'; and b.) God allowed the creation of the universe with potential for evil to ultimately demonstrate divine glory through ultimate victory, at which point we are beyond human understanding anyway in that these are cosmic matters being played out.\n \n Furthermore, I take issue with your use of the term 'guilty'. We have to keep in mind that the only thing God is \"guilty\" of would be failure to do what certain human beings think he should be held to. He is, by very definition of being God, not under the auspices of whatever morality human is held to. He sets morality standards for humanity himself, ergo he can do what he wants--he IS God, after all. IOW, if God kills someone, that's fine. If a human does so, that's not fine. By even holding God to a standard of what you consider hypocrisy, you're trying to constrain him with a HUMAN standard of morality, which doesn't apply. There's ultimately no way to ever truly judge God, beyond, say, the extent a pet might judge its human owner for standards on a pet's level. The pet is never going to comprehend God on any level other than the pet's POV (which is the God<-<man relationship is infinitely less).\n \n \nSaying that thinking about doing something (being angry or lustful) is as bad as doing it, teaching people not to be responsible and to not care about the future, etc are matters of the heart?\n\n \n Yes, because \"reason's\" morality is concerned only with actions, not thoughts, and therefore doesn't take into account that thoughts influence action. Christian morality does take that into account. And if you in turn argue that \"reason's\" morality takes thoughts into account as well, then you have to admit Christian morality IS reasonable. :)\n \n \nIs this where I can just say \"Yeah, but the people doing those atrocities weren't using reason?\" \n\n \n Indeed! Since Christianity and reason go hand in hand, I have no problem with that at all. (though I realize you're reason for saying it)\n \n \nI'll avoid that, and just say that 'loving your enemy' isn't all that 'reasonable,' and that sometimes you gotta fight for your rights.\n\n \n It sounds like you're confusing love with pacifism here.\n \n \nReason is rationality; it is the philosophy of freethought.\n\n \n Well those are subjective definitions, if I ever saw them. My point still stands--with those definitions anyone can claim their view is what is \"reasonable\". And therein lies the real problem with relying on something called \"reason\" for morality. There's no overarching standard that OBJECTIVELY and SPECIFICALLY defines it. Hitler considered himself to be using reason. So did every other dictator that ever lived. And I am not playing the Hitler card there--I only use that example to show you the obvious \"eye-of-the-beholder\" quality of \"reason\".\n \n \nCan you explain to me the rationality behind some of the things in Christianity that I disagree with, specifically something like, \"Take no thought for the morrow?\" (And if you try to make it seem like a non-literal, softcore 'don't be too vain' message, you are ignoring his teachings of giving away all your belongings, and the immediate context about how God feeds the birds and clothes the grass.)\n\n \n I think you just probably answered your own question with the last part. This model does indeed work .... in the context of the Church (when operating correctly, that is). \n \n \nThat said, it seems that you have softened your stance to point where I am almost inclined to agree with you.\n\n \n I don't think I've softened anything, frankly. Christianity did directly cause much good in the world. Failure to follow Christ's teachings cause much harm. You can call that the no-true-scottsman all you want, but it doesn't change the reality of it.\n \n \nConstantine was a bloodthirty conqueror who was willing to battle anyone who stood in his way. His conversion (as it is told) was only because he thought it helped him win a battle (not because of the teachings). \n\n \n That's quite open to interpretation and opinion.\n Recent scholarship on Constantine have greatly challenged old stereotypes regarding him.\n \n \nI was simply stating that it wasn't the teachings that caused it to spread, it was because a Roman emperor converted and it eventually became the state religion. \n\n \n ... who wouldn't have converted had it not spread. :)\n \n \nBecause if slavery is wrong (and a sin), and the bible references God's people owning slaves, Christians owning slaves, and telling people how they should treat slaves instead of telling them not to own them in the first place, then it is misleading people\n\n \n I would agree with that if God had ever said \"slavery is a good thing.\" That would be misleading. As it is, you're arguing the ABSENCE of a statement is misleading. But when the broader work isn't about that topic, I don't think one should be castigated for not dealing with every single issue that could or will ever come up. The Bible is not a 'Compendium of Sins.'\n \n \nAnd since when is speaking on morality above the purpose of the bible? The purpose of the bible is to teach people how to obtain salvation and obey God, which is based largely on morals (as seen in the Old Law, and Jesus giving his interpretations of the Law).\n\n \n That is not the base for salvation if you follow the Christian gospel.\n \n \nOutside the adulteress, do you have any examples? As I've mentioned, there are multiple stories in the gospels that indicate that Jesus did not come to change the law.\n\n \n Sabbatical laws.

He himself healed on the sabbath. \n \n \n...that we should be \"thanking our lucky stars\" for Christian culture is what I disagreed with.\n\n \n I still wholeheartedly hold to that view.

Monogamy is the only sure-fire way to prevent the spread of STDs.\n\n \n Not the only option... like I said before, celibacy and castration are also options. And the only way monogomy is completely effective is if both partners are virgins going into the relationship (and didn't get a disease some other way)... either way, my whole point is that there is no excuse for the whole Catholic church-condom thing. Whether or not there are other ways to combat the spread of disease is no reason to ban an alternate, proven effective method. Especially when it has been shown time and time again that the majority of people do not (and seem to be unable to) have only one sexual partner in a lifetime, regardless of what they are taught and what they believe. \n \n \nThe Bible is quite clear--if you truly read it--that every single one of those events were the result of people exercising their free will--then, therefore, God acting accordingly.

God hardening Pharoah's heart (forcing him to change his mind to stop Moses from letting the people free) is a direct intervention of Pharoah's free will. Unless you are arguing that God reserves the right to change our will in the name of punishment, but that is just highly contradictory to the whole point of free will. \n \n You argued earlier that God stopping slavery would be a violation of free will, but I don't see how you can say that now that you've hand waved all these examples away. How would it be any different from God stopping the Tower of Babel from being built? Why couldn't he 'punish' all the slave owners (a result of their exercising their free will)... why couldn't he un-harden their hearts? \n \n And how did all the little children and babies exercise their free will enough to warrant the flood or the death of the first born? \n \n And understanding the \"need\" for the incarnation of Jesus doesn't take away the fact that it was a violation of Mary and Joseph's free will. So does predestination and prophesy. It doesn't matter one bit how much he \"balances\" the freedom of choice... that saying alone implies that he doesn't allow full free will. And if it isn't full free will it isn't free at all. If you take the bible as absolute truth, there was no possible way for Jesus to do anything to jeopardize the plan. He did not have the ability (or the free will) to sin. The ones who killed Jesus did not have the ability to choose Jesus instead of Barrabas. And if you are predestined, no matter what that is a violation. Maybe you 'think' you are making decisions, but if God knows every little thing you do and has known where you are going to wind up since the very beginning, that goes against the very principle. \n \n The Church is aware of this, and they have been ignoring it for centuries.\n \n \nYou're right that he doesn't want to destroy free will, but he clearly cares about intervening. That's the whole message of the Christian gospel, after all.\n\n \n So he doesn't want to, but he has to. \n \n \nThe short version of the most accepted answers to that is a.) God ultimately allowed the creation of the universe with the potential for evil in order to ultimately let humans be created first as capable of real choice (in an fallen universe), lest they not be human in the later more perfect 'heaven'; and b.) God allowed the creation of the universe with potential for evil to ultimately demonstrate divine glory through ultimate victory, at which point we are beyond human understanding anyway in that these are cosmic matters being played out.\n\n \n So what you are saying is that humans do not have choice and free will in heaven. So what is the point? What is the point that they should be human in heaven if they have no choice anyway? Earth is nothing more than a cruel game in this scenario. And if it only \"more\" perfect and not fully perfect, then that allows the possibility of sin and another fall, making heaven itself a lie. The whole divine glory thing is ridiculous. If it is beyong our knowledge, how does he get the glory? Doesn't this need for glory and praise and his characteristics of jealousy, anger, love, and compassion seem very human? If it is beyond our knowledge to understand his demonstration of glory, then how do you know that is why he allowed/created evil? How do you know that his methods are good and justified? \n \n \nFurthermore, I take issue with your use of the term 'guilty'. We have to keep in mind that the only thing God is \"guilty\" of would be failure to do what certain human beings think he should be held to. He is, by very definition of being God, not under the auspices of whatever morality human is held to.

The pet is never going to comprehend God on any level other than the pet's POV (which is the God<-<man relationship is infinitely less).\n\n \n I take issue with this argument which you have used before. It's nonsense. In Matthew 5, Jesus says that God the Father is perfect. In another part in Matthew, he says something to the effect of \"There is only one who is good, God.\" Psalms also has numerous references to the goodness of God. If your idea has any merit, these terms lose all meaning. It's no different than Big Brother... what Big Brother says is the truth, even if it's a lie. If your understanding is that God can do whatever and it be all good simply because it is God who is doing it, then what is the point of trying to proclaim the Bible's moral teachings as the best? Even if they were evil, they would be perfect since Big Brother YHWH said they were. \n \n I also fully object to your notion for the reason that it is hypocritical to judge the good actions of God (and call them good or gracious) while at the same time saying the bad things aren't really bad, or that we just don't understand. If we don't understand the bad, we can't understand the good.\n \n \nYes, because \"reason's\" morality is concerned only with actions, not thoughts, and therefore doesn't take into account that thoughts influence action. Christian morality does take that into account. And if you in turn argue that \"reason's\" morality takes thoughts into account as well, then you have to admit Christian morality IS reasonable. :)\n\n \n Thoughts influence actions, but it's the action that is criminal, not the thought. Lust as a sin is ridiculous. Without it, no one would be attracted to anyone, and the human species would die off. Same basic thing with coveting... the world runs on coveting. Capitalism runs on wanting something you do not have. Anger is also similar, although Jesus is contradictory here. In the sermon on the mount he says that anyone who is angry with a brother will be subject to judgment. That to me is dumb. However, I agree with the teaching in Ephesians to \"be angry and sin not.\"\n \n The whole concept of thought crime (very consistent with the Big Brother reference by the way) is ridiculous and unreasonable. Emotions can be controlled, but thoughts can not be. \n \n \nIndeed! Since Christianity and reason go hand in hand, I have no problem with that at all. (though I realize you're reason for saying it)\n\n \n But when you define something as being perfect, it makes it meaningless. Sure I can define reason as perfect and say that anything bad is a departure thereof, and you can do the same for Christianity, and somebody else can do the same thing for Confucianism, or communism, or whatever ideology or utopia you can think of.\n \n \nIt sounds like you're confusing love with pacifism here.\n\n \n \"Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.\" Sorry, but that reeks of pacifism. Are you saying that Jesus wasn't a pacifist? Aside from the whol whip in the temple thing, I'd say he was anti violence-and anti-revenge. How purposeful violence against an enemy ever be acceptable if you honestly love that enemy? I don't think it's possible.\n \n \nWell those are subjective definitions, if I ever saw them. My point still stands--with those definitions anyone can claim their view is what is \"reasonable\". And therein lies the real problem with relying on something called \"reason\" for morality. There's no overarching standard that OBJECTIVELY and SPECIFICALLY defines it. Hitler considered himself to be using reason. So did every other dictator that ever lived. And I am not playing the Hitler card there--I only use that example to show you the obvious \"eye-of-the-beholder\" quality of \"reason\".\n\n \n Morality is not absolute, but that said, Hitler and other dictators weren't concerned about morality toward the people they harmed. They only used reason to do what was best for themselves and to push their unreasonable ideaologies (like Hitler's racism). \n \n \nI think you just probably answered your own question with the last part. This model does indeed work .... in the context of the Church (when operating correctly, that is). \n\n \n But it doesn't work. Point me to a church where all the members take no care for the morrow, don't worry about food, shelter, or clothes, and I'll show you a poor, starving, miserable group of people. I've been to a good number of churches, poor and rich alike, but there's always a building, there's always vehicles, well dressed people, money in the plates, communion stuff that has been nicely prepared ahead of time, etc. These teachings of Jesus are nothing short of lazy and irresponsible. \n \n \nI don't think I've softened anything, frankly. Christianity did directly cause much good in the world. Failure to follow Christ's teachings cause much harm. You can call that the no-true-scottsman all you want, but it doesn't change the reality of it.\n\n \n I already accepted your apology. Sorry. No take backs. \n \n \nThat's quite open to interpretation and opinion.\n Recent scholarship on Constantine have greatly challenged old stereotypes regarding him.\n\n \n Link? I'd be interested to read it. \n \n \n... who wouldn't have converted had it not spread. :)\n\n \n If it wasn't for him, the religion may have died out, or remained an obscure little religion and not spread throughout Europe and to America.\n \n \nI would agree with that if God had ever said \"slavery is a good thing.\" That would be misleading. As it is, you're arguing the ABSENCE of a statement is misleading. But when the broader work isn't about that topic, I don't think one should be castigated for not dealing with every single issue that could or will ever come up. The Bible is not a 'Compendium of Sins.'\n\n \n But it's not a simple absence of a statement. There are many, many passages regarding slavery in the bible. Even in the long, complex Mosaic law it is mentioned, and specific things about it are said to be wrong, such as murdering your slave or taking a fellow Hebrew as a slave for life. \n \n Let's change slavery to stealing for a moment. If the Bible said that 'you shall not steal any item and resell it' and assigned punishments to people who violated the law, while explicitly stating that there will be no punishment for those who steal and do not resell, then it would clearly be condoning the act of stealing. \n \n And the Old Law sure seemed to be a compendium of sins...\n \n \nThat is not the base for salvation if you follow the Christian gospel.\n\n \n \"If you love me, keep my commandments.\" - Jesus. The idea that you can do whatever you like as long as you believe in Jesus is not scriptural. After all,\"the devils also believe, and tremble.\"\n \n \nSabbatical laws. He said to honor the sabbath, but he clearly lets people off the hook if they have to do work on the sabbath. He himself healed on the sabbath. \n\n \n Jesus didn't consider those things that he or his disciples did to be breaking the Mosaic Law. He considered the Jewish interpretation of the law to be incorrect and missing the whole point. After all, breaking the law would haven be sin, and Jesus was sinless. This was not a change that Jesus made in the law (at least in his mind). \n \n \nI still wholeheartedly hold to that view. After all, I have to go where historical evidence takes me. Evidence I've shown you now.\n\n \n I don't think you've given very convincing evidence to show that Christianity is the primary cause of any of the things you claimed; but of course you are going to hold to that view since you are a Christian. Anyway, I feel like this reason/culture argument has pretty much run its course...\n \n -------------------------------\n \n I was also a little disappointed you skipped over this tidbit, so I'll put it here again:\n \n \n\n I'm hesitant to even get into it with you, because you're not going to get it. Suffice it to say, you're bringing up issues that Christians have dealt with for centuries, and there are pretty standard views out there on this stuff. Let's just say the sacrifice system wasn't just about that sacrifice, but pointing to a much greater reality.\n\n \n Originally posted by me\n Please, go on. If you are pointing to the idea that sacrifices just pushed sin forward until the perfect sacrifice (Jesus) could be offered to actually atone for them, then I am already aware of it. And you are right, I don't 'get it.' It makes no sense to kill an innocent animal for any other reason than food, protection, etc. Modern tribes and natives that practice sacrifice are looked at as crazy, but somehow having a woman give sacrifice after menstruation or childbirth in the Old Testament isn't seen that way.",

   "Not the only option... like I said before, celibacy and castration are also options.\n\n \n I guess I was assuming you were at least limiting this discussion to the real world here. Castration?

Monogamy certainly IS an option.\n \n \nAnd the only way monogomy is completely effective is if both partners are virgins going into the relationship (and didn't get a disease some other way)\n\n \n Or give full disclosure, which (as we've already covered) is likely in the case of a monogamous relationship.\n \n \nAnyway, this doesn't work. God hardening Pharoah's heart (forcing him to change his mind to stop Moses from letting the people free) is a direct intervention of Pharoah's free will. Unless you are arguing that God reserves the right to change our will in the name of punishment, but that is just highly contradictory to the whole point of free will.\n\n \n You're point completely leaves out the fact that, by imposing on Pharoah's will, he responds and gives free will to his people. Again, the scriptures make it clear that God did this in answer to the Israelite prayers.\n \n \nWhy couldn't he 'punish' all the slave owners (a result of their exercising their free will)... why couldn't he un-harden their hearts?\n\n \n I suppose if you elevate slavery above all other offenses of the human condition I could see why you might think that. But again, if God did that it would only make him inconsistent in that he would have stopped one sin but not all others, and if he stopped all others, then humans would be automatons. I don't agree with you that slavery is a 'worst' of all sins, which is pretty much what your logic has to incorporate. There are plenty of sins that the Bible doesn't directly deal with.\n \n \nAnd how did all the little children and babies exercise their free will enough to warrant the flood or the death of the first born? \n\n \n You're misundertanding me. I'm saying that to somehow magically force the human race to be unable to enslave others, it would infringe too much on free will. That there are instances where God killed people before they could make choices doesn't change this. By the logic you're incorporating, we could say society is hypocritical for allowing hate speech instead of just taking away all free speech. No, we allow for the negative effects of speech because we know how important it is for people to be able to have free speech. Free choice is important enough that God allows humans to sin. You seem to be arguing for some divine removal of capability, where people wouldn't even have the choice. But to take away peoples' ability to make choices would be evil too, so I don't agree with you. You're demands on God to meet your unreasonable standard of consistency are just as unreasonable here as what you're criticizing. I suspect if you were being honest with me, you would prefer to keep the CAPABILITY to do evil in terms of freedom of choice, even though you might not do evil. Doing evil and having the capacity to do evil are two very different things. \n \n \nAnd understanding the \"need\" for the incarnation of Jesus doesn't take away the fact that it was a violation of Mary and Joseph's free will. So does predestination and prophesy. It doesn't matter one bit how much he \"balances\" the freedom of choice... that saying alone implies that he doesn't allow full free will.\n\n \n If he doesn't allow free will, then why would he even teach people to do good to begin with? There would be no need for ANY teaching about behavior in the Bible if there were no freedom of choice. I'm sorry, but you're arguing extreme exceptions as if they are the rule, and they aren't. What made these particular events noteworthy, to where they were written about, is that they WERE the exceptions. \n \n \nIf you take the bible as absolute truth, there was no possible way for Jesus to do anything to jeopardize the plan. He did not have the ability (or the free will) to sin. The ones who killed Jesus did not have the ability to choose Jesus instead of Barrabas. And if you are predestined, no matter what that is a violation. Maybe you 'think' you are making decisions, but if God knows every little thing you do and has known where you are going to wind up since the very beginning, that goes against the very principle. \n \n The Church is aware of this, and they have been ignoring it for centuries.\n\n \n Of course they are aware of it, but they certainly have not been 'ignoring' it. The free will versus predestination debate has been one of the most active debates in Christianity for as long as the Church has been around. Though I don't see why the fact God can't be surprised by anything we do means we aren't free to make decisions, and that seems to be the gist of your argument.\n \n \nSo what you are saying is that humans do not have choice and free will in heaven.\n\n \n I don't know if we have choice in heaven. Considering that would not be very 'heavenly' or desirable, my belief is that in heaven God somehow squares free will with lack of evil.\n \n \nIf it is beyong our knowledge, how does he get the glory?\n\n \n I think you probably give humanity way more credit than it deserves. God's glory certainly doesn't NEED humanity in the equation. Our very existence is pretty generous on his part.\n \n \nDoesn't this need for glory and praise and his characteristics of jealousy, anger, love, and compassion seem very human?\n\n \n What do you mean by a 'need for praise'? I don't see how you can really argue he needs anything; if he did, he wouldn't really be God.\n \n \nIf it is beyond our knowledge to understand his demonstration of glory, then how do you know that is why he allowed/created evil? How do you know that his methods are good and justified?\n\n \n I never said I know that is the reason. It just seems to be the most logical one to me.\n \n \nI take issue with this argument which you have used before. It's nonsense. In Matthew 5, Jesus says that God the Father is perfect. In another part in Matthew, he says something to the effect of \"There is only one who is good, God.\" Psalms also has numerous references to the goodness of God. If your idea has any merit, these terms lose all meaning. It's no different than Big Brother... what Big Brother says is the truth, even if it's a lie. If your understanding is that God can do whatever and it be all good simply because it is God who is doing it, then what is the point of trying to proclaim the Bible's moral teachings as the best? Even if they were evil, they would be perfect since Big Brother YHWH said they were.\n\n \n \"Even if they were evil\"? Evil by what standard? I don't see how you can get any higher than God when it comes to who sets moral standards. IMO, that's really the point. You compare God to 'big brother', but if he is God, then what else would it be? It's not like there is an over-arching morality standard over and ABOVE God. \n \n \nI also fully object to your notion for the reason that it is hypocritical to judge the good actions of God (and call them good or gracious) while at the same time saying the bad things aren't really bad, or that we just don't understand. If we don't understand the bad, we can't understand the good.\n\n \n No, no. You're still not getting my view. I just got through saying God can't be judged as good or evil by us because he's outside the standard. You say he should be judged bad if he's judged good, but I'm taking it a step FARTHER than you and saying he can't be judged as either, in any meaningful way, by humans.\n \n \nThoughts influence actions, but it's the action that is criminal, not the thought. Lust as a sin is ridiculous. Without it, no one would be attracted to anyone, and the human species would die off. \n Same basic thing with coveting... the world runs on coveting. Capitalism runs on wanting something you do not have.\n\n \n Well, these are your opinions, and I have my own. I think the important point Jesus was getting at what that dealing with actions ALONE don't get to the root of the issue. (which sort of demonstrates why you only want to remove consequences of sexual action--STDs--rather than deal with the root of such a problem.) It seems Jesus is pointing out something there that culture doesn't like.\n \n \nAnger is also similar, although Jesus is contradictory here. In the sermon on the mount he says that anyone who is angry with a brother will be subject to judgment. That to me is dumb. However, I agree with the teaching in Ephesians to \"be angry and sin not.\"\n\n \n Again, I think you've missed the boat on the sermon on the mount. He was raising the bar on merely avoiding murder--it's not just avoiding murder that we should be trying to fix, but the root causes of murder.\n \n \n\"Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.\" Sorry, but that reeks of pacifism. Are you saying that Jesus wasn't a pacifist?\n\n \n I don't know that we can assume Jesus meant that in the sense of meaning 'you should never go to war or serve in the military.' That's what I mean by pacifism. I meant in the political sense.\n \n \nMorality is not absolute, but that said, Hitler and other dictators weren't concerned about morality toward the people they harmed. They only used reason to do what was best for themselves and to push their unreasonable ideaologies (like Hitler's racism).\n\n \n I would say human morality is not absolute. I agree with your take on Hitler.\n \n \nBut it doesn't work. Point me to a church where all the members take no care for the morrow, don't worry about food, shelter, or clothes, and I'll show you a poor, starving, miserable group of people.\n\n \n Many churches don't worry about food shelter and clothes, because they don't have to. Those certainly aren't 'poor, starving, miserable' people. Remember, Christian teaching is about meeting people in time of NEED. Did you think the ideal of the Church was to PROMOTE people being poor or starving? If people aren't poor, then the church isn't needing to provide food, shelter, etc. In cases where there are congregants who are poor or hungry, I've seen many examples of Churches caring for such people.\n \n \nI've been to a good number of churches, poor and rich alike, but there's always a building, there's always vehicles, well dressed people, money in the plates, communion stuff that has been nicely prepared ahead of time, etc. These teachings of Jesus are nothing short of lazy and irresponsible. \n\n \n I don't understand what you're getting at. You're giving the impression that you believe Christ taught people to go without cars, financial responsibility, etc. That's not the Christ's teaching I've read. That there are plenty of well-off people in the church doesn't mean the church isn't meeting the needs of people where there IS poverty there.\n \n \nLink? I'd be interested to read it. \n\n \n A good example:\n Amazon.com: Defending Constantine: The Twilight of an Empire and the Dawn of Christendom (9780830827220): Peter J. Leithart: Books\n \n \nBut it's not a simple absence of a statement. There are many, many passages regarding slavery in the bible.\n\n \n I would be willing to bet there is not a single passage that cannot be explained in terms of context. If someone is LOOKING to find justification for slavery to condemn the Bible, then yes, you're going to read it there. But in doing so, you're committing the very same injustice that preachers themselves engage in with their 'cafeteria Christianity' or proof-texting, which is therefore double-standard-ish on your part. And often what you condemn as justification (the 'don't murder your slave' passage, for instance) was actually greater protections for slaves than what was there before. Context, context, context.\n \n \nAnd the Old Law sure seemed to be a compendium of sins&#8230;\n\n \n No. If that had been the case, it would been a much longer testament than it is.\n \n \n\"If you love me, keep my commandments.\" - Jesus. The idea that you can do whatever you like as long as you believe in Jesus is not scriptural. After all,\"the devils also believe, and tremble.\"\n\n \n The devils DON'T love Jesus. They believe out of sense of fear rather than love. (hence, they tremble.) You can't separate the Christian gospel from atonement. It's the whole point.\n \n \nJesus didn't consider those things that he or his disciples did to be breaking the Mosaic Law. He considered the Jewish interpretation of the law to be incorrect and missing the whole point.\n\n \n But with that way of thinking, we could also argue against YOUR take on the Jewish law about slavery. Your interpretation of the Bible as pro-slavery is incorrect and missing the point. After all, your take doesn't jibe with Christ's teachings and ideals of loving others.\n \n \nI was also a little disappointed you skipped over this tidbit, so I'll put it here again\n\n \n You've already said you don't really get it. I don't see much point in elaborating.",

For instance in Matthew 10:34 Jebus says himself he didn't come to spread peace. He came to turn families against each other and said that if you loved your family more than you loved him then you are not worthy. A Peaceful, Loving Messiah would never tell people that.

   "There are certain teachings that pretty much all denominations that are Christian agree on: the resurrection for example. \n And I've certainly never heard of a Bible-is-proslavery denomination. That accusation is usually reserved for those who want to unfairly treat Judeo-Christian adherents.\n\n \n People have used the Bible in the Past to Justify Slavery, but as Humans living in a Civilized society most realize that slavery is wrong and took it upon themselves to change this. No, I've never heard of a Pro-Slavery denomination but the Bible in and of itself is Pro Slavery both in the Old testament and the new. Part of Jebus's teachings were how to treat your slaves. This is one reason I have always found it hard to believe most of the stories of the Old Testament. According to the Bible The Hebrew people were enslaved by the Egyptians. You would think a People who had endured centuries of Slavery would have a different view of the Ideal of Slavery, yet the Hebrew people kept slaves, Their Religion taught them how to treat , buy, and sell slaves, and their God condoned Slavery throughout the Bible. I would find it very hard not to see the Bible as Pro Slavery and I'm pretty sure I'm not alone in that.\n \n Ephesians 6:5-9\n 5 Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ. 6 Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart. 7 Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not people, 8 because you know that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good they do, whether they are slave or free. \n \n 1 Timothy 6:1-2\n 1 All who are under the yoke of slavery should consider their masters worthy of full respect, so that God&#8217;s name and our teaching may not be slandered. 2 Those who have believing masters should not show them disrespect just because they are fellow believers. Instead, they should serve them even better because their masters are dear to them as fellow believers and are devoted to the welfare of their slaves.\n \n Luke 12:47-48\n 47 &#8220;The servant who knows the master&#8217;s will and does not get ready or does not do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows. 48 But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.\n \n Leviticus 25:44-45\n However, you may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you. You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land. You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance. You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way. \n \n Exodus 21:20-21\n When a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished. If, however, the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished, since the slave is his own property.\n \n Exodus 21:7-11\n When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are. If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again. But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her. And if the slave girl's owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter. If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife. If he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment.\n \n Exodus 21:2-6\n If you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve for only six years. Set him free in the seventh year, and he will owe you nothing for his freedom. If he was single when he became your slave and then married afterward, only he will go free in the seventh year. But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife will be freed with him. If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master. But the slave may plainly declare, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children. I would rather not go free.' If he does this, his master must present him before God. Then his master must take him to the door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl. After that, the slave will belong to his master forever. \n \n Sounds rather Pro Slavery to me..",

Then go back and read it.\n As you may or may not understand technology can be transported and therefore machines such as steam engines( it was a long time ago) or even internal combustion engines will operate just as well in the Southern states as the North.\n Now we have an engine..develop a drive system and the engine can move and turn pulleys and drive shafts.\n Devise a machine that picks cotton,ploughs the land,harvests the corn, cuts the suger cane etc etc and what are you left with?\n No?\n Okay, you are left with a whole load of machinery that can do farm work far more efficiently than people and a whole load of slaves with nothing to do.\n What you NEED is a few skilled workers and some itinerant unskilled ones that you can hire or fire when you want..not slaves.\n And that is why the industrial revolution would have resulted in the abolishment of slavery in the west..because it made would have made slavery obsolete and inefficient.\n One may also say that the industrial revolution was responsible for the industrial north to prevail over the South because of the wealth that industry brought.\n So on every level the rise of machines did for slavery.\n I have said that the west exported its slavery to the developing country but thats for another time.\n \n Of course while all this was happening Chile was busy being a irrelevant backwater..as it is today",

   "I guess I was assuming you were at least limiting this discussion to the real world here. Castration? Does that really even need to be brought up as if its an option? Monogamy certainly IS an option.\n\n \n Eunuchs aren't part of the real world? I know they were a big part of the church (at least the early church). The bible (well, mostly just Paul) teaches that if possible you should avoid any sex and avoid marriage, and that marriage is just to help people avoid sexual immorality. You want to write off the 'crazy' ideas, but keep in mind that they were very real (and considered the most righteous) options in the early church. \n \n \nOr give full disclosure, which (as we've already covered) is likely in the case of a monogamous relationship.\n\n \n Full disclosure means nothing if one of the persons involved has a disease. Are they supposed to be celibate then, since there is no way to have safe sex between them? And I'm aware... \"well if one of them hadn't had promiscuous sex to start with, he/she wouldn't have an STD.\" But that is going back to a fairy tale utopia where everyone is perfect. \n \n \nYou're point completely leaves out the fact that, by imposing on Pharoah's will, he responds and gives free will to his people. Again, the scriptures make it clear that God did this in answer to the Israelite prayers.\n\n \n Are you kidding with this answer? So it's okay that he denies Pharoah's free will so that he can answer prayers? You are grasping at straws, now. You say that evil exists because of this gift of free will that God felt was so important, but he is willing to deny that gift to some people for the sake of others... Not only does this make void your arguments about God not being able to stop slavery since it would interfere with free will, but you've also got your Egyptian story messed up. Pharoah was willing to let the people go! That's all the Jews would have been praying for! But no, God had to harden pharoah's heart so that he could show off with his miracles (by murdering innocent children, starving and punishing non-Jewish civilians, killing animals, etc.) Had Pharoah's heart NOT been hardened, the Jews' free will wouldn't have suffered one bit, and the Jews would have been freed even earlier than they were!\n \n \nI suppose if you elevate slavery above all other offenses of the human condition I could see why you might think that. But again, if God did that it would only make him inconsistent in that he would have stopped one sin but not all others, and if he stopped all others, then humans would be automatons. I don't agree with you that slavery is a 'worst' of all sins, which is pretty much what your logic has to incorporate. There are plenty of sins that the Bible doesn't directly deal with.\n\n \n It has nothing to do with it being the worst sin. It has to do with it being a sin, period. The Jews were 'God's people' and under God's perfect moral law, but they were allowed not only to enslave people from other cultures, but to beat them (allowed by the law!). All the other sins that I would consider 'worse' than slavery, things like murder, hurting other people, rape... these are all covered. All the major, obvious sins are covered, and even many little meaningless 'sins' are covered, yet slavery is fine and dandy. And again, it isn't that the bible is silent on the issue. It constantly talks directly about slavery, but never once implies that it is anything less than moral; and you get fun tidbits like this:\n \n Exodus 20:20-21\n \n20And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.\n \n 21Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.\n\n \n If he continues a \"day or two\"? So if he doesn't die right away, then you're good? Or does it mean you can beat them to within an inch of their life, as long as they get better? It's ridiculous to think that this is acceptable morality. \n \n And it doesn't matter if it was acceptable to other cultures. God didn't mind the law hitting other points that weren't acceptable to the non-Jews... the dietary laws, the circumcision, no idolatry, homosexuality. \n \n And can you name some of these major sins (on the level of slavery) that the bible doesn't deal with (that were possible at the time)? And no abortion, since I'm sure we disagree with the morality involved there.\n \n \nYou're misundertanding me. I'm saying that to somehow magically force the human race to be unable to enslave others, it would infringe too much on free will. That there are instances where God killed people before they could make choices doesn't change this. By the logic you're incorporating, we could say society is hypocritical for allowing hate speech instead of just taking away all free speech. No, we allow for the negative effects of speech because we know how important it is for people to be able to have free speech. Free choice is important enough that God allows humans to sin. You seem to be arguing for some divine removal of capability, where people wouldn't even have the choice. But to take away peoples' ability to make choices would be evil too, so I don't agree with you. You're demands on God to meet your unreasonable standard of consistency are just as unreasonable here as what you're criticizing. I suspect if you were being honest with me, you would prefer to keep the CAPABILITY to do evil in terms of freedom of choice, even though you might not do evil. Doing evil and having the capacity to do evil are two very different things. \n\n \n But I've never said that God should have done that (I don't even believe in God!), I've simply stated over and over that there shoul have been some sort of anti slavery law in the Mosaic Law! It's mentioned enough, and it's obviously immoral, so how hard would it have been to just say \"slavery is a sin\" instead of regulating the prices, who you can and can't buy and sell, how hard you can beat them, etc. And what does it mean by infringing \"too much?\" You've already admitted to God infringing in the case of Pharoah (and gave some nonsensical justification for it). If free will was so important that it made evil and suffering 'okay' then why would God ever unfringe upon it?\n \n And I think that God killing innocent children and babies as punishment for others' sins is very relevant. He is taking away every bit of free will and choice that those people will ever have for the sake of punishment; but not punishment to those children, the punishment of others.\n \n I would also say that you have your analogy backwards, because that is exactly what the Old Testament says that God did with the flood. He killed all the innocent babies, children, animals, and plants, along with the sinners (and still didn't get rid of sin, imagine that). Then constantly throughout the bible, God does kill people who are disobedient, which would be opposite of the idea of allowing hate speech along with free will. \n \n And again, I am not arguing for 'divine intervention' in the case of slavery! I never have! The only time I mentioned it was when I was showing how God broke free will anyway for other reasons. All I have ever said was that it should have been a punishable offense the same as murder, rape, or (God forbid) idolatry. \n \n \nIf he doesn't allow free will, then why would he even teach people to do good to begin with? There would be no need for ANY teaching about behavior in the Bible if there were no freedom of choice. I'm sorry, but you're arguing extreme exceptions as if they are the rule, and they aren't. What made these particular events noteworthy, to where they were written about, is that they WERE the exceptions. \n\n \n (I imagine there would be a backlash if I simply answered that the laws were made by man and that God didn't write them... or that God doesn't exist, so I'll try something else). I would argue that the God of the bible wants that behavior. I mean, if he didn't, why would he allow Satan into the garden to begin with? Why wouldn't he just destroy Satan right off the bat? \n \n \nOf course they are aware of it, but they certainly have not been 'ignoring' it. The free will versus predestination debate has been one of the most active debates in Christianity for as long as the Church has been around. Though I don't see why the fact God can't be surprised by anything we do means we aren't free to make decisions, and that seems to be the gist of your argument.\n\n \n I'm aware of the predestination stuff, but I was referring more to the 'free will in heaven' idea. You can't see the reason why 'all knowing' is incompatible with free will? Because in this scenario, you don't have free will! It's an illusion! If God knows you are going to lie to your wife, then even if you think you are making that choice, telling the truth was never actually an option! If the illusion was the only thing that was important, then God could have made everyone always make the right decisions, but make them 'feel' like they made that choice themselves... \n \n \nI don't know if we have choice in heaven. Considering that would not be very 'heavenly' or desirable, my belief is that in heaven God somehow squares free will with lack of evil.\n\n \n But if God can somehow 'square' free will with a lack of evil, then he is worse than Satan himself for not doing that in the first place to avoid all the evil and suffering and death. That's the whole point! \n \n \nI think you probably give humanity way more credit than it deserves. God's glory certainly doesn't NEED humanity in the equation. Our very existence is pretty generous on his part.\n \n What do you mean by a 'need for praise'? I don't see how you can really argue he needs anything; if he did, he wouldn't really be God.\n\n \n I don't mean 'need' in a 'will die without it' kind of way. It is clear from the bible that everyone has to give him praise, everyone has to love him, everyone has to glorify him, OR ELSE. I'm using the word 'need' in the same way that a spoiled child 'needs' all the attention of his parents or in school. It is extremely human for a being that is supposedly so much better than us.\n \n \nI never said I know that is the reason. It just seems to be the most logical one to me.\n\n \n But it isn't logical. If it is beyond your knowledge, then you can't know.\n \n \n\"Even if they were evil\"? Evil by what standard? I don't see how you can get any higher than God when it comes to who sets moral standards. IMO, that's really the point. You compare God to 'big brother', but if he is God, then what else would it be? It's not like there is an over-arching morality standard over and ABOVE God. \n\n \n Evil by any standard. Enough with this \"God is not subjected to our morality.\" It's BS. The bible constantly says things to the effect of \"God is good\" and \"God is perfect.\" It says that God's standard is sinless, and that man falls short of it. It says that God is not tempted by sin, and even 'God's son' didn't sin. These phrases lose any and all meaning. If God isn't subject to the same morality, then nothing the bible says is worth anything. Everything he says could be a lie. That is what standard I am talking about. An example: Things can be true or false. We can know for a fact that the sky is blue, but if God (Big Brother) says it is green, it becomes the truth, since he is God. By your view, God might as well be Satan, since he isn;t subject to any morality.\n \n \nNo, no. You're still not getting my view. I just got through saying God can't be judged as good or evil by us because he's outside the standard. You say he should be judged bad if he's judged good, but I'm taking it a step FARTHER than you and saying he can't be judged as either, in any meaningful way, by humans.\n\n \n The writers of the bible certainly didn't feel that way, as I pointed out above (and in a previous post). They constantly judge God. And if this is really your view, then your entire view of morality is skewed. If God says to murder or rape, that doesn't make it okay! Morality is doing what's best for everyone, not just what satisfies an authority figure or yourself. \n \n \nWell, these are your opinions, and I have my own. I think the important point Jesus was getting at what that dealing with actions ALONE don't get to the root of the issue. (which sort of demonstrates why you only want to remove consequences of sexual action--STDs--rather than deal with the root of such a problem.) It seems Jesus is pointing out something there that culture doesn't like.\n\n \n Culture doesn't 'like' that because it's an impossibility to control your thoughts. If someone makes you angry, you can't stop that, all you can do is control your actions. You can't stop nature... if you find a woman attractive, then you find her attractive. The best you can do is control your actions. If you see your neighbor's new car and you want it, you can't help that thought, but you can control yourself not to steal it. And your view of my stance on STDs is a strawman. I don't think that casual sex is a good idea, but I think that taking away an effective measure against disease is a much worse idea that would be much easier to control than a person's sex drive. \n \n \nAgain, I think you've missed the boat on the sermon on the mount. He was raising the bar on merely avoiding murder--it's not just avoiding murder that we should be trying to fix, but the root causes of murder.\n\n \n There is a difference in anger and wanting to murder someone. \n \n \nI don't know that we can assume Jesus meant that in the sense of meaning 'you should never go to war or serve in the military.' That's what I mean by pacifism. I meant in the political sense.\n\n \n I have a very hard time imagining Jesus being in favor of war, and I would go as far as to say that anyone who really tries to understand Jesus' views would agree. The 'turn the other cheek' view shows this. And an extrapolation of that idea in 1 Peter 3 goes even further. Here is an excerpt: \n \n \n9 Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing. 10 For,\n \n \"Whoever would love life\n and see good days\n must keep their tongue from evil\n and their lips from deceitful speech.\n 11 They must turn from evil and do good;\n they must seek peace and pursue it.\n 12 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous\n and his ears are attentive to their prayer,\n but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.\"[a]\n \n 13 Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good? 14 But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. \"Do not fear their threats[b]; do not be frightened.\"\n\n \n There are also numerous places that say to leave any vengeance to God and (paraphrasing) that God will be the punisher, and that it is good to suffer for Christ, etc. I don't think there is a different set of morality for politics.\n \n \nI would say human morality is not absolute. I agree with your take on Hitler.\n\n \n Yet you imply that God's morality is that \"he can do whatever he wants.\" I guess that's one definition of absolute.\n \n \nMany churches don't worry about food shelter and clothes, because they don't have to. Those certainly aren't 'poor, starving, miserable' people. Remember, Christian teaching is about meeting people in time of NEED. Did you think the ideal of the Church was to PROMOTE people being poor or starving? If people aren't poor, then the church isn't needing to provide food, shelter, etc. In cases where there are congregants who are poor or hungry, I've seen many examples of Churches caring for such people.\n \n I don't understand what you're getting at. You're giving the impression that you believe Christ taught people to go without cars, financial responsibility, etc. That's not the Christ's teaching I've read. That there are plenty of well-off people in the church doesn't mean the church isn't meeting the needs of people where there IS poverty there.\n\n \n YES! That is exactly what Jesus taught! \n \n \n21 Jesus looked at him and loved him. \"One thing you lack,\" he said. \"Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\"\n \n 22 At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.\n \n 23 Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, \"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!\"\n \n 24 The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, \"Children, how hard it is[b] to enter the kingdom of God! 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\" \n\n \n Matthew 6\n \n \n19 \"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\n \n 22 \"The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy,[c] your whole body will be full of light. 23 But if your eyes are unhealthy,[d] your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!\n \n 24 \"No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.\n Do Not Worry\n 25 \"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? 26 Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? 27 Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life[e]?\n \n 28 \"And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. 29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 30 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you-you of little faith? 31 So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' 32 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. \n\n \n \n \n15 Then he said to them, \"Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.\"\n \n 16 And he told them this parable: \"The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest. 17 He thought to himself, 'What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.'\n \n 18 \"Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. 19 And I'll say to myself, \"You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.\"'\n \n 20 \"But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?'\n \n 21 \"This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God.\"\n Do Not Worry\n 22 Then Jesus said to his disciples: \"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. 23 For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. 24 Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! 25 Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life[a]? 26 Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?\n \n 27 \"Consider how the wild flowers grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 28 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you-you of little faith! 29 And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it. 30 For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them. 31 But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.\n \n 32 \"Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom. 33 Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. 34 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. \n\n \n Can it be much clearer? What is financial responsibility if it isn't worrying about tomorrow? Take special note of verse 33... another note to sell your possessions. This is another example of ignoring what Jesus actually taught.\n \n \nA good example:\n Amazon.com: Defending Constantine: The Twilight of an Empire and the Dawn of Christendom (9780830827220): Peter J. Leithart: Books\n\n \n I don't plan on buying/reading the book, but I did read some of the reviews. First of all, it doesn't seem a lot different than a doctrinal apology from a Christian with some theology to push. It's nice that Constantine referred to the Christian God and got rid of some barbaric laws (or introduced laws against things like rape), but I was specifically referring to Constantine and the wars he fought and how he put his own wife and son to death, neither of which really came up in the reviews of the book. My complaint is that he was very much into Rome and politics, and was willing to ignore the Christian teachings if it benefited him or Rome. \n \n \n I would be willing to bet there is not a single passage that cannot be explained in terms of context. If someone is LOOKING to find justification for slavery to condemn the Bible, then yes, you're going to read it there. But in doing so, you're committing the very same injustice that preachers themselves engage in with their 'cafeteria Christianity' or proof-texting, which is therefore double-standard-ish on your part. And often what you condemn as justification (the 'don't murder your slave' passage, for instance) was actually greater protections for slaves than what was there before. Context, context, context.\n\n \n \"Don't murder your slave\" was me being kind. I've already quoted the verse in this post, but the real words are closer to \"You can beat them as hard as you want as long as they don't die within a couple days.\" Again, this is supposed to come from God. Why would God be operating on 1000 BC morals and not 'eternal' morals. Greater protection for the time is not good enough if it is supposed to be the groundwork of perfection from God. If this is the case, and the laws can just change with time, then I'd say it's time for all the anti-gay and anti-equality among the sexes to disappear. After all, that was just there for the time. But go ahead and try to use \"context\" to justify beating a slave. \n \n \nNo. If that had been the case, it would been a much longer testament than it is.\n\n \n This seems pretty circular to me. There are what, 613 commandments in the Old Law? How many would it take to be considered a compendium?\n \n \nThe devils DON'T love Jesus. They believe out of sense of fear rather than love. (hence, they tremble.) You can't separate the Christian gospel from atonement. It's the whole point.\n\n \n I'm not trying to separate Christianity from atonement, but I am disagreeing with the \"faith without works\" interpretation that you seem to be pushing. I think that view is the result of picking and choosing passages in the bible to fit your view.\n \n \nBut with that way of thinking, we could also argue against YOUR take on the Jewish law about slavery. Your interpretation of the Bible as pro-slavery is incorrect and missing the point. After all, your take doesn't jibe with Christ's teachings and ideals of loving others.\n\n \n You are arguing this because you live in a time where slavery is known to be wrong. You 'know' that the bible is anti slavery because you also 'know' that slavery is wrong, and that the Bible is always right. The bible was used as justification for slavery for a very long time.\n \n \nYou've already said you don't really get it. I don't see much point in elaborating.\n\n \n I said that I don't understand how murdering innocent animals and humans can do anything to make up for wrongdoings. Is it your view that it does? I'm guessing that you simply have no reasonable explanation. Even worse is the idea of human/animal sacrifice for 'tribute' or thanks rather than for the forgiveness of anything. I would really appreciate your justification of these things, even a simple, short answer.",

Then go back and read it.\n As you may or may not understand technology can be transported and therefore machines such as steam engines( it was a long time ago) or even internal combustion engines will operate just as well in the Southern states as the North.\n Now we have an engine..develop a drive system and the engine can move and turn pulleys and drive shafts.\n Devise a machine that picks cotton,ploughs the land,harvests the corn, cuts the suger cane etc etc and what are you left with?\n No?\n Okay, you are left with a whole load of machinery that can do farm work far more efficiently than people and a whole load of slaves with nothing to do.\n What you NEED is a few skilled workers and some itinerant unskilled ones that you can hire or fire when you want..not slaves.\n And that is why the industrial revolution would have resulted in the abolishment of slavery in the west..because it made would have made slavery obsolete and inefficient.\n One may also say that the industrial revolution was responsible for the industrial north to prevail over the South because of the wealth that industry brought.\n So on every level the rise of machines did for slavery.\n I have said that the west exported its slavery to the developing country but thats for another time.\n \n Of course while all this was happening Chile was busy being a irrelevant backwater..as it is today\n\n \n Pretty good explanation of it. The industrial revolution definitely signaled an end to actual slavery. No, it didn't abolish unfairness, which is what Winston seems to be referring to, since there were plenty of badly paid workers in terrible conditions, but that has nothing to do with the actual practice of slavery.",

   "Eunuchs aren't part of the real world? I know they were a big part of the church (at least the early church). The bible (well, mostly just Paul) teaches that if possible you should avoid any sex and avoid marriage, and that marriage is just to help people avoid sexual immorality. You want to write off the 'crazy' ideas, but keep in mind that they were very real (and considered the most righteous) options in the early church.\n\n \n Castration was certainly more common in the ancient world, not just 'the church' or early church. Regardless, it's not a real-world option in any modern day civilized context and debatable that it was that common then. It is quite a stretch to assert that Paul argued against marriage--to the extent that he did it was nothing more than the level of advice. He went out of his way in 1 Corinthians to make clear there is no sin in marrying, and even argued that it is better to marry than burn in lust. (which only backs my argument about marriage vs. promiscuity.)\n \n \n \nFull disclosure means nothing if one of the persons involved has a disease. Are they supposed to be celibate then\n\n \n Well, yes. A person with HIV really shouldn't be doing things to spread it around--even using a condom with HIV is risky to the point where most people wouldn't want to have sex with someone HIV-infected, I suspect! I suppose if both a husband and wife BOTH have HIV already, then they would have nothing to lose.\n \n \n \nAnd I'm aware... \"well if one of them hadn't had promiscuous sex to start with, he/she wouldn't have an STD.\" But that is going back to a fairy tale utopia where everyone is perfect.\n\n \n Yeah but higher standards are not something we should avoid striving for just because it's not realistic. For example, it's not really realistic that we could ever have world with no bigotry either, but we still need to fight against bigotry.\n \n \n \nAre you kidding with this answer? So it's okay that he denies Pharoah's free will so that he can answer prayers? You are grasping at straws, now. You say that evil exists because of this gift of free will that God felt was so important, but he is willing to deny that gift to some people for the sake of others\n\n \n I don't think its grasping at straws at all. Pharoah ENSLAVED the israelites, and utimately as a result, he had his heart hardened which would not have happened otherwise. (Irony alert!, given your arguing in the direction that God is pro-slavery.) Again, it is noteworthy when God DOES infringe on free will, to the point where it gets written in the Bible. It's a pretty big deal with that happens, therefore it is quite rare. For God to never intervene in human affairs (infringing on free will), ever, would be a God that NEVER answered prayer--a God that never affected humans in any way. That's not the God of the scriptures, nor have I argued that it is. \n \n You need to understand that I'm speaking in a general sense here, with these things. I have never meant, in this course of conversation, that God NEVER infringes on free will EVER. But it is only logical that for free will to exist in the human race, God has to allow evil choices to be made. If he didn't allow evil choices, then it wouldn't be free will. \n \n \n... Not only does this make void your arguments about God not being able to stop slavery since it would interfere with free will, but you've also got your Egyptian story messed up. Pharoah was willing to let the people go! That's all the Jews would have been praying for! But no, God had to harden pharoah's heart so that he could show off with his miracles (by murdering innocent children, starving and punishing non-Jewish civilians, killing animals, etc.) Had Pharoah's heart NOT been hardened, the Jews' free will wouldn't have suffered one bit, and the Jews would have been freed even earlier than they were!\n\n \n Yep, you are correct that is what happened. That's his business--he is almighty God, after all. The end result of all these such cases is the realization of various peoples to know their place, in relation to God's place. I know you prefer to think of that as some example of 'childishness' on the part of God, but I don't see it that way. Rather I see it as acknowledging the reality of the situation. I think God is being pretty generous with you in even allowing you the thoughts you have about it. Heck, people respect the office of earthly officials (police, for instance) even if the policeman comes across as being a jerk. You do that because you know the policeman has the power to make your life pretty difficult really fast. IMO, that's nothing compared to what God is capable of doing. And yes, I know you don't believe in God, but I'll place my bets that God does exist, and let the chips fall where they may. As men much smarter than either of us have said, you have nothing to lose in believing in God, but everything to lose if you don't. In the end it really doesn't effect God at all whether or not you think God is being childish. He is God or He is not. It really doesn't matter to the issue itself whether or not you believe in him, because whether he TRULY exists or not is in no way dependent on your belief or disbelief. \n \n \n \nIt has nothing to do with it being the worst sin. It has to do with it being a sin, period. The Jews were 'God's people' and under God's perfect moral law, but they were allowed not only to enslave people from other cultures, but to beat them (allowed by the law!).\n \n All the other sins that I would consider 'worse' than slavery, things like murder, hurting other people, rape... these are all covered.\n\n \n In point of fact, there are times God allowed his people to engage in behavior with other cultures that would be CONSIDERED murder in other contexts. With all due respect, you aren't telling me anything here that I or many religious people down through the centuries aren't aware of. There are arguments regarding all these things, such as that God was using the Israelite tribes for some specific work in the human race and chose them out above other cultures to be able to do these things. The issue of slavery in the Bible is quite a debate in and of itself--entire books have been written about it. Suffice it to say that I consider it a case of God working within the context of the time, with the human race. Eventually, God obviously did allow slavery to be abolished as a legal institution. If you don't accept any of that, that's your prerogative, but I'm not really that interested in a protracted debate about slavery in and of itself; that was one issue that we've gotten side-tracked on here. \n \n \nI've simply stated over and over that there shoul have been some sort of anti slavery law in the Mosaic Law!\n\n \n Ok, if that's your view, very well. There should probably also have been some sort of anti-smoking law since tobacco is so deadly, or anti-drug use law since that is so common a detriment for people in these times. There should probably have been some sort of anti-embezzlement law as well. The list goes on and on. Again, I don't think the OT Mosaic law was meant to be an exhaustive compendium of every sin imaginable to humankind. (Oh, embezzlement is covered in the admonition to not steal? Yes, but in that vein you don't seem nearly as willing to concede that slavery is covered in Jesus' teaching about loving others.)\n \n \nI would also say that you have your analogy backwards, because that is exactly what the Old Testament says that God did with the flood. He killed all the innocent babies, children, animals, and plants, along with the sinners (and still didn't get rid of sin, imagine that). Then constantly throughout the bible, God does kill people who are disobedient, which would be opposite of the idea of allowing hate speech along with free will.\n\n \n I am well aware that the idea God would wipe out nearly all the human race is not particularly popular, or endearing. I also don't think God is so concerned about your approval as you must think a God should be. The reason of the flood is given in the narrative in Genesis 6: \"The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. The LORD regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled. So the LORD said, \"I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created\" \n \n You need to understand two things:\n 1. Many narratives in the scriptures are there to impart a moral theme or teaching. (This especially seems to apply to the early parts of the Pentateuch: passages Rowan Williams has referred to as so-called 'dream-time'.) The flood story was borrowed from earlier sources. The fact God would actually put his reputation on the line by using a story that would make him look vengeful to someone like yourself, by using a flood narrative to impart spiritual truth only goes to show God is in fact not too worried about his reputation. And apparently he has been right in that assumption given that most people conclude God is good in some way, despite stories like the flood story.\n 2. This concept of myth for the sake of deeper teaching applies to much ELSE in the Bible as well, myth or otherwise, such as the Mosaic law. The mosaic law was not really ABOUT getting people to not sin. (that doesn't mean the admonitions against sin didn't apply!) It was about a more important issue than that--to demonstrate how humans, in fact, can't measure up morally, on their own. \n \n \n(I imagine there would be a backlash if I simply answered that the laws were made by man and that God didn't write them... or that God doesn't exist, so I'll try something else). I would argue that the God of the bible wants that behavior. I mean, if he didn't, why would he allow Satan into the garden to begin with? Why wouldn't he just destroy Satan right off the bat?\n\n \n See previous response above.\n \n \nI'm aware of the predestination stuff, but I was referring more to the 'free will in heaven' idea. You can't see the reason why 'all knowing' is incompatible with free will?\n\n \n I certainly can see the philosophical argument you're making. But I think it relies too much on trying to fit metaphysical ideas into a logical box to be meaningful, frankly. It relies on the idea that we can wrap our finite minds around the idea of a heavenly existence (which would basically be extra-dimensional) At the end of the day, we make choices and therefore can only comclude, from a human's perspective, that we have free will. \n \n \nI don't mean 'need' in a 'will die without it' kind of way. It is clear from the bible that everyone has to give him praise, everyone has to love him, everyone has to glorify him, OR ELSE. I'm using the word 'need' in the same way that a spoiled child 'needs' all the attention of his parents or in school. It is extremely human for a being that is supposedly so much better than us.\n\n \n On what are you basing your view that God demands everyone \"praise, love, and glorify him, or else\"? Please elaborate.\n \n \nEvil by any standard. Enough with this \"God is not subjected to our morality.\" It's BS. The bible constantly says things to the effect of \"God is good\" and \"God is perfect.\" It says that God's standard is sinless, and that man falls short of it. It says that God is not tempted by sin, and even 'God's son' didn't sin. These phrases lose any and all meaning. If God isn't subject to the same morality, then nothing the bible says is worth anything. Everything he says could be a lie. That is what standard I am talking about. An example: Things can be true or false. We can know for a fact that the sky is blue, but if God (Big Brother) says it is green, it becomes the truth, since he is God. By your view, God might as well be Satan, since he isn;t subject to any morality.\n\n \n You can't reasonably call something that can't be avoided as \"BS\". If God is God, then yes, he's above any standard of morality there is. If God does it, it's ok. If people do it, it's not ok. It's that simple. He's GOD. We are not. When the Bible indicates that God demands sinlessnesss, it means he demands sinlessness on the part of PEOPLE. If God kills someone, he can do that. He's God, and he created them. People? No, they can't do that. I don't know how else to explain this. It's pretty straighforward. We use this very concept in HUMAN relationships. A parent gets to use matches, but a child can't play with matches. The child sees this as a double-standard, but there's a reason for it. you really can't be serious that an omniscient God needs to be held to the same standards as humans, can you? Frankly, that's about like saying a person has to be limited to whatever concept of behavior the ants have in an ant-hill on his property! (except all-knowing puts God even infinitely more knowing.)\n Because He is God, then he also gets to call himself good, even if he engages in actions that would NOT be good for HUMANS to do.\n \n \nCulture doesn't 'like' that because it's an impossibility to control your thoughts. If someone makes you angry, you can't stop that, all you can do is control your actions. You can't stop nature... if you find a woman attractive, then you find her attractive.\n\n \n I disagree. People can control their thoughts. If you're a man, you control your thoughts about women by not ogling them. And yes, anger is something that is controlable. Haven't you ever heard of anger management classes? What do you think such classes exist for?\n A person really can learn to not be angry. \n \n \nThe best you can do is control your actions. If you see your neighbor's new car and you want it, you can't help that thought, but you can control yourself not to steal it.\n\n \n No, you can do better and learn not to be jealous and covet. You can control your thoughts too.\n \n \nYES! That is exactly what Jesus taught! .... \n .... Can it be much clearer? What is financial responsibility if it isn't worrying about tomorrow? Take special note of verse 33... another note to sell your possessions. This is another example of ignoring what Jesus actually taught.\n\n \n It's fascinating that almost everything you've argued or taken issue with has been from either Jesus' 'law' teaching of the Sermon on the Mount or the original law in the OT. I suppose if people took your completely literalistic view of things here, there would be a lot of one-eyed or one-handed Christians walking around. Seriously, do you not understand that when something sounds so unreasonable that it is irrational, that there is probably a higher meaning there than is on the surface??? Do you actually think Jesus meant for people to sell everything they own, or cut off their hands, or gouge out their eyes? I've said this before, but critics of religous people can sometimes have a much more literalist take on scripture than religious people themselves. With all due respect, I suggest you give all these writings a new read after looking up the definition of 'hyperbole.'\n \n \nI don't plan on buying/reading the book\n\n \n Then I'm not sure you have any business of questioning my assertion that recent scholarship has challenged your views of Constantine.\n \n \nThis seems pretty circular to me. There are what, 613 commandments in the Old Law? How many would it take to be considered a compendium?\n\n \n You tell me. You're the one arguing it needs to include additional sins, such as slavery.\n \n \nI'm not trying to separate Christianity from atonement, but I am disagreeing with the \"faith without works\" interpretation that you seem to be pushing. I think that view is the result of picking and choosing passages in the bible to fit your view.\n\n \n This is a debate that much of the protestant reformation revolved around, Martin Luther in particular. I only mean that atonement has to be a work of God, and not brought about by any act we can engage in. \n \n \nI said that I don't understand how murdering innocent animals and humans can do anything to make up for wrongdoings. Is it your view that it does? I'm guessing that you simply have no reasonable explanation. Even worse is the idea of human/animal sacrifice for 'tribute' or thanks rather than for the forgiveness of anything. I would really appreciate your justification of these things, even a simple, short answer.\n\n \n No, it's not my view that killing animals makes up for wrongdoings, or gives tribute.",

   "Castration was certainly more common in the ancient world, not just 'the church' or early church. Regardless, it's not a real-world option in any modern day civilized context and debatable that it was that common then. It is quite a stretch to assert that Paul argued against marriage--to the extent that he did it was nothing more than the level of advice. He went out of his way in 1 Corinthians to make clear there is no sin in marrying, and even argued that it is better to marry than burn in lust. (which only backs my argument about marriage vs. promiscuity.)\n\n \n Monogomy was also a lot more common in the past too, and I would argue that it is not a real world option for preventing the spread of STDs on a large scale either. As for Paul, yeah, he does say that marriage isn't a sin (which i obvious since it is regulated both in the New Testament by Jesus and in the Old Law. But Paul teaches that although it isn't a sin, and although it is better than fornication, you should remain unmarried and celibate. Celibacy, castration, and monogamy are all great ways to keep an individual safe from STDs, but none of them are realistic for a population at large.\n \n \nWell, yes. A person with HIV really shouldn't be doing things to spread it around--even using a condom with HIV is risky to the point where most people wouldn't want to have sex with someone HIV-infected, I suspect! I suppose if both a husband and wife BOTH have HIV already, then they would have nothing to lose.\n\n \n Probably not with HIV, but other STDs (like herpes if there is any truth to the TV commercials) aren't an automatic sentence to celebacy. But without condoms, there really isn't even a safe choice for these people.\n \n \nYeah but higher standards are not something we should avoid striving for just because it's not realistic. For example, it's not really realistic that we could ever have world with no bigotry either, but we still need to fight against bigotry.\n\n \n And I think this just about sums it up. You should strive for high standards, but it isn't something to be relied upon. If you rely on abstinence alone to prevent the spread of STDs in an area of any size at all, you are going to fail. With that, I think this sex debate has just about run its course. \n \n \nI don't think its grasping at straws at all. Pharoah ENSLAVED the israelites, and utimately as a result, he had his heart hardened which would not have happened otherwise. (Irony alert!, given your arguing in the direction that God is pro-slavery.) Again, it is noteworthy when God DOES infringe on free will, to the point where it gets written in the Bible. It's a pretty big deal with that happens, therefore it is quite rare. For God to never intervene in human affairs (infringing on free will), ever, would be a God that NEVER answered prayer--a God that never affected humans in any way. That's not the God of the scriptures, nor have I argued that it is. \n \n You need to understand that I'm speaking in a general sense here, with these things. I have never meant, in this course of conversation, that God NEVER infringes on free will EVER. But it is only logical that for free will to exist in the human race, God has to allow evil choices to be made. If he didn't allow evil choices, then it wouldn't be free will. \n\n \n Irony alert! That an enslaved people would be freed just to have their own slaves.\n \n How do you know that this intervention is quite rare? Do you think Pharoah was aware that God was actually pulling the strings and making him change his mind? How do you know this doesn't happen all the time, or that many times it was left out of the bible, or that God isn't making everybody's decisions for them? You don't... \n \n I think the intervening in human affairs/infringing upon free will was a premise you originally disagreed with, so prayer wouldn't really be affected. Anyway, the whole idea of prayer is problematic to itself. Why do you need to pray if God knows your thoughts? If 'God's will' is always to be done, what's the point? If God has a perfect plan, how and why would he change it? On a side note, I think it's somewhat funny (maybe sad actually) when people ask for other people's prayers... In church I know people will ask for the congregation's prayers, or they will ask friends and families for prayers... is it a contest? Does God need a certain amount of prayers before he considers doing something? You don't have to respond to any of this, it's just an observation.\n \n You say that if God doesn't allow evil then it wouldn't be free will. I say if free will can at any time be overruled, then it is not free will.\n \n \nYep, you are correct that is what happened. That's his business--he is almighty God, after all. The end result of all these such cases is the realization of various peoples to know their place, in relation to God's place. I know you prefer to think of that as some example of 'childishness' on the part of God, but I don't see it that way. Rather I see it as acknowledging the reality of the situation. I think God is being pretty generous with you in even allowing you the thoughts you have about it. Heck, people respect the office of earthly officials (police, for instance) even if the policeman comes across as being a jerk. You do that because you know the policeman has the power to make your life pretty difficult really fast. IMO, that's nothing compared to what God is capable of doing. And yes, I know you don't believe in God, but I'll place my bets that God does exist, and let the chips fall where they may. As men much smarter than either of us have said, you have nothing to lose in believing in God, but everything to lose if you don't. In the end it really doesn't effect God at all whether or not you think God is being childish. He is God or He is not. It really doesn't matter to the issue itself whether or not you believe in him, because whether he TRULY exists or not is in no way dependent on your belief or disbelief. \n\n \n All those plagues didn't seem to work, since the Egyptians still believed in other gods.\n \n The authority is what is given the respect, but if the authority is abused, that individual loses his respect.\n \n Ah, the ol' Pascal's Wager. \"If I'm right I win, if I'm wrong I lose nothing.\" You're making the faulty assumption that there are only two choices. How do you know you've picked the right God, the right religion, the right denomination, etc? And I know you truly believe and that the phrase \"place my bets\" wasn't literal, but I don't think an all knowing God would be easily fooled by someone who believed, or 'went through the motions' just because of a wager. I'd imagine sincerity would be pretty important.\n \n \nIn point of fact, there are times God allowed his people to engage in behavior with other cultures that would be CONSIDERED murder in other contexts. With all due respect, you aren't telling me anything here that I or many religious people down through the centuries aren't aware of. There are arguments regarding all these things, such as that God was using the Israelite tribes for some specific work in the human race and chose them out above other cultures to be able to do these things. The issue of slavery in the Bible is quite a debate in and of itself--entire books have been written about it. Suffice it to say that I consider it a case of God working within the context of the time, with the human race. Eventually, God obviously did allow slavery to be abolished as a legal institution. If you don't accept any of that, that's your prerogative, but I'm not really that interested in a protracted debate about slavery in and of itself; that was one issue that we've gotten side-tracked on here. \n\n \n Yes, I am aware of the hypocrisy and conflicting messages in the bible. I just don't see the YHWH of the Old Testament as being lenient against sin to allow something like slavery. Slavery was obviously rampant in Israel, and God regulating it and saying nothing against it leads me to believe that the bible didn't view it as a sin. That's the gyst of my argument, but other than that, I agree we've gotten sidetracked. \n \n \nOk, if that's your view, very well. There should probably also have been some sort of anti-smoking law since tobacco is so deadly, or anti-drug use law since that is so common a detriment for people in these times. There should probably have been some sort of anti-embezzlement law as well. The list goes on and on. Again, I don't think the OT Mosaic law was meant to be an exhaustive compendium of every sin imaginable to humankind. (Oh, embezzlement is covered in the admonition to not steal? Yes, but in that vein you don't seem nearly as willing to concede that slavery is covered in Jesus' teaching about loving others.)\n\n \n The Bible says that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost, obviously anything that you would do to harm that temple would be a crime against God (except for fasting, which is promoted despite being harmful... luckily most modern Christians don't do that anymore). Embezzling is stealing, dishonesty, and coveting, which would break 3 of the 10 commandments (stealing, bearing false witness, coveting). Slavery and loving, however, are not mutually exclusive. Look no further than our own country's history; sure there are instances of pure evil, but there were also plenty of instances where slaves were loved like family. I would argue that slavery is much less a violation of New Testament law than war is.\n \n \nI am well aware that the idea God would wipe out nearly all the human race is not particularly popular, or endearing. I also don't think God is so concerned about your approval as you must think a God should be. The reason of the flood is given in the narrative in Genesis 6: \"The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. The LORD regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled. So the LORD said, \"I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created\" \n \n You need to understand two things:\n 1. Many narratives in the scriptures are there to impart a moral theme or teaching. (This especially seems to apply to the early parts of the Pentateuch: passages Rowan Williams has referred to as so-called 'dream-time'.) The flood story was borrowed from earlier sources. The fact God would actually put his reputation on the line by using a story that would make him look vengeful to someone like yourself, by using a flood narrative to impart spiritual truth only goes to show God is in fact not too worried about his reputation. And apparently he has been right in that assumption given that most people conclude God is good in some way, despite stories like the flood story.\n 2. This concept of myth for the sake of deeper teaching applies to much ELSE in the Bible as well, myth or otherwise, such as the Mosaic law. The mosaic law was not really ABOUT getting people to not sin. (that doesn't mean the admonitions against sin didn't apply!) It was about a more important issue than that--to demonstrate how humans, in fact, can't measure up morally, on their own. \n\n \n I don't really think it matters whether you take the stories literally or as myths used to tell a story. If the Bible was really God's handiwork, those stories accurately reveal the nature of God. Adding in the \"God is good in some way\" thing just muddies the water in this debate. You've just been discussing how people can't judge God, yet you bring this up? People say God is good because they have to say God is good. The bible says that God is good. What else are they going to say? If they didn't think God was good, they probably wouldn't be a Christian.\n \n I disagree that the law wasn't to get people not to sin. Yes, it showed that man can't live up to God's standards, but I think it also had the purpose of limiting sin (and punishing sinners). \n \n \nI certainly can see the philosophical argument you're making. But I think it relies too much on trying to fit metaphysical ideas into a logical box to be meaningful, frankly. It relies on the idea that we can wrap our finite minds around the idea of a heavenly existence (which would basically be extra-dimensional) At the end of the day, we make choices and therefore can only comclude, from a human's perspective, that we have free will. \n\n \n I don't buy into the heavenly existence, so I think it is all possible to be subjected to logic and though. If an idea doesn't make sense, and there is no evidence to support it, then I don't see any reason to believe it. I don't agree with the common Christian tactic of hand waving difficult questions away by saying that God works in mysterious ways or that it is beyond our capacity.\n \n And again, the human perspective of free will could be an illusion.\n \n \nOn what are you basing your view that God demands everyone \"praise, love, and glorify him, or else\"? Please elaborate.\n\n \n Really? Gee I don't know... How many times in the Old Testament did God tell people to \"worship me?\"\n \n Or how about this:\n \n \nYou shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, 6 but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.\n \n \n or this\n \n \n\"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?\" Jesus replied: \"'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.'\n\n \n What about requiring sacrifices, singing praises to God, requiring church and not forsaking the assembly... what about having to love and accept Jesus in order to avoid hell? Where could I get such crazy ideas?\n \n \nYou can't reasonably call something that can't be avoided as \"BS\". If God is God, then yes, he's above any standard of morality there is. If God does it, it's ok. If people do it, it's not ok. It's that simple. He's GOD. We are not. When the Bible indicates that God demands sinlessnesss, it means he demands sinlessness on the part of PEOPLE. If God kills someone, he can do that. He's God, and he created them. People? No, they can't do that. I don't know how else to explain this. It's pretty straighforward. We use this very concept in HUMAN relationships. A parent gets to use matches, but a child can't play with matches. The child sees this as a double-standard, but there's a reason for it. you really can't be serious that an omniscient God needs to be held to the same standards as humans, can you? Frankly, that's about like saying a person has to be limited to whatever concept of behavior the ants have in an ant-hill on his property! (except all-knowing puts God even infinitely more knowing.)\n Because He is God, then he also gets to call himself good, even if he engages in actions that would NOT be good for HUMANS to do.\n\n \n And if he wants to call himself good in the bible, then he better fit the human concept of good. As I've mentioned before, those words lose any and all meaning if you take your point of view. With your point of view God can be neither evil nor good... He might as well be Satan and it wouldn't matter. If God has given us our morality, then from that morality we can judge whether or not he is 'good.' Ultimately, if he exists, it doesn't matter what we think, but if he's a jerk while his bible says that he's perfect, then the book loses some of it's authority. \n \n \nI disagree. People can control their thoughts. If you're a man, you control your thoughts about women by not ogling them. And yes, anger is something that is controlable. Haven't you ever heard of anger management classes? What do you think such classes exist for?\n A person really can learn to not be angry. \n\n \n Ogling is an action, and anger management is for people who can't control their actions when they get angry. Note that that the goal is 'managing' your anger, not eliminating it.\n \n \nNo, you can do better and learn not to be jealous and covet. You can control your thoughts too.\n\n \n I disagree. Maybe to some extent you can control your thoughts (by not thinking about something), but you're going to feel the way you feel.\n \n \nIt's fascinating that almost everything you've argued or taken issue with has been from either Jesus' 'law' teaching of the Sermon on the Mount or the original law in the OT. I suppose if people took your completely literalistic view of things here, there would be a lot of one-eyed or one-handed Christians walking around. Seriously, do you not understand that when something sounds so unreasonable that it is irrational, that there is probably a higher meaning there than is on the surface??? Do you actually think Jesus meant for people to sell everything they own, or cut off their hands, or gouge out their eyes? I've said this before, but critics of religous people can sometimes have a much more literalist take on scripture than religious people themselves. With all due respect, I suggest you give all these writings a new read after looking up the definition of 'hyperbole.'\n\n \n When you are talking about moral teachings in the bible, wouldn't you expect Jesus' teachings and the Old Law to be the main sources? And I can understand interpreting something like Jonah and the whale as not being literal, but direct commandments from the Old Law, and Jesus directly telling people to sell their possessions are pretty straight forward. \n \n Jesus was speaking in hyperbole when he said that about the eyes and hands, but he also didn't command people to do it. He said that it would be better to lose those body parts than for those body parts to cause you to sin. That's obviously different from \"Give your possession to the poor.\" \n \n By it sounding \"so unreasonable that it is irrational\" I would say that it is only unrational to modern Christians. The followers of Jesus were not rich, and they did give away their possessions. You are just ignoring the inconvenient teachings by writing them off as not being literal... something that so many Christians are quick to do. \"Oh, he didn't reeaally mean that.\" \n \n I know that as a Christian you would disagree with my interpretation, but I think if you look at Jesus' (and Paul's) teachings from the point of view of expecting the end of the world to come soon, then these things (selling your possessions, if you aren't married don't get married, don't worry about tomorrow, leave your family, etc.) make a lot more sense. \n \n \nThen I'm not sure you have any business of questioning my assertion that recent scholarship has challenged your views of Constantine.\n\n \n Did you actually expect me to spend $20 and read 400 pages of apologia? I read reviews of it, and from what I could gather, I saw no mention of the warfare and the killing of the wife and son, which were my first two thoughts about Constantine. If there is some argument you have against these things (or a shorter, free article), then I'd be happy to hear it, but I don't think I should just accept that Constantine was a good guy because some Christian with a theological agenda wrote a book saying so. \n \n \nYou tell me. You're the one arguing it needs to include additional sins, such as slavery.\n\n \n I'm saying the bible isn't in any way indicitive of a perfect moral code and that it doesn't denounce slavery as a sin (it sees it as perfectly lawful). I'm saying that if it was a perfect, or even good moral code, like so many Christians say it is, then it wouldn't regulate slavery but would denounce it, and wouldn't include imaginary crimes such as witchcraft. \n \n \nThis is a debate that much of the protestant reformation revolved around, Martin Luther in particular. I only mean that atonement has to be a work of God, and not brought about by any act we can engage in. \n\n \n I don't really want to argue doctrine, and I know there are many, many different views, but the view I was saying was that in order to get that atonement from God, you have to follow the necessary teachings (even if the grace itself is independent of your actions since your actions could never be good enough to deserve such a great gift). But there's no need for an atheist to debate about doctrines and denominations.\n \n \nNo, it's not my view that killing animals makes up for wrongdoings, or gives tribute.\n\n \n Well, I'm glad we can agree, although it makes me wonder why the Israelites sacrificed so many animals and people in tribute to God in the OT.",

It was really expensive to keep a slave (I've heard that it was like $40,000 in modern money, plus the cost of taking care of him), and eventually technology would have caught up, or something. That said, I'm glad it ended when it did (wish it had never happened at all). I do wonder what race relations would be like now had slavery not been abolished when it was and had the reconstruction (which really caused deep tensions between the races in the south) never happened.\n\n \n Thank you guys.Ive learnt something here.",

   "Monogomy was also a lot more common in the past too\n\n \n Castration physically harms someone--I can't believe you're even seriously comparing one to the other. To pretend monogamy is even remotely unreasonable (while we both know castration IS unreasonable) is ridiculous. The only reason to claim monogamy is not a \"real world option\" for preventing STDs is that some people don't want to be faithful or that they want to sleep around. That's the bottom line. Society considers it an ideal because it IS ideal if done correctly.\n \n \nAnd I think this just about sums it up. You should strive for high standards, but it isn't something to be relied upon. If you rely on abstinence alone to prevent the spread of STDs\n\n \n No where have I argued here that one should rely on abstinence alone. \n \n \nHow do you know that this intervention is quite rare?\n\n \n We know because of real-world experience, and if it had been common, there probably would have been many more instances recorded than just the ones we have.\n \n \nI think the intervening in human affairs/infringing upon free will was a premise you originally disagreed with, so prayer wouldn't really be affected. Anyway, the whole idea of prayer is problematic to itself. Why do you need to pray if God knows your thoughts?\n\n \n Well, think about it in context of a relationship between two people. There are certainly times when a spouse (for instance) probably knows what the other is thinking, but that doesn't mean verbalizing isn't a good idea. Prayer is for the sake of people, not for the sake of God. There is something very helpful and \"therapeutic\" about coming out in the open with a confession, for instance. I think that exemplifies why God likes for people to actually pray.\n \n \nYou say that if God doesn't allow evil then it wouldn't be free will. I say if free will can at any time be overruled, then it is not free will.\n\n \n If you have a child, you can 'overrule' him or her at any time by putting them in 'time out.' That doesn't mean they don't still have the opportunity most of the time to make choices. I think you're over-complicating this, myself.\n \n \nAll those plagues didn't seem to work, since the Egyptians still believed in other gods.\n\n \n True, the people didn't follow God the way they should. Scripture doesn't pretend otherwise.\n \n \nAh, the ol' Pascal's Wager. \"If I'm right I win, if I'm wrong I lose nothing.\" You're making the faulty assumption that there are only two choices. How do you know you've picked the right God, the right religion, the right denomination, etc? And I know you truly believe and that the phrase \"place my bets\" wasn't literal, but I don't think an all knowing God would be easily fooled by someone who believed, or 'went through the motions' just because of a wager. I'd imagine sincerity would be pretty important.\n\n \n If pascal's wager is applied to theism in general, it works. I'm not prescribing any one particular belief here within religion--I'm referring simply to belief in God. That alone is a significant step. The issue of which religion is correct is very much of a different debate. Nor did I say you should pretend to believe--I said \"believe\" in God. Please, if you're going to respond, then respond to what I actually wrote, rather than something else.\n \n \nYes, I am aware of the hypocrisy and conflicting messages in the bible. I just don't see the YHWH of the Old Testament as being lenient against sin to allow something like slavery. Slavery was obviously rampant in Israel, and God regulating it and saying nothing against it leads me to believe that the bible didn't view it as a sin. That's the gyst of my argument, but other than that, I agree we've gotten sidetracked.\n\n \n Hypocrisy? No, not hypocrisy--that's nothing more than value judgment on your part. There's nothing conflicting about God prescribing behavior to his created creatures and having a different standard for himself, or giving a different standard to a chosen people over other cultures. He's God, we're not. It's as if you aren't even hearing what I've posted here. \n \n \nThe Bible says that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost, obviously anything that you would do to harm that temple would be a crime against God (except for fasting, which is promoted despite being harmful... luckily most modern Christians don't do that anymore). Embezzling is stealing, dishonesty, and coveting, which would break 3 of the 10 commandments (stealing, bearing false witness, coveting). Slavery and loving, however, are not mutually exclusive.\n \n \n See, you yourself are reading these things that way and viewing them a certain way because of modern influences. Embezzling is stealing, and slavery is harming others. By the way, many modern Christians engage in fasting of some kind. The whole season of Lent in the Catholic Church and Orthodox church (which combined comprises MOST of Christianity), for instance, involves fasting.\n \n \nLook no further than our own country's history; sure there are instances of pure evil, but there were also plenty of instances where slaves were loved like family. I would argue that slavery is much less a violation of New Testament law than war is.\n\n \n If someone is loved like family, then one could argue whether that's really 'slavery'. This is why I pointed out earlier that slavery in the Bible and in the far-east was often more along the lines of servitude, and not so much like the auction-block/cotton-plantation idea you have of more modern slavery in the 19th century context. Paul used the form of slavery in Biblical times to analogize Christians no longer being slaves to sin, but being slaves to righteousness. To get hung up on constant sidetracking questions of whether or not God was ok with slavery robs people from the opportunity to get to this sort of important teaching.\n \n \nAdding in the \"God is good in some way\" thing just muddies the water in this debate. You've just been discussing how people can't judge God, yet you bring this up? People say God is good because they have to say God is good. The bible says that God is good. What else are they going to say? If they didn't think God was good, they probably wouldn't be a Christian.\n\n \n I don't really see where the problem is there. My reaction is so-what'? The only way you can judge God as good or bad on your own is to adhere to some moral standard of some sort outside of yourself.\n \n \nI disagree that the law wasn't to get people not to sin. Yes, it showed that man can't live up to God's standards, but I think it also had the purpose of limiting sin (and punishing sinners).\n\n \n Galatians 2 and several chapters in Romans indicate the real reason for the law was to point toward Christ. That's my view; as you are atheist I'm sure you have a different one. \n \n \nI don't buy into the heavenly existence, so I think it is all possible to be subjected to logic and though. If an idea doesn't make sense, and there is no evidence to support it, then I don't see any reason to believe it.\n\n \n I agree that if an idea doesn't make sense there is no reason to believe it, but Christianity does make the most sense to me, and pretty much ANY religion is more logical, IMO, than the idea there is no God.\n \n \nI don't agree with the common Christian tactic of hand waving difficult questions away by saying that God works in mysterious ways or that it is beyond our capacity.\n\n \n Why not? There are some questions that are just another form of asking how many angels can fit on the head of a pin. Realizing we don't have an answer isn't the same as not asking the question. Scientists do this with scientific issues to they cannot answer--I don't really see it as a problem myself. I think the real problem is that you are determined to view instances where religion cannot answer a given question as a reason to reject religion or to accuse it of inconsistencies, which is unfair IMO. Scientists, for instance, admit they cannot answer every question in science as well, and chalk things up to such lofty ideas as 'string theory', quantum physics, etc.\n \n \nAs I've mentioned before, those words lose any and all meaning if you take your point of view. With your point of view God can be neither evil nor good... He might as well be Satan and it wouldn't matter. If God has given us our morality, then from that morality we can judge whether or not he is 'good.' \n \n Really? Gee I don't know... How many times in the Old Testament did God tell people to \"worship me?\"\n\n \n But that's not the same thing as saying \"that God demands everyone praise love and glorify him, or else\". You are intentionally trying to infer your take on God as a megalomaniac, but that's your prejudices coming through. Billions of people don't see praising God as a problem, nor as some sort of fear factor. My experience is that Christians usually praise God because they love him. \n \n More importantly is that the only standard by which you can judge God is a human one, which carries no more authority (given all the moral problems in humanity) than the very \"immoral\" being you're inferring. \n \n \nWhat about requiring sacrifices, singing praises to God, requiring church and not forsaking the assembly... what about having to love and accept Jesus in order to avoid hell? Where could I get such crazy ideas?\n\n \n Things like not forsaking assembly are just good, sound teachings reminding people that they need to come together. That's a good thing. The only example you've given here that incorporates the critical \"or else\" part is the 'avoiding hell' thing. But as so much of your arguments in this thread, it relies heavily on over-simplification. The Bible presents hell as a reality because of God's holiness, and in fact no one is required to go to hell at all. How is hell a fear factor if God makes quite clear the way to not have to worry about it?\n \n \nAnd if he wants to call himself good in the bible, then he better fit the human concept of good.\n\n \n No, sorry, your \"human concept\" of good is a nothing more than concepts created by some other outside moral standard to yourself. Again, you might as well be saying a parent should never watch anything but G-rated movies since their young child is required to do that. I note you have not dealt with my analogies very much at all.\n \n \nOgling is an action, and anger management is for people who can't control their actions when they get angry. Note that that the goal is 'managing' your anger, not eliminating it.\n\n \n Yes, an action that affects thoughts. Again, refusing to ogle is a way to control thoughts. Apparently, your model of human thinking is one that can't be controlled. With all due respect I think that's pretty unrealistic, if not silly.\n \n \nJesus was speaking in hyperbole when he said that about the eyes and hands, but he also didn't command people to do it. He said that it would be better to lose those body parts than for those body parts to cause you to sin. That's obviously different from \"Give your possession to the poor.\"\n\n \n Incorrect--He certainly did command them to \"cut if off\" if their right hand offends them, so I don't see what basis there is to assume selling all one's possessions is any less hyperbole than cutting off hands or gouging eyes, other than your need for them to be different for the sake of your argument. :) \n \n \nI know that as a Christian you would disagree with my interpretation, but I think if you look at Jesus' (and Paul's) teachings from the point of view of expecting the end of the world to come soon, then these things (selling your possessions, if you aren't married don't get married, don't worry about tomorrow, leave your family, etc.) make a lot more sense.\n\n \n I would agree that interpretation would make sense if one rejects the scriptures assertions of the deity of Christ. The interpretation is dependent on the idea that scriptures are false to begin with, so yes, I do disagree. \n \n \nI'm saying the bible isn't in any way indicitive of a perfect moral code and that it doesn't denounce slavery as a sin (it sees it as perfectly lawful).\n\n \n Indeed it doesn't indicate a \"perfect moral code\", but not for the reason you probably think--it doesn't because it was never intended for such a mere purpose as that. I would agree it doesn't denounce slavery as a sin, but then again, a lack of denouncing does not equate to condoning for a document that could never be nor was intended an exhaustive compendium of sins. It sort of takes away your whole basis of arguing it's an imperfect standard if that was not really its intention to begin with, in that your augment is based on a faulty premise, so it's no surprise that you would disagree with the idea that the OT law was not intended for justification in and of itself directly.\n \n \nWell, I'm glad we can agree, although it makes me wonder why the Israelites sacrificed so many animals and people in tribute to God in the OT.\n\n \n My opinion is that they did it out of obedience, and some probably got that it was about pointing to a later event.",

Society considers it an ideal because it IS ideal if done correctly.\n\n \n So does circumcision which was originally commanded by God, and I know plenty of men who would say that marriage was painful... even comparable to castration.\n \n Seriously, though. Monogamy in the way you are using it (virgin until marriage, one sexual partner for life), is not the societal norm in Western culture. We've gone over this already. Eventually, the ideal is to settle down and get married. But it isn't ideal these days to be a virgin on your wedding day, and in that sense, it's completely ineffective in preventing STD spread.\n \n \nNo where have I argued here that one should rely on abstinence alone. \n\n \n You were defending the Catholic church's anti-prophylactic stance.\n \n \nWe know because of real-world experience, and if it had been common, there probably would have been many more instances recorded than just the ones we have.\n\n \n Real world experience doesn't tell you anything. Do you think Pharoah was aware that God was intervening? God could just be giving you the illusion of free will... and 'probably' doesn't mean anything either. \n \n \nWell, think about it in context of a relationship between two people. There are certainly times when a spouse (for instance) probably knows what the other is thinking, but that doesn't mean verbalizing isn't a good idea. Prayer is for the sake of people, not for the sake of God. There is something very helpful and \"therapeutic\" about coming out in the open with a confession, for instance. I think that exemplifies why God likes for people to actually pray.\n\n \n I pretty much agree. Prayer does help a lot of people cope with things. But it's not like a couple because nobody knows what God is thinking, and you don't get back answers that are distinguishable from non-answers. I just mention this because it seems to me God should be the one talking directly to people and not the other way around.\n \n \nIf you have a child, you can 'overrule' him or her at any time by putting them in 'time out.' That doesn't mean they don't still have the opportunity most of the time to make choices. I think you're over-complicating this, myself.\n\n \n But children aren't at all free! And when parents intervene, it's for the good of the child; not so God can kill first born children or flood the world. And if God can intervene, yet doesn't in situations like the Holocaust, children being tortured/abused/raped... \n \n \nTrue, the people didn't follow God the way they should. Scripture doesn't pretend otherwise.\n\n \n You said the purpose of God's showing off was to put various peoples in their place... to know their place in relation to God's place. If they didn't know God, it really didn't work, did it?\n \n \nIf pascal's wager is applied to theism in general, it works. I'm not prescribing any one particular belief here within religion--I'm referring simply to belief in God. That alone is a significant step. The issue of which religion is correct is very much of a different debate. Nor did I say you should pretend to believe--I said \"believe\" in God. Please, if you're going to respond, then respond to what I actually wrote, rather than something else.\n\n \n Theism in general? That doesn't work because it ignores all the religions and doctrines. Who is to even say that 'theism in general' has punishment, unless you are equating 'theism in general' to mean 'Christianity.'\n \n And I was responding to what you wrote... that you would 'place your bets' on God's existence.\n \n \nHypocrisy? No, not hypocrisy--that's nothing more than value judgment on your part. There's nothing conflicting about God prescribing behavior to his created creatures and having a different standard for himself, or giving a different standard to a chosen people over other cultures. He's God, we're not. It's as if you aren't even hearing what I've posted here. \n\n \n Yes it is hypocrisy. Call it whatever you want to brush it away, but it's the very definition of human hypocrisy to punish people for doing something, then turn around and tell people to do the same thing. And yes, racism is still wrong even if God does it. It doesn't matter that he won't ever get punished and that there is no authority over him; wrong is wrong regardless of punishment and reward. God may never be punished for anything, but he's still an A-hole. And yes, I am judging with human standards. That's all we can judge by. As I've stated over and over again with no answer, by your definitions God might as well be Satan, since you say that the only thing that matters is being under an authority. It's just dumb, and falls right back into the Big Brother analogy perfectly. \n \n \nSee, you yourself are reading these things that way and viewing them a certain way because of modern influences. Embezzling is stealing, and slavery is harming others. By the way, many modern Christians engage in fasting of some kind. The whole season of Lent in the Catholic Church and Orthodox church (which combined comprises MOST of Christianity), for instance, involves fasting.\n\n \n If embezzling was around back then it would have been easily identifiable as stealing. I know smoking existed back then, but I doubt very seriously people could smoke as much as they do now, and yeah, the health issues weren't known (and probably wouldn't have mattered since the average life span was so low anyway back then). \n \n The problem is that you are giving examples of things which aren't mentioned in the bible at all, and comparing the biblical silence on those issues with the 'silence' on slavery. But the problem is that the bible isn't silent on slavery. This is another point that you haven't addressed. The issues would be similar if the bible specifically allowed embezzling or regulated smoking to done in public places or something. Those issues aren't, and slavery is. 'God' specifically tells the Israelites who they are allowed to buy and sell into slavery. How is this not an approval of slavery?\n \n \nIf someone is loved like family, then one could argue whether that's really 'slavery'. This is why I pointed out earlier that slavery in the Bible and in the far-east was often more along the lines of servitude, and not so much like the auction-block/cotton-plantation idea you have of more modern slavery in the 19th century context. Paul used the form of slavery in Biblical times to analogize Christians no longer being slaves to sin, but being slaves to righteousness. To get hung up on constant sidetracking questions of whether or not God was ok with slavery robs people from the opportunity to get to this sort of important teaching.\n\n \n Um no. You are begging the question. You are asserting that \"love your neighbor\" outlaws slavery and then reasoning that loving your slaves makes them 'not really slaves.' (and this is ignoring the context of 'neighbor'.\n \n Slavery is owning people to work for you without pay. I've already destroyed your servitude argument. Servants are either on contract or they are free to go at any time. And you really don't think there was an 'auction block' side to ancient slavery? Do you not remember the story of Joseph? It is clear that humans were bought and sold into slavery and were beaten, and it was all regulated and deemed acceptable by God.\n \n \nI don't really see where the problem is there. My reaction is so-what'? The only way you can judge God as good or bad on your own is to adhere to some moral standard of some sort outside of yourself.\n\n \n Why does it have to be a standard outside of yourself? My whole point in this is that God defines 'good' in the bible. He calls himself 'good,' yet he doesn't fit his own definition of 'good.'\n \n \nGalatians 2 and several chapters in Romans indicate the real reason for the law was to point toward Christ. That's my view; as you are atheist I'm sure you have a different one. \n\n \n As would Jews... but Galations also says that the faithful follow the (moral) law (because of their faith). The moral laws are never said to be anything less than perfect. It is the things like circumcision that are basically done away with here... Even in Galatians it gives a list of different types of sinners who won't get into heaven.\n \n But regardless, that's Paul's view of the law and Christianity. He never met Jesus, and Jesus himself is never credited with saying anything like what Paul's doctrine is. \n \n \nI agree that if an idea doesn't make sense there is no reason to believe it, but Christianity does make the most sense to me, and pretty much ANY religion is more logical, IMO, than the idea there is no God.\n\n \n There is no empirical evidence for God or gods.\n \n \nWhy not?

Scientists, for instance, admit they cannot answer every question in science as well, and chalk things up to such lofty ideas as 'string theory', quantum physics, etc.\n\n \n First of all, string theory is nowhere near as well founded as quantum mechanics, which has been about as successful as a scientific theory can be.\n \n But I'm not referring to asking a question that is unknown or as yet unknown. I'm talking about questions about the doctrine itself and where ideas seem contradictory. You see, in science, if something is found that disproves a hypothesis or theory, the hypothesis or theory is either scrapped or rewritten to fit the new data. \n \n In religion, when questions are brought up that legitimately question the claims of free will, heaven, hell, God being all-loving, all-powerful, all-knowing, and perfect, etc, the doctrine can't be changed, so it's either hand waved away, justified with a lot of mental gymnastics and assumptions, or some other weak tactic.\n \n \nBut that's not the same thing as saying \"that God demands everyone praise love and glorify him, or else\". You are intentionally trying to infer your take on God as a megalomaniac, but that's your prejudices coming through. Billions of people don't see praising God as a problem, nor as some sort of fear factor.

The Bible presents hell as a reality because of God's holiness, and in fact no one is required to go to hell at all. How is hell a fear factor if God makes quite clear the way to not have to worry about it?\n\n \n Robber: \"Give me the money or else.\" Justification in court: How is that a fear factor or threat when I made quite clear the way to avoid my wrath? \n \n Your argument is worthless. There are many people who can't shake the fear of hell even after they lose their faith. And you really don't think hell is supposed to be a fear factor? Then why the need for hell at all? \n \n It absolutely comes down to an \"or else\" situation, and that's not oversimplifying it at all. And my \"that God demands everyone praise love and glorify him, or else\" is very accurate. You are in danger of eternal torture if you don't follow God's arbitrary instructions. It doesn't matter if you are the nicest, most caring person in the world; if you don't accept Jesus, pray, go to church, repent, take communion, etc. you are \"off to the pit\" as EZ would say. Tell me, what does the bible say is going to happen to a person like me who neither believes in, loves, nor obeys God? \n \n \nNo, sorry, your \"human concept\" of good is a nothing more than concepts created by some other outside moral standard to yourself. Again, you might as well be saying a parent should never watch anything but G-rated movies since their young child is required to do that. I note you have not dealt with my analogies very much at all.\n\n \n Again with \"outside\" myself. How so? Yes, decisions on morality have to be made by considering other people outside myself, but the standard is my own. \n \n Your analogies, like this one, are just terrible. A parent watching an R rated movie while not allowing the kid to doesn't effect the child. The parent doesn't want the child to be exposed to certain things at that time, and by the parent watching the movie, the child isn't any worse off. \n \n A relevant example would have been more like this: If a parent tells his child not to curse, despite the parent often cursing in front of, or when talking to the child. This is MUCH more consistent with what the biblical God is doing: \"No, you can't kill Billy, but I will.\" \n \n \nYes, an action that affects thoughts. Again, refusing to ogle is a way to control thoughts. Apparently, your model of human thinking is one that can't be controlled. With all due respect I think that's pretty unrealistic, if not silly.\n\n \n Another flawed observation. Any action is going to alter thoughts. If I decide to go jogging, my thoughts will likely turn to thoughts about jogging. \n \n It's not the sexual desire or attraction a person has that is the problem. It is the action... Don't ogle. It's the same thing with addiction. The problem isn't that you feel the need to drink or smoke, the problem is the action. Don't act on your urges (unless it's acceptable of course).\n \n You bringing up the idea to \"not ogle\" proves my point. You are basically saying that controlling your actions is the way to solve the problems. It isn't the thoughts that cause the problem, it is acting on them without discretion. I'm not sure why anyone would disagree with this.\n \n \nIncorrect--He certainly did command them to \"cut if off\" if their right hand offends them, so I don't see what basis there is to assume selling all one's possessions is any less hyperbole than cutting off hands or gouging eyes, other than your need for them to be different for the sake of your argument. :) \n\n \n It's hyperbole because your eye and your hand aren't what causes you to sin. It is your decisions. The next sentence(s) makes it clear what he is saying when he says that it would be better to go to heaven maimed than go to hell in good condition. \n \n The 'give away your possessions' thing is different for several reasons. First of all, it isn't just in the sermon on the mount that he gives that command. When the guy comes up to him and asks him what he needs to do, which commandments are best, he is told to go sell his possessions to the poor (Matthew 19:21). It's not a parable, not hyperbole, that's what he told the guy to do, and when the guy went away sad, that's what prompted Jesus to talk about how rich people will have trouble making it to heaven. I don't recall him ever actually telling an individual to cut off a hand or pluck out an eye, then implying that he is doomed when he doesn't do it. \n \n Even in parables, like Luke 12, Jesus gives the parable of the rich man storing up goods, then in the literal explanation he tells people to give away their belongings. It's not the figurative, parable part where he is telling people to give away what they own, it is in the explanation of the parables. \n \n \nI would agree that interpretation would make sense if one rejects the scriptures assertions of the deity of Christ. The interpretation is dependent on the idea that scriptures are false to begin with, so yes, I do disagree. \n\n \n Why would that require one to reject the deity of Jesus? The bible even says that Jesus was in the dark about the timing of the apocalypse, but that doesn't mean that Jesus and Paul didn't have their own expectations. \n \n \nIndeed it doesn't indicate a \"perfect moral code\", but not for the reason you probably think--it doesn't because it was never intended for such a mere purpose as that. I would agree it doesn't denounce slavery as a sin, but then again, a lack of denouncing does not equate to condoning for a document that could never be nor was intended an exhaustive compendium of sins. It sort of takes away your whole basis of arguing it's an imperfect standard if that was not really its intention to begin with, in that your augment is based on a faulty premise, so it's no surprise that you would disagree with the idea that the OT law was not intended for justification in and of itself directly.\n\n \n Again ignoring that slavery isn't simply omitted, but that it is regulated repeatedly and given mention many times throughout both the Old and New Testaments.\n \n \nMy opinion is that they did it out of obedience, and some probably got that it was about pointing to a later event.\n\n \n It's ridiculous, and in the case of human sacrifice it is completely contradictory to the commandments, like Numbers 31:40 where they sacrifice 32 people. How is that necessary or acceptable?",

   "Seriously, though. Monogamy in the way you are using it (virgin until marriage, one sexual partner for life), is not the societal norm in Western culture. We've gone over this already.\n\n \n Yes, we have, and you aren't getting it. I didn't say 'norm', I said ideal. An ideal is not the same as something that is frequent. Monogamy--even premarital monogamy--is clearly the ideal, even if it is infrequent. Why do you think many parents encourage their children to avoid premarital sex? Do you really think it's common for parents to encourage premarital sex? I don't know of any such cases myself.\n \n \nEventually, the ideal is to settle down and get married. But it isn't ideal these days to be a virgin on your wedding day, and in that sense, it's completely ineffective in preventing STD spread.\n\n \n An 'ideal', in the form of a noun is meant as something to aim for. To say something is 'ideal' as an adjective is not exactly the same meaning. You're using that term interchangeably between noun and adjective as if it is. I would say it is AN ideal for people to save themselves for the one they marry, in that people look upon it as admirable. Very rarely have I heard of someone looking upon premarital sex as admirable.\n \n \nReal world experience doesn't tell you anything. Do you think Pharoah was aware that God was intervening? God could just be giving you the illusion of free will... and 'probably' doesn't mean anything either.\n\n \n Well with that approach, we could never rely on anything as real, as human beings. Again, I think you're being a bit silly here.\n \n \nI pretty much agree. Prayer does help a lot of people cope with things. But it's not like a couple because nobody knows what God is thinking, and you don't get back answers that are distinguishable from non-answers. I just mention this because it seems to me God should be the one talking directly to people and not the other way around.\n\n \n Why do you assume religious people \"don't get back answers that are distinguishable from non-answers\"? (I hope you aren't basing this on your past experiences. After all, you just said \"real world experience doesn't tell you anything.\")\n \n \nBut children aren't at all free! And when parents intervene, it's for the good of the child\n\n \n Wow, there is so much wrong with that. Children make choices all the time. Seriously. And no, parents don't always intervene for the good of the child, unfortunately. The analogy stands, even if you wish it didn't.\n \n \nAnd if God can intervene, yet doesn't in situations like the Holocaust, children being tortured/abused/raped...\n\n \n So your reason for not believing in God is based on theodicy? Have you even researched the philosophy of 'bad things happening'? You do realize that, for a world such as what you're apparently wanting to exist, it would be sterile, cold utopia where nothing ever dangerous or bad could ever happen, right? We'd be automatons or live a VERY choice-less existence. The lack thereof is what you blame God for? Frankly, with people of your mentality, God can never win, in your thinking. If God were to stop bad things from happening, he would be accused of eliminating choice from the human race. (When He does intervene and leads his people to wipe out another culture, and you criticize him for it.) Yet when he doesn't, you use that against him as well. That might be fine, except you refuse to allow religious people the same levity for the reverse thinking. You will never let 'God win', but criticize religious people for a mindset that never lets 'God lose', so to speak. You can see a double-standard in religion, but are blind to it in atheism.\n \n \nYou said the purpose of God's showing off was to put various peoples in their place... to know their place in relation to God's place. If they didn't know God, it really didn't work, did it?\n\n \n I think I've been quite consistent in arguing that people have freedom of choice. It may not have worked in the sense that they didn't CHOOSE to follow God, ultimately, but it did work in the sense of him getting his message across. Ultimately, they lost out anyway because they didn't heed.\n \n \nTheism in general? That doesn't work because it ignores all the religions and doctrines. Who is to even say that 'theism in general' has punishment, unless you are equating 'theism in general' to mean 'Christianity.'\n\n \n Again, I'm talking about theism in a general sense: simply belief in God (or the 'divine', or whatever you want to call it). I agree that Pascal's Wager can't \"narrow down\" which religion or doctrines is legit. \n \n \nYes it is hypocrisy. Call it whatever you want to brush it away, but it's the very definition of human hypocrisy to punish people for doing something, then turn around and tell people to do the same thing. And yes, racism is still wrong even if God does it.\n \n It doesn't matter that he won't ever get punished and that there is no authority over him; wrong is wrong regardless of punishment and reward.\n \n\n \n Racism denotes prejudice, a human problem. Your very inference indicates you aren't getting that a God would be a ... God, and not a human. Frankly, I think this is something that is probably irreconcilable between us, because you're only going to see this from the standpoint of disbelief in God. You're only ever going to view it as hypocrisy because you don't consider God omnipotently divine. But that view on your part is your opinion, not given reality.\n \n And yes, your morality is from an outside source. That outside source is society--the human race--which presents a morality no better than the standard you're criticizing. Do we really want to elevate a morality that led to the murder of 6 million Jews in the 20th century as any better than that espoused in the Bible? Yet if you don't believe in God: THAT'S your human-race morality, because you can't attribute something to God when you don't believe in It. Ergo, why should I consider it any better?\n \n \nThe problem is that you are giving examples of things which aren't mentioned in the bible at all, and comparing the biblical silence on those issues with the 'silence' on slavery. But the problem is that the bible isn't silent on slavery.\n\n \n It is other than working within the context of the time--it would contain the failure to be relevant if it didn't speak of how to live in such a culture. Your example of eunuchs is a good example here: eunuchs were a reality of the era. Therefore Jesus (and Paul both) spoke of some things pertaining to them since it was a part of their world. Could Jesus have condemned it? Sure, I guess so. But then He could have condemned every sin that was alive and well at the time. He didn't condemn porn, specifically either. He did teach keeping one's heart pure. So he didn't condemn slavery, but he did teach loving others. \n \n Frankly, I think you're pretty hung up on the issue of Biblical slavery, and you seem to think it is some 'slam dunk' here, but it's not. It's no different than any other sin that wasn't specifically singled out by Christ. It's a current social-justice/human-rights issue that is also very political in some ways. I think it's great you oppose it, but I think you're REALLY grasping at straws here to use it as a way to point fingers at the Christian Bible.\n \n \nThis is another point that you haven't addressed. The issues would be similar if the bible specifically allowed embezzling or regulated smoking to done in public places or something. Those issues aren't, and slavery is. 'God' specifically tells the Israelites who they are allowed to buy and sell into slavery. How is this not an approval of slavery?\n\n \n We've already been over this. The Bible makes it clear that Israel was a very special case, used as an instrument of judgment. I suppose you could argue he DID approve of Israel doing it (not the same as everyone else), but then Israel was operating in that culture where slavery was pretty much an expected thing.\n \n \nUm no. You are begging the question. You are asserting that \"love your neighbor\" outlaws slavery and then reasoning that loving your slaves makes them 'not really slaves.' (and this is ignoring the context of 'neighbor'.\n\n \n If a slavery chooses to stay because they love their family, then how on earth is that slavery by any reasonable definition??? You brought up the example of a loving relationship between slaves and their owners, not me.\n \n \nSlavery is owning people to work for you without pay.\n\n \n And I would say that definition no longer applies in a case of families and slaves loving one another. They are now working as part of the family, based on the same motivations as other sons and daughters. A sort of informal adoption has taken place by that point.\n \n \nBut regardless, that's Paul's view of the law and Christianity. He never met Jesus, and Jesus himself is never credited with saying anything like what Paul's doctrine is.\n\n \n He certainly claimed to have met Jesus, and the event was written about but a different author as well.\n \n \nThere is no empirical evidence for God or gods.\n\n \n Only if you irrationally throw out the teleological argument.\n \n \nIn religion, when questions are brought up that legitimately question the claims of free will, heaven, hell, God being all-loving, all-powerful, all-knowing, and perfect, etc, the doctrine can't be changed, so it's either hand waved away, justified with a lot of mental gymnastics and assumptions, or some other weak tactic.\n\n \n Well, a.) the 'questions' need to balanced with the reality that the alternative moral standards of the culture making raising these 'questions' are no better, and therefore carry no more moral weight themselves.\n b.) Christian doctrines get changed all the time throughout church history; so you're just flat out wrong there. \n \n \nRobber: \"Give me the money or else.\" Justification in court: How is that a fear factor or threat when I made quite clear the way to avoid my wrath? \n\n \n Using a robber in analogy doesn&#8217;t take into account the idea that what is happening may be for long-term good.\n \n \n Tell me, what does the bible say is going to happen to a person like me who neither believes in, loves, nor obeys God?\n\n \n If you don&#8217;t believe in God, then it doesn&#8217;t matter does it? Why would it even be something you&#8217;re concerned with? As I said, you can hedge your bets that way if you so choose, and I&#8217;ll hedge mine on theism.\n \n \n A relevant example would have been more like this: If a parent tells his child not to curse, despite the parent often cursing in front of, or when talking to the child.\n\n \n Alright, we&#8217;ll go with your analogy then. By your approach, you would say the parent should never ever utter a curse word then, right, if the he or she doesn&#8217;t want their child to do so? (I assume you aren&#8217;t arguing the idea that the parent only act that way when the child is around, as this would be very bad for your argument)\n \n \nYou bringing up the idea to \"not ogle\" proves my point. You are basically saying that controlling your actions is the way to solve the problems \n\n \n The point really is that we control thoughts all the time, and therefore your position that we can&#8217;t is downright silly.\n \n \nIt's hyperbole because your eye and your hand aren't what causes you to sin. It is your decisions. The next sentence(s) makes it clear what he is saying when he says that it would be better to go to heaven maimed than go to hell in good condition. \n \n The 'give away your possessions' thing is different for several reasons.\n\n \n Frankly, you&#8217;re just doing the very thing you&#8217;re accusing other of, here, by wanting to read the scriptures in a way that fits your argument. The real bottom line is that you or anyone else can filter scriptures any way you want. You say Christians don&#8217;t really follow the teachings of Christ, but then your insistence of what Christ means follows an interpretation (intended for arguing against Christians). I&#8217;m sorry, but your position is no more reasonable than theirs because it&#8217;s just as arbitrary as anyone you are claiming interprets scripture through their own culture and influences. \n \n \nFirst of all, it isn't just in the sermon on the mount that he gives that command. When the guy comes up to him and asks him what he needs to do, which commandments are best, he is told to go sell his possessions to the poor\n\n \n So because he tells one man to do so, you infer that was intended for every person to do? Especially when he&#8212;in the very next section&#8212;said that the LOVE of money is the root of all evil (not money itself)? Jesus was trying to teach you to be generous, not foolish. The fact is, most people GET this as his intent and meaning. And your view of those passages as so literalistic is not in keeping with what people much smarter than either of is understands it to be.\n \n \nIt's ridiculous, and in the case of human sacrifice it is completely contradictory to the commandments, like Numbers 31:40 where they sacrifice 32 people. How is that necessary or acceptable?\n\n \n Human sacrifice is not what's happening in that verse. Clearly, you are starting with various premises and trying to find scriptures to fit your preconceived prejudices even to the point of fitting anything you can that might possibly be construed as making the Judeo-Christian God look like a megalomania-cal ogre.",

Pretty much all you say revolves around women (and not all women) and very religious men. It would be far closer to the truth to say that the ideal for young men these days is to have sex with as many women as they can before settling down. Ask any single man how many women he's slept with... I can pretty much guarantee you he won't under-estimate the number.\n \n Most parents obviously aren't going to encourage it (although I know several who have), because it can lead to STDs and unwanted pregnancies, but among individuals and their peers, having sex with only one person your entire life is no longer the ideal...

Everything was that way.\n \n And I think you're being silly by saying that free will is important enough to put up with all the evil in the world, but showing off with plagues and other various things are worth setting aside this great 'gift,' as well as the possibility of setting it aside in heaven (I think that's the most silly). \n \n \nWhy do you assume religious people \"don't get back answers that are distinguishable from non-answers\"? (I hope you aren't basing this on your past experiences. After all, you just said \"real world experience doesn't tell you anything.\")\n\n \n If you pray for somebody to get better from their sickness and they do, Ta-dah! Thanks, God. If they die... well, God answered no because it wasn't his will to do so. If God always answers yes, no, or 'not now,' the result is indistinguishable from him not answering at all.\n \n \nWow, there is so much wrong with that. Children make choices all the time. Seriously. And no, parents don't always intervene for the good of the child, unfortunately. The analogy stands, even if you wish it didn't.\n\n \n What are you considering \"free\"? You can still make choices if a burglar has a gun to your head, too, but you're not going to be saying \"Yay, free will!\" \n \n Most children can't eat what they want, can't dress how they want, can't leave the house when they want, can't watch or listen to what they want, etc.\n \n If the only thing you are going to consider un-free is not being able to make choices, then your analogy still fails, because not even the most oppressive parents, governments, or criminals have the power to completely control your mind and choices like God does.\n \n \nSo your reason for not believing in God is based on theodicy? Have you even researched the philosophy of 'bad things happening'? You do realize that, for a world such as what you're apparently wanting to exist, it would be sterile, cold utopia where nothing ever dangerous or bad could ever happen, right? We'd be automatons or live a VERY choice-less existence. The lack thereof is what you blame God for? Frankly, with people of your mentality, God can never win, in your thinking. If God were to stop bad things from happening, he would be accused of eliminating choice from the human race. (When He does intervene and leads his people to wipe out another culture, and you criticize him for it.) Yet when he doesn't, you use that against him as well. That might be fine, except you refuse to allow religious people the same levity for the reverse thinking. You will never let 'God win', but criticize religious people for a mindset that never lets 'God lose', so to speak. You can see a double-standard in religion, but are blind to it in atheism.\n\n \n No, my 'reason' for not believing is that there is no evidence for a God. I don't find the arguments for \"bad things happening\" convincing in the least for a caring God, and based on the rest of your comment, what do you expect heaven to be like? Isn't the very definition of the Christian heaven a place where there is no pain or suffering (and therefore no danger or bad things)? I mean, I've always thought heaven seemed quite dull, but I didn't know Christians felt that way, too.\n \n \nI think I've been quite consistent in arguing that people have freedom of choice. It may not have worked in the sense that they didn't CHOOSE to follow God, ultimately, but it did work in the sense of him getting his message across. Ultimately, they lost out anyway because they didn't heed.\n\n \n Except for in this very instance, where God took away Pharoah's freedom of choice that would have avoided a lot of suffering by the innocent bystanders (the Egyptian civilians). I don't think God's point was to have the Egyptians believe in him, since all that would have required would have been him showing up and speaking to them all, or doing a \"Paul on the road to Damascus\" type thing. The random plagues could have been explained by any god to the Egyptians... they could have seen it as being punishment for the sun god or whatever Egyptians worshiped.\n \n \nAgain, I'm talking about theism in a general sense: simply belief in God (or the 'divine', or whatever you want to call it). I agree that Pascal's Wager can't \"narrow down\" which religion or doctrines is legit. \n\n \n But again, it's pointless then. You're not really saying anything. Pascal's wager is basically \"If I believe in God I have nothing to lose.\" But if it's the wrong god (and there are thousands) then you do have plenty to lose. If you change it to \"If I believe in the right God\" then the wager loses its meaning.\n \n \nRacism denotes prejudice, a human problem. Your very inference indicates you aren't getting that a God would be a ... God, and not a human. Frankly, I think this is something that is probably irreconcilable between us, because you're only going to see this from the standpoint of disbelief in God. You're only ever going to view it as hypocrisy because you don't consider God omnipotently divine. But that view on your part is your opinion, not given reality.\n \n And yes, your morality is from an outside source. That outside source is society--the human race--which presents a morality no better than the standard you're criticizing. Do we really want to elevate a morality that led to the murder of 6 million Jews in the 20th century as any better than that espoused in the Bible? Yet if you don't believe in God: THAT'S your human-race morality, because you can't attribute something to God when you don't believe in It. Ergo, why should I consider it any better?\n\n \n \n Sorry, but having unlimited authority doesn't make someone blameless or good, and choosing one group of people to be the best and kill off many other nations is pretty bad. \n \n And yes, my source of morality is better. Since morality is based on how to help yourself and others in society, and to avoid doing anything that would hurt people, why should the morals come from outside of society? Morals are for the good of everybody, so it makes sense that 'everybody' plays into the standard. Society has its own interests at heart, while your God is willing to throw 'good' people into eternal torment.\n \n And while I am certainly influenced by society, my morals are my own. I know how I like to be treated and how I don't like to be treated, and assuming that others are like-minded, I respect their wishes. I would also argue that humans getting their morality from humans doesn't really seem like an 'outside source' in the same way that is meant by getting your morality from a non-human source.\n \n Also, the Holocaust is immoral. It is absolutely going against 'society' to try and kill off a millions of people in society. We've already gone over this once. They were acting out of selfishness and what was good for themselves and not what was good for others... I could however, bring up the exact same thing about the morality of the bible, with all the genocide in the Old Testament, except I would have a better point, since that genocide was the result of obedience.\n \n \nIt is other than working within the context of the time--it would contain the failure to be relevant if it didn't speak of how to live in such a culture. Your example of eunuchs is a good example here: eunuchs were a reality of the era. Therefore Jesus (and Paul both) spoke of some things pertaining to them since it was a part of their world. Could Jesus have condemned it? Sure, I guess so. But then He could have condemned every sin that was alive and well at the time. He didn't condemn porn, specifically either. He did teach keeping one's heart pure. So he didn't condemn slavery, but he did teach loving others. \n \n Frankly, I think you're pretty hung up on the issue of Biblical slavery, and you seem to think it is some 'slam dunk' here, but it's not. It's no different than any other sin that wasn't specifically singled out by Christ. It's a current social-justice/human-rights issue that is also very political in some ways. I think it's great you oppose it, but I think you're REALLY grasping at straws here to use it as a way to point fingers at the Christian Bible.\n \n We've already been over this. The Bible makes it clear that Israel was a very special case, used as an instrument of judgment. I suppose you could argue he DID approve of Israel doing it (not the same as everyone else), but then Israel was operating in that culture where slavery was pretty much an expected thing.\n\n \n Being a eunuch is another thing Jesus condoned:\n \n Matthew 19:12\n \n \nFor there are eunuchs, that were so born from their mother's womb: and there are eunuchs, that were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, that made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.\n\n \n You're hopeless with the slavery thing, and of course I am talking about him allowing Israel to do it (those were HIS people after all... what do you think I've been talking about all this time?). By \"how to live in such a culture\" you are basically saying \"how to buy, sell, own, and beat slaves.\" That's patheticm, and it is completely deserving of pointing fingers. It's not even that it condones treating human beings as property, but that it tells you how to physically beat the slaves... They couldn't even throw in a little \"don't hit your slaves\" commandment. Was that absolutely necessary as well? I mean, obviously slavery was a sin that meant way too much to the Israelites for God to speak up against it, but did he have to tell them how to legally beat them?\n \n I mean, it's pathetic. Since when did God care what was 'expected' in other societies? Homosexuality, worshipping idols, having graven images... all these things were practiced in other cultures and God had no problem condemning them. Even something like kings... every other nation had kings, and although God finally broke down and gave them what they wanted, he was quite clear about how he felt about it. It's just absurd that God's morals for his people were subjected to the norms of ungodly nations.\n \n \nIf a slavery chooses to stay because they love their family, then how on earth is that slavery by any reasonable definition??? You brought up the example of a loving relationship between slaves and their owners, not me.\n\n \n Because slaves don't choose. (Unless you are referring to the 'Hebrew servants' who were to be released after a certain number of years in the bible, but they were allowed to choose to stay with their wives and children, who weren't allowed to go with them). If a worker has the choice to leave at any time, then he isn't a slave. \n \n \nAnd I would say that definition no longer applies in a case of families and slaves loving one another. They are now working as part of the family, based on the same motivations as other sons and daughters. A sort of informal adoption has taken place by that point.\n\n \n No, because the slaves don't have the choice to leave (and have limited rights in society). Sons and daughters eventually grow up and move on, slaves don't.\n \n \nHe certainly claimed to have met Jesus, and the event was written about but a different author as well.\n\n \n He claimed to have a revelation on the road to Damascus, and saw no one but just heard Jesus' voice. Jesus didn't teach to him either, but told him that he would be told what to do (by the apostles and other Christians) when he went into Damascus.\n \n \nOnly if you irrationally throw out the teleological argument.\n\n \n No, I rationally throw out the teleological argument as it is just an argument from ignorance.\n \n \nWell, a.) the 'questions' need to balanced with the reality that the alternative moral standards of the culture making raising these 'questions' are no better, and therefore carry no more moral weight themselves.\n b.) Christian doctrines get changed all the time throughout church history; so you're just flat out wrong there. \n\n \n It's true that Christianity has split up hundreds of times and that they have different doctrines (which is funny considering the 'house divided' teachings), but I was speaking in a way related to how we are discussing things now, or like if I was talking to a Baptist or something... If I bring up something that may be contradictory or difficult within his accepted doctrine, he'll ignore the argument or hand wave it away before considering that his doctrine is wrong (most of the time, anyway).\n \n \nUsing a robber in analogy doesn't take into account the idea that what is happening may be for long-term good.\n\n \n Long term good? I noticed that you cut out a lot of my argument on this statement (the most relevant parts), but I showed that it doesn't matter how 'good' you are, and it certainly isn't about the long term 'good' for humans (especially for humans on earth)... it's about believing in and loving a deity... in order to avoid punishment, you have to do what is good for the deity, regardless of how good a person you are, and in my analogy, the robber would be the deity, and whatever he commanded you to do would be good for him.\n \n \nIf you don't believe in God, then it doesn't matter does it? Why would it even be something you're concerned with? As I said, you can hedge your bets that way if you so choose, and I'll hedge mine on theism.\n\n \n Good job avoiding the answer. I care because it was directly related to my argument, and disproved your claim that my \"or else\" statement was wrong.\n \n \nAlright, we'll go with your analogy then. By your approach, you would say the parent should never ever utter a curse word then, right, if the he or she doesn't want their child to do so? (I assume you aren't arguing the idea that the parent only act that way when the child is around, as this would be very bad for your argument)\n\n \n If a parent expects his child not to curse, then no, the parent shouldn't curse at all. But... this was an answer to your analogy about a God being outside the moral standards of humans (where God would be like a parent and humans the children). So keeping that in mind, if the parent curses on his own time, away from children, then it is no harm, no foul. The children don't know about it, and it isn't setting a contradictory example to them personally. The problem with the bible, though, is that God breaks his own commandments in front of humans all the time, and even commands them to break the commandments... \n \n Humans, as we all know, aren't perfect; so occasionally a parent will do something like curse in front of their kids (to whom they have taught that cursing is wrong). It's usually accidental, or done in an emotional state like anger... The examples from the bible, though, would be more like a parent teaching his child not to curse, then running right up to him and purposely swearing like a sailor.\n \n \nThe point really is that we control thoughts all the time, and therefore your position that we can't is downright silly.\n\n \n But it's by controlling the actions, not getting rid of the carnal desires. Because of that, 'thought crime' is a completely ridiculous idea. Actions are the things that need policed.\n \n \nFrankly, you're just doing the very thing you're accusing other of, here, by wanting to read the scriptures in a way that fits your argument. The real bottom line is that you or anyone else can filter scriptures any way you want. You say Christians don't really follow the teachings of Christ, but then your insistence of what Christ means follows an interpretation (intended for arguing against Christians). I'm sorry, but your position is no more reasonable than theirs because it's just as arbitrary as anyone you are claiming interprets scripture through their own culture and influences. \n\n \n Then it's all pretty unreasonable. You take out of it what you want to take out of it. If people want to justify slavery, drinking, or whatever, they can do it. Even if I'm guilty of doing the same thing, people interpreting scripture to fit their own desires and their own morality and sense of right and wrong was my original point. That's why I still hold strongly to the idea that modern culture has shaped Christian morals just as much as Christian morals have shaped modern culture. \n \n \nSo because he tells one man to do so, you infer that was intended for every person to do? Especially when he-in the very next section-said that the LOVE of money is the root of all evil (not money itself)? Jesus was trying to teach you to be generous, not foolish. The fact is, most people GET this as his intent and meaning. And your view of those passages as so literalistic is not in keeping with what people much smarter than either of is understands it to be.\n\n \n Again, you are taking out of it what you want. When I read about a man who comes up and asks Jesus what the greatest commandment is that he should follow, and what he needs to do, I feel like Jesus' answer should be universal (at least for Christians). Love of money is yet another vague statement anyway. What does it even mean? In one of Jesus' parables, a man who stores up his crops so that he can be comfortable and not worry about what to eat for the foreseeable future is condemned... How is that any different than saving up for retirement, or saving up for vacations or anything like that? It's not; but people will interpret things the way they want to ('Well yeah, I have a lot of nice stuff and money, but I don't love that stuff').\n \n I think a lot of people see it the way you do because it is completely inconvenient, and doesn't really hurt anybody. I don't see what \"smart people\" have to do with it. Smart people like material things as much as anybody.\n \n \nHuman sacrifice is not what's happening in that verse. Clearly, you are starting with various premises and trying to find scriptures to fit your preconceived prejudices even to the point of fitting anything you can that might possibly be construed as making the Judeo-Christian God look like a megalomania-cal ogre.\n\n \n A tribute or offering to God sounds a lot like sacrifice (and being that human sacrifice was done elsewhere in the bible, it's not hard to believe), especially when a ton of animals are also involved... but even if they weren't sacrificed (commentaries don't have much to say about it), I would assume they would instead become some sort of slave. Even so, it's still one of the sickest chapters in the bible... killing all the women children (except for the virgin women), then counting them among the animals as booty and given to the people. Regardless, blood sacrifice is just wrong and doesn't make much sense.",

   "Now for you to go changing it to \"AN\" ideal is completely changing the meaning. Yes, it is AN ideal, but it is not THE ideal for most people.\n\n \n What I mean by \"the ideal\" is that it is so between the two issue of promiscuity versus monogamy. Clearly, society views purity before marriage as an ideal versus premarital sex, even if premarital sex is more common (which seems to be the only argument you have to present against what I'm saying).\n \n \nIf you pray for somebody to get better from their sickness and they do, Ta-dah!

That's definitely taking away the ABILITY to choose.\n \n \nNo, my 'reason' for not believing is that there is no evidence for a God.\n\n \n As the very same arguments that are made interpreting the universe in a way that demonstrates no evidence can also be made that it DOES demonstrate evidence, I come to very different conclusions than you, and your conclusions are no more superior than the billions of theists out there.\n \n \nI don't find the arguments for \"bad things happening\" convincing in the least for a caring God, and based on the rest of your comment, what do you expect heaven to be like? Isn't the very definition of the Christian heaven a place where there is no pain or suffering (and therefore no danger or bad things)? I mean, I've always thought heaven seemed quite dull, but I didn't know Christians felt that way, too.\n\n \n To that argument I would say, tell the starving child he or she should never believe in a better existence because you think it would be 'dull'. To you, the idea of a 'dull' heaven may be repugnant, but to someone truly in a state of suffering I doubt they're too concerned whether or not it might be a boring place. My view is that part of what truly makes heaven as heaven, above and beyond what we would be capable of here in our existence, is that suffering is alleved in a way that doesn't negate freedom. Your reason for bringing that up may be ulterior in that you are trying to play logical conundrums up here rather than truly learning about the issues, but those are my thoughts. \n \n \nExcept for in this very instance, where God took away Pharoah's freedom of choice that would have avoided a lot of suffering by the innocent bystanders (the Egyptian civilians).\n\n \n [*]Yeah but at some point, with a being far beyond our capabilities to understand, we have to simply abide the idea that He is infinitely greater in understanding and we are infinintely less. You're playing up all the things that underscore the very limits of human understanding about God. But these things don't demonstrate God's limits, but rather OUR limits to understand. If He is God, then we can't read these events without factoring in the 900lb elephant of his infinitely greater omniscience.\n \n \nThe random plagues could have been explained by any god to the Egyptians... they could have seen it as being punishment for the sun god or whatever Egyptians worshiped.\n\n \n In fact I've read commentary before that the plagues were intentionally a play on their Egyptian gods. The plagues were done alongside Moses' message, so they WOULD know it wasn't their gods.\n \n \nSorry, but having unlimited authority doesn't make someone blameless or good, and choosing one group of people to be the best and kill off many other nations is pretty bad.\n\n \n Sure it does, because there is no longer any other standard by which to make such a judgment call of 'blameless' or 'good'.\n \n \nMorals are for the good of everybody, so it makes sense that 'everybody' plays into the standard. Society has its own interests at heart\n\n \n Except that's not how things have played out. Many bad things have happened under that so called morality of society's, so clearly there's something lacking in relying on just society protecting it's own interests as the standard of morality.\n \n \nAlso, the Holocaust is immoral.\n \n \n Ah ... weren't you going on earlier about the no-true-scottsman fallacy? I can't remember if that was you or not. But, no, if you are going criticize Christians for only defining God by positive attributes for His morality and not what you perceive as bad, then you don't get to define society's morality in such a way either. ;) \n \n \nIt is absolutely going against 'society' to try and kill off a millions of people in society.\n\n \n Which is why I reject society as a superior source of morality.\n \n \nYou're hopeless with the slavery thing, and of course I am talking about him allowing Israel to do it ......\n .....I mean, it's pathetic. Since when did God care what was 'expected' in other societies? ......\n\n \n Apparently there were plenty of abolitionists in the 19th century that didn't agree with your view of the Bible as later on it DID help overturn slavery, so your view just doesn't hold up in the full scope of history. And again, there were plenty of other sins he didn't single out. I don't know how many ways to say it to get you to understand that. \n \n \n like if I was talking to a Baptist or something... If I bring up something that may be contradictory or difficult within his accepted doctrine, he'll ignore the argument or hand wave it away before considering that his doctrine is wrong (most of the time, anyway).\n\n \n Well, again, I point you to your own comment that \"real world experience doesn't tell you anything.\" You're inferring an unfair generalization when you single out a denomination or Christians in any general way.\n \n \nIf a parent expects his child not to curse, then no, the parent shouldn't curse at all. But... this was an answer to your analogy about a God being outside the moral standards of humans (where God would be like a parent and humans the children).

The problem with the bible, though, is that God breaks his own commandments in front of humans all the time, and even commands them to break the commandments... \n\n \n Just as a parent might allow an older child freedoms he doesn't allow his younger children, for instance. The problem with your 'cursing' analogy is that it uses an issue (cursing) that is already presupposed as wrong over both the parent and child TO BEGIN WITH. I'm of the opinion that it's NOT wrong for God to kill if He wants to. He has his reasons, and there is no obligation on his part to explain them to you. At some point, we have to take into account that infinite knowledge of time and space will, naturally, give a being a better vantage point to make such decisions.\n \n \nBut it's by controlling the actions, not getting rid of the carnal desires. Because of that, 'thought crime' is a completely ridiculous idea. Actions are the things that need policed.\n\n \n You're splitting hairs. And no one said anything about 'thought crime'. I really don't think it's unreasonable for Jesus to have taught for people to work on controlling bad thoughts, and I think you're fighting quite the uphill battle in arguing that it is. \n \n \nWhen I read about a man who comes up and asks Jesus what the greatest commandment is that he should follow, and what he needs to do, I feel like Jesus' answer should be universal (at least for Christians).\n\n \n And I think the reason you're are waiving off any possibility of individual teaching is that it's necessary for you to do so in order to make the argument you are making. :) But your standard there is irrational. We would have to say that Jesus could never make a statement to anyone individually without taking him to have intended it for every person who ever lived.\n \n \nLove of money is yet another vague statement anyway. What does it even mean?\n\n \n What's vague about telling people not to love money? It seems pretty straightforward to me.\n \n \nEven so, it's still one of the sickest chapters in the bible... killing all the women children (except for the virgin women), then counting them among the animals as booty and given to the people. Regardless, blood sacrifice is just wrong and doesn't make much sense.\n\n \n Indeed you're drudging up some of the hardest passages in scripture. There have been whole books written on these issues. But the fact is that many religious people have worked through the issues and come out with different conclusions than you. That speaks to the fact that you're position isn't necessarily the right take on things at all.",

Clearly, society views purity before marriage as an ideal versus premarital sex, even if premarital sex is more common (which seems to be the only argument you have to present against what I'm saying).\n\n \n You've made it clear that by \"promiscuity,\" you mean more than one sexual partner, period. And with that interpretation, it isn't the ideal, as I have already said. If you are trying to say that strict monogamy is ideal vs. super-promiscuity with total irresponsibility and lots of casual sex, then you're not really saying anything (since you are simply picking two extremes of a long line of possibilities). I've also argued that it isn't just 'uncommon' it's simply not what people want to do... You haven't even acknowledged my point here. In society today, men are expected to be promiscuous, which is why single men lie about how many women they've slept with, and why virgins are the butt of so many jokes. You have put forth no evidence that 'purity' is the ideal outside of religious communities, and if you really believe that it is the ideal in society today, then I doubt you spend much time around 'worldly' people.\n \n \nYou're avoiding my question. \n Again, what is your basis to assume religious people \"don't get back answers that are distinguishable from non-answers\"? What is your evidence for this?\n\n \n Unless apparitions and hearing voices are a normal part of prayer (and if they are for you, I would recommend consulting a doctor), there's nothing about prayer that couldn't be explained by pure chance. If you pray for something and it happens, you will consider that God answering your prayer with a 'yes.' If it doesn't happen, it just wasn't God's will, and he answered with a 'no.' The reason an answer is indistinguishable from a non-answer, is because no matter the outcome of a prayer, you can say that God answered positively or negatively. I know that there is no possible outcome that could convince my parents or their Christian friends that God wasn't answering their prayers... Tell me, if you prayed just now and God didn't answer you prayer, how would you distinguish that from God just answering 'no?' If what you pray for happens the way you wanted it to, how do you know it was God instead of just chance?\n \n \nI'm just responding to your position. The standard you seem to demand of God is that he supernaturally intercede to stop bad things in the human race. That's definitely taking away the ABILITY to choose.\n\n \n This is your assertion, not mine. You keep saying that I demand that, but I don't, and haven't. My point wasn't that \"God needs to stop everything (or anything),\" but that if God is willing to take away this oh-so-important gift of free will for comparatively benign things like showing off to the Egyptians while allowing mass murders, then his priorities aren't in line. And again, the reason Pharoah is such a good example is because it is GOd forcing Pharoah to change his decisions... an absolutely direct violatation of free will that cost Pharoah his life, the life of his soldiers, the life of all the Egyptian first born, and who know how many other people and animals...\n \n \nAs the very same arguments that are made interpreting the universe in a way that demonstrates no evidence can also be made that it DOES demonstrate evidence, I come to very different conclusions than you, and your conclusions are no more superior than the billions of theists out there.\n\n \n There is no empirical evidence that points to God or leaves no other option outside of the supernatural, and there is no evidence that points to the supernatural even existing in the first place. So many things that have at some point been 'obvious evidence' for a god or gods have been shown to be completely natural. Your 'conclusions' are not based on the scientific method, and are nothing more than arguments from ignorance and the 'god of the gaps' explanations (and judging from your last line, possible the argumentum ad populum).\n \n \nTo that argument I would say, tell the starving child he or she should never believe in a better existence because you think it would be 'dull'. To you, the idea of a 'dull' heaven may be repugnant, but to someone truly in a state of suffering I doubt they're too concerned whether or not it might be a boring place. My view is that part of what truly makes heaven as heaven, above and beyond what we would be capable of here in our existence, is that suffering is alleved in a way that doesn't negate freedom. Your reason for bringing that up may be ulterior in that you are trying to play logical conundrums up here rather than truly learning about the issues, but those are my thoughts. \n\n \n Well obviously heaven and religion in general is designed to make the poor, suffering people feel better about their pitiful existences. I've never suggested anything different.\n \n This \"logical conundrum\" isn't just me, it's brought about from the bible, from the basic principles of heaven and free will, the very foundation of the whole shebang, and you've again completely contradicted yourself. You have said that free will necessarily leads to suffering, and this is a way to absolve God from the blame (blah blah God can't be blamed), but then you say that you believe free will can exist without suffering. You can't take the blame off God and place it on free will if free will is possible without suffering. Knowing your strange position on authority and morality (that if there's no one to answer to then you can't be 'bad'), I don't know why you even argued this in the first place. God could have just created people for the sheer pleasure of watching them suffer and die, and you would still consider that righteous (since after all, he's God, he can do what he wants, and he's not going to be punished). And if free will and pure happiness can exist together in heaven, then that's precisely what God has done; he's made a bunch of giant ants and put them under the magnifying glass.\n \n \n[*]Yeah but at some point, with a being far beyond our capabilities to understand, we have to simply abide the idea that He is infinitely greater in understanding and we are infinintely less. You're playing up all the things that underscore the very limits of human understanding about God. But these things don't demonstrate God's limits, but rather OUR limits to understand. If He is God, then we can't read these events without factoring in the 900lb elephant of his infinitely greater omniscience.\n\n \n How do you know he's not just an XXX? This is again your hypocrasy. On one hand, you say that God can do anything and is blameless because he answers to no one, and on the other, you defend him as if you don't really believe what you are saying (and you shouldn't, because morality is not about answering to an authority or being punished. That's a very childish view. It's about empathy and caring, and avoiding causing pain and misery.) You are constantly arguing that God is doing things for the greater good, things that we can't understand, but if God answers to no one and can do no wrong, how do you know it's for 'good?' How do you know that it is above our comprehension? Maybe it's easily comprehensible, and he just doesn't care about our suffering, or he may even enjoy it.\n \n \nIn fact I've read commentary before that the plagues were intentionally a play on their Egyptian gods. The plagues were done alongside Moses' message, so they WOULD know it wasn't their gods.\n\n \n Is that a fact? You've read commentaries that say this, huh? So that means at least one guy holds that opinion. I doubt very seriously that the Egyptian common-folk, the ones worst affected by the plagues, had any idea what was going on with the Pharoah and royal affairs. And I doubt that they had any input in the situation either, making the issue of them suffering for Pharoah's actions yet another head scratcher of a decision by God. \n \n \nSure it does, because there is no longer any other standard by which to make such a judgment call of 'blameless' or 'good'.\n\n \n I've already discussed this above, but I still don't understand this premise that morality is simply a product of authority. To you, there is nothing God could do that could be immoral. I think this is ridiculous from a practical standpoint, and even a biblical standpoint. I think just about any Christian will say that God is 'good' and that he simply doesn't do bad things. Even the bible says things along these lines... that he can't lie, there's no unrighteousness in him, he can't be around sin, he is perfect/good, loving, etc. If God describes himself as good, loving, and righteous, and we assume that he's not lying when he says that he can't lie, then we have to expect his actions to show this loving nature. But we don't. God's constant killing sprees, commanded genocides, and all that stuff are not consistent with a God who loves his people. If you love someone, you don't kill them, and you certainly don't send them to a torture pit for eternity. The point of view you have taken, that nothing God does can be bad simply because of his authority, makes everything... his love, his righteousness, his goodness, his inability to lie... it makes it all completely meaningless (and lies). Seriously, is there nothing that God could do that you would consider evil? What if he created humans for the sole purpose of hell, with no intentions of ever setting them free, only because he enjoyed watching them suffer? Would you consider him evil, then? Or would that be within his rights, and not some totally irresponsible abuse of power?\n \n \nExcept that's not how things have played out. Many bad things have happened under that so called morality of society's, so clearly there's something lacking in relying on just society protecting it's own interests as the standard of morality.\n \n Ah ... weren't you going on earlier about the no-true-scottsman fallacy? I can't remember if that was you or not. But, no, if you are going criticize Christians for only defining God by positive attributes for His morality and not what you perceive as bad, then you don't get to define society's morality in such a way either. ;) \n \n Which is why I reject society as a superior source of morality.\n\n \n By saying that I get my morals from society, I don't mean that in the way you seem to imply. I'm not talking about the consensus opinion of society... No, by society influencing my morality, I mean that I consider the interests of other individuals in society. My morals can basically summed up by the golden rule; I take other people's welfare into consideration and do my best to not wrong others. Not because somebody told me to, or because I am afraid of punishment or looking for a reward, but because I can empathize with other people and put myself in their shoes (and hope that others act the same way). \n \n What you are doing, is taking individuals who acted in their own selfish interests, and saying that they are respresentative of the basis of morality, when it's simply not true. Their morality (or actions) comes from ignoring the welfare of society in favor of their own well-being.\n \n \nApparently there were plenty of abolitionists in the 19th century that didn't agree with your view of the Bible as later on it DID help overturn slavery, so your view just doesn't hold up in the full scope of history. And again, there were plenty of other sins he didn't single out. I don't know how many ways to say it to get you to understand that. \n\n \n And you are simply ignoring the other side of the coin, which has been brought up repeatedly, that scripture was also used to justify slavery (and likely kept it around longer than it would have in some parts of the country/world). This just goes to show how unclear the bible is (how it treats it as a normal, acceptable thing, not much different than marriage or any other institution). \n \n I don't deny (or ignore) that there were Christians who were abolitionists, but I also recognize that it took thousands of years before Christians and Jews used the bible against slavery. I know that you can spout the same lines over and over again, and I'm sure there are examples of sins that weren't mentioned (although you haven't really mentioned any particularly convincing examples), but every other specific sin that was mentioned in the bible was pointed out as being a sin. Slavery, as noted, was discussed over and over again throughout the bible, Old and New Testaments, and was never denounced, only regulated. There is no example of any other sin in the bible that compares in that regard.\n \n \nWell, again, I point you to your own comment that \"real world experience doesn't tell you anything.\" You're inferring an unfair generalization when you single out a denomination or Christians in any general way.\n\n \n You're taking my statement out of context. You were saying that you could tell that God doesn't intervene often in everyday life because of 'real world experience.' I said that God could easily make it unnoticeable and indistinguishable from normal, free-will life. \n \n But yeah, I was wrong to generalize, but it's just my observation that most church-going, bible-totin', bible quotin' Christians (the type that would be interested in debating) are quite stubborn, and dead set in their doctrines. This isn't to say that atheists aren't often stubborn and set in their ways, but it isn't about doctrine. \n \n Anyway, one thing I find interesting that you have brought up (in the post before this last one) is that church doctrines often change. It's been a common saying of yours that none of the things I bring up are new, and none have posed problems for the church, and so on, but the truth is that the church just splits up into different denominations whenever they hit one of these snags. That's why there are thousands of different denominations; and you know what they say about a house divided...\n \n \nJust as a parent might allow an older child freedoms he doesn't allow his younger children, for instance. The problem with your 'cursing' analogy is that it uses an issue (cursing) that is already presupposed as wrong over both the parent and child TO BEGIN WITH. I'm of the opinion that it's NOT wrong for God to kill if He wants to. He has his reasons, and there is no obligation on his part to explain them to you. At some point, we have to take into account that infinite knowledge of time and space will, naturally, give a being a better vantage point to make such decisions.\n\n \n Again, your analogy doesn't hold up (or make sense). The ten commandments were for every human, and even so it doesn't justify God breaking commandments in front of people. \n \n No, I'm not presupposing that cursing is wrong for the parent to do. That's why I picked cursing. I don't personally think there is anything wrong with cursing (although I don't curse much, and definitely not around children for the sake of their parents). I said that if the parent told the child that it was wrong, then it would be wrong for the parent to curse in front of the children. It's not that the parent is cursing that is immoral, but that he is doing it in front of the child, to whom he told it was wrong. Do you disagree? Do you think it is okay for a parent to curse in front of his children if he has taught those children that cursing is wrong? The analogy is still solid. \n \n (And by the way, when I said that a parent shouldn't curse at all, that was when talking about an actual parent in the real world, and it wasn't related to the God analogy. In the real world, if a parent doesn't think cursing is wrong, then I don't think the parent should tell a child that it is wrong. I tried to make it clear in the original statement by saying that with relation to the God analogy, a parent can curse on his own time no harm, no foul.)\n \n And remember, the parent/child analogy was yours to begin with.\n \n \nYou're splitting hairs. And no one said anything about 'thought crime'. I really don't think it's unreasonable for Jesus to have taught for people to work on controlling bad thoughts, and I think you're fighting quite the uphill battle in arguing that it is. \n\n \n I'm not splitting hairs. Jesus most definitely said something about thoughtcrime (maybe thoughtsin would be more accurate).\n \n \n 21Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:\n \n 22But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. \n \n ..............\n \n 27Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:\n \n 28But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.\n\n \n If all he said was \"Think good thoughts\" then that would have been fine, but he didn't, and saying that you are in danger of eternal punishment for thinking the wrong thoughts is ridiculous, and purely Big Brother. \n \n \nAnd I think the reason you're are waiving off any possibility of individual teaching is that it's necessary for you to do so in order to make the argument you are making. :) But your standard there is irrational. We would have to say that Jesus could never make a statement to anyone individually without taking him to have intended it for every person who ever lived.\n\n \n If it wasn't a lesson to be followed, what was the purpose? A guy asked Jesus what he needed to do to be saved, and Jesus tells him to love his neighbors and sell his possessions. If that was a lesson for that individual only, then I don't really get the point of it (and I don't know why it would only be a requirement for that individual either). By your logic, you could dismiss every one of the New Testament teachings... \"Oh, he was talking to the poor in the crowd.\" \"Oh that was just for Peter.\" \"Oh that was just for the rich man.\" \"Oh that was just for the churches in Galatia.\" Obviously, that's nonsensical.\n \n \nWhat's vague about telling people not to love money? It seems pretty straightforward to me.\n\n \n This is the kind of thing that is annoying when debating you. You often cut out things I say (sometimes things that are not that important, but often things that are central to my point), and right here you just cut out my entire explanation for saying what I did. \n \n \nLove of money is yet another vague statement anyway. What does it even mean? In one of Jesus' parables, a man who stores up his crops so that he can be comfortable and not worry about what to eat for the foreseeable future is condemned... How is that any different than saving up for retirement, or saving up for vacations or anything like that? It's not; but people will interpret things the way they want to ('Well yeah, I have a lot of nice stuff and money, but I don't love that stuff').\n \n I think a lot of people see it the way you do because it is completely inconvenient, and doesn't really hurt anybody. I don't see what \"smart people\" have to do with it. Smart people like material things as much as anybody.\n\n \n The point was that the rich man who stored up goods and lived comfortably was shown as a specific example of someone loving their wealth, yet that example seems extremely tame to just about any modern day person living above the poverty line.\n \n \nIndeed you're drudging up some of the hardest passages in scripture. There have been whole books written on these issues. But the fact is that many religious people have worked through the issues and come out with different conclusions than you. That speaks to the fact that you're position isn't necessarily the right take on things at all.\n\n \n Those people are either working under the immediate assumption that God is 'good,' something that you have said man can't comment on, or with a similar position to your own, that God can do whatever and it's okay. I'm sorry if I don't buy into the \"I brought you into this world, I'll take you out\" philosophy, but I just don't find it reasonable. And killing all the women and children except for the virgins? That's just so terrible... and I've looked through commentaries on these passages, and the most they say is that God can do as he pleases, or that all the people, children included, were at least partially guilty, or that the children would go to heaven (an assumption not taken from scripture, but from the 'God can't be that big of a jerk' school of thought.)\n \n The ability of religious people to make excuses doesn't speak to my correctness or incorrectness. It only speaks to their faith.",

   "You haven't even acknowledged my point here. In society today, men are expected to be promiscuous, which is why single men lie about how many women they've slept with\n\n \n That may be true, but I don't think it reflects what is the ideal in society. It reflects what happens, but not the ideal.\n \n \nYou have put forth no evidence that 'purity' is the ideal outside of religious communities\n\n \n Certainly I have. I think you are ignoring the evidence I'm putting forward out of stubbornness, frankly. I've pointed out the fact that no parent I've ever heard of encourages premarital sex; if it happens it's rare. On the contrary, there is common encouragement to wait. I note that you are now drawing a distinction between 'religious communities' and 'worldly'. That's doing a better job of avoiding generalizations. I would also say though, that the 'religious' standard of avoiding premarital sex is still very much an ideal that is alive and well in society. I can concede it may not be the \"the\" ideal, though based on observation (not just in religious circles) the avoiding-premarital-sex ideal is certainly more common than any ideal in society of promoting it. (Again, I said an \"ideal\", not behavior)\n \n \nUnless apparitions and hearing voices are a normal part of prayer (and if they are for you, I would recommend consulting a doctor)... \n\n \n No, there is so much wrong with your comments on this, I'm not even sure the best place to start here. I'm not talking about 'apparitions' or voices, though even if I were, that would be fine. Are you intentionally trying to tie religion with the idea of needing to see a doctor? Because that's pretty offensive and not accurate, and certainly an unfair characterization on your part in the least.\n \n First and furthermore, it's pretty unfair to approach this in a way that doesn't take into account the fact that billions of people obviously have religious experience that would lead them to believe prayers get answered. For any other issue, claims of experience would at least be taken into account, but for some reason atheists never seem willing to do that with anything having to do with religion. If people claim they are experiencing their prayers being answered, why should that not be good enough? Why should it matter to you? It's downright irresponsible to just waive off anyone's account of communication just because it happens to have the \"R\" word involved.\n \n Second, you aren't taking into account the fact that most people consider prayer to be a very personal matter--some view hearing from God as an 'internal' thing; that's not claims to audible voices, or seeing ghosts. While I agree that can't be quantified, that is by no means grounds to dismiss it. \n \n Third, it's not valid to claim something is a negative when it is untestable by nature. There have been claims of having 'tested' prayer answers though bizarre experiments of counting positive answers versus non-positive answers against a control group, but these approach prayer as if it is some sort of a magical incantation, which is not the way most religious people approach it, in my experience. The only way to contextualize prayer is view it as communication within a relationship. In other words, to use a 'count' experiment would be like counting the number of times a wife heard from one's husband, or vice versa, when the spouse knows full well they are being analyzed like some lab rat experiment. Maybe, just maybe, God isn't interested in that. (Who could blame him?) I understand you don't believe in prayer, or God. And that's fine--that's your choice. But the problem I have with modern atheism is that it has a tendency to turn atheism into a value judgment. In other words, I rarely ever meet an atheist who merely limits things to mere lack of belief, but instead always judges religious people as being less in some way than he or she is. Usually religion is associated with ignorance on some level, and I see little exception in your posts. It's a classic case of demanding latitude of tolerance, but refusing to give it. It would be fine to hold to the opinion that prayer is not valid if you truly maintained an open mind that it may in fact BE valid and acknowledged that your view is opinion. As it stands, I'm supposed to disregard the claimed experiences of billions of people for your view that prayer is a sham. Now that's unreasonable.\n \n \nThe reason an answer is indistinguishable from a non-answer, is because no matter the outcome of a prayer, you can say that God answered positively or negatively. I know that there is no possible outcome that could convince my parents or their Christian friends that God wasn't answering their prayers... Tell me, if you prayed just now and God didn't answer you prayer, how would you distinguish that from God just answering 'no?' If what you pray for happens the way you wanted it to, how do you know it was God instead of just chance?\n\n \n And to that I would say 'so what?' If there is a God, then he would be sovereign, and therefore how would it not be in his will if he didn't grant one's request? It seems to me that your claim of prayer being 'indistinguishable' from chance doesn't really matter much. I'm not sure anyone has claimed it IS distinguishable from chance in any experimental way.\n \n I think what matters is that these people--your parents no doubt included--are in a relationship. Maybe the reason you don't hear from God is that you aren't. \n \n \nThis is your assertion, not mine. You keep saying that I demand that, but I don't, and haven't. My point wasn't that \"God needs to stop everything (or anything),\" but that if God is willing to take away this oh-so-important gift of free will for comparatively benign things like showing off to the Egyptians while allowing mass murders, then his priorities aren't in line. And again, the reason Pharoah is such a good example is because it is GOd forcing Pharoah to change his decisions... an absolutely direct violatation of free will that cost Pharoah his life, the life of his soldiers, the life of all the Egyptian first born, and who know how many other people and animals...\n\n \n Well, free will versus fatalism is like discussing how many angels fit on the head of a pin. What you present as some logical conundrum is only so because you want to try to put God in a box, logically speaking. Certainly, I don't claim that's possible. (Nor do many theists that I know of.) \n \n \nThere is no empirical evidence that points to God or leaves no other option outside of the supernatural, and there is no evidence that points to the supernatural even existing in the first place.\n\n \n Again, that's only if you discount the religious experience of billions, which would never be a valid approach for any serious social scientific experiment. So I'm certainly not prepared to do that.\n \n \n So many things that have at some point been 'obvious evidence' for a god or gods have been shown to be completely natural. Your 'conclusions' are not based on the scientific method, and are nothing more than arguments from ignorance and the 'god of the gaps' explanations (and judging from your last line, possible the argumentum ad populum).\n\n \n (Shrug) One could also argue that your argument is a fallacy of reverses 'argumentum ad populum' in that you approach the whole issue without even considering accounts and peoples' experience. That is bad science, my friend. I would argue I have not used 'god of the gaps' approach, in that I have not claimed God fills what has not been proven--my point has been that YOU haven't filled those gaps, and therefore I see nothing compelling about your worldview.\n \n \n Well obviously heaven and religion in general is designed to make the poor, suffering people feel better about their pitiful existences. I've never suggested anything different.\n\n \n Obviously, because we can't dare keep the possibility open that theism could possibly actually be the real deal, now could we? I can think of no other issue than modern atheism where conclusions so emphatic are drawn from an inability to obtain empirical evidence. (though I'd argue a lot of the problem is how you interpret it.)\n \n \n This \"logical conundrum\" isn't just me, it's brought about from the bible, from the basic principles of heaven and free will, the very foundation of the whole shebang, and you've again completely contradicted yourself. You have said that free will necessarily leads to suffering, and this is a way to absolve God from the blame (blah blah God can't be blamed)\n\n \n No, I'm not trying to 'absolve God from' any 'blame'. Ironically, I think I probably attribute these things more to God a lot more than you do! It is sort of ironic, isn't it, that between the two of us mine is the only view which even CAN blame God, because your view doesn't even allow for his existence. So please forgive me for not taking your arguments very seriously here when I can't just pretend blaming God is particularly important to you. My statements on free will are simply the best I can do with working under the understanding of an all-powerful and all-knowing God, infinitely 'more' than we are. By no means am I claiming to have all the answers. The problem with arguing the 'logical conundrums' as you have is that it doesn't take into account the gap in understanding between us and God. Again, the '900lb elephant.' You're never going to be able to fit God in your box, Stonewall. This is all ground that has already been covered over the centuries. I suspect the real difference between atheists and theists is that theists aren't troubled by the fact that it can't be done. We prefer some mystery--it's the spice of life. Though evidence in my personal life leads me to believe God certainly exists. I'd be living a lie to pretend that's not the case.\n \n \n .... And if free will and pure happiness can exist together in heaven, then that's precisely what God has done; he's made a bunch of giant ants and put them under the magnifying glass.\n\n \n Ok, then. :) Maybe he has. \n \n \nHow do you know he's not just an XXX?\n\n \n And what if he is? Is humanity supposed to stage some cosmic rebellion coup and throw the divine tyrant out of office? This is God, we're talking about, after all. I'm just not sure your point there is particularly relevant in the grand scheme of things, irrespective of whether or not it is true or not. You could argue one should reject belief in God, but, to play devil's advocate, that ignores other possibilities out there such as the idea that we shouldn't embrace other views of God that isn't dependent on the idea of Biblical inerrancy. Or maybe a different religion that has God in a nicer light nails it instead. Therefore, to throw out theism based on your playing up of these logical problems seems awfully presumptuous and 'overkill'.\n \n \nThis is again your hypocrasy. On one hand, you say that God can do anything and is blameless because he answers to no one, and on the other, you defend him as if you don't really believe what you are saying (and you shouldn't, because morality is not about answering to an authority or being punished. That's a very childish view. It's about empathy and caring, and avoiding causing pain and misery.) You are constantly arguing that God is doing things for the greater good, things that we can't understand, but if God answers to no one and can do no wrong, how do you know it's for 'good?' How do you know that it is above our comprehension? Maybe it's easily comprehensible, and he just doesn't care about our suffering, or he may even enjoy it.\n\n \n We accept it's for good because the one who sets the standard for good and evil for humanity says it's good. If we can't rely on an omniscient God to set that standard, we sure can't rely on humans. And I'll make you a deal: I'll stop accusing you of \"hypocrisy\" every time something isn't consistent if you do the same with me. I think it's safe to say we are both being honest and discussing out of honest intentions, so what say you to us both avoiding such ad hominems?\n \n \nIs that a fact? You've read commentaries that say this, huh? So that means at least one guy holds that opinion\n\n \n Yes, it is a fact that I have read commentaries that say such. More than once.\n \n \nI've already discussed this above, but I still don't understand this premise that morality is simply a product of authority. To you, there is nothing God could do that could be immoral. I think this is ridiculous from a practical standpoint, and even a biblical standpoint. I think just about any Christian will say that God is 'good' and that he simply\n\n \n Again, I can't in good honesty argue morality outside the idea of an omniscient God. IMO you TOO argue that it is a product of authority--society's authority. So I don't see how one can avoid it. I am fully willing to acknoweledge that you don't believe the Bible should be morality's authority, but you still ascribe to an authority for morality, and one that has proven to be no better, as I have pointed out.\n \n \nThe point of view you have taken, that nothing God does can be bad simply because of his \n \n authority, makes everything... his love, his righteousness, his goodness, his inability to lie... it makes it all completely meaningless (and lies). Seriously, is there nothing that God could do that you would consider evil? What if he created humans for the sole purpose of hell, with no intentions of ever setting them free, only because he enjoyed watching them suffer? Would you consider him evil, then? Or would that be within his rights, and not some totally irresponsible abuse of power?\n\n \n Well, to entertain this line of throwing around cosmic-level issues as if we truly can ever rise to the understanding of the mind of God ...\n \n Within what limited amount of human understanding is possible with such issues, I would say that the correct answer to your question is that the dualism of \"evil vs. good\" does not really apply to God. So no, I don't see how one could ever fit God into a box called \"evil\". Not when we're dealing with infinite intelligence here. I think the Bible calls God 'good' because that's a better understanding of God than evil, and I think the very tendency you have of trying to impossibly fit God into such a box goes to show why such simplistic statements were necessary. On a human level, such a statement is probably the best we can do.\n \n \nBy saying that I get my morals from society, I don't mean that in the way you seem to imply. I'm not talking about the consensus opinion of society... No, by society influencing my morality, I mean that I consider the interests of other individuals in society. My morals can basically summed up by the golden rule; I take other people's welfare into consideration and do my best to not wrong others. Not because somebody told me to, or because I am afraid of punishment or looking for a reward, but because I can empathize with other people and put myself in their shoes (and hope that others act the same way).\n\n \n But the ways you 'consider the interests of other individuals' are values that came from society. Ergo, you DO get your morals from society. And your summation of morality summed up by the golden rule sounds a lot like Christ to me. So I'm not sure there's much point in ascribing to your distinctions. Your comments about not doing things \"because you are afraid of punishment\" and so forth are common misunderstandings I hear from atheists about religious motivation. Just because someone is religious doesn't mean they TOO don't also do things out of wanting to consider the best interests of others. Nor does it mean religious do things 'out of fear'. I think I may have said this already, but my experience is that most religious people consider themselves to be in a relationship with God, and the fact so many people DO refer to God in attributes of \"love\" and \"good\" undercuts the idea that it's all just a fear factor. \n \n \nWhat you are doing, is taking individuals who acted in their own selfish interests, and saying that they are respresentative of the basis of morality, when it's simply not true. Their morality (or actions) comes from ignoring the welfare of society in favor of their own well-being.\n\n \n [*] That's fine, as long as you give same levity toward the Church historically, and Christians in the world.\n \n \nAnd you are simply ignoring the other side of the coin, which has been brought up repeatedly, that scripture was also used to justify slavery (and likely kept it around longer than it would have in some parts of the country/world). This just goes to show how unclear the bible is (how it treats it as a normal, acceptable thing, not much different than marriage or any other institution). \n\n \n No, I'm not ignoring that at all--I agree it has been used to justify slavery at times. I'm just saying that the fact it has also been used the OTHER way shows that your view isn't the only one here. And it didn't seem to be unclear to the William Wilberforces' and later folks like ML King, who attributed their views to Biblical influence.\n \n \nI don't deny (or ignore) that there were Christians who were abolitionists, but I also recognize that it took thousands of years before Christians and Jews used the bible against slavery.\n\n \n See *, above.\n \n \nAgain, your analogy doesn't hold up (or make sense). The ten commandments were for every human, and even so it doesn't justify God breaking commandments in front of people.\n\n \n But we aren't referring to the 10 commandments. We are referring to a conversation Jesus had with a rich guy. Think about it. Does it not stand to reason that if Jesus had intended EVERYONE to sell their possessions--rich and poor alike, and everyone in between--that he would have also directed the statement toward someone who wasn't rich? The apostle's themselves more or less asked Jesus right after this \"who then, can be saved?!?!\" To which Jesus said it's easier for a rich man to go through the eye of a needle than enter the Kingdom of God--indicating He was talking about people who are rich. It has also been pointed out that:\n On other occasions, Jesus didn't rebuke friends who owned property or command them to sell their homes and businesses. In fact, He often ate with people and stayed at their homes. Friends like Mary and Martha or Zacchaeus the publican were clearly not among the poor. He was even buried in the newly excavated tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, a wealthy member of the Sanhedrin. (Does the passage about the rich young ruler teach that Jesus expects His followers to give up all of - Answers to Tough Questions )\n \n \nNo, I'm not presupposing that cursing is wrong for the parent to do. That's why I picked cursing. I don't personally think there is anything wrong with cursing (although I don't curse much, and definitely not around children for the sake of their parents). I said that if the parent told the child that it was wrong, then it would be wrong for the parent to curse in front of the children. It's not that the parent is cursing that is immoral, but that he is doing it in front of the child, to whom he told it was wrong. Do you disagree? Do you think it is okay for a parent to curse in front of his children if he has taught those children that cursing is wrong? The analogy is still solid. \n\n \n No, but only because that is still viewed negatively for adults too. The only sort of analogy that would work for that is something adults CAN do in front of children, which is why I used the analogy I did (which you said was terrible). I think your analogy is a bad one, because cursing is still looked down upon for adults as well. A God wouldn't have any restrictions of any degree.\n \n \nIf all he said was \"Think good thoughts\" then that would have been fine, but he didn't, and saying that you are in danger of eternal punishment for thinking the wrong thoughts is ridiculous, and purely Big Brother.\n\n \n Again, I think this is a gross over-simplification of what the Sermon on the Mount was all about.\n \n \nThis is the kind of thing that is annoying when debating you. You often cut out things I say (sometimes things that are not that important, but often things that are central to my point), and right here you just cut out my entire explanation for saying what I did.\n\n \n Ok, I'll try to be more careful.\n \n \nThe point was that the rich man who stored up goods and lived comfortably was shown as a specific example of someone loving their wealth, yet that example seems extremely tame to just about any modern day person living above the poverty line.\n\n \n Well that's all pretty relative isn't it? The very fact it's so relative lends itself to the idea that Jesus wasn't making some general statement that every person, rich, poor, and all in between should sell all their possessions. It just isn't in keeping with other things Jesus taught that a poor person who only owned one sheep would need to sell that and go without, even farther. \n \n More importantly you need to remember that there was basically no middle class in Jesus' culture. There was upper class, and lower class. But that doesn't mean we can assume that \"upper-class\" then means \"middle-class\" now. That's too much of an over-simplification. Jesus explained things when his dsiciples asked about all this, by asserting to them they shouldn't love money.",

   "First of all, sorry this took so long, I've been pretty busy this week.\n \n \nThat may be true, but I don't think it reflects what is the ideal in society. It reflects what happens, but not the ideal.\n \n Certainly I have. I think you are ignoring the evidence I'm putting forward out of stubbornness, frankly. I've pointed out the fact that no parent I've ever heard of encourages premarital sex; if it happens it's rare. On the contrary, there is common encouragement to wait. I note that you are now drawing a distinction between 'religious communities' and 'worldly'. That's doing a better job of avoiding generalizations. I would also say though, that the 'religious' standard of avoiding premarital sex is still very much an ideal that is alive and well in society. I can concede it may not be the \"the\" ideal, though based on observation (not just in religious circles) the avoiding-premarital-sex ideal is certainly more common than any ideal in society of promoting it. (Again, I said an \"ideal\", not behavior)\n\n \n It's the ideal among the people involved (not the parents). The ideal of society would be the standard that society pressures people to fit in to. Yet the pressure from peers from the same age groups, all the popular media... they all push the ideal of men having sex with tons of women (and it's not uncommon to see the media push the same values for women either). \n \n As for parents, I'm not so sure that parents teaching children (at least boys) to wait until marriage is as common as you think. I think a lot of parents don't talk about these issues at all with their children. But even if they did, that might be the ideal for parents, but among the majority of society, when discussing the ideal for their peers, you won't find that view. Especially in the younger generations. If the vast majority of young men think having sex with as many women as possible is the most respectable and expected behavior, then I don't think you can call monogamy the ideal.\n \n \nNo, there is so much wrong with your comments on this, I'm not even sure the best place to start here. I'm not talking about 'apparitions' or voices, though even if I were, that would be fine. Are you intentionally trying to tie religion with the idea of needing to see a doctor? Because that's pretty offensive and not accurate, and certainly an unfair characterization on your part in the least.\n \n First and furthermore, it's pretty unfair to approach this in a way that doesn't take into account the fact that billions of people obviously have religious experience that would lead them to believe prayers get answered. For any other issue, claims of experience would at least be taken into account, but for some reason atheists never seem willing to do that with anything having to do with religion. If people claim they are experiencing their prayers being answered, why should that not be good enough? Why should it matter to you? It's downright irresponsible to just waive off anyone's account of communication just because it happens to have the \"R\" word involved.\n \n Second, you aren't taking into account the fact that most people consider prayer to be a very personal matter--some view hearing from God as an 'internal' thing; that's not claims to audible voices, or seeing ghosts. While I agree that can't be quantified, that is by no means grounds to dismiss it. \n \n Third, it's not valid to claim something is a negative when it is untestable by nature. There have been claims of having 'tested' prayer answers though bizarre experiments of counting positive answers versus non-positive answers against a control group, but these approach prayer as if it is some sort of a magical incantation, which is not the way most religious people approach it, in my experience. The only way to contextualize prayer is view it as communication within a relationship. In other words, to use a 'count' experiment would be like counting the number of times a wife heard from one's husband, or vice versa, when the spouse knows full well they are being analyzed like some lab rat experiment. Maybe, just maybe, God isn't interested in that. (Who could blame him?) I understand you don't believe in prayer, or God. And that's fine--that's your choice. But the problem I have with modern atheism is that it has a tendency to turn atheism into a value judgment. In other words, I rarely ever meet an atheist who merely limits things to mere lack of belief, but instead always judges religious people as being less in some way than he or she is. Usually religion is associated with ignorance on some level, and I see little exception in your posts. It's a classic case of demanding latitude of tolerance, but refusing to give it. It would be fine to hold to the opinion that prayer is not valid if you truly maintained an open mind that it may in fact BE valid and acknowledged that your view is opinion. As it stands, I'm supposed to disregard the claimed experiences of billions of people for your view that prayer is a sham. Now that's unreasonable.\n\n \n You said nothing here except for \"people feel things.\" I ask you, would there be any way to know if God ignored you? If you didn't get a 'feeling' would that mean God wasn't listening or that you simply didn't get a feeling? It clearly makes no difference whether your prayers are answered positively or negatively, so how could you tell the difference between an answer and a non-answer? \n \n And no matter what religion you are, billions of people are having/have had false religious experiences regardless. Muslims can't be having true religious experiences with Muhammad if Christians are having true experiences with Christ. Even if one of the religions is true, there has to be some sort of mass delusion going on.\n \n \nAnd to that I would say 'so what?' If there is a God, then he would be sovereign, and therefore how would it not be in his will if he didn't grant one's request? It seems to me that your claim of prayer being 'indistinguishable' from chance doesn't really matter much. I'm not sure anyone has claimed it IS distinguishable from chance in any experimental way.\n \n I think what matters is that these people--your parents no doubt included--are in a relationship. Maybe the reason you don't hear from God is that you aren't. \n\n \n I used to think I was... but anyway, by saying that prayer isn't distinguishable from chance, you just rephrased my original statement (that you found so offensive). That's all I meant. I could pray to literally anything and get results that are indistinguishable from the results someone gets from praying to God. If I prayed to my dead grandmother, and something came true, I could say that she answered it; if it didn't come true, I could say it wasn't her will, and I could justify it all if I had some sort of feeling, or felt that I still had a relationship with her from beyond the grave. The same basic thing could be said about praying to anything... a loaf of bread, a star in the sky, a political figure...\n \n \nWell, free will versus fatalism is like discussing how many angels fit on the head of a pin. What you present as some logical conundrum is only so because you want to try to put God in a box, logically speaking. Certainly, I don't claim that's possible. (Nor do many theists that I know of.) \n\n \n I don't see how this comment has anything to do with what I said. I said nothing about fate or any of that. I just said that God's priorities are out of wack if he is willing to violate free will for a chance to do some magic tricks while not intervening in the times of serious human suffering. If you aren't going to violate free will then, then don't violate it at all. Some consistency would be nice, that's all.\n \n \nAgain, that's only if you discount the religious experience of billions, which would never be a valid approach for any serious social scientific experiment. So I'm certainly not prepared to do that.\n\n \n As I've already stated, even if the religion of the majority was right, there would still be billions who are wrong, and they are just as sincere and just as convinced by their 'religious experiences' as anyone else. And feelings aren't exactly a scientific way to establish truth. There are millions of people who have had experiences with 'ghosts' and been abducted by 'aliens,' etc. Then there's the whole herd behavior, mass hysteria actions that take place in events like faith healing shows. \n \n \n(Shrug) One could also argue that your argument is a fallacy of reverses 'argumentum ad populum' in that you approach the whole issue without even considering accounts and peoples' experience. That is bad science, my friend. I would argue I have not used 'god of the gaps' approach, in that I have not claimed God fills what has not been proven--my point has been that YOU haven't filled those gaps, and therefore I see nothing compelling about your worldview.\n\n \n If your point is that I haven't filled the gaps (and thus disproved your God answer), then it's nothing more than an argument from ignorance. \n \n About the experiences, I've gone over them already. There are millions of people who have seen ghosts, aliens, demons, or other supernatural/crazy things throughout history, and many of the experiences are similar to each other. It's not bad science to accept the most plausible explanations for these things... or do you also believe in ghosts, alien abductions, near death experiences, and the like? \n \n The human mind is capable of a lot of crazy things, and is very capable of falling for illusions, delusions, hearing and seeing things that aren't there, and more. And the probability of these things happening increases with emotion, stress, or even when you are in groups of people who believe and see similar things. If science accepted things based on feelings, revelation, and personal experience, then we would still be in the dark ages.\n \n \nObviously, because we can't dare keep the possibility open that theism could possibly actually be the real deal, now could we? I can think of no other issue than modern atheism where conclusions so emphatic are drawn from an inability to obtain empirical evidence. (though I'd argue a lot of the problem is how you interpret it.)\n\n \n It was just a rebuttal to yet another of your emotional appeals that was based on nothing. ('Tell that to the suffering children'). Give me a break.\n \n \nNo, I'm not trying to 'absolve God from' any 'blame'. Ironically, I think I probably attribute these things more to God a lot more than you do! It is sort of ironic, isn't it, that between the two of us mine is the only view which even CAN blame God, because your view doesn't even allow for his existence. So please forgive me for not taking your arguments very seriously here when I can't just pretend blaming God is particularly important to you. My statements on free will are simply the best I can do with working under the understanding of an all-powerful and all-knowing God, infinitely 'more' than we are. By no means am I claiming to have all the answers. The problem with arguing the 'logical conundrums' as you have is that it doesn't take into account the gap in understanding between us and God. Again, the '900lb elephant.' You're never going to be able to fit God in your box, Stonewall. This is all ground that has already been covered over the centuries. I suspect the real difference between atheists and theists is that theists aren't troubled by the fact that it can't be done. We prefer some mystery--it's the spice of life. Though evidence in my personal life leads me to believe God certainly exists. I'd be living a lie to pretend that's not the case.\n\n \n What is the point of constantly bringing up how important something is to me? Or my motives? The 'logical conundrum' that I have brought up about free will in heaven is not something that can be wafted away by \"God is infinitely wise.\" It is simply a conclusion from your very own assumptions and statements when compared with what the bible says. If free will must lead to sin (and suffering), and no possibility of sin means you're just an automated robot, and heaven has no sin, then it's a legitimate pickle, and all of those statements can't be correct. \n \n \nOk, then. :) Maybe he has. \n\n \n Then he is abusing his infinite power (and not making a strong case for his infinite wisdom). It would be irresponsible, even if you knew you weren't going to be punished, to inflict pain and suffering (and to actually invent the concepts) when it is avoidable in the first place.\n \n \nAnd what if he is? Is humanity supposed to stage some cosmic rebellion coup and throw the divine tyrant out of office? This is God, we're talking about, after all. I'm just not sure your point there is particularly relevant in the grand scheme of things, irrespective of whether or not it is true or not. You could argue one should reject belief in God, but, to play devil's advocate, that ignores other possibilities out there such as the idea that we shouldn't embrace other views of God that isn't dependent on the idea of Biblical inerrancy. Or maybe a different religion that has God in a nicer light nails it instead. Therefore, to throw out theism based on your playing up of these logical problems seems awfully presumptuous and 'overkill'.\n\n \n No, again you miss the point. It doesn't matter if nothing can be done about it. But if God is just an XXX, then the act of moral supremacy of your religion needs to stop. It has no authority for what is best for humans. \n \n And I'm not ignoring anything. I'm not talking about other religions, I am talking about the Abrahamic religions here... and if you reject the basic belief that God is good and all-loving or that there is a literal heaven (which is basically the only way around the free will in heaven problem), then you really don't have much of a reason to worship God or practice that particular religion in the first place.\n \n \nWe accept it's for good because the one who sets the standard for good and evil for humanity says it's good. If we can't rely on an omniscient God to set that standard, we sure can't rely on humans. And I'll make you a deal: I'll stop accusing you of \"hypocrisy\" every time something isn't consistent if you do the same with me. I think it's safe to say we are both being honest and discussing out of honest intentions, so what say you to us both avoiding such ad hominems?\n\n \n 'Sets the standard for good and evil.' God says what you are supposed to do to gain a reward and to avoid punishment, but 'good' for whom? For God. He doesn't have human interests in mind or else he wouldn't have commanded genocide in the Old Testament, wouldn't have made something as arbitrary as faith the only path to heaven, and he wouldn't have create an eternal punishment for finite crimes. Take Abraham and Isaac for example. If Abraham hadn't been stopped from sacrificing his son, would that have been moral on Abraham's part? Of course not; he would have been a murderer! God's standards are whatever God wants them to be, and that's fine, but there's no reason to believe that they are moral and in the best interests of humans on earth.\n \n And as for relying on society, again, you have it wrong. You can't rely on majority rules morality, but if you take the interests of others to heart, you can certainly rely on that.\n \n As for calling out hypocrisy, sure, I'll stop. (I don't think I've done any of that so far in this post, but if I did, then I'm sorry).\n \n \nAgain, I can't in good honesty argue morality outside the idea of an omniscient God. IMO you TOO argue that it is a product of authority--society's authority. So I don't see how one can avoid it. I am fully willing to acknoweledge that you don't believe the Bible should be morality's authority, but you still ascribe to an authority for morality, and one that has proven to be no better, as I have pointed out.\n\n \n You didn't even seem to read what I said and are just misrepresenting it. My morality is based on empathy for other individuals in society. It isn't about the authority of society... I can think for myself. Would I like to have my things stolen? No, and I have reason to believe others feel this way too, so it would be wrong of me to steal. It isn't about what society says is right and wrong; it's not society's authority. It's about me being able to put myself in the shoes of others and consider how they would feel before acting in my own self interests.\n \n \nWell, to entertain this line of throwing around cosmic-level issues as if we truly can ever rise to the understanding of the mind of God ...\n \n Within what limited amount of human understanding is possible with such issues, I would say that the correct answer to your question is that the dualism of \"evil vs. good\" does not really apply to God. So no, I don't see how one could ever fit God into a box called \"evil\". Not when we're dealing with infinite intelligence here. I think the Bible calls God 'good' because that's a better understanding of God than evil, and I think the very tendency you have of trying to impossibly fit God into such a box goes to show why such simplistic statements were necessary. On a human level, such a statement is probably the best we can do.\n\n \n I've said before that even though God can not be punished, since he is the ultimate authority, he could still act immorally (and according to the bible, did act that way). I have no idea what you are trying to say about \"good\" being a better understanding than evil. If he was neither good nor evil, then why would either of those words be chosen? Why would God be described as someone who can't lie, or look upon sin (things that are 'evil'). I don't believe for a second that there is any reason that human's could not understand that would make the murder of innocent children okay. Same for the concept of torturing people for their beliefs, which is what hell basically boils down to. And I don't think that I am the one trying to 'fit God into a box.' I'm just saying that God is not 'all good' and has committed and commanded many atrocities (according to the bible). I would argue that you are the one trying to put him in a box by saying that all of these acts are necessarily (or most likely) justified in some way that we can't understand and refusing to consider any action of God as immoral. \n \n \nBut the ways you 'consider the interests of other individuals' are values that came from society. Ergo, you DO get your morals from society. And your summation of morality summed up by the golden rule sounds a lot like Christ to me. So I'm not sure there's much point in ascribing to your distinctions. Your comments about not doing things \"because you are afraid of punishment\" and so forth are common misunderstandings I hear from atheists about religious motivation. Just because someone is religious doesn't mean they TOO don't also do things out of wanting to consider the best interests of others. Nor does it mean religious do things 'out of fear'. I think I may have said this already, but my experience is that most religious people consider themselves to be in a relationship with God, and the fact so many people DO refer to God in attributes of \"love\" and \"good\" undercuts the idea that it's all just a fear factor. \n\n \n How is that taking society's values? I wouldn't want people to murder me, I won't murder others. I wouldn't want to be raped, enslaved, treated as inferior, etc. And yeah, Jesus did teach the golden rule. By far the best teaching in the bible, but it's not like he, or the bible writers invented it. The golden rule has been around for a very long time and been taught in various forms by Confucius, Socrates and various ancient Greek philosophers, and seen in many, many religions and ancient cultures.\n \n Christians say that God is love and God is good only because they are afraid that if they don't, they'll get sent to hell... (kidding)... I didn't mean to imply that all moral-acting Christians are good because of fear, and I think most Christians would follow roughly the same morals with or without the bible. But if you don't think Christians have a fear of hell or a fear of God, then I'm afriad you are mistaken. I'm not saying that all Christians do, or that fear is the sole reason of their religion, but it's a big part of the motivation to convert, go to church, and various other things, especially for younger kids and children. And it seems like it's a huge factor in trying to convert other people (telling them they are going to hell, 'hell-fire' or 'fire and brimstone' sermons, etc.), and for many Christian parents, it's a huge factor when their children (or other family members) don't believe. \n \n \n[*] That's fine, as long as you give same levity toward the Church historically, and Christians in the world.\n\n \n There's a big difference here. First of all, I'll agree that no matter what morals a person has, sometimes they will go against them in acts of selfishness or whatever, even though they know they are doing wrong. These things aren't indicitive of their religion's morals, or their beliefs, just about the person himself (like Moses murdering the Egyptian, David's adultery with Bathsheba and subsequent murder of her husband, etc.). \n \n But you were trying to equate my morals to those of 'society' (although you've argued that society's morals come largely from Christianity), then saying that people like Hitler (who at the very least grew up a Catholic, by the way) were representative of where I get my morals (when I've told you my morals aren't much more than a product of empathy, something Hitler quite obviously lacked). I don't doubt that a lot of Christians get most of their morals the same way... but I was saying that \"my way is best\" compared with getting morals from the Bible or from teachings or really from any book. Besides the possibility of misinterpretation, the bible teaches ideas that can't be supported by reason or empathy... the anti-gay stuff, the idea that women are inferior (in Christ there may be no male nor female, but on earth, there sure is, and apparently males are way more important). As for 'misinterpretations' (I'm sure you would say they were misinterpretations, although I wouldn't for several of them), Christians have used biblical morals to justify persecuting other religions and beliefs, witch hunts, wars, government actions/rights of kings, slavery, etc. \n \n \nBut we aren't referring to the 10 commandments. We are referring to a conversation Jesus had with a rich guy. Think about it. Does it not stand to reason that if Jesus had intended EVERYONE to sell their possessions--rich and poor alike, and everyone in between--that he would have also directed the statement toward someone who wasn't rich? The apostle's themselves more or less asked Jesus right after this \"who then, can be saved?!?!\" To which Jesus said it's easier for a rich man to go through the eye of a needle than enter the Kingdom of God--indicating He was talking about people who are rich. It has also been pointed out that:\n On other occasions, Jesus didn't rebuke friends who owned property or command them to sell their homes and businesses. In fact, He often ate with people and stayed at their homes. Friends like Mary and Martha or Zacchaeus the publican were clearly not among the poor. He was even buried in the newly excavated tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, a wealthy member of the Sanhedrin. (Does the passage about the rich young ruler teach that Jesus expects His followers to give up all of - Answers to Tough Questions )\n\n \n I think you've got things confused... this part you quoted had nothing to do with the rich guy; this was about God acting morally, and since I was using mostly Old Testament examples, the ten commandments were exactly what we were talking about. I'll respond about the rich guy here, anyway. The link has a pretty good explanation, but again, it's nothing more than reading in between the lines to make the passages mean what you want them to mean. Multiple places Jesus says to people to give away their possessions, preaches against rich people and possessions, etc. And just owning a house doesn't mean you are wealthy, and since shelter is an essential, I don't see why that would be relevant. Zacchaeus was wealthy, though, and guess what he did as soon as he converted? He gave away half of his possessions. \n \n \nNo, but only because that is still viewed negatively for adults too. The only sort of analogy that would work for that is something adults CAN do in front of children, which is why I used the analogy I did (which you said was terrible). I think your analogy is a bad one, because cursing is still looked down upon for adults as well. A God wouldn't have any restrictions of any degree.\n\n \n It works perfectly if you just assume that cursing is generally accepted among adults (at least in casual situations). I think you are missing the point though. It doesn't matter if the parents doing the action (cursing, sex, smoking, whatever) is wrong, it's the fact that the parent is teaching a child that a certain behavior is wrong, then behaving that way in front of them. But fine, let's pick something that would be okay for the parents and not okay for children. Say a mother and father purposely have sex right in front of their children (or better yet a teenage son and his girlfriend). \n \n Another thing I'd like to ask. You say that God can do whatever he likes (which if he exists, I don't deny), but you say that none of his actions can be considered immoral. But what makes it morally acceptable for God to kill a person (a child, an adult, whatever)? I know he is the ultimate authority, but what gives him the moral right? If a political figure somehow gained absolute authority over the world, his actions wouldn't suddenly become acceptable. So how is it ever not wrong (and yes, I'm talking in the human sense) to kill someone? Just because you have created something doesn't give you the right to destroy it (otherwise parents could morally murder their children). Do you really think that morality is solely authoritarian?\n \n \nWell that's all pretty relative isn't it? The very fact it's so relative lends itself to the idea that Jesus wasn't making some general statement that every person, rich, poor, and all in between should sell all their possessions. It just isn't in keeping with other things Jesus taught that a poor person who only owned one sheep would need to sell that and go without, even farther. \n \n More importantly you need to remember that there was basically no middle class in Jesus' culture. There was upper class, and lower class. But that doesn't mean we can assume that \"upper-class\" then means \"middle-class\" now. That's too much of an over-simplification. Jesus explained things when his dsiciples asked about all this, by asserting to them they shouldn't love money.\n\n \n First of all, I don't know if you meant to quote something else along with this, but what you quoted was a parable warning people not to love money that made no mention of selling possessions. Secondly, when did I say that a poor person would have to sell his only sheep? Jesus taught to give your possessions to the poor, so obviously it wasn't a commandment for the poor who had little or no possessions. And again, as I showed with the \"eat drink and be merry\" parable, 'loving money' is pretty vague, as the example of a materialistic person in the parable seems very, very tame compared even to lower middle class folks these days.",

   "First of all, sorry this took so long, I've been pretty busy this week.\n\n \n No problem, same here.\n \n \nYou said nothing here except for \"people feel things.\" I ask you, would there be any way to know if God ignored you\n\n \n No, but I'm not sure it would matter much either way. If someone asks for something and they don't get it, the result is the same either way--God ignoring someone is basically the same as saying 'no' for all practical purposes\n \n \nAnd no matter what religion you are, billions of people are having/have had false religious experiences regardless. Muslims can't be having true religious experiences with Muhammad if Christians are having true experiences with Christ. Even if one of the religions is true, there has to be some sort of mass delusion going on.\n\n \n Again, the issue of which religion is legit is a different debate than whether or not theism is legit. The fact that theism is interpreted in many different forms doesn't change the fact that most people seems to understand that God(s) exists, on some level. It would be irresponsible to act as if that's not the case and throw out the claims of billions of people.\n \n \nIf I prayed to my dead grandmother, and something came true, I could say that she answered it; if it didn't come true, I could say it wasn't her will, and I could justify it all if I had some sort of feeling, or felt that I still had a relationship with her from beyond the grave. The same basic thing could be said about praying to anything... a loaf of bread, a star in the sky, a political figure...\n\n \n To that I would say, so what? That doesn't really prove anything.\n I also think you're doing your argument a disservice by comparing prayer with communicating with a political figure. People do \"pray\" to political figures all the time, in that they communicate with them. that's the way religious people view prayer with God. It seems to me that the gist of your argument could be boiled down to the fact that you assume prayer isn't legit simply on the basis that you can't physically hear God's voice. I don't think that fact is a problem for most people.\n \n \nThere are millions of people who have had experiences with 'ghosts' and been abducted by 'aliens,' etc. Then there's the whole herd behavior, mass hysteria actions that take place in events like faith healing shows.\n \n About the experiences, I've gone over them already. There are millions of people who have seen ghosts, aliens, demons, or other supernatural/crazy things throughout history, and many of the experiences are similar to each other. \n\n \n But that could be said about anything. If one senses someone is in the next room (and they really are), they could then say 'well I also believe ghosts are real.' The fact there are beliefs out there about ghosts and aliens is a red herring here. It doesn't speak to prayer when it comes to GOD.\n \n \nIt's not bad science to accept the most plausible explanations for these things... or do you also believe in ghosts, alien abductions, near death experiences, and the like? \n\n \n I certainly am not as quick to dismiss them out of hand as you may be. But they are red herrings to the issue of theism. The existence of a creator (even if only as a first cause) is a much, much different question than the existence of ghosts. Theism is not only an experiential matter, but a philosophical one as well. Your example of 'supernatural phenomenon' doesn't necessarily rise to that category. Regardless, all I'm saying is that I don't DISCOUNT things due to lack of empirical evidence (or evidence that can be interpreted differently, anyway). I can't, in good reason, emphatically claim any of this doesn't exist just because I can't 'see' it. \n \n \nThe human mind is capable of a lot of crazy things, and is very capable of falling for illusions, delusions, hearing and seeing things that aren't there, and more. And the probability of these things happening increases with emotion, stress, or even when you are in groups of people who believe and see similar things. If science accepted things based on feelings, revelation, and personal experience, then we would still be in the dark ages.\n\n \n Agreed; I am only pointing it out as a contribution to evidence, not as evidence in whole. So, are you of the view that theism is a global-level hoax, or that it's a global-wide form of delusion in most of the human race? Because your view, logically, has to be one or the other. \n \n \nIt was just a rebuttal to yet another of your emotional appeals that was based on nothing. ('Tell that to the suffering children'). Give me a break.\n\n \n No, it was not meant to be an emotional appeal. It was meant to point out a broader context regarding your 'heaven-would-be-boring' take on things. For some, boredom may be a small price to pay to eliminate suffering.\n \n \nWhat is the point of constantly bringing up how important something is to me? Or my motives?\n\n \n Aren't you arguing the position of atheism, and aren't you an atheist? I am assuming you genuinely mean what you argue, therefore one's posts represent one's views and motives.\n \n \nThe 'logical conundrum' that I have brought up about free will in heaven is not something that can be wafted away by \"God is infinitely wise.\" \n\n \n It has to be. You're delving into an unsolvable puzzle--again, the angels on the head of a pin thing.\n \n \nThen he is abusing his infinite power (and not making a strong case for his infinite wisdom). It would be irresponsible, even if you knew you weren't going to be punished, to inflict pain and suffering (and to actually invent the concepts) when it is avoidable in the first place.\n\n \n What would you have him do, then? What would constitute a non-abuse of power to you? Be stand-offish with humanity? Or create the robotic automaton utopia?\n \n \nNo, again you miss the point. It doesn't matter if nothing can be done about it. But if God is just an XXX, then the act of moral supremacy of your religion needs to stop. It has no authority for what is best for humans.\n\n \n What act of moral supremacy of my religion? To what are you referring to, specifically?\n \n \n'Sets the standard for good and evil.' God says what you are supposed to do to gain a reward and to avoid punishment, but 'good' for whom? For God. He doesn't have human interests in mind\n\n \n That may be the case. I've not argued He did, necessarily here. I'm not sure we can know his reasons, frankly. I think we try to do the best we can in understanding things, but naturally when dealing with an infinite God there are going to be things we encounter that are not understandable. That may not be a sufficient answer for you, but for me, I don't have some need to have God line up in a perfect way logically. I'd really rather he NOT fit in any box, actually. :)\n \n \nGod's standards are whatever God wants them to be, and that's fine, but there's no reason to believe that they are moral and in the best interests of humans on earth.\n\n \n The irony there though, is that because we're dealing with a being of infinitely intelligence, it stands to reason that even a morality on his part that doesn't have humanity's best interest in mind is better than that of humans who DO. Infinity of knowledge matters A LOT. \n \n And again, I don't think humans really do any better anyway. Basically the human race is selfish--it's all about individual self--preservation. At least religion often tends to teach ALTRUISTICALLY putting others first, rather than for the sake of ulterior motives.\n \n \nMy morality is based on empathy for other individuals in society. It isn't about the authority of society... I can think for myself. Would I like to have my things stolen? No, and I have reason to believe others feel this way too, so it would be wrong of me to steal.\n\n \n No, conflating a kindness toward others with a defensiveness about your own possessions. It's naturally for children to not want their stuff taken, but you have to teach them values of not taking things from others. You got those values from society--your parents, others, etc.--that's all I'm saying. Therefore your morality DOES come from society. You 'think for yourself' no differently than religious people do--because those are the values you were influenced toward at some point. If we went by what is apparently your logic of morality, one could conceivably let a child grow up with zero human interaction on a deserted island from birth, and the child would know not to take things from others automatically. That's not a logical assumption at all. Your morality comes from society, whether you admit it or not. The problem is that you are engaging in a common fallacy that atheists engage in: assuming that non-theists don't ALSO engage in adherence to morality outside individuals. Where God is rejected as any moral authority, society just fills the void. We ALL get our morality from somewhere. You claim to 'think for yourself' but the values by which you make those judgments come from the influences of ..... (drum roll) society. That's no better than religious people.\n \n \nI've said before that even though God can not be punished, since he is the ultimate authority, he could still act immorally (and according to the bible, did act that way).\n\n \n I still don't see how you can ascribe morality/immorality to a being who--by very definition--is above any standard of such.\n \n \nAnd yeah, Jesus did teach the golden rule. By far the best teaching in the bible, but it's not like he, or the bible writers invented it.\n\n \n The 'golden rule' (the ethic of reciprocity') isn't all that Jesus was getting at, by any means. I didn't say Jesus 'invented it'.\n \n \nI think most Christians would follow roughly the same morals with or without the bible.\n\n \n Yes, but that's because they get their moral framework from society, which in turn got much of it from Christianity (at least in the west). So we're back to square one!\n \n \nBut if you don't think Christians have a fear of hell or a fear of God, then I'm afriad you are mistaken. I'm not saying that all Christians do, or that fear is the sole reason of their religion, but it's a big part of the motivation to convert, go to church, and various other things, especially for younger kids and children. And it seems like it's a huge factor in trying to convert other people (telling them they are going to hell, 'hell-fire' or 'fire and brimstone' sermons, etc.), and for many Christian parents, it's a huge factor when their children (or other family members) don't believe. \n\n \n If hell is real, then it needs to be factor. I know you don't believe in it, but that's your choice and opinion. Many people do. \n More importantly, it's not like accepting Christ is some awful, awful thing. God has made it pretty easy and straightforward to avoid hell, so I for one don't see what the problem is. \n \n \nBut you were trying to equate my morals to those of 'society' (although you've argued that society's morals come largely from Christianity), then saying that people like Hitler (who at the very least grew up a Catholic, by the way) were representative of where I get my morals (when I've told you my morals aren't much more than a product of empathy, something Hitler quite obviously lacked). I don't doubt that a lot of Christians get most of their morals the same way... but I was saying that \"my way is best\" compared with getting morals from the Bible or from teachings or really from any book. Besides the possibility of misinterpretation, the bible teaches ideas that can't be supported by reason or empathy... the anti-gay stuff, the idea that women are inferior (in Christ there may be no male nor female, but on earth, there sure is, and apparently males are way more important). As for 'misinterpretations' (I'm sure you would say they were misinterpretations, although I wouldn't for several of them), Christians have used biblical morals to justify persecuting other religions and beliefs, witch hunts, wars, government actions/rights of kings, slavery, etc. \n\n \n Well I only use Hitler to illustrate that society, left to it's own devices, doesn'tt necessarily end up empathetic at all. Look, you can't have your cake and eat it too--if you're going to argue that human nature is empathetic on its own, then you have to accept that it can be pretty darn nasty on its own too. Sorry, but I'm just not ready to trust human nature for morality. There have been too many atrocities over the years. \n \n If you were willing to give the same latitude to religion as you give to human society (overlooking the faults), there would be no problem here with your position. But you don't seem willing to do that. You ARE using the no-true-scottsman fallacy when it comes to the human race, but not including such atrocities at Hitler as examples of society's-morality.\n \n \n it's the fact that the parent is teaching a child that a certain behavior is wrong, then behaving that way in front of them.\n\n \n So as long as God does bad things outside the view of humans, you're fine? See, your analogy breaks down. It seems you're basing the standard, then, on whether such acts are visible. I don't think I need to point out to you the obvious problems there.\n \n \nAnother thing I'd like to ask. You say that God can do whatever he likes (which if he exists, I don't deny), but you say that none of his actions can be considered immoral. But what makes it morally acceptable for God to kill a person (a child, an adult, whatever)? \n\n \n \"Morally acceptable\"? The question presupposes a premise. It's not moral or immoral if God does it. He just does it. He's God; He can do what he wants. \n \n \nI know he is the ultimate authority, but what gives him the moral right?\n\n \n Does a homeowner have a moral right to kill an anthill on his property? I'd say yes. Moreover, I'd say it's not even a \"moral\" conundrum at all. All of your questions are worded as if we are somehow on the same level as God to begin with, as if we aren't the ants. Yet he's infinitely \"more\" than us than the home-owner is over the ants. There's no comparison between us and God. The very questions of moral comparison themselves are ludicrous, IMO.\n \n \nSecondly, when did I say that a poor person would have to sell his only sheep? Jesus taught to give your possessions to the poor, so obviously it wasn't a commandment for the poor who had little or no possessions. \n\n \n Well therein is the problem with your generalist take: being rich is relative. The poor person who owns a sheep may BE rich compared to the poor person who doesn't own any sheep. By your view that Jesus means the rich should sell all their possessions and give to the poor, even the poor people in society would have to sell what little they have if there is anyone in even worse predicament. This ridiculousness is yet another reason to know that Jesus wasn't trying to institute some social/government policy here. He wasn't trying to advocate socialism or communism. He was trying to tell people to be compassionate.",

   "No, but I'm not sure it would matter much either way. If someone asks for something and they don't get it, the result is the same either way--God ignoring someone is basically the same as saying 'no' for all practical purposes\n\n \n And getting a 'yes' would for all intents and purposes be the same as getting lucky and God ignoring you. That was the reason for my original statement.\n \n \nAgain, the issue of which religion is legit is a different debate than whether or not theism is legit. The fact that theism is interpreted in many different forms doesn't change the fact that most people seems to understand that God(s) exists, on some level. It would be irresponsible to act as if that's not the case and throw out the claims of billions of people.\n\n \n This argument still makes no sense. If one guy sees and hears Jesus talking to him, another guy has a vision of Muhammad, and another guy sees Ganesha, at least two of them have to be wrong. They aren't compatible beliefs, and they can't all belong to a legitimate, overall theism... and this is the way things are. Most people who have had these experiences would probably bring up their experience to 'prove' that their religion is the right one. Again I point you to the millions of claims about ghosts and aliens and other crazy things... \n \n \nTo that I would say, so what?

If one senses someone is in the next room (and they really are), they could then say 'well I also believe ghosts are real.' The fact there are beliefs out there about ghosts and aliens is a red herring here. It doesn't speak to prayer when it comes to GOD.\n\n \n It wasn't about prayer, it was about mass delusion and having false experiences. It certainly isn't a red herring when you ask yourself, what is the difference between someone seeing a ghost or alien in their room, versus an angel or other religious figure? There is no difference in the mechanics of the experience, just in what they see and interpret. \n \n \nI certainly am not as quick to dismiss them out of hand as you may be. But they are red herrings to the issue of theism. The existence of a creator (even if only as a first cause) is a much, much different question than the existence of ghosts.

If you want to change the subject, then that's fine, but you've given me no reason to believe religious experiences are any more valid than alien abductions or ghost sightings.\n \n \nAgreed; I am only pointing it out as a contribution to evidence, not as evidence in whole. So, are you of the view that theism is a global-level hoax, or that it's a global-wide form of delusion in most of the human race? Because your view, logically, has to be one or the other. \n \n \n I believe it's a delusion (religion sounds almost exactly like wikipedia's definition of delusion: \"A delusion is a belief that is either mistaken or not substantiated and is held with very strong feelings or opinions and expressed forcefully\"). I don't think that 'hoax' is a good word for it, since the people who originally came up with religion probably believed whole-heartedly in various gods. I think religion just rose up naturally as a way to explain the unknown and give comfort and hope to people when faced with death. Things just progressed from there.\n \n I also am much more sympathetic toward people who either believe in or are agnostic to a non-personal, prime-mover, deistic god. There's no evidence to support the idea of a deistic god, but as far as religion goes, it is pretty reasonable.\n \n \nAren't you arguing the position of atheism, and aren't you an atheist? I am assuming you genuinely mean what you argue, therefore one's posts represent one's views and motives.\n\n \n So? You say things like \"I don't think you really care about this\" and using that as a way to dismiss my arguments. My arguments are valid on their own merits, it shouldn't matter whether I believe in a god or not.\n \n \nIt has to be. You're delving into an unsolvable puzzle--again, the angels on the head of a pin thing.\n\n \n The 'angels on the head of a pin' thing is nothing like the question of free will in heaven. That's just a nonsensical question that can be answered by saying that angels are incorporeal. It's not a logical problem at all and doesn't deal with contradictions. The free will issue, on the other hand, deals with contradictions that you yourself have made. \n \n I'll repost what I said in the last post that you cut out and didn't respond to: \"If free will must lead to sin (and suffering), and no possibility of sin means you're just an automated robot, and heaven has no sin, then it's a legitimate pickle, and all of those statements can't be correct.\" Logically, it either leads to the dismissal of the idea of a sinless heaven, or it means that God is the reason for suffering, not free will. It's only an 'unsolvable puzzle' because the doctrine is self-defeating.\n \n \nWhat would you have him do, then? What would constitute a non-abuse of power to you? Be stand-offish with humanity? Or create the robotic automaton utopia?\n\n \n Let me refresh this conversation. I said \n \n \nAnd if free will and pure happiness can exist together in heaven, then that's precisely what God has done; he's made a bunch of giant ants and put them under the magnifying glass.\n\n \n You then said \"Okay, maybe he has.\" That's when I said he was abusing his power. \n \n So the obvious answer would be this: Take away the magnifying glass. If free will and pure happiness could exist together in heaven, then that's the way earth should have been from the beginning. If those two things were compatible, we wouldn't be robots. If those things aren't compatible, then a 'sinless' heaven was an immoral thing to promise, since that means taking away human free will. If that was the ultimate goal (since heaven lasts forever), then he should have just made us robots from the start and saved us all the headaches. OR he could just scrap the heaven thing, make people immortal and impervious to physical pain, set them up on a place like earth and punish any sinners himself (with 100% accuracy). \n \n \nWhat act of moral supremacy of my religion? To what are you referring to, specifically?\n\n \n Touting that the Christian morality is better than anyone else's, which seems to have been the entire point of you starting this thread (\"This guy was a Christian and did a good thing. How many atheists would have done the same?\"), and was a major topic in the early going as you would imply that when non-believers did good, it was because they were acting \"Christian.\" It's much more than just you or this thread, it's Christianity as a whole touting the bible's morals as superior, then trying to force those beliefs on people who don't feel the same way (homosexuality and the like). \n \n \nThat may be the case. I've not argued He did, necessarily here. I'm not sure we can know his reasons, frankly. I think we try to do the best we can in understanding things, but naturally when dealing with an infinite God there are going to be things we encounter that are not understandable.

Infinity of knowledge matters A LOT. \n \n And again, I don't think humans really do any better anyway. Basically the human race is selfish--it's all about individual self--preservation. At least religion often tends to teach ALTRUISTICALLY putting others first, rather than for the sake of ulterior motives.\n\n \n Really? You can be really evil and really smart at the same time. \"He's much smarter than me, so he probably knows what is best for me better than I do\" sounds like propaganda a totalitarian government would try to feed people.\n \n \nNo, conflating a kindness toward others with a defensiveness about your own possessions. It's naturally for children to not want their stuff taken, but you have to teach them values of not taking things from others.

That's no better than religious people.\n\n \n Who says that non-religious people don't put others first? Who says that it's only the religious who teach these things? Since you believe Christianity to be true, you must believe that other religions and philosophies are man made, yet many of these also teach about putting others first. Why must non-religious people have ulterior motives? I think of myself as being a pretty altruistic person, and I definitely don't feel like I do it out of ulterior motives. By the way, this is just another example of pushing the 'moral supremacy' of your religion.\n \n I was taught to think. When I was a child, I probably did do things more out of selfishness. But as I've matured, my morals have changed significantly, specifically after I ditched religion. And a defensiveness about my own possessions? It's not about my possessions. I don't not steal because I'm afraid someone would take my stuff, I don't steal because I know they wouldn't want somebody to take theirs. I also haven't made any claims about non-theists as a whole; I've just spoke about myself. \n \n \nI still don't see how you can ascribe morality/immorality to a being who--by very definition--is above any standard of such.\n\n \n He's not above any standard. He's above punishment. I still don't see how you can't see the difference in morality and authority.\n \n \nThe 'golden rule' (the ethic of reciprocity') isn't all that Jesus was getting at, by any means. I didn't say Jesus 'invented it'.\n\n \n No, that's not all he was teaching, but it would have probably been better had he just left it at that.\n \n \nYes, but that's because they get their moral framework from society, which in turn got much of it from Christianity (at least in the west). So we're back to square one!\n\n \n You know I disagree with that in the first place (mainly because 'Christian societies' took about 1500 years before reaching anything close to modern morals), but I'm saying if the bible and Christianity never existed, the morals would likely be the same anyway. Similar ethics have sprung up elsewhere without Christianity, and there's no reason to believe they would be much different if it had never existed. After all, those 'good morals' were good before they were taught by the Jews and Christians... it's not like the religion is what made them good morals, and I think as society evolved, eventually 'good morals' would become prevalent.\n \n \nIf hell is real, then it needs to be factor. I know you don't believe in it, but that's your choice and opinion. Many people do. \n More importantly, it's not like accepting Christ is some awful, awful thing. God has made it pretty easy and straightforward to avoid hell, so I for one don't see what the problem is. \n\n \n Criminal in court: \"I don't see what the problem is. I made it very clear and easy what the lady had to do in order to avoid being shot. It's not like sex (or giving up your purse, etc.) is some awful, awful thing.\" It doesn't matter, torturing someone for any amount of time for his beliefs is as immoral as it gets, and God built a place to do that eternally. Do you think that torturing someone for his beliefs (or anything else, really) is acceptable?\n \n And by the way, believing something that you don't believe is not easy in the least. Do you think it would be easy for you to 'choose' to sincerely believe in Big Foot or the Loch Ness Monster, or ancient aliens?\n \n \nWell I only use Hitler to illustrate that society, left to it's own devices, doesn'tt necessarily end up empathetic at all. Look, you can't have your cake and eat it too--if you're going to argue that human nature is empathetic on its own, then you have to accept that it can be pretty darn nasty on its own too. Sorry, but I'm just not ready to trust human nature for morality. There have been too many atrocities over the years. \n \n If you were willing to give the same latitude to religion as you give to human society (overlooking the faults), there would be no problem here with your position. But you don't seem willing to do that. You ARE using the no-true-scottsman fallacy when it comes to the human race, but not including such atrocities at Hitler as examples of society's-morality.\n\n \n Have I ever claimed any of this? I've talked about my own morality, and the ability to use reason to choose between right and wrong. I haven't made any claims about society's as a whole (I even denied that I share the same morals as society. I don't see how I could have been much clearer). I've said all along that there are good people and there are bad people. \n \n I find it ineresting that you say you aren't ready to trust human morality... again, I've said over and over again that you should think for yourself and not trust the majority opinion at the time. But are you saying that you aren't ready trust yourself for your morality? I find this a little odd, because you've said that the bible isn't a perfect moral code (and that it doesn't try to be). I guess leaning on your religion and praying to make good decisions is something that Christians do, though. \n \n \nSo as long as God does bad things outside the view of humans, you're fine? See, your analogy breaks down. It seems you're basing the standard, then, on whether such acts are visible. I don't think I need to point out to you the obvious problems there.\n\n \n You are avoiding the dilemma here. Are you saying that teaching that a certain behavior is wrong, then behaving that way in front of those you have taught is acceptable? This whole argument is about God in his relations to humans, so his 'invisible' actions are irrelevant, but you are attacking me based on an assumption of your own. You stated that God wasn't bound by his own commandments (which is why we spent time trying to pick something that would be acceptable for a parent and not a child). I was just showing that even if the action wasn't wrong for God himself to do, it was wrong to do it in front of people whom he taught that it was wrong. You've continued to avoid this.\n \n That said, I'm of the belief that if there is some type of God, then he is capable of wrong-doing whether it is front of humans or not (wrong-doing toward other non-humans or heavenly beings or whatever). There are reasons why certain things are immoral, and these reasons don't change depending on the person doing the deed.\n \n \n\"Morally acceptable\"? The question presupposes a premise. It's not moral or immoral if God does it. He just does it. He's God; He can do what he wants. \n\n \n He may be able to do what he wants, but that doesn't mean morality doesn't apply. I also find it, simply put, condradictory to the bible and every religious view I've heard, that God isn't capable of doing moral or 'good' things. If God decided to specifically help somebody who was in need, how would that not be a moral action?\n \n \nDoes a homeowner have a moral right to kill an anthill on his property? I'd say yes. Moreover, I'd say it's not even a \"moral\" conundrum at all. All of your questions are worded as if we are somehow on the same level as God to begin with, as if we aren't the ants. Yet he's infinitely \"more\" than us than the home-owner is over the ants. There's no comparison between us and God. The very questions of moral comparison themselves are ludicrous, IMO.\n\n \n Why would God care so much about us if we are nothing more than ants? Why would he bother with morals? Why would he send himself to die? In the bible, God often relates to individuals, came down into a human form, created man in his own image, and often behaves like a human (jealousy, rage, happiness, etc.) I think the analogy of us to ants is a bit poor.\n \n That said, I would consider torturing any living thing to be immoral, even ants (not killing them, though). I also think it would be immoral to judge and punish ants according to a moral code, and to make the analogy a little more accurate, I think it would be immoral to 'kill' an anthill if you were the one who put it there in the first place. \n \n \nWell therein is the problem with your generalist take: being rich is relative. The poor person who owns a sheep may BE rich compared to the poor person who doesn't own any sheep. By your view that Jesus means the rich should sell all their possessions and give to the poor, even the poor people in society would have to sell what little they have if there is anyone in even worse predicament. This ridiculousness is yet another reason to know that Jesus wasn't trying to institute some social/government policy here. He wasn't trying to advocate socialism or communism. He was trying to tell people to be compassionate.\n\n \n Wow, more putting words in my mouth. I never said he was trying to set up a government policy, and I'm pretty sure I never implied that a rich person was supposed to give literally everything away. With the sheep-man, if he was able to use his sheep to help people less fortunate than himself, then yes, that's what he would have done, but if he was barely able to take care of himself, then he obviously wouldn't have been able to give away anything.",

   "And getting a 'yes' would for all intents and purposes be the same as getting lucky and God ignoring you. That was the reason for my original statement.\n\n \n Again, why should it matter? It is unreasonable to rule out a cause-and-effect simply on the basis that it could have happened by chance--the only reason one should want to do that is if they are out to disprove God's providence. I just don't see the point, except that some might have an 'axe to grind' regarding theism.\n \n \nThis argument still makes no sense. If one guy sees and hears Jesus talking to him, another guy has a vision of Muhammad, and another guy sees Ganesha, at least two of them have to be wrong. They aren't compatible beliefs, and they can't all belong to a legitimate, overall theism... and this is the way things are. Most people who have had these experiences would probably bring up their experience to 'prove' that their religion is the right one. Again I point you to the millions of claims about ghosts and aliens and other crazy things&#8230;\n\n \n It is still better evidence for theism than against it--the 'divine' (if you are going to take the realm-of-evidence approach for theism to begin with that is, which I don't really hold to. Which I explain more below). The extent of the case you can make is that different people interpret theism in different ways. It might very well be that one or more of those religions is legit, but at least all the other ones aren't so naive to assume we are alone in this existence and that there is no 'other' out there. The question of WHICH religion is accurate in regards to theism is a different debate. Acknowledging the existence of that \"otherness\" is square one; it's a starting point at least.\n \n \nI'm not trying to 'prove' anything, I'm defending my original statement that an answered prayer is indistinguishable from an unanswered prayer, which, although you originally seemed to take offense to, is what you basically conceded by stating that it would be impossible to tell if God was to ignore your prayers.\n\n \n I only say its offensive because it's not really fair to refuse to take people's experiences into account just because it has the \"R\" word involved, and experience is taken into account on pretty much anything else. We don't really need to go into the theism issue automatically slanted just because we don't want to believe in a god. \n \n \nI believe it's a delusion (religion sounds almost exactly like wikipedia's definition of delusion: \"A delusion is a belief that is either mistaken or not substantiated and is held with very strong feelings or opinions and expressed forcefully\"). I don't think that 'hoax' is a good word for it, since the people who originally came up with religion probably believed whole-heartedly in various gods. I think religion just rose up naturally as a way to explain the unknown and give comfort and hope to people when faced with death. Things just progressed from there.\n\n \n So most people in the world are under a world-wide mass delusion? That's really what you believe? That's what it sounds like to me.\n \n \nThe 'angels on the head of a pin' thing is nothing like the question of free will in heaven. That's just a nonsensical question that can be answered by saying that angels are incorporeal. It's not a logical problem at all and doesn't deal with contradictions. The free will issue, on the other hand, deals with contradictions that you yourself have made. \n\n \n No, the phrase is used as a figure of speech to refer to discussions that can't be resolved, because they deal with issues that are too metaphysical. They are not just 'unknown' issues, but rather unknowable' issues. That's a different matter than whether or not evidence does or does not support something. It is not an issue of the realm of the 'evidentiary' to begin with. And that's what many of these issues are. This is a lot of the heart of the frustration I have with atheism--it portends to determine theism by way of science, i.e. what measures things in the natural, physical world. It would not be called 'supernatural' to begin with if it were natural. Therefore it makes no sense to me that we should go by what measures the physical to determine the validity of the non-physical. It is applying a method for measuring the physical/natural to the non-physical/supernatural, and therefore applying empiricism to what is not of the realm of the empirical to begin with. That's why science is ultimately un-compelling in overturning religion. \n \n \nI'll repost what I said in the last post that you cut out and didn't respond to: \"If free will must lead to sin (and suffering), and no possibility of sin means you're just an automated robot, and heaven has no sin, then it's a legitimate pickle, and all of those statements can't be correct.\" Logically, it either leads to the dismissal of the idea of a sinless heaven, or it means that God is the reason for suffering, not free will. It's only an 'unsolvable puzzle' because the doctrine is self-defeating.\n\n \n Or leads one to believe that the rules of logic we hold to are inadequate for framing the issue of what the afterlife would be if it exists. That's the option you didn't include there.\n \n \nYou then said \"Okay, maybe he has.\" That's when I said he was abusing his power. \n\n \n But your judgment that the homeowner is abusing his power is from the perspective of the ant. Naturally, the ant is never going to view any action of the homeowner to kill ants on his property as anything but an abuse of power, because the ant is not privy to the much greater perspective and understanding of the homeowner. It can never rise to that level of understanding. \n \n \nSo the obvious answer would be this: Take away the magnifying glass. If free will and pure happiness could exist together in heaven, then that's the way earth should have been from the beginning. If those two things were compatible, we wouldn't be robots. If those things aren't compatible, then a 'sinless' heaven was an immoral thing to promise, since that means taking away human free will. If that was the ultimate goal (since heaven lasts forever), then he should have just made us robots from the start and saved us all the headaches. OR he could just scrap the heaven thing, make people immortal and impervious to physical pain, set them up on a place like earth and punish any sinners himself (with 100% accuracy).\n \n \n Maybe 'make people immortal and impervious to physical pain, set them up on a place like earth and punish any sinners himself' is exactly what God is doing, in the eternal scheme of things. I think religion would often say that is exactly what is going on. It tends to view things in a much more eternal mindset, rather than just a perspective of the here-and-now. \n \n Regardless, I fully realize that religion can never be fully squared with human logic. That is not something I claim. But it's failure to do so is not enough for me to throw the baby out with the bathwater and assume the theistic doesn't even exist. Acknowledging logical problems is one thing; making the leap to the idea that there is no god based on that is another. In my opinion it's pretty poor reasoning.\n \n \nTouting that the Christian morality is better than anyone else's, which seems to have been the entire point of you starting this thread (\"This guy was a Christian and did a good thing. How many atheists would have done the same?\"), and was a major topic in the early going as you would imply that when non-believers did good, it was because they were acting \"Christian.\" It's much more than just you or this thread, it's Christianity as a whole touting the bible's morals as superior, then trying to force those beliefs on people who don't feel the same way (homosexuality and the like). \n\n \n But that's what everyone does. People argue their points because they believe their view is the RIGHT one. Otherwise, they wouldn't be making their arguments. If you're going to demand Christianity drop it's claim to moral supremacy, then you need to make that demand of everyone, including yourself (since you seem to think yours--based on 'think-for-yourself--is superior to religion's). You'd have to make that demand of anyone who argues anything that involves an opinion about human behavior or conduct. This is a double-standard I see on the part of critics of Christianity. They criticize Christianity for holding up its moral stance as best, as if anyone making judgments about what is best human conduct aren't doing the same thing. Every person than has given any thought to human conduct has things they believe are right and wrong, and therefore do hold to the idea that what they think is best. People have standards, and when they argue those standards they are effectively 'touting their morality as better than everyone else's', as you put it. Else they wouldn't be arguing their view. And that includes the standard you seem to espouse. \n \n \nIf I can't see him, hear him, find any evidence of his existence, and the beliefs associated with him are illogical, then why should I even begin to believe in him?\n\n \n It's up to you, of course. No one here has said you have to believe in God. I don't understand how anyone couldn't, but if you don't then that's up to you. Today's atheism doesn't really stop there, though, does it? It goes farther and makes a value judgment at those who choose differently. It associates belief in God with ignorance, which goes much farther than mere 'lack-of-belief.' If atheists merely stopped at lack-of-belief, I don't think there would be a problem here.\n \n \nWho says that non-religious people don't put others first? Who says that it's only the religious who teach these things? Since you believe Christianity to be true, you must believe that other religions and philosophies are man made, yet many of these also teach about putting others first. Why must non-religious people have ulterior motives? I think of myself as being a pretty altruistic person, and I definitely don't feel like I do it out of ulterior motives. By the way, this is just another example of pushing the 'moral supremacy' of your religion.\n \n I was taught to think. When I was a child, I probably did do things more out of selfishness. But as I've matured, my morals have changed significantly, specifically after I ditched religion. And a defensiveness about my own possessions? It's not about my possessions. I don't not steal because I'm afraid someone would take my stuff, I don't steal because I know they wouldn't want somebody to take theirs. I also haven't made any claims about non-theists as a whole; I've just spoke about myself. \n\n \n And is it not the least bit interesting to you that those morals you hold to now are after prolonged exposure to society and other people? Society does influence you, and I see every reason to to believe that the values you hold to are due to society's influence. \n \n I've said all along here there is no way to know for sure if religion is ultimately the reason for these things, but I find it hard to believe its some accident that you would hold to these values after living in a culture so influenced over the centuries by a given religion in the west, in particular. I just think religious values are very much an undercurrent and long-term influence on culture. Yes, non-religious persons can put others first. But they are still influenced by a culture heavily influenced by religion. The only real test would be to see if a person somehow raised with no human interaction in society at all would be altruistic. My suspicion is that he or she would not be, but of course that is just my opinion.\n \n \nHe's not above any standard. He's above punishment. I still don't see how you can't see the difference in morality and authority.\n\n \n Morality involves an outside and, by definition, higher standard. There is no such higher standard in this case. I don't see how you can only conflate morality and authority.\n \n \nCriminal in court: \"I don't see what the problem is. I made it very clear and easy what the lady had to do in order to avoid being shot. It's not like sex (or giving up your purse, etc.) is some awful, awful thing.\" It doesn't matter, torturing someone for any amount of time for his beliefs is as immoral as it gets, and God built a place to do that eternally. Do you think that torturing someone for his beliefs (or anything else, really) is acceptable?\n\n \n That's a very poor analogy.\n A better analogy would be a homeowner who gets a dog that would hurt and kill people in his fence, but makes it very clear for people to avoid the dog and puts up an 'beware-of-dog' sign. Is the homeowner really culpable if pedestrians don't adhere to the signs, and go walking in his back yard anyway? You keep bringing up this 'torturing people' thing (because it paints God in such a bad light, no doubt), but the very religion that purports hell so much that you are referring to mainly here has made it absolutely clear how to avoid it, in pretty darn clear terms. So clear in fact, that people are without excuse.\n \n \nYou are avoiding the dilemma here. Are you saying that teaching that a certain behavior is wrong, then behaving that way in front of those you have taught is acceptable? This whole argument is about God in his relations to humans, so his 'invisible' actions are irrelevant, but you are attacking me based on an assumption of your own. You stated that God wasn't bound by his own commandments (which is why we spent time trying to pick something that would be acceptable for a parent and not a child). I was just showing that even if the action wasn't wrong for God himself to do, it was wrong to do it in front of people whom he taught that it was wrong. You've continued to avoid this.\n\n \n It would matter if it weren't for the fact that God's teachings are for human conduct. I just don't see how it is you aren't getting this. If one teaches his dog to not dig holes in the yard, it doesn't mean the homeowner can never go and dig a hole in his yard. How can you not understand that morality for his creatures are behavioral codes intended for them and not the creator? The only reason for your \"dilemma\" is that you are determined to insist that omnipotent and omniscient God has to abide by the very same rules that he makes for his created humans. \n \n \nThat said, I'm of the belief that if there is some type of God, then he is capable of wrong-doing whether it is front of humans or not (wrong-doing toward other non-humans or heavenly beings or whatever). There are reasons why certain things are immoral, and these reasons don't change depending on the person doing the deed.\n\n \n Then he would NOT be God. To be able to judge him puts him under an over-arching standard, meaning he is not God, after all.\n \n \nWhy would God care so much about us if we are nothing more than ants? Why would he bother with morals? Why would he send himself to die?\n\n \n I guess he's just benevolent like that. :-)\n \n \nWow, more putting words in my mouth.

With the sheep-man, if he was able to use his sheep to help people less fortunate than himself, then yes, that's what he would have done, but if he was barely able to take care of himself, then he obviously wouldn't have been able to give away anything.\n\n \n They why are you arguing from the standpoint that God expects Christians (in general) to sell all their possessions and give to the poor? Are you saying that DOESN'T apply to all Christians? If you don't think it does, I'm not sure why you're arguing the stance you are.",

I just don't see the point, except that some might have an 'axe to grind' regarding theism.\n\n \n I never suggested that you rule it out; I only made the statement that there was no distinguishing between answers and non-answers, which seems to be agreed upon by you at this point. I did this because you said prayer was like a conversation between a couple, and we've only continued talking about it because you took offense to the idea that answers and non-answers were indistinguishable, and that you couldn't know if God was ignoring you or saying no, or if it was luck, or whatever. It was you who tried to call me out on something I said, but now you are playing defense like I was trying to make some further point. \n \n But while we're at it, I fail to see the 'reason' behind the belief that God acts as a cosmic magic 8-ball when everything that happens is natural and can be explained by chance and probabilities, and (as mentioned) answered prayers and unanswered prayers are indistinguishable. Maybe you can't completely rule out any possibility, but you can't reasonably justify the belief, either... no more than the belief in astrology or praying to idols, other gods, or muffins.\n \n \nIt is still better evidence for theism than against it--the 'divine' (if you are going to take the realm-of-evidence approach for theism to begin with that is, which I don't really hold to.

Dreams and individual hallucinations are no evidence of anything.\n \n \nI only say its offensive because it's not really fair to refuse to take people's experiences into account just because it has the \"R\" word involved, and experience is taken into account on pretty much anything else. We don't really need to go into the theism issue automatically slanted just because we don't want to believe in a god. \n\n \n Experiences and things people say are accepted when the claims are normal and reasonable. If I say that my truck gets a fuel mileage of 20 miles per gallon, then your level of suspicion is going to be pretty low, because that is very normal. If I say my truck gets 120 mpg, then you aren't going to believe me without some further evidence. If someone tells you that their mother came to visit last weekend, you are probably going to accept it, because again, there's no reason to suspect that the person is lying. If you know, however, that the person's mother has been dead for 5 years, then you will not blindly accept his experience as fact. It has nothing to do with the 'R' word being used; it has everything to do with 'extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.' Much the same way you probably dismiss the experiences of people seeing ghosts and alien abductions (which I noticed you conveniently omitted and ignored my two statements regarding the similarities between religious experience and paranormal claims), I dismiss religious experiences and other supernatural and extraordinary claims until there is convincing evidence of their truth. Unless I know that someone isn't trustworthy, I generally accept 'normal' claims and experiences without much thought. There's nothing unfair about it.\n \n \nSo most people in the world are under a world-wide mass delusion? That's really what you believe? That's what it sounds like to me.\n\n \n Yes. Billions are indoctrinated and deluded. I thought I was pretty clear... I think religion is wrong, and therefore most religious beliefs fit this definition (that I agree with) of delusion: \"a belief that is either mistaken or not substantiated and is held with very strong feelings or opinions and expressed forcefully.\" You of course believe the same thing, since I'm sure you think that atheists, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, and all other non-Christians are mistaken in their beliefs. \n \n \nNo, the phrase is used as a figure of speech to refer to discussions that can't be resolved, because they deal with issues that are too metaphysical.

How an atheist gets to that conclusion is irrelevant.\n \n \nOr leads one to believe that the rules of logic we hold to are inadequate for framing the issue of what the afterlife would be if it exists. That's the option you didn't include there.\n\n \n You are correct. I should have included that option, but I didn't think you would choose it.

You mean understanding that the homeowner is acting in his own self-interests and not caring about the ants at all?

In my opinion it's pretty poor reasoning.\n\n \n Except there is physical pain, and there are apparently plans for eternal physical pain, so that whole statement is completely wrong. To the original analogy, the magnifying glass is still there, when any decent god would have never misused the magnifying glass in the first place.\n \n There is no evidence for god. The logical leap is not to the idea of no god, the logical leap to the belief in gods in the first place. You bring up reasoning, but without a reason to believe, unbelief is the only reasonable option.\n \n \nBut that's what everyone does. People argue their points because they believe their view is the RIGHT one. Otherwise, they wouldn't be making their arguments. If you're going to demand Christianity drop it's claim to moral supremacy, then you need to make that demand of everyone, including yourself (since you seem to think yours--based on 'think-for-yourself--is superior to religion's). You'd have to make that demand of anyone who argues anything that involves an opinion about human behavior or conduct. This is a double-standard I see on the part of critics of Christianity. They criticize Christianity for holding up its moral stance as best, as if anyone making judgments about what is best human conduct aren't doing the same thing. Every person than has given any thought to human conduct has things they believe are right and wrong, and therefore do hold to the idea that what they think is best. People have standards, and when they argue those standards they are effectively 'touting their morality as better than everyone else's', as you put it. Else they wouldn't be arguing their view. And that includes the standard you seem to espouse. \n\n \n People can have their opinions, but claiming that the best moral code comes from a god who doesn't follow the code doesn't make sense, especially when trying to push that code onto other people who don't share the same opinions. I may say that my method of determining right and wrong is better than getting ideas from a book, but I'm not pushing my opinions onto others (although with my views, being basically that you can do what you want as long as you aren't hurting someone else, I'm not sure what I could really 'push' except for maybe tolerance.) \n \n \nIt's up to you, of course. No one here has said you have to believe in God. I don't understand how anyone couldn't, but if you don't then that's up to you. Today's atheism doesn't really stop there, though, does it? It goes farther and makes a value judgment at those who choose differently. It associates belief in God with ignorance, which goes much farther than mere 'lack-of-belief.' If atheists merely stopped at lack-of-belief, I don't think there would be a problem here.\n\n \n I would guess that most, including myself, don't associate a belief in gods with (global) ignorance. Sure, we think that on the subject of religion, religious people are wrong, but that's not any different from a religious person's view of a non-believer (or a person of another faith). No reasonable person would say that a belief in god necessarily makes a person any less intelligent or uninformed on non-religious subjects. This is just another generalization. And seriously, since when have the major religions ever been tolerant and understanding of atheism? You complain about a few modern atheists who speak negatively about religious people, but for centuries, right up until today religious people have persecuted and killed atheists, called them stupid (happens every Sunday across America... I will occasionally go to church with believers, and this is not an uncommon topic), and every other negative thing you can think of. The 'problem' is that a few atheists have decided to religious people a taste of their own medicine (even if I disagree with what they are saying). \n \n \nAnd is it not the least bit interesting to you that those morals you hold to now are after prolonged exposure to society and other people? Society does influence you, and I see every reason to to believe that the values you hold to are due to society's influence. \n \n I've said all along here there is no way to know for sure if religion is ultimately the reason for these things, but I find it hard to believe its some accident that you would hold to these values after living in a culture so influenced over the centuries by a given religion in the west, in particular. I just think religious values are very much an undercurrent and long-term influence on culture. Yes, non-religious persons can put others first. But they are still influenced by a culture heavily influenced by religion. The only real test would be to see if a person somehow raised with no human interaction in society at all would be altruistic. My suspicion is that he or she would not be, but of course that is just my opinion.\n\n \n Do you just ignore everything I say on purpose? I held different opinions on right and wrong for most of my life... I was obviously influenced by society and religion. But when I abandoned religion, I reconsidered my stances on various issues and realized a few of my stances didn't have any solid reasoning behind them. These were pretty rapid changes to ideas that very few people I knew held, not just 'prolonged exposure' to like-minded people. The influence was from reason and thinking, not from authority and peer pressure. The difference is massive.\n \n But this is all just the same nonsense we've already gone over. \n \n You can't bring up a person with no human interaction and expect them to be able to do anything... talk, interact with others, etc. They are called ferel, and they are basically just wild animals. But I've already given examples of societies such as Ancient Greece which produced better moral philosophers than just about anybody up until pretty recent times, and their religion had very little to do with morality. Do you really think that only religious societies (religions pertaining to morals, like the Abrahamic religions) practiced altruism, and that all others were just selfish and immoral? That's ridiculous! Without altruism, the other societies would have never lasted as long as they did (they probably would have never gotten to the 'civilization' stage).\n \n \nMorality involves an outside and, by definition, higher standard. There is no such higher standard in this case. I don't see how you can only conflate morality and authority.\n\n \n By whose definition? You are just making one big circular argument... if I accepted your premise, then I would have to either believe in a god, or believe that a man on earth with enough power and protection from harm wouldn't be subject to morality (or that morality doesn't exist at all). Both situations are ridiculous to me.\n \n If I flew alone to another planet that had life (semi-intelligent life, at least to the level of mammals like dogs or apes) where I was clearly the most advanced, powerful being present, I would have no 'higher standard/authority' in the way you speak, but if I tortured and killed all the life on the planet, surely that would be wrong (and going against your definition). I would also argue that the 'higher standard,' if not taken to mean authority, would be 'non-violence' in this example. \n \n I am ignoring god, because unless you are of the belief that 'without a god things can be neither right nor wrong,' it isn't necessary to consider. And that belief is faulty when you actually consider morality. What makes something wrong? (I'm going to give my answer, but I'd like to know yours). I think anything that causes harm to something without need (need being things like self defense or food for survival) is immoral (roughly). Killing or causing uneccessary suffering (even mental) to some creature when it is avoidable is immoral. It's wrong because from the viewpoint of whatever you are hurting, it's a bad situation... you are doing something 'bad' from its view, when not doing the bad deed doesn't put you in a bad situation.\n \n Denying this (or some other similar statement) means that you do indeed only view something as being moral because it is commanded by an authority, and even though you have said otherwise, it would mean the only reason you act morally is because 'God said to' and because you will be rewarded or punished for your actions. If you have other reasons for acting the way you do, then it must lead to the conclusion that morality is independent of God's authority and commands.\n \n Think about it, if God commands something immoral, does that make it moral? If you were commanded to rape and murder, would rape and murder now be moral? It would still be bad for everyone involved (except for the possible exception of you, the rapist/murderer), so I can't see how it is possible to say that commands from an authority can make something either moral or immoral. Morality is a higher principle, and since God is capable of all these interactions, even God is capable of acting morally or immorally.\n \n Imagine you are on a world where no god exists. Surely you would still consider murderers and thieves to be bad people that you would want to avoid, and non-murderers and non-thieves better company. You would wish that everyone would stop murdering and stealing, because it would be better for you and everyone else. This is morality in a nutshell, and the idea isn't dependent on a higher power. It wouldn't matter if you are punished, rewarded, or if nothing else happens, doing something 'bad' is immoral. A god's authority really plays no part. These principles are universal, and this 'higher standard' would apply even to a god... For example, if Satan was the only higher power, and was the creator, and sent everyone to hell regardless of their crimes, then surely he is 'worse' than a creator who loves and cares for his creations. One is clearly better than the other (from the view of everyone involved), and this is morality. If one god created a place where there was much unfairness and suffering, and another created one with everyone else's wishes taken into consideration and very little or no suffering, then the first god is immoral, and the second god is moral. This is how I'm defining things (and how I think morality is usually defined): morality is about the welfare of living creatures. \n \n Your only argument has been that there is no standard higher than God and that he has no one to answer to, but as I have shown, answering to someone has nothing to do with morality... so while you can still say that God has no one to answer to (and I have agreed with that point), I don't see how you can say that God can not be good or evil, do right or wrong, be moral or immoral. He is clearly capable of causing needless pain and suffering, clearly capable of treating living things fairly, unfairly, well, or poor. I don't think that this statement is deniable by you or anyone, and these actions have a morality attached. If you don't want to call that morality, immorality, good, evil, right, wrong, or otherwise, I think you are just playing word-games to avoid what is obvious: morality is not dependent on God, and God is capable of right and wrong.\n \n And I think it's pretty clear that I'm not the one conflating authority and morality. That's been your SOP this whole debate.\n \n \nThat's a very poor analogy.\n A better analogy would be a homeowner who gets a dog that would hurt and kill people in his fence, but makes it very clear for people to avoid the dog and puts up an 'beware-of-dog' sign. Is the homeowner really culpable if pedestrians don't adhere to the signs, and go walking in his back yard anyway? You keep bringing up this 'torturing people' thing (because it paints God in such a bad light, no doubt), but the very religion that purports hell so much that you are referring to mainly here has made it absolutely clear how to avoid it, in pretty darn clear terms. So clear in fact, that people are without excuse.\n\n \n Point out how my example is poor (other than you not liking it). Your example requires you to do nothing to avoid punishment, and requires you to actually put forth effort to be punished. Why would anyone want to climb a fence when they can see a dog and a sign? There is no reward at all in your scenario for taking the risk, no short term reason that a person should want to go over the fence. It also assumes that not loving or having different beliefs is equivalent to the crime of trespassing. \n \n Other problems with your analogy: Picking the bible out from the various other religious texts is obviously not easy, nor is picking the right version of the bible, or the right interpretation (for example, you claim that it is very clear and easy to make it to heaven, whereas many believe that human nature has to be shunned and many sacrifices have to be made, and that it is a very difficult process... verses about 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name,' 'straight is the way and narrow is the gate,' 'many will seek to enter in, and shall not be able,' '[list of sinners] shall not enter the kingdom,' and various ones about false teachers/Satan deceiving people come to mind.) \n \n In my example, a person is held at gunpoint, forced to either do something he/she may not want to do, or be punished by death (much better than eternal torture, by the way). If Christianity required behavior that everybody wanted to do, then you wouldn't have to answer questions about all the 'un-Christian Christians' throughout history. You wouldn't have to worry about non-Christians either, since everybody would be Christians naturally. So how is my example a poor analogy that casts Christian belief in a bad light? If anything, it is too kind.\n \n A better example would be a person locked in a hallway with a thousand doors, and each door having a sign proclaiming it to be the only door that doesn't have an angry dog behind it. Keep in mind that you can't stay in the hallway, and that there is no way to see or hear any of the dogs (there may be no dogs at all). \n \n And again, how does 'making it clear how to avoid' torture justify it in any way? Would the death penalty be justifiable for speeding or not paying taxes? You honestly think that 'making it clear' or it being 'easy' justifies torturing people who have different (or wrong) beliefs, especially when their specific belief makes the message very un-clear from the beginning? I've said it before, belief isn't something you just choose. I think I asked you before (I'm not sure, it might have been EZ), but if Islam turned out to be right, and you were sent to hell because you were Christian, would you be in hell because you chose to go?\n \n I know I've already asked you several questions in this little section, but here are the others that you failed to answer from the previous post:\n Do you think that torturing someone for his beliefs is acceptable? (Is torture ever NOT immoral?)\n Do you think it would be easy for you to 'choose' to sincerely believe in Big Foot or the Loch Ness Monster, or ancient aliens?\n \n \nIt would matter if it weren't for the fact that God's teachings are for human conduct. I just don't see how it is you aren't getting this. If one teaches his dog to not dig holes in the yard, it doesn't mean the homeowner can never go and dig a hole in his yard. How can you not understand that morality for his creatures are behavioral codes intended for them and not the creator? The only reason for your \"dilemma\" is that you are determined to insist that omnipotent and omniscient God has to abide by the very same rules that he makes for his created humans. \n\n \n And if you taught your dog not to dig holes, went and dug holes with your hands in front of the dog, then the dog mimicked you and started digging, then you wouldn't have anyone but yourself to blame for the dog's actions. You use a lot of thse animal analogies, but I don't think any of them work very well. I know you would say that the gap between a human and an ant is tiny compared to the gap between God and man, but God and man have the ability to communicate, whereas animals and humans don't. Sure, maybe pets can understand some body language and pick up on behaviors and signals, but God is capable of understanding every human thought, and is capable of communicating anything at all to humans (he did create human understanding, after all). \n \n \nThen he would NOT be God. To be able to judge him puts him under an over-arching standard, meaning he is not God, after all.\n\n \n By your own little definition of God? Says who? If God exists, then I've been judging him throughout this thread. That doesn't change that he would be God. \n \n Also, you ignored this:\n \n Originally Posted by Stonewall - He may be able to do what he wants, but that doesn't mean morality doesn't apply. I also find it, simply put, condradictory to the bible and every religious view I've heard, that God isn't capable of doing moral or 'good' things. If God decided to specifically help somebody who was in need, how would that not be a moral action?\n \n \nThey why are you arguing from the standpoint that God expects Christians (in general) to sell all their possessions and give to the poor? Are you saying that DOESN'T apply to all Christians? If you don't think it does, I'm not sure why you're arguing the stance you are.\n\n \n I didn't say 'all Christians' were to sell 'all' of their belongings. If I did, point it out, and I'll admit that I was wrong. Poor Christians would be exempt, and you obviously wouldn't give away something that you needed to live. That said, the Christians with the big houses, fancy cars, expensive clothes, etc. are certainly not following Jesus' teachings. Look at the example of the woman using the oil on Jesus, where Judas gets mad because it could have helped the poor... Sure, Judas may have had other intentions and Jesus said it was okay because he (Jesus) was special and only on earth for a little while, but you can see the mindset. Any little luxuries were unnecessary and could help the less fortunate.",
