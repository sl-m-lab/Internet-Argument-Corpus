The REAL homophobics experience an uncontrollable fear around gays. While just the racist XXXXXXXs who hate them are not homophobic.\n \n There is a difference.\n\n \n One perspective is your right for gays it isn't a choice. They are gay. The alternative is that we all choose, the majority going with the opposite sex. But we both know it isn't a conscience choice, we are attracted to women whether we like it or not. This is really one of the most difficult concepts for straight people to grasp, and it is apparent with arguments like this and below.\n \n As for the Homophobic I will refer you to your explanation on the English language being dynamic posted below, but would add there is usually very little rational reason for racism, at least most racists have a difficult time expressing any. Most resort to what amounts to fear of losing something, jealousy, feelings of inferiority or just feel threatened in some way. Depending on who you are gays would defiantly fall under things, animals or people as that covers even the homophobes and Religious types. Which by your definition appears to work out sufficiently to say the word is not being used as incorrectly as you seem to think?\n \n \n \n\"You are denieing my rights to (gay)marraige\"\n \n No one is stopping the gays from getting married. They are perfectly able to get married.\n \n That is another twist in logic. They can marry the opposite sex. But what gays are asking for is something NOBODY has: to marry the same sex. Im straight and I can't marry a guy, there is absolutly no denial of rights.\n \n But what appeared to happened is that gay activists have warped subject of marraige to include same sex marraige and then blame the government of violating their rights.\n\n \n Would you like to marry a guy? That probably is a contributing factor on why you think this. Gays are asking to be allowed to do something they want to do, just because you don't seem a shallow reason to say they can't. \n \n If you're married or when you do, will it be for love? Is that not an expectation placed upon all of us including ourselves? Would it not be beneficial to be attracted to your spouse, I would think they would think so. So then how does one fulfill that expectation of society and ourselves if we do not love the opposite sex?\n \n Why can only a man and woman enter into a marriage agreement? Why are they given preferential treatment over single people, gay or straight? \n \n \nHomosexuallity is natural\n \n There are two sides to it:\n 1) \"It occurs in nature.\"\n 2) \"It feels so right.\"\n \n It may only appear to occure in nature. In being that you might witness your male dog humping another male dog. He does it the same reason for why he mounts like a sofa or tree. Stimulus. \n Humans practice homosexuallity to gratify an irrational chemical reaction in the brain that is repressented by 'emotions', or simply people do it to satisfy an emotional desire. While animals do it like a form of masturbation, a unconscious primal drive.\n\n \n \n Isn't that one of the reasons you and wife or girlfriend do it? I assume you do enjoy it? Maybe if dogs had hands your sofa would be safe.\n \n Marriage is not just about the sex or at least not after a few years. I don't know if the reason couples who have been together for decades tend to not live long after one passes away is because they miss the sex.\n \n My guess is that it feels so right is referring to the emotional attachment and not so much the physical.\n \n The \"occurs in nature\" argument is to counter the position of it is unnatural seeing how until fairly recently in human history we tried to view our lives on what we observed in nature. Unless of course a dog and sofa were involved and then we became a more enlightened and elevated animal. \n \n So on both sides you seem to have misunderstood the meaning these phrases have regarding gay relationships.\n \n \n \nAnd by going down the logic of evolution and natural selection, assuming that homosexuallity is caused by a gene, it just makes the most sense that any gene or instinct that existed in the past would have simply been wiped out. The animal carrying the gay gene would have not been motivated to mate with the opposite sex, thus not passing down the 'gay gene' to future generations.\n\n \n Since many gay people live a heterosexual life, including having children it could very well continue as it has. You also have not given any consideration to a specific DNA sequence being the trigger or that the recessive gene is with the mother who passes it to her offspring both male and female.\n \n \n \n\"That's so gay!\"\n \n The word 'gay' being used to express dislike of something.\n First it was used to be an synonym for being happy,\n Then it is used as a lable for a homosexual individual.\n Now its being used as slang for dislike.\n \n Thats the tricky thing of the English language, words are dynamic. They take on different meanings as time goes on.\n Now 'gay' has entered that phase again, the transition of a new definition.\n \n Get over it.\n\n \n How about we apply this idea to marriage? then we could all get over it.\n \n Or you didn't mean for this to have such a liberal application?\n \n \nAnd the last thing would be a question of mine: If you are proud to be gay, why are you so easily offended? (non-sarcastic)\n \n Where's that Gay Pride? \n If gays are often offended by a simple remark or the misuse of the word 'gay', then that points to an insecurity of your sexual identification.\n Now go make peace with your inner self and be proud.\n\n \n Would not standing up for yourself be considered a proud act? Why the inner self, why not the whole self? If you want to help gays feel like better people then don't treat them like there is something wrong with them. \n \n I think the insecurity comes from things like being fired for being gay or evicted for being gay. I bet you would prefer to live in a safe neighborhood. Is that because you would like to walk to the corner liquor store not fearing for your life every 5th time you went. Being gay increases the odds of being them getting beaten, harassed or killed.\n \n Seems an odd choice to make.",

Im straight and I can't marry a guy, there is absolutly no denial of rights.\n \n But what appeared to happened is that gay activists have warped subject of marraige to include same sex marraige and then blame the government of violating their rights.\n\n This is really dumb. First off, until Bush et al got their panties in a bunch over this...what defined marriage as one man and one woman? Shouldn't marriage be the union of 2 people who love each other? Saying that gays have the same marriage rights as you do is a false truth. You have the right to marry the person you love...they don't. \n \n \nHomosexuallity is natural\n \n There are two sides to it:\n 1) \"It occurs in nature.\"\n 2) \"It feels so right.\"\n \n It may only appear to occure in nature.

The animal carrying the gay gene would have not been motivated to mate with the opposite sex, thus not passing down the 'gay gene' to future generations.\n\n The act itself is inconsequential. It's about attraction. It's as simple as what colors one finds pleasing to the eye, or what music one finds pleasing to the ear. Pleasure is well known to be a positive feedback chemically mediated response in the brain. Who are you to call that irrational? \n \n \nAnd the last thing would be a question of mine: If you are proud to be gay, why are you so easily offended?

That doesn't mean it is common sense, in fact it's the opposite.\n \n \n\n This too is accurate in its common sense simplicity, and I believe points to the innate guilt that infects all homosexuals who are so thin skinned and defensive regarding their unnatural sexual proclivities.

If so then HOW WOULD YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BEING GAY?.. You are making general assumptions and random judgments based on the teachings of your religion. You don't have a Clue what Gay people are thinking or feeling and neither do I so stop trying to convince yourself you do. \n \n \n\n I can attest first hand that as a believer in Christ I have absolutely no personal animosity toward any homosexual, in any way at all.

The evidence of this is that I constantly warn them of the eternal consequences that awaits all who practice this unnatural lifestyle which they refuse to accept as sincere warnings but rather interpret as condemnation.\n\n \n This is a bold faced denial of the truth. You WANT people to believe this because of your religious views, \" God Forbid They think I'm a Bigot\".. But your actions prove otherwise. You spew hatred and bigotry as much as any Homophobic Radical Christian. See, I'm not even a Christian, nor do I believe any of your fairy tales, but even I know that one of the most important things your Jesus taught and preached was Compassion towards your fellow man.

For those who are such do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly, and by smooth words and flattering speech deceive the hearts of the simple.\" (Romans 16:17)\n \n \"Do not be deceived: \"Evil company corrupts good habits.\" Awake to righteousness, and do not sin; for some do not have the knowledge of God.\" (1 Corinthians 15:33)\n \n \"A scoffer seeks wisdom and does not find it, but knowledge is easy to him who understands.

   "welcome IME, you seem like a very rational person; i think you and i will get along quite well. however, i have some objections to what youve posted.\n \n first, the term \"homophobia\" is slightly misrepresented. usually, homophobics do not fear gay people, but they fear two things - first, fear that their beloved country would be destroyed if gay people were allowed to get married, and second, fear that their children would be gay. both are fear traits brought on by hatred and bigotry of gay people/homosexuality. a homophobic fears far less than he hates, and his fears are fueled by hatred. and one always chooses to hate something - its not involuntary.\n \n second, their right to marry. its not very fair to say \"well, you can get married, but to a woman.\" imagine a reversed world, where you are the minority of straight people. homosexuality is the norm and heterosexuality is frowned upon. homosexuality produceses offspring, heterosexuality does not. you are not allowed to get married to a woman, but you are free to marry a man. you simply would not be able to! that would be a fruitless attempt to satisfy a desire that you do not have. what is suggested is something that goes against the hard-wiring of sexual orientation. in this reversed world, would you be one of the people fighting for straight rights, the right to get married? i know i would. and in our non-reversed world, i will fight for the exact same thing, but for the opposite side. equality helps everyone.\n \n third, you are semi-correct about homosexuality in nature, however there are thousands of documented cases in which a male will choose other males to mate with over females. bonobos are famous for this. homosexuality is found in nature all the time, homosexuals are not. there is not one case of a homosexual organism in nature, apart from humans.\n \n im glad you brought up the gay gene and genetics, because i am one who personally does not think there is a gay gene. first of all, if there is a gay gene it would be recessive, and thus be able to be inherited, keeping it alive. secondly, homosexuality is not genetic because the genome contains the code for physical attributes only. there are cases of identical twins, one of which is gay, the other is straight. if there was a gay gene, this would not happen, because identical twins have identical DNA.\n \n in summary of your third point, homosexuality IS natural to humans. in my opinion, i think there must be a sort of mis-firing in the brain during pregnancy that causes homosexuality. not to draw any negative attention to the term \"mis-firing\", mis-firing happens all the time. everybody has certain traits which were caused by mess-ups in the brain before they were born.\n \n fourth, \"that's so gay\". theres no point in arguing that \"gay means happy\", because thats not what is meant in the statement \"that's so gay\". gay is meant as in homosexual, f-a-g, q-u-e-e-r, other derogatory terms for what we now refer to as \"gay\". \"that's so gay\"ers will often be heard saying the other stuff too, they all mean the same thing. this statement is often heard out of the mouths of early teenagers or pre-teens, and they will almost always not show the same respect to gays as they show to straights. in short, kids can be bigots. \"that's so gay\" is a bigotted statement that offends even me, as a straight person. it's also always used in a negative sense, with a negative tone about something that is felt negatively. also in short, the people who say \"that's so gay\" are referring to \"gay\" in a negative manner, as if homosexuality is a negative thing. they will also almost always have a negative stance on homosexuality.\n \n lastly, we have a right to be offended. why should i not be offended by my fellows being treated any differently than how i am treated? why should i not be offended by people in other countries who are killed for something they have no choice in? why should i not be offended at bigotry towards my friends? why should i not be offended at the sight of constant negativity towards good people? why should i not be offended at people who refuse change for the better? why should i not be offended by people who hate my fellows simply because of their sexual orientation, nothing else?\n \n that isnt to say that there is no pride in homosexuality; youll see two gay dude holding hands walking down the street and they will be yelled at by bigotted conservatives. they then have the right to stand up for themselves and dispute the biggoted claims. why not? the fact that they are openly gay in public, prepared to be yelled at by these arseholes, expresses their bravery and pride perfectly.",

   "Through many different readings on the internet and in school, it has been revealed to me that there are many logic holes in the debate.\n \n But before I start, I DO NOT hate gays, even though I am Christain, I take on a biological or non-biblical stance to take that out of the equaition, seeming that most of the pro-gay arguments are based on so-called paranoid bible thumpers.\n \n \n \n Being gay is not a choice, but homophobia is.\n \n First part is right, second is not.\n \n In being the literal definition of a phobia is: A phobia is an irrational, intense and persistent fear of certain situations, activities, things, animals, or people... Phobias are known as an emotional response learned because of difficult life experiences.. \n \n But in recent times, the term homophobia has been expanded to include the actual conscious decesion to hate gays. The REAL homophobics experience an uncontrollable fear around gays. While just the racist XXXXXXXs who hate them are not homophobic.\n \n There is a difference.\n \n \"You are denieing my rights to (gay)marraige\"\n \n No one is stopping the gays from getting married. They are perfectly able to get married.\n \n That is another twist in logic. They can marry the opposite sex. But what gays are asking for is something NOBODY has: to marry the same sex. Im straight and I can't marry a guy, there is absolutly no denial of rights.\n \n But what appeared to happened is that gay activists have warped subject of marraige to include same sex marraige and then blame the government of violating their rights.\n \n \n Homosexuallity is natural\n \n There are two sides to it:\n 1) \"It occurs in nature.\"\n 2) \"It feels so right.\"\n \n It may only appear to occure in nature. In being that you might witness your male dog humping another male dog. He does it the same reason for why he mounts like a sofa or tree. Stimulus. \n Humans practice homosexuallity to gratify an irrational chemical reaction in the brain that is repressented by 'emotions', or simply people do it to satisfy an emotional desire. While animals do it like a form of masturbation, a unconscious primal drive.\n \n And by going down the logic of evolution and natural selection, assuming that homosexuallity is caused by a gene, it just makes the most sense that any gene or instinct that existed in the past would have simply been wiped out. The animal carrying the gay gene would have not been motivated to mate with the opposite sex, thus not passing down the 'gay gene' to future generations.\n \n \"That's so gay!\"\n \n The word 'gay' being used to express dislike of something.\n First it was used to be an synonym for being happy,\n Then it is used as a lable for a homosexual individual.\n Now its being used as slang for dislike.\n \n Thats the tricky thing of the English language, words are dynamic. They take on different meanings as time goes on.\n Now 'gay' has entered that phase again, the transition of a new definition.\n \n Get over it.\n \n \n And the last thing would be a question of mine: If you are proud to be gay, why are you so easily offended? (non-sarcastic)\n \n Where's that Gay Pride? \n If gays are often offended by a simple remark or the misuse of the word 'gay', then that points to an insecurity of your sexual identification.\n Now go make peace with your inner self and be proud.\n\n \n You brought up some great points I think. \n It's ok to question gay pride dogma (just as it is ok to question religious dogma) and these are good examples.\n \n The issue of the term 'homophobia' is interesting. A lot of the gay pride approach has been to try and own terminology. \"Homophobia\", \"bigot\", \"equality\", etc. are all terms thrown out there in the debate as rhetoric, and are rarely qualified. \n The reality is, if homophobia is evil, then most PEOPLE are evil. The example I use is the tendency of 2 guys to keep an empty seat between them in the movie theater. Let's be honest--the reason they do it is often because of homophobia, or not wanting to be perceived as gay. (There are other reasons too of course, such as having more room) Now is that evil? I don't think so. What is clear is that the same term should not be used to both describe a.) leaving an empty seat in a theater, and b.) beating a gay person to death. Yet it is. The term is too broad to be meaningful. As such it becomes an attack term, to try and vilify or to just throw around. My conclusion to the fact that homophobia would mean most people are evil is that the premise 'homophobia is evil' is not necessarily the case. The 'ick' factor is actually probably pretty natural. We're going to obviously be turned off by sexual activity that doesn't fall under our own sexual orientation. Gays have 'ick factors' to varying degrees over heterosexual sex as well. Is that bad? I don't think it falls under the auspices of good or bad, it just IS. It's a state of being.\n It's when people ACT on homophobia and allow it to influence them to go out and physically harm gays that it becomes a problem.\n \n Your second point is correct too that it is a misnomer when they say 'gays cannot marry.' Of course, what they really mean is that gays can't marry a person of the same gender. But you are right, in that they technically DO have the same right that an opposite-gender couple has. This is why, in my opinion, the real issue is that gays want to change marriage. \n \n The third point you make is yet another problem with gay pride movement arguments .... using the fact that 'the animals do it' to argue that it's natural. The important question SHOULD be, is it natural for PEOPLE to do it? \n Animals engage in all sorts of behavior--for instance, some animals many kill and eat their young. Does that make such to be natural behavior for people? No, I don't think it does. Humans operate on a much different level of behavior and so it is unnatural if a person engages in such animal behavior. \"Because-the-animals-do-it\" is, in fact, a terrible argument for normalcy on this topic or most any other.\n \n Your 4th point gets back to the issue of the gay pride movement wanting to own terminology. \"Gay\" now has gone through 3 meanings in the last few decades: 1. glad; 2. homosexual; 3. dislike or asinine. Indeed, if one is going to argue that they should be able to own a term because language changes, then they have to accept that they may lose a term because language changes. However, to be fair, I haven't heard too many gays too upset over this. Maybe they are, I don't know. I just haven't heard any of them say so.",

   "fair points.\n \n on what you say about homophobia, i think you would be hard pressed to find anyone who calls leaving a seat between two guys \"homophobic\".\n \n \n We certainly don't have to go with that example; there are plenty of others. When do two heterosexual guys who are close friends hold hands? In fact, they often avoid things like embracing. The reality is, this behavior (or lack thereof) is due to homophobia. Should we use the same term for that as we do a person who beats a gay person to death? I don't think we should. It muddies the debate to be using such broad terminology, and doesn't allow for the fact that homophobia is usually pretty benign. In fact, as I said, it's probably pretty natural to be homophobic. (the 'ick' factor) IMO, the only thing that really matters is to educate people to not ACT on homophobia and bully/harm gays. Just as they shouldn't ACT in a harmful way based on any emotion or feeling.\n \n \neating your babies is harm and obviously should not be allowed. Hannibal Lecter does not deserve the right to eat babies. allowing two people to get married is NOT harm, anyway you think about it - it is fair, and should be allowed. \"because animals do it\" is to show that it is in fact a phenomenon found in nature. like you, however i dont think that argument works. there are far better explanation for how homosexuality is natural.\n\n \n Well, also, the discussion of normalcy and the discussion of rights are not the same thing. Much of the debates revolving around homosexuality involve defining social norms. \"Rights\" refers to the legal issues, and I'm referring to the cultural ones. The argument 'the-animals-do-it' is one I hear a lot regarding the cultural issue: the issue of normalcy. IOW ... arguing it should be natural because we see it elsewhere in nature.

   "Great post, and very common sense in its content. I will respond to the last point since the rest of it is obvious in its rationale. You said:\n\n \n The rational is obvious, but shallow taking only a cursory look at the issue from a perspective that is unable or unwilling to see the substance of what is being addressed\n \n \n \nAnd the last thing would be a question of mine: If you are proud to be gay, why are you so easily offended? (non-sarcastic)\n \n Where's that Gay Pride? \n If gays are often offended by a simple remark or the misuse of the word 'gay', then that points to an insecurity of your sexual identification.\n Now go make peace with your inner self and be proud.\n This too is accurate in its common sense simplicity, and I believe points to the innate guilt that infects all homosexuals who are so thin skinned and defensive regarding their unnatural sexual proclivities. They fight so hard to have homosexuality accepted as a right, normal and natural lifestyle but are incapable of actually feeling good and fulfilled as homosexuals.\n \n \n This broad generalization is really not based on anything, It's not even really your opinion, but something you have borrowed from your religion. The attempt by Christians to project their own feelings of inadequacy onto others is a significant problem within the religion. It is understandable given from the onset of accepting the role of subserviant follower incapable of ever being seen as anything but a failure in the eyes of God is a heavy burden to carry. Then add to that the guilt of being the cause of that God had to kill himself to make up for all their transgressions it is a credit to your faith to have the will to get out of bed every morning. \n \n Since your opinion here is obviously wrong, what are possible alternatives to gays fighting for rights and to be accepted as normal? One could be the treatment they endure, the discrimination they suffer and the fear they exoerience. The most common justification for this comes from religious values and beliefs. I am of the opinion religion is so afraid that God may decide they aren't worth the effort that they in desperation try and appease by God by violating the laws of the bible in order to try and enforce them. This can only be viewed as irrational and illogical and shows a deep misunderstanding of God's desires. Unfortunately they will not listen, just as the bible says they won't. They will claim they have spiritual knowledge but their actions show once more the bible was correct in stating they would.\n \n \n \nHomosexuals feel the inherent guilt, condemnation and self loathing that comes with this blatant rebellion against the laws of God, who created them. That is why they are so bitter and angry toward any and all who oppose their corrupt lifestyle on moral grounds.\n\n \n This could be true of Christians but not likely for homosexuals. Since God as stated in the Bible made them that way and keeps them that way and ignorant of the fact to boot, how could they possibly feel as you describe?\n \n \nI can attest first hand that as a believer in Christ I have absolutely no personal animosity toward any homosexual, in any way at all. I wish them no harm or ultimate judgement or condemnation at all even though they will constantly accuse me of wanting that for them. The evidence of this is that I constantly warn them of the eternal consequences that awaits all who practice this unnatural lifestyle which they refuse to accept as sincere warnings but rather interpret as condemnation.\n\n \n Perhaps you should look at why the Spirit does not come thru you to do God's work. What do you think might be preventing God from acknowledging what you do. Maybe your not spreading God's word but your own and that is you are unable to speak with the voice of God.\n \n \n \nThe fact is, they feel judged and condemned all on their own because subconsciously they realize they are under condemnation as long as they remain in rebellion against the natural laws God has established for MAN, His creation. This is the crux of their anger and rage against straight people who oppose their reprobate lifestyle on moral grounds.\n\n \n Really? You mean no one else judges or condemns them? What do you hope to achieve when you say something like this? How do ever expect to be effective when you clearly have no grasp of the situation?\n \n \n \nJust watch the defensive response to this post that will surely come from both the outed homosexuals and the closeted gays who claim to be just defending homosexuality but are in reality practicing homosexuals who can't admit it even on an anonymous debate forum.\n\n \n This I found really sad. That knowing your position is based on misguided and misunderstood beliefs you resort to childish attempts to keep from having your ignorance uncovered. Was this last part necessary for your argument, you seemed to think so. It's just a troll on a fishing trip hoping to deflect from it's lack of self confidence and fear that you might lose something you were never worthy of receiving, sorry to break this to you but it just doesn't work that way,",

   "Through many different readings on the Internet and in school, it has been revealed to me that there are many logic holes in the debate.\n \n But before I start, I DO NOT hate gays,\n\n \n If you do not view being gay as equal to being hetero then you hate, dislike, or view gay people less then heterosexuals. This is the truth. If you can n;t accept a gay person the same as you accept a hetero then you hate the gay person. That is the truth whether you want to admit it or not.\n \n \n \n \n\n \"You are denying my rights to (gay)marriage\"\n \n No one is stopping the gays from getting married. They are perfectly able to get married.\n \n That is another twist in logic. They can marry the opposite sex. But what gays are asking for is something NOBODY has: to marry the same sex. I'm straight and I can't marry a guy, there is absolutely no denial of rights.\n \n But what appeared to happened is that gay activists have warped subject of marraige to include same sex marraige and then blame the government of violating their rights.\n \n\n \n If gay people are not allowed to marry the person of their choice the same as heteros then we are being denied the right to marry. The truth is that I can not marry the person I want to heteros can marry the person they want to. That is the truth.\n \n \n\n \n Homosexuality is natural\n \n There are two sides to it:\n 1) \"It occurs in nature.\"\n 2) \"It feels so right.\"\n \n It may only appear to occur in nature. In being that you might witness your male dog humping another male dog. He does it the same reason for why he mounts like a sofa or tree. Stimulus. \n Humans practice homosexuality to gratify an irrational chemical reaction in the brain that is represented by 'emotions', or simply people do it to satisfy an emotional desire. While animals do it like a form of masturbation, a unconscious primal drive.\n \n And by going down the logic of evolution and natural selection, assuming that homosexuality is caused by a gene, it just makes the most sense that any gene or instinct that existed in the past would have simply been wiped out. The animal carrying the gay gene would have not been motivated to mate with the opposite sex, thus not passing down the 'gay gene' to future generations.\n \n \"That's so gay!\"\n \n The word 'gay' being used to express dislike of something.\n First it was used to be an synonym for being happy,\n Then it is used as a label for a homosexual individual.\n Now its being used as slang for dislike.\n \n That's the tricky thing of the English language, words are dynamic. They take on different meanings as time goes on.\n Now 'gay' has entered that phase again, the transition of a new definition.\n \n Get over it.\n \n \n And the last thing would be a question of mine: If you are proud to be gay, why are you so easily offended? (non-sarcastic)\n \n Where's that Gay Pride? \n If gays are often offended by a simple remark or the misuse of the word 'gay', then that points to an insecurity of your sexual identification.\n Now go make peace with your inner self and be proud.\n\n \n Get over the bigoted gay hating attitude.\n \n I could say I don't want to eat in the same restaurant as a christian, I don;t want to be around them, and I think they are deluded. I don't hate Christians I just don't wan them to be able to practice their sick religion in public. Does that mean that I hate Christians by making those statements. \n \n After all being christian is just a choice and can therefore be restricted and controlled by laws, or maybe if locking up the sick puppies in metal institutions.",

   "We certainly don't have to go with that example; there are plenty of others. When do two heterosexual guys who are close friends hold hands? In fact, they often avoid things like embracing. The reality is, this behavior (or lack thereof) is due to homophobia. Should we use the same term for that as we do a person who beats a gay person to death? I don't think we should. It muddies the debate to be using such broad terminology, and doesn't allow for the fact that homophobia is usually pretty benign. In fact, as I said, it's probably pretty natural to be homophobic. (the 'ick' factor) IMO, the only thing that really matters is to educate people to not ACT on homophobia and bully/harm gays. Just as they shouldn't ACT in a harmful way based on any emotion or feeling.\n \n \n \n Well, also, the discussion of normalcy and the discussion of rights are not the same thing. Much of the debates revolving around homosexuality involve defining social norms. \"Rights\" refers to the legal issues, and I'm referring to the cultural ones. The argument 'the-animals-do-it' is one I hear a lot regarding the cultural issue: the issue of normalcy. IOW ... arguing it should be natural because we see it elsewhere in nature. It's not a convincing argument to say the least.\n\n \n i dont think any of the examples youve given are blatant examples of homophobia. two men with a seat in the middle in a theatre - not homophobia. two dudes not holding hands - not homophobia. someone beating the pulp out of a gay person - not really homophobia, although it might be. homophobia isnt really an action, its more of an attitude. thinking lowly of homosexuality is homophobia, regardless of the actions that follow.\n \n on the example you gave of beating up a gay person, that is a blatant example of assault and abuse... thats worse than homophobia, unless it was the person's homophobia which stirred it on.\n \n of course people should be educated to not physically harm people, but why not educate people further, to let them know that everyone deserves to be treated fairly? whether it be hatefully ranting that gay sex is a biblical sin on an internet forum or beating the snot out of a gay person, why shouldnt people be taught that both are wrong?\n \n no one is comparing the two actions as being equal, they arent. but they are both unfair in the same way it would be if you substituted \"gay\" for \"black\". by the way, i have actually heard of someone say that black people are black because they sinned... ive never laughed harder in my life.\n \n homosexuality is actually natural, but the argument that animals do it too is not a good explanation. the fact that so many people are homosexual makes it so. i hate when people dislocate humans with nature... we are natural. the feelings and emotions we have, the way we look (with some exceptions), the way we act are all natural. thus, homosexuality is absolutely and completely natural in the same way heterosexuality is.",

Full Text. Abstract.\n \n Here are some general statistics on homosexuals: The Statistics on Homosexuality and its Effects\n \n Some statistics about the Homosexual lifestyle:\n * One study reports 70% of homosexuals admitting to having sex only one time with over 50% of their partners (3)\n * One study reports that the average homosexual has between 20 and 106 partners per year (6). The average heterosexual has 8 partners in a lifetime\n * Many homosexual sexual encounters occur while drunk, high on drugs, or in an orgy setting (7)\n * Many homosexuals don't pay heed to warnings of their lifestyles: \"Knowledge of health guidelines was quite high, but this knowledge had no relation to sexual behavior\" (16)\n * Homosexuals got homosexuality removed from the list of mental illnesses in the early 70s by storming the annual American Psychiatric Association (APA) conference on successive years. \"Guerrilla theater tactics and more straight-forward shouting matches characterized their presence\" (2). Since homosexuality has been removed from the APA list of mental illnesses, so has pedophilia (except when the adult feels \"subjective distress\") (27)\n * Homosexuals account for 3-4% of all gonorrhea cases, 60% of all syphilis cases, and 17% of all hospital admissions (other than for STDs) in the United States (5). They make up only 1-2% of the population\n * Homosexuals live unhealthy lifestyles, and have historically accounted for the bulk of syphilis, gonorrhea, Hepatitis B, the \"gay bowel syndrome\" (which attacks the intestinal tract), tuberculosis and cytomegalovirus (27)\n * 73% of psychiatrists say homosexuals are less happy than the average person, and of those psychiatrists, 70% say that the unhappiness is NOT due to social stigmatization (13)\n * 25-33% of homosexuals and lesbians are alcoholics (11)\n * Of homosexuals questioned in one study reports that 43% admit to 500 or more partners in a lifetime, 28% admit to 1000 or more in a lifetime, and of these people, 79% say that half of those partners are total strangers, and 70% of those sexual contacts are one night stands (or, as one homosexual admits in the film \"The Castro\", one minute stands) (3). Also, it is a favorite past-time of many homosexuals to go to \"cruisy areas\" and have anonymous sex\n * 78% of homosexuals are affected by STDs (20)\n * Judge John Martaugh, chief magistrate of the New York City Criminal Court has said, \"Homosexuals account for half the murders in large cities\" (10)\n * Captain William Riddle of the Los Angeles Police says, \"30,000 sexually abused children in Los Angeles were victims of homosexuals\" (10)\n * 50% of suicides can be attributed to homosexuals (10)\n * Dr. Daniel Capron, a practicing psychiatrist, says, \"Homosexuality by definition is not healthy and wholesome. The homosexual person, at best, will be unhappier and more unfulfilled than the sexually normal person\" (10). For other psychiatrists who believe that homosexuality is wrong, please see National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality\n * It takes approximately $300,000 to take care of each AIDS victim, so thanks to the promiscuous lifestyle of homosexuals, medical insurance rates have been skyrocketing for all of us(10)\n * Homosexuals were responsible for spreading AIDS in the United States, and then raised up violent groups like Act Up and Ground Zero to complain about it. Even today, homosexuals account for well over 50% of the AIDS cases in the United States, which is quite a large number considering that they account for only 1-2% of the population\n * Homosexuals account for a disproportionate number of hepatitis cases: 70-80% in San Francisco, 29% in Denver, 66% in New York City, 56% in Toronto, 42% in Montreal, and 26% in Melbourne (8)\n * 37% of homosexuals engage in sadomasochism, which accounts for many accidental deaths. In San Francisco, classes were held to teach homosexuals how to not kill their partners during sadomasochism (8)\n * 41% of homosexuals say they have had sex with strangers in public restrooms, 60% say they have had sex with strangers in bathhouses, and 64% of these encounters have involved the use of illegal drugs (8)\n * Depending on the city, 39-59% of homosexuals are infected with intestinal parasites like worms, flukes and amoebae, which is common in filthy third world countries (8)\n * The median age of death of homosexuals is 42 (only 9% live past age 65). This drops to 39 if the cause of death is AIDS. The median age of death of a married heterosexual man is 75 (8)\n * The median age of death of lesbians is 45 (only 24% live past age 65). The median age of death of a married heterosexual woman is 79 (8)\n * Homosexuals are 100 times more likely to be murdered (usually by another homosexual) than the average person, 25 times more likely to commit suicide, and 19 times more likely to die in a traffic accident (8)\n * 21% of lesbians die of murder, suicide or traffic accident, which is at a rate of 534 times higher than the number of white heterosexual females aged 25-44 who die of these things(8)\n * 50% of the calls to a hotline to report \"XXXXX bashing\" involved domestic violence (i.e., homosexuals beating up other homosexuals) (18)\n * About 50% of the women on death row are lesbians (12).\n \n Homosexuals prey on children.\n \n * 33% of homosexuals ADMIT to minor/adult sex (7)\n * There is a notable homosexual group, consisting of thousands of members, known as the North American Man and Boy Love Association ( NAMBLA). This is a child molesting homosexual group whose cry is \"SEX BEFORE 8 BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.\" This group can be seen marching in most major homosexual parades across the United States\n * Homosexuals commit more than 33% of all reported child molestations in the United States, which, assuming homosexuals make up 2% of the population, means that 1 in 20 homosexuals is a child molestor, while 1 in 490 heterosexuals is a child molestor (19)\n * 73% of all homosexuals have had sex with boys under 19 years of age (9)\n * Many homosexuals admit that they are pedophiles: \"The love between men and boys is at the foundation of homosexuality\" (22)\n * Because homosexuals can't reproduce naturally, they resort to recruiting children. Homosexuals can be heard chanting \"TEN PERCENT IS NOT ENOUGH, RECRUIT, RECRUIT, RECRUIT\" in their homosexual parades. A group called the \"Lesbian Avengers\" prides itself on trying to recruit young girls. They print \"WE RECRUIT\" on their literature. Some other homosexuals aren't as overt about this, but rather try to infiltrate society and get into positions where they will have access to the malleable minds of young children (e.g., the clergy, teachers, Boy Scout leaders, etc.) (8). See the DC Lesbian Avengers web page, and DC Lesbian Avengers Press Release, where they threaten to recruit little boys and girls. Also, see AFA Action Alert.\n If you can't see the unnatural perversions and negative social impact of this corrupt lifestyle on our society according to these statistics, then you are clearly and loudly proving that you have been given over to a reprobate mind emoticon_xagree",

Full Text. Abstract.\n \n Here are some general statistics on homosexuals: The Statistics on Homosexuality and its Effects\n \n Some statistics about the Homosexual lifestyle:\n * One study reports 70% of homosexuals admitting to having sex only one time with over 50% of their partners (3)\n * One study reports that the average homosexual has between 20 and 106 partners per year (6). The average heterosexual has 8 partners in a lifetime\n * Many homosexual sexual encounters occur while drunk, high on drugs, or in an orgy setting (7)\n * Many homosexuals don't pay heed to warnings of their lifestyles: \"Knowledge of health guidelines was quite high, but this knowledge had no relation to sexual behavior\" (16)\n * Homosexuals got homosexuality removed from the list of mental illnesses in the early 70s by storming the annual American Psychiatric Association (APA) conference on successive years. \"Guerrilla theater tactics and more straight-forward shouting matches characterized their presence\" (2). Since homosexuality has been removed from the APA list of mental illnesses, so has pedophilia (except when the adult feels \"subjective distress\") (27)\n * Homosexuals account for 3-4% of all gonorrhea cases, 60% of all syphilis cases, and 17% of all hospital admissions (other than for STDs) in the United States (5). They make up only 1-2% of the population\n * Homosexuals live unhealthy lifestyles, and have historically accounted for the bulk of syphilis, gonorrhea, Hepatitis B, the \"gay bowel syndrome\" (which attacks the intestinal tract), tuberculosis and cytomegalovirus (27)\n * 73% of psychiatrists say homosexuals are less happy than the average person, and of those psychiatrists, 70% say that the unhappiness is NOT due to social stigmatization (13)\n * 25-33% of homosexuals and lesbians are alcoholics (11)\n * Of homosexuals questioned in one study reports that 43% admit to 500 or more partners in a lifetime, 28% admit to 1000 or more in a lifetime, and of these people, 79% say that half of those partners are total strangers, and 70% of those sexual contacts are one night stands (or, as one homosexual admits in the film \"The Castro\", one minute stands) (3). Also, it is a favorite past-time of many homosexuals to go to \"cruisy areas\" and have anonymous sex\n * 78% of homosexuals are affected by STDs (20)\n * Judge John Martaugh, chief magistrate of the New York City Criminal Court has said, \"Homosexuals account for half the murders in large cities\" (10)\n * Captain William Riddle of the Los Angeles Police says, \"30,000 sexually abused children in Los Angeles were victims of homosexuals\" (10)\n * 50% of suicides can be attributed to homosexuals (10)\n * Dr. Daniel Capron, a practicing psychiatrist, says, \"Homosexuality by definition is not healthy and wholesome. The homosexual person, at best, will be unhappier and more unfulfilled than the sexually normal person\" (10). For other psychiatrists who believe that homosexuality is wrong, please see National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality\n * It takes approximately $300,000 to take care of each AIDS victim, so thanks to the promiscuous lifestyle of homosexuals, medical insurance rates have been skyrocketing for all of us(10)\n * Homosexuals were responsible for spreading AIDS in the United States, and then raised up violent groups like Act Up and Ground Zero to complain about it. Even today, homosexuals account for well over 50% of the AIDS cases in the United States, which is quite a large number considering that they account for only 1-2% of the population\n * Homosexuals account for a disproportionate number of hepatitis cases: 70-80% in San Francisco, 29% in Denver, 66% in New York City, 56% in Toronto, 42% in Montreal, and 26% in Melbourne (8)\n * 37% of homosexuals engage in sadomasochism, which accounts for many accidental deaths. In San Francisco, classes were held to teach homosexuals how to not kill their partners during sadomasochism (8)\n * 41% of homosexuals say they have had sex with strangers in public restrooms, 60% say they have had sex with strangers in bathhouses, and 64% of these encounters have involved the use of illegal drugs (8)\n * Depending on the city, 39-59% of homosexuals are infected with intestinal parasites like worms, flukes and amoebae, which is common in filthy third world countries (8)\n * The median age of death of homosexuals is 42 (only 9% live past age 65). This drops to 39 if the cause of death is AIDS. The median age of death of a married heterosexual man is 75 (8)\n * The median age of death of lesbians is 45 (only 24% live past age 65). The median age of death of a married heterosexual woman is 79 (8)\n * Homosexuals are 100 times more likely to be murdered (usually by another homosexual) than the average person, 25 times more likely to commit suicide, and 19 times more likely to die in a traffic accident (8)\n * 21% of lesbians die of murder, suicide or traffic accident, which is at a rate of 534 times higher than the number of white heterosexual females aged 25-44 who die of these things(8)\n * 50% of the calls to a hotline to report \"XXXXX bashing\" involved domestic violence (i.e., homosexuals beating up other homosexuals) (18)\n * About 50% of the women on death row are lesbians (12).\n \n Homosexuals prey on children.\n \n * 33% of homosexuals ADMIT to minor/adult sex (7)\n * There is a notable homosexual group, consisting of thousands of members, known as the North American Man and Boy Love Association ( NAMBLA). This is a child molesting homosexual group whose cry is \"SEX BEFORE 8 BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.\" This group can be seen marching in most major homosexual parades across the United States\n * Homosexuals commit more than 33% of all reported child molestations in the United States, which, assuming homosexuals make up 2% of the population, means that 1 in 20 homosexuals is a child molestor, while 1 in 490 heterosexuals is a child molestor (19)\n * 73% of all homosexuals have had sex with boys under 19 years of age (9)\n * Many homosexuals admit that they are pedophiles: \"The love between men and boys is at the foundation of homosexuality\" (22)\n * Because homosexuals can't reproduce naturally, they resort to recruiting children. Homosexuals can be heard chanting \"TEN PERCENT IS NOT ENOUGH, RECRUIT, RECRUIT, RECRUIT\" in their homosexual parades. A group called the \"Lesbian Avengers\" prides itself on trying to recruit young girls. They print \"WE RECRUIT\" on their literature. Some other homosexuals aren't as overt about this, but rather try to infiltrate society and get into positions where they will have access to the malleable minds of young children (e.g., the clergy, teachers, Boy Scout leaders, etc.) (8). See the DC Lesbian Avengers web page, and DC Lesbian Avengers Press Release, where they threaten to recruit little boys and girls. Also, see AFA Action Alert.\n If you can't see the unnatural perversions and negative social impact of this corrupt lifestyle on our society according to these statistics, then you are clearly and loudly proving that you have been given over to a reprobate mind emoticon_xagree",

And what constitutes sex? By your logic (I am cutting to the end as I already know where you justify it) any sex without the primary intention to reproduce would be a sin. \n \n There is a biological desire to not just have sex, but to experience the emotional attachment that goes with it (yes it does happen to men once in awhile, right before we go to sleep). Which would suggest sex is more than just reproduction, but also part of a social building mechanism. If this is true then the there is little merit to the argument it is unnatural because it can't reproduce.

First of All Jubus did not Preach only Love, He advocated all the atrocities found in the old testament. You can mis-interpret him all you want to fit your beliefs but he said himself he did not come to CHANGE the old Laws... here's what he said in case you need a reminder....\n \n Matthew 5:17-20\n \n The Fulfillment of the Law\n 17 \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. 18 For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. 19 Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. \n \n Now.. Going by this Jebus meant that everyone should adhere to the Laws written by the Old Prophets... so this is what he ws advocating with his \" LOVE\"\n \n 1) Capital Punishment Crimes:\n \n Kill People Who Don't Listen to Priests\n \n Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the LORD your God must be put to death. Such evil must be purged from Israel. (Deuteronomy 17:12 NLT)\n \n Kill Witches\n \n You should not let a sorceress live. (Exodus 22:17 NAB)\n \n Kill Homosexuals\n \"If a man lies with a male as with a women, both of them shall be put to death for their abominable deed; they have forfeited their lives.\" (Leviticus 20:13 NAB)\n \n Kill Fortunetellers\n \n A man or a woman who acts as a medium or fortuneteller shall be put to death by stoning; they have no one but themselves to blame for their death. (Leviticus 20:27 NAB)\n \n Death for Hitting Dad\n \n Whoever strikes his father or mother shall be put to death. (Exodus 21:15 NAB)\n \n Death for Cursing Parents\n \n 1) If one curses his father or mother, his lamp will go out at the coming of darkness. (Proverbs 20:20 NAB)\n \n 2) All who curse their father or mother must be put to death. They are guilty of a capital offense. (Leviticus 20:9 NLT)\n \n Death for Adultery\n \n If a man commits adultery with another man's wife, both the man and the woman must be put to death. (Leviticus 20:10 NLT)\n \n Death for Fornication\n \n A priest's daughter who loses her honor by committing fornication and thereby dishonors her father also, shall be burned to death. (Leviticus 21:9 NAB)\n \n Death to Followers of Other Religions\n \n Whoever sacrifices to any god, except the Lord alone, shall be doomed. (Exodus 22:19 NAB)\n \n Kill Nonbelievers\n \n They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul; and everyone who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. (2 Chronicles 15:12-13 NAB)\n \n Kill False Prophets\n \n If a man still prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall say to him, \"You shall not live, because you have spoken a lie in the name of the Lord.\" When he prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall thrust him through. (Zechariah 13:3 NAB)\n \n \n Kill the Entire Town if One Person Worships Another God\n \n Suppose you hear in one of the towns the LORD your God is giving you that some worthless rabble among you have led their fellow citizens astray by encouraging them to worship foreign gods. In such cases, you must examine the facts carefully. If you find it is true and can prove that such a detestable act has occurred among you, you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock. Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the street and burn it. Put the entire town to the torch as a burnt offering to the LORD your God. That town must remain a ruin forever; it may never be rebuilt. Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction. Then the LORD will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you. He will have compassion on you and make you a great nation, just as he solemnly promised your ancestors. \"The LORD your God will be merciful only if you obey him and keep all the commands I am giving you today, doing what is pleasing to him.\" (Deuteronomy 13:13-19 NLT)\n \n Kill Women Who Are Not Virgins On Their Wedding Night\n \n But if this charge is true (that she wasn't a virgin on her wedding night), and evidence of the girls virginity is not found, they shall bring the girl to the entrance of her fathers house and there her townsman shall stone her to death, because she committed a crime against Israel by her unchasteness in her father's house. Thus shall you purge the evil from your midst. (Deuteronomy 22:20-21 NAB)\n \n Kill Followers of Other Religions.\n \n 1) If your own full brother, or your son or daughter, or your beloved wife, or you intimate friend, entices you secretly to serve other gods, whom you and your fathers have not known, gods of any other nations, near at hand or far away, from one end of the earth to the other: do not yield to him or listen to him, nor look with pity upon him, to spare or shield him, but kill him. Your hand shall be the first raised to slay him; the rest of the people shall join in with you. You shall stone him to death, because he sought to lead you astray from the Lord, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that place of slavery. And all Israel, hearing of this, shall fear and never do such evil as this in your midst. (Deuteronomy 13:7-12 NAB)\n 2) Suppose a man or woman among you, in one of your towns that the LORD your God is giving you, has done evil in the sight of the LORD your God and has violated the covenant by serving other gods or by worshiping the sun, the moon, or any of the forces of heaven, which I have strictly forbidden. When you hear about it, investigate the matter thoroughly. If it is true that this detestable thing has been done in Israel, then that man or woman must be taken to the gates of the town and stoned to death. (Deuteronomy 17:2-5 NLT)\n \n Death for Blasphemy\n \n One day a man who had an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father got into a fight with one of the Israelite men. During the fight, this son of an Israelite woman blasphemed the LORD's name. So the man was brought to Moses for judgment. His mother's name was Shelomith. She was the daughter of Dibri of the tribe of Dan. They put the man in custody until the LORD's will in the matter should become clear. Then the LORD said to Moses, \"Take the blasphemer outside the camp, and tell all those who heard him to lay their hands on his head. Then let the entire community stone him to death. Say to the people of Israel: Those who blaspheme God will suffer the consequences of their guilt and be punished. Anyone who blasphemes the LORD's name must be stoned to death by the whole community of Israel. Any Israelite or foreigner among you who blasphemes the LORD's name will surely die. (Leviticus 24:10-16 NLT)\n \n Kill False Prophets\n \n 1) Suppose there are prophets among you, or those who have dreams about the future, and they promise you signs or miracles, and the predicted signs or miracles take place. If the prophets then say, 'Come, let us worship the gods of foreign nations,' do not listen to them. The LORD your God is testing you to see if you love him with all your heart and soul. Serve only the LORD your God and fear him alone. Obey his commands, listen to his voice, and cling to him. The false prophets or dreamers who try to lead you astray must be put to death, for they encourage rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of slavery in the land of Egypt. Since they try to keep you from following the LORD your God, you must execute them to remove the evil from among you. (Deuteronomy 13:1-5 NLT)\n 2) But any prophet who claims to give a message from another god or who falsely claims to speak for me must die.' You may wonder, 'How will we know whether the prophecy is from the LORD or not?' If the prophet predicts something in the LORD's name and it does not happen, the LORD did not give the message. That prophet has spoken on his own and need not be feared. (Deuteronomy 18:20-22 NLT)\n \n Infidels and Gays Should Die\n \n So God let them go ahead and do whatever shameful things their hearts desired. As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other's bodies. Instead of believing what they knew was the truth about God, they deliberately chose to believe lies. So they worshiped the things God made but not the Creator himself, who is to be praised forever. Amen. That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires. Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other. And the men, instead of having normal sexual relationships with women, burned with lust for each other. Men did shameful things with other men and, as a result, suffered within themselves the penalty they so richly deserved. When they refused to acknowledge God, he abandoned them to their evil minds and let them do things that should never be done. Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, fighting, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip. They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful. They are forever inventing new ways of sinning and are disobedient to their parents. They refuse to understand, break their promises, and are heartless and unforgiving. They are fully aware of God's death penalty for those who do these things, yet they go right ahead and do them anyway. And, worse yet, they encourage others to do them, too. (Romans 1:24-32 NLT)\n \n Kill Anyone who Approaches the Tabernacle\n \n For the LORD had said to Moses, 'Exempt the tribe of Levi from the census; do not include them when you count the rest of the Israelites. You must put the Levites in charge of the Tabernacle of the Covenant, along with its furnishings and equipment. They must carry the Tabernacle and its equipment as you travel, and they must care for it and camp around it. Whenever the Tabernacle is moved, the Levites will take it down and set it up again. Anyone else who goes too near the Tabernacle will be executed.' (Numbers 1:48-51 NLT)\n \n Kill People for Working on the Sabbath\n \n The LORD then gave these further instructions to Moses: 'Tell the people of Israel to keep my Sabbath day, for the Sabbath is a sign of the covenant between me and you forever. It helps you to remember that I am the LORD, who makes you holy. Yes, keep the Sabbath day, for it is holy. Anyone who desecrates it must die; anyone who works on that day will be cut off from the community. Work six days only, but the seventh day must be a day of total rest. I repeat: Because the LORD considers it a holy day, anyone who works on the Sabbath must be put to death.' (Exodus 31:12-15 NLT)\n \n Go tell it to someone who might believe your swill.. I personally don't need YOUR religion or any other .....",

Gay 'marriage' is broadening an opposite-gender institution to include social taboos. Making marriage an anything-goes institution isn't progress.\n\n \n I am sorry but your arguments just don't hold water. Marriage was redefined when men no longer could have concubines, it was redefined when women could choose who they could marry, it was redefined when only adults could marry. It was redefined when divorce was established. All material changes done for no other reason then society changed its mind on what marriage is. At times the changes can be significant, other no so much. \n \n When you say just geoups left out think about that a second. These were not groups left out, blacks were considered people they were property 3/5 people and that only for tax purposes. They had rights equal to a pet, sometimes less. Abolishing slavery redefined what a person was. Women had only the illusion of being considered people. For both groups the workplace was redefined more than once, what equality is has been redefined. As we ebb forwards and backwards we, having found that self governance to be ideally suited to our beliefs adapt our legal system to balance the wants of the individual with the needs of the whole.\n \n Marriage is not about moral values or religious beliefs. Christians and religion in general like to lay claim to things like marriage. It isn't yours to dictate ownership rights to others. Religion has nothing to offer marriage except a ceremony. If you believe in God then you know God is not confined to a building and is capable of seeing and hearing thru eyes and ears other than those of a priest, rabbi, elder, shaman etc. Marriage is defined however we decide to do so. If we repercussions exists for soiling the sanctity of marriage then there should be divorce only in the case of adultery. There just is no justifiable reason that is not based on a subjective belief and we try very hard to stay away from such social landmines. \n \n If you really wanted to be fair just abolish everything the distinguishes legally a married person from a single person, because as a single person I am penalized for not being married. Remember the government works by it power of coercion when it wants people to do something it pays them or it makes them pay. That is why our tax system is like it is.

There are some who want it all, but I think the majority would be content to just be be treated as if it didn't matter who they slept with\n \n \nThat doesn't mean, of course, that people can't walk down the courthouse and get a marriage license in a way that is completely void of any religious trappings. This is why we have to always keep in mind that LEGAL marriage and CULTURAL marriage are not the same thing. People on both sides of the issue tend to muddy them together.\n\n \n I agree. I respect if a church doesn't want to perform a ceremony for same sex couples. I disagree with the choice to do so, speaking as a person who was not permitted to take communion at my wedding because the drunken priest felt my first communion wasn't sufficient, the wife she went had a pick-nick on crackers and wine while kneeled there losing circulation in my legs, but I digress. Religion though is not content with being allowed to discriminate within it's domain. It is compelled to step over it's boundaries and interpret the law through the Bible. Religion doesn't say same sex couples can't get married in church they don't want a legal marriage being permissible also. They are not smudging the line they are erasing it. I could say they are redefining the legal definition, which for those states that made no distinction they are trying to.\n \n \nI could not agree more with this. I have been arguing that for years, in fact.\n The only truly fair way to deal with marriage benefits is a.) either do away with them, or b.) apply them to any and every possible case that comes along wanting them.\n\n \n We can define marriage as one person willing to sleep alone argue with themselves drive better and is willing to accept better deductions and higher ceilings on their tax return.",

Stop trying to steer clear of the issue again Jyoshu. Why must you religious ideologues always skip a question, or avoid a subject when you know your wrong or can't give a defense? \n \n You still have yet to reply to my post on Hitler so please enlighten me about these \"gremlins\".\n \n \nYou're going to have to get used to the fact that most of society doesn't see things your way, and just because you say something doesn't mean it is.\n\n \n Oh yeah? and who is most of the society? Ignorant blind spiritualists like yourself? Or perhaps self righteous, snub religious people like yourself? Or shall I giver another example?\n \n Point is you don't speak for society Jyoshu you only speak for YOU. So you just said that I need to get used to the fact that you don't see things \"my\" way. \n \n OK. So your a prejudiced hypocrite. I already knew that from day one Jyoshu. So actually nothing new has occurred except once again you dancing around the issue again..\n \n Just say it! say you don't like gay people! don't sugar coat BS and say \"lifestyle\" or \"movement\" or \"actions\" you give yourself too much leeway and it show! You try to walk this fine line between bigot, and moderate when your actually well a bigot!\n \n It's OK. Just stand in the corner with Zorba and Easy and let the grown ups talk OK?",

And homosexual relations are unnatural, according to scripture. \n \n Are there other Scriptures in the New Testament which deal with homosexuality?\n \n Yes. Romans 1:24-27; I Timothy 1:10 and Jude 7. If one takes these Scriptures seriously, homosexuality will be recognized as an evil. The Romans passage is unmistakably clear. Paul attributes the moral depravity of men and women to their rejection of \"the truth of God\" (1:25). They refused \"to retain God in their knowledge\" (1:28), thereby dethroning God and deifying themselves. The Old Testament had clearly condemned homosexuality but in Paul's day there were those persons who rejected its teaching. Because of their rejection of God's commands He punished their sin by delivering them over to it.\n \n The philosophy of substituting God's Word with one's own reasoning commenced with Satan. He introduced it at the outset of the human race by suggesting to Eve that she ignore God's orders, assuring her that in so doing she would become like God with the power to discern good and evil (Genesis 3:1-5). That was Satan's big lie. Paul said that when any person rejects God's truth, his mind becomes \"reprobate,\" meaning perverted, void of sound judgment. The perverted mind, having rejected God's truth, is not capable of discerning good and evil.\n \n In Romans 1:26-31 twenty-three punishable sins are listed with homosexuality leading the list. Paul wrote, \"For this cause God gave them up into vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet\" (Romans 1:26, 27). These verses are telling us that homosexuals suffer in their body and personality the inevitable consequences of their wrong doing. Notice that the behaviour of the homosexual is described as a \"vile affection\" (1:26). The Greek word translated \"vile\" (atimia) means filthy, dirty, evil, dishonourable. The word \"affection\" in Greek is pathos, used by the Greeks of either a good or bad desire. Here in the context of Romans it is used in a bad sense. The \"vile affection\" is a degrading passion, a shameful lust. Both the desire (lusting after) and the act of homosexuality are condemned in the Bible as sin.\n \n Homosexuality: The Christian Perspective | Bible.org - Worlds Largest Bible Study Site\n \n Come out of Sodom; come out of Gomorrah.

You haven't taken that in context with the rest of scripture.\n \n Let's start with Matthew 7:1 -\"Judge not, and you will not be judged.\" (Matthew 7:1)\n \n Jesus is not saying that we cannot make judgments about people, he is saying that we should not be hypocrites if we do. In Matthew 7:5 he says, \"You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brothers eye.\"\n \n God acknowledges the legitimacy of civil authorities to judge:  \n \n Romans 13:1-4: \"Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. (v. 4) For he (the reigning authority) is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of God's wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.\" (Also note Matthew 5:25; Acts 25:10-11)\n \n God has commanded the church to make correct judgments:\n \n John 7:24: \"Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment.\"\n \n Matthew 18:15-17: \"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses (note Deuteronomy 19:15). If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector .\"\n \n God commands us to warn the wicked to turn from their sins:\n \n \"When I say to the wicked, 'You will surely die,' and you do not warn him or speak out to warn the wicked from his wicked way that he may live, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. \"Yet if you have warned the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered yourself. (Ezekiel 3:18-19)\n \n Bet you don't like that one! Or this one:\n \n \"When I say to the wicked, 'O wicked man, you will surely die,' and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require from your hand. \"But if you on your part warn a wicked man to turn from his way and he does not turn from his way, he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your life. (Ezekiel 33:8-9)\n \n God commands us to judge according to one's 'fruits.'\n \n Matthew 7:17-20: \"Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.....every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.\"\n \n Saints of Christ will judge the world, and angels:\n \n I Corinthians 6:2: \"Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?\"\n \n I Corinthians 6:3: \"Do you not know that we will judge angels?\"\n \n Jesus condemned the teachers of the law and the Pharisees:\n \n Matthew 23:27-28: \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.\"\n \n John the Baptist rebukes King Herod for adultery and other sins:\n \n Luke 3:19: \"But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other things he had done, Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.\" \n \n Stephen rebukes the Jewish leaders:\n \n Acts 7:51-53:  \"You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit!  Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him - you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.\" \n \n Jesus rebukes the Christ-deniers:\n \n Jesus said to them, &#8220;If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me. Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say. You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father&#8217;s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!\" - John 8:42-44\n \n Also note all the Old Testament prophets who condemned sin and corrupt moral leadership, and who were persecuted for their discernment and duty.\n \n You're busted again (still), Mr. pick-and-chooser.

If you want others to live by your False book of fairy tales it would be a Good Idea for you to read it and follow it yourself first. Choosing one or two scriptures and using them to attack people is only making you look foolish.\n \n \n\n The philosophy of substituting God's Word with one's own reasoning commenced with Satan. He introduced it at the outset of the human race by suggesting to Eve that she ignore God's orders, assuring her that in so doing she would become like God with the power to discern good and evil (Genesis 3:1-5). That was Satan's big lie. Paul said that when any person rejects God's truth, his mind becomes \"reprobate,\" meaning perverted, void of sound judgment. The perverted mind, having rejected God's truth, is not capable of discerning good and evil.\n\n \n No, Satan is just as imaginary as God is.. Religious Zealots of old had a need to create a Nemesis for God so they could blame bad XXXX on something other than their perfect Deity. When you realize it's all imaginary then maybe you will understand truth.\n \n \n\n In Romans 1:26-31 twenty-three punishable sins are listed with homosexuality leading the list. Paul wrote, \"For this cause God gave them up into vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet\" (Romans 1:26, 27). These verses are telling us that homosexuals suffer in their body and personality the inevitable consequences of their wrong doing. Notice that the behaviour of the homosexual is described as a \"vile affection\" (1:26). The Greek word translated \"vile\" (atimia) means filthy, dirty, evil, dishonourable. The word \"affection\" in Greek is pathos, used by the Greeks of either a good or bad desire. Here in the context of Romans it is used in a bad sense. The \"vile affection\" is a degrading passion, a shameful lust. Both the desire (lusting after) and the act of homosexuality are condemned in the Bible as sin.\n\n \n Yep.. and these same 23 are also listed in the Old testament Laws which you yourself have told me no longer apply because Jebus changed them. Make up your mind, and for once take your head out of your XXX and listen to the swill you spout .",

You know straight sex is a sin also, but there are circumstances where it is considered not to be. The muddling is what you continue to do. As an example you somewhere stated that Romans in listing all the sins of the terrible people places homosexuality right at the top. We both know that isn't true, yet you will keep on with it. \n \n So just as straight sex has circumstances where it is a sin and as well as some in which it is not. So to would homosexual sex.

These verses are telling us that homosexuals suffer in their body and personality the inevitable consequences of their wrong doing. Notice that the behaviour of the homosexual is described as a \"vile affection\" (1:26). The Greek word translated \"vile\" (atimia) means filthy, dirty, evil, dishonourable. The word \"affection\" in Greek is pathos, used by the Greeks of either a good or bad desire. Here in the context of Romans it is used in a bad sense.
