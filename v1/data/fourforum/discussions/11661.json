   "Hello,\n I find paper books and high-liters helpful to get my mind off the computer screen, rather simplistic maybe, but it engages my brain and its reinforced by a physical action. I also think clipping articles out of publications and filing them is productive. Again I know it can be done on-line and I do it on-line also but I think its good to mix up different activity's for brain storming.\n \n A white board can be helpful.\n Also a friend to use as a sounding board can find a lot of weak spots in a presentation ... before you make them public! :)\n \n Cheers,\n Vis.",
