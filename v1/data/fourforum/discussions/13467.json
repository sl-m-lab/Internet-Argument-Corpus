   "&#8220;The only argument that Anita was making is that they are not really a news organization, if you watch even its not even their commentators, but a lot of their news program. It&#8217;s really not news, it&#8217;s pushing a point of view and the bigger thing is that other news organizations like yours, ought not to treat them that way. And we&#8217;re not going to treat them that way, we&#8217;re going to appear on their shows and participate, but understanding that they represent a point of view.&#8221;\nAxelrod: Fox News Is 'Not Really A News Organization' - George's Bottom Line\n \n Someone bring out the whambulance for the Obama administration. (my apologies for the profanity on the image) \n http://doogs.files.wordpress.com/2007/08/whambulance.jpg\n \n Don't worry, I've found a video of David Axelrod saying the same thing about CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC, and CBS. At least he is fair. \n \n I have to give republicans created on this one...they might complain about CNN and MSNBC but they still go onto the networks and, for the most part, don't go so far to say they aren't news organizations. This isn't to say they don't get close but I think the Obama folks have crossed over the normal mud thrown by the Bush's and Clinton's at the media.\n \n I'm not sure why the Obama folks feel it is a good idea to attack the ones who have half the cable news viewers (aka all the other networks combined).\n \n EDIT: Here is a good article by the New York Times of all people: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/18/weekinreview/18davidcarr.html?hpw",

Glenn Beck isn't reporting the nightly news in his reports. He is commenting on and exposing the Obama agenda. Sean Hannity and O'Reilly do the same thing. But they aren't reporting the daily News on Fox. \n \n So here's the difference between Fox and the other networks which are in the pocket of the Obamanites. Fox reports the News in an objective way which offers both sides of the story, even stories which are critical of the political Right. The sold out leftist media like CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, NBC and CNBC all use their main line reporters of the NEWS, NOT just their commentators to bolster, support and endorse Obama and his Socialist agenda while ignoring anything about him which is negative or critical of him.\n \n That isn't reporting News, that is becoming a political partisan and has cost all other Networks all credibility as sources of objective information which is why FOX has become the #1 News source on TV, while all others have been let in the dust and relegated to the dust bin of history as propagandists by the vast majority of viewers. People want both sides of the story so they can decide for themselves what to believe, but the leftists are so arrogant they think they have the right to tell people what they must believe. What these viewer numbers really show is that FOX'S viewership crosses all party lines and Dems as well as Independents and Republicans are turning to them for a balanced perspective on the days events. \n \n But what is even more disturbing to Obama is that the commentators like Beck and O'Reilly are getting huge ratings just for giving their take on the impact these socialist policies are having on our future as free americans. And you may hate what they represent, but I challenge you to prove that anything they are saying about the radically socialist/communist/un-american people he has surrounded himself with, is untrue in any way.\n \n As for your inane and inaccurate cartoon, here's one which at least tells the truth.\n http://z.about.com/d/politicalhumor/1/0/L/z/2/missing-yes-we-can.gif\n \n AND HERE'S ANOTHER...\n \n http://z.about.com/d/politicalhumor/1/0/N/w/2/Wall-Street-Redux.jpg",

We have other patriots who love our country who have other ideas about how to solve our problems... We're patriots; they're patriots too.\" \n \n That was my friend Van Jones, speaking about the Tea Party at the Summit on Jobs and America's Future in Washington last week (full disclosure: the conference was sponsored by the Campaign for America's Future which I co-direct). His analysis of the Tea Party was insightful, generous, and focused on the debate on values and ideas that has to be waged across America. He disagreed with the Tea Party, but he did not disparage them.\n \n Contrast that to the right-wing smear merchants that have gone into high gear to slime Van Jones. Jones has been a favorite target of Glenn Beck, Andrew Breitbart and many castigators on the right for over a year now. The most recent ad hominem slur from Breitbart was characteristically beyond the pale.\n \n Van Jones is an extraordinary leader, so it isn't surprising that the right has targeted him. They didn't propagate the lies about Obama's birth because he lost; they propagated them because he won big and had to be brought down. They didn't target ACORN because it was ineffective; they targeted it because it was the most effective organization registering and getting out the vote of minorities that increasingly feel locked out of the Republican Party. They don't target Planned Parenthood because it is extreme; they target it because it provides essential and popular family planning services that they bitterly oppose. \n \n Like most progressives, I generally don't listen to nor bother to respond to right-wing bile. But the campaign against Van Jones has been unrelenting and slanderous. Van is leading efforts to build a movement that will challenge the right, so the calumny will get worse. It is worth just once to set the record straight.\n \n Van Jones is a father, a man of faith, an entrepreneur and innovator, author and life-long champion of the poor and disenfranchised. He graduated from Yale Law School, but he rose above it, to devote his life to making America better.\n \n He has created three remarkable advocacy organizations: the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, a California-based group working for alternatives to violence; Color of Change, an on-line advocacy group for African Americans; and Green For All, to promote the creation of a clean energy economy to drive economic growth and battle poverty.\n \n Leaders like Van see farther than most of us. Van was one of the first to understand the potential of the green industrial revolution, and the opportunity it posed for those communities that had been largely locked out of the last industrial revolution. He authored a best-selling book that helped put the term \"Green-Jobs\" on the map. He advocated for the first-ever piece of Green-Jobs legislation, the \"Green Jobs Act of 2007, which was signed into law by none other than President George W Bush. He joined in building the Apollo Alliance and then created Green for All to champion this cause. He accepted a position in the Obama White House to help drive clean and green solutions to our economic problems.\n \n For this, he was targeted by Fox and featured on Glenn Beck's backboard. They propagated the smears and lies that continue to this day. Rather than let the administration be dragged into that muck, Van Jones took the high road, corrected the record, and moved on. He now holds a joint appointment at Princeton University, as a distinguished visiting fellow in both the Center for African American Studies and in the Program in Science, Technology and Environmental Policy at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Van is also a senior fellow at the Center For American Progress and a senior policy advisor at Green For All. \n \n Van Jones hasn't let the right intimidate him. His electric presentations are helping to galvanize a movement to rebuild the American Dream. And the greater his leadership, the more the right recycles the slurs and lies, the more he ignores them, the more rabid they get. Breitbart illustrates the hysteria, labeling Van a \"punk,\" \"human toxin,\" and a \" cockroach\" in the course of a brief interview.\n \n But the right has perfected the art of the big lie, repeating a falsehood over and over until people begin to think there must be something to it. Three big lies are deployed regularly in their attempt to discredit Van Jones. They get recycled through the right wing sound machine. Seldom heard is the truth. So here is the truth. \n \n Right-Wing Slur: Van is 9/11 Truther.\n \n Truth: Van Jones believes and has stated repeatedly that the 9/11 terrorist attacks on our nation's soil were planned and carried out by Osama bin Laden and members of Al Qaeda. He never saw, signed, or endorsed any statement indicating otherwise. Six years ago, a group claiming to represent 9/11 families asked for his support and then attached his name, without his knowledge or permission, to abhorrent language that they never showed him. The group has since admitted they do not have his signature.\n \n \n Right-Wing Slur: Van is a \"Communist.\" \n \n \n \n Truth: Van Jones is a leading champion of free market solutions and American innovation. His award-winning work is rooted in business-friendly, market-based ideas. His bestselling book, The Green-Collar Economy, argues that government should provide incentives for private sector innovation. Van has forged successful partnerships with green businesses and served on the board of a national business association. (And isn't this slur beyond its expiration date? The Soviet Union is no more; the Cold War is over. Global corporations vie to gain a foothold in China still governed by so-called communists. Can't we can the 50s calumnies now that we're in a new century?)\n \n \n Right-Wing Slur: Van Jones is an ex-convict.\n \n \n \n Truth: Van Jones is a law-abiding citizen and has never been to prison or convicted of any crime. Van's only scrape with the law was when he was wrongfully detained for four hours in a San Francisco warehouse where police held thousands of peaceful protesters in May 1992. A Yale Law student at the time, Van had attended the event as a legal monitor. In a lawsuit, he won monetary compensation for his false imprisonment.\n \n Of course, refutation won't stop the lies, just as the right will never stop questioning Obama's citizenship. \n \n But for those outside the circles of hate, understand the charges for what they are: A backhanded tribute to the past accomplishments and future potential of Van Jones as a leader and advocate for a better America.",

UNITED STATES\n \n \n ACORN, Acorn Institute, Inc., and Mhany Management, Inc., f/k/a/ New York Acorn Housing Company, Inc., Plaintiffs-Appellees, v. UNITED STATES of America, Shaun Donovan, Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Peter Orszag Director Office of Management and Budget, Timothy R. Geithner Jr., Secretary of the Department of Treasury of the United States, Lisa P. Jackson, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Gary Locke, Secretary of Commerce, and Robert Gates, Secretary of Defense, Defendants-Appellants.\n \n \n Docket Nos. 09-5172-cv (L), 10-0992-cv (CON).\n \n Argued: June 24, 2010. -- August 13, 2010 \n Before MINER, CABRANES, and WESLEY, Circuit Judges. \n .....\n B. Mismanagement, Fraud, and Congressional Response\n \n In 1999 and 2000, Dale Rathke, the brother of ACORN's founder Wade Rathke, embezzled nearly $1 million from the organization. Upon discovery of the embezzlement, \"a small group of executives decided to keep the information from almost all of the group's board members and not to alert law enforcement.\" A restitution agreement was signed in which the Rathke family \"agreed to repay [, beginning in 2001], the amount embezzled in exchange for confidentiality.\" In June 2008, however, a whistleblower forced ACORN to disclose the embezzlement, and at that time ACORN's mismanagement came under serious public scrutiny. ACORN immediately prepared an internal report noting, among other issues, \"potentially improper use of charitable dollars for political purposes\" as well as possible violations of federal law by ACORN and its \"web\" of nearly 200 affiliated organizations.\n \n ACORN's reputation suffered further upon accusations of voter registration fraud, for which ACORN's workers had been convicted in prior years. Between October 2008 and May 2009, two more ACORN workers were charged with, and convicted of, voter registration fraud. While ACORN adopted \"several good-governance policies\" to address the problems identified in the internal report, a new scandal arose in the summer of 2009 when \"hidden camera\" videos revealed ACORN employees and volunteers providing advice and counseling in support of a proposed prostitution business.\n \n ........\n \n III. CONCLUSION\n \n In accordance with the foregoing, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed in part and vacated in part. We remand for further proceedings as to the plaintiffs' First Amendment and due process claims.Docket Nos. 09-5172-cv (L), 10-0992-cv (CON). - ACORN v. UNITED STATES - US 2nd Circuit \n",

Couple that with the consolidation of refineries under fewer owners and the fact that no new refineries are being built and you create a crisis. \n\n \n Rig count data and refinery utilization data are published every month. We have not had more than 89% refinery utilization (and that is actual documented capability, not theoretical) for over a decade. Why would anybody build new refineries when we are not even using the ones we have to capacity? Also, the \"no new refineries being built\" thing is a little misleading. That is green field projects. You cannot get a green field project approved. Even if you can get past environmental regs, NIMBY is still very much alive and well. \n \n We have had plenty of refinery expansions and parallel construction, though. Think about the infrastructure that has to go into a new refinery. MASSIVE electrical service, pipeline extensions, water and wastewater systems. Why go through all that when you can build right up against an existing refinery, share all the infrastructure, and count your project as an expansion instead of a green field project, which does away with 90% of the environmental junk. \n \n As far as exploration goes, frankly I think that the exploration argument certainly points to the end of cheap hydrocarbons. Where are the oil companies fighting to drill? Deep water. They are fighting to be allowed to drill wells that are under 2 miles of water that then go 3 miles into the earth...for a total pipe length of 5 miles to the bottom, and they cant actually touch the top of the well. If there was easier oil out there to be had, they would be all over it. \n \n The project BP was working on when the deepwater horizon exploded had a projected production cost of $128 per barrel. \n \n \nLibya's oil production is a few % of demand.

China, with our help, has become a great oil resource sucking machine. Oil, phosphate, rare earths, steel, zinc, etc., \n\n \n On Libya, I agree...but the fact that the Sauds could not bring up production certainly warrants the spike. There simply is not enough oil left out there for us to live the lifestyle we are used to and for developing nations to grow. Too many customers, not enough product, prices go up.

It is also a fact that it was the first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln who freed the slaves. One more fact you leftists like to deny is that in the 60's during the civil rights movement it was the southern democrats who fought integration, lynched blacks who dared to attempt voter registration drives so they could create a voice in american politics and it was the southern democrats in Washington like Al Gore Senior who fought tooth and nail against the 1964 civil rights act until northern christians and republicans made real headway in arguing for racial equality for black people.\n \n As I said, or alluded to before...I minored in history. I need no history lesson from an obvious racist and bigot trying to win me over to his point of view. \n But like all issues democrats were on the wrong side of historically, they have co-opted the race issue by rewriting history. If one really considers the facts though, they will see that only under republicans who created real opportunities for minorities, did they finally start to make social and economic advances in this country.\n \n emoticon_rolleyesemoticon_confusedemoticon_smileemoticon_smileemoticon_smile\n \n Your problem is your misplaced sense of fairness is so warped you think creating a welfare state and forcing minorities into perpetual poverty while making endless promises to them every 4 years is a good thing. To you, this is social and economic advancement as you criticize republicans for wanting to end handouts and make real economic opportunities available to minorities.\n \n I know that's your standard mantra, but it doesn't have anything to do with me. You don't know me, and I prefer to keep it that way. If you asked me what my views were instead of assuming to know, that would be fair. But in your mad rush to \"entitlement\" via \"white privilege\", and your belief that you are omniscient, you have made an embarrassment of yourself. \n I'm all for abled-bodies, working, and getting fair pay for their endeavors. But I am committed to us caring for the sick, the elderly, children and the disadvantaged, as any Christian worth his salt would do. Moral majority my a**. Greedy SOB's is what you all are. Selfish bas***dsDemocrats want a needy underclass who is dependent upon them for security while republicans want the minorities to become economically independent so they can lift themselves out of poverty with the dignity that comes with economic security. I realize these facts are beyond your small mind to comprehend, but like all facts your in denial of, these are historically and factually undeniable. I felt it necessary to repeat that so maybe you'll actually absorb it. I wont expect too much though given my experience with godless heathens of your ilk.\n\n \n \n Oh, just like you have the white rich dependent on Republicans. And give me a friggin break. Republicans don't care about anyone except those who resemble them: conservative white men. Once again, you fail to realize that I don't accept racist bigoted white people telling me anything, much less who and how I am. \n Godless heathens? I went to a Episcopal boys choir school, in Chicago, Illinois, for 3 years. Sang mass 6 days out of 7, which, undoubtedly would prove to be more than the times you have ever set foot within a church.\n Fake Christian.",
