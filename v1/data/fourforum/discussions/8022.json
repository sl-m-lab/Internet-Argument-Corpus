We have been bound by treaty and promising to remove farming subsidies since 1992. \n \n \n I think those folks are just ungrateful, the whole lot of them. We gave them guys like Pinochet and Noriega to show them the wonders of the capitalist system, ran death squads in El Salvadore to help wipe out the evil socialists, and now, after we did all that for them, they turn agiunst us. Savages.\n \n What shoulod REALLY be a wakeup call for those who are still harboring the image of a strong America is the failure of the coup against Chavez. If you can't even pull off a coup in venezuela, you have truly become a paper tiger.",
