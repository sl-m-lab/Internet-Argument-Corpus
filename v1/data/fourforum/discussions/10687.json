   "Well, where does this \"energetic cycle\" come from and how will your \"life after death\" manifest itself?\n\n \n Energy contained within the body is released into the environment upon death. It sounds a bit like the elan vital, but I credit it to the internal chemistry of the body. This energy is recycled in the environment. Don't forget Newton! As to how it will manifest itself, I have no idea. Plato's soul cycling appeals to me, but I have no data, and therefore can't provide any actual evidence.\n \n \nThe Crusades happened after Mohammed and his ilk started killing Christians who would not bow down with them.\n\n \n Actually, they were probably started by the Pope in order to stop European Nobles killing each other. Islamic societies seem to have been tolerant of other religions (apart from Judaism), probably because they were too busy persecuting each other.\n \n \nI'm betting that had there never been any religions formed that nations would still have tried to conquer unlike peoples\n\n \n I won't argue there, but I'd still say that organised religion makes it too easy to dehumanise and persecute other people. At least people would recognise thier motives for what they truly are.\n \n \nTo say that atheists are insecure and want company is not ad hom. Being insecure is not a always a negative. \n\n \n Your tone read as being sarcastic. If I mis-read you I apologise. Accusing a group of people who you know very little about of all being insecure is verging close to personal attack. Whilst I agree that insecurity is not always a negative, it has more negative than positive attributes. \n \n \nWanting company (concurring comrades) is common in humans.\n\n \n True.
