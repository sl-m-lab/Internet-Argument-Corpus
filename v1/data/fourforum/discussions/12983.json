   "An excellent article on Huffington Post: Jeff Schweitzer: A Comical Failure of Moral Values: Twisted Ideas of Theory and Practice in the Republican Party\n \n Excerpt:\nThe link between morality and religion has been established so firmly over the past 2000 years that any shift to a strictly secular model will strike many as heretical even today, on par with Galileo's transgression so long ago. But morality based on religious teachings has an immediate problem in that the source document has credibility problems. We can demonstrate beyond any doubt the fallibility of religious doctrine from factual errors in the bible. From that, we can demonstrate easily enough the fallibility of religious morality. \n \n For 1600 years the Church defended as indisputable, divine fact the notion that the earth was the immobile center of the universe. We can see why they did so: the bible is unambiguous on this point in multiple passages. But when direct observations and objective truth finally revealed this divine fact to be anything but, the Church suddenly declared that nothing in Scripture actually said the earth was the center of the universe, thereby sweeping 1600 years of violently enforced dogma under the rug. And what a mighty big rug that is! And what a mighty big broom!\n \n Much else has also been swept under that rug. The Bible is wrong about the earth's age, off by more than 4 billion years. The creator apparently slept through Biology 101 because he makes mistakes concerning the biology of camels, snakes and mustard seeds, to name a few.\n \n These points are not raised to denigrate religion but to highlight religion's fallibility. These accumulating factual mistakes must call into question the certainty with which the Catholic Church and many Protestant denominations claim the Bible is infallible, since their previous insistence has proven unsubstantiated. These doubts about infallibility apply, too, to the Church's teachings on morality. Why would the Bible's moral proclamations carry any more weight than inaccurate but strongly enforced proclamations on the orbit of the sun?\n \n Only when we remove the false certainly that comes with claiming god is on our side can we truly confront the moral issues and ethical dilemmas that we face in our society. This epidemic of moral failure in the Republican Party is a clear symptom of the disease of intolerance; and such intolerance is an inevitable consequence of an appeal to divine insight. Why compromise when god says you're right?\n \n We cure this disease by adopting a moral code completely divorced from religion. That task is easier than it would first appear. Religious morality has a poor track record; we can do better. The bar has been set fairly low. \n \n Traits that we view as moral are deeply embedded in the human psyche. Honesty, fidelity, trustworthiness, kindness to others, and reciprocity are primeval characteristics that helped our ancestors survive. In a world of dangerous predators, we can speculate that early man could thrive only in cooperative groups. Good behavior likely strengthened the tribal bonds that were essential to survival. What we now call morality is really a suite of behaviors favored by natural selection in an animal weak alone but strong in numbers. We need to re-discover and appeal to this inner good derived from our biology and evolutionary history rather than to the myth of an invisible man in the sky with magical powers as a sound basis for our moral guidance.\n",

   "Even more significant to the topic than whether morality is a natural trait, in my opinion, is that the bible is grossly errant.

It is grossly self-contradictory and is full of double-standards and revisions that not only seem to stem from random whims of the authors or \"God himself\", but these contradictions are treated like they don't even occur. And when they are so blatant that they forced to be highlighted, there's always the response or \"well, God is sovereign, his ways is higher than ours\".

I could address those you just mentioned, like your confusing murder with divine justice, but let's go with what I originally asked for.\n\n Hmmmm... So we must now distinguish gospel morality from biblical morality for the sake of this discussion? Because there was no distinction in the original post. The topic addressed was biblical morality and whether or not it comes from a reliable source. \n \n Apparently, with the snap of your finger we can dismiss all of the commandments, law, and judeo-religious philosophy just like that. We can simply overlook the deeds of all of mankind before jesus' era, whether noble or malicious, regardless of whether God expressly endorsed them or not. All of a sudden, we're letting all that slide because you want to isolate the gospels from the rest of the bible. \n \n Cool\n \n However, I'm not going to look for contradictions among the few passages in the gospels that address morality. Morality in the gospels is simple: do unto others, love your neighboor, that kind of stuff. Its no different from the moral philosophy of nearly every other religion-based civilization of that era as well as thousands of years before. It wasn't a moral law, just a clue as to what moral direction we should be heading in. \n \n By the way, isn't divine justice grand?

If God says don't kill, then shouldn't it mean don't kill? Otherwise it should have been the 10 conditional options rather than the 10 commandments.

And of course its also ok to commit acts that look exactly like murder but isn't if its considered executing divine justice. \n \n If you look back over this discussion so far, you might start to see where going by the bible as a source of moral guidance creates huge problems. Yes, some of us are being deliberately cynical and obstinate, but the issue of misinterpretation, selective application, special pleading, apologetics, and so on just continues to bacome more complicated and cumbersome with time, rather than become more resolved. \n \n Or even better yet, look at history, or take any bible based religion and trace its path of division and doctrinal evolution. Not for a lack of effort or sincerety, \"open bible\" or pentecostal denominations are by far the most vastly divided sector of all religions in the world, and they are all derived entirely from the bible. They all believe in the holy spirit for clarity and accuracy in interpreting the word of God, and they all believe whole-heartedly that they have the truth. For what its worth, they all have a common theme and style of worship. Yet they differ over some tiny application of some biblical scripture, and one of the members takes a handful of the church he attends, becomes ordained, and a new denomination is born. And the cycle continues. Every church divides and spawns new denominations. \n \n How could a single source of so-called absolute truth, inspired by a single omniscient and all-wise God, taken to be inerrant and complete, create so much division, segregation, inter-religious enmity and oppression, to the point of religion-based civil and international wars, and yet still be considered the ultimate authority on human morality?

So I'm sorry that you see fit to blame God for all of the evil which has occurred due to Mans fallen nature, but it is God who has been working since A&E to redeem us from this sinful nature which introduced death and sin into our life experience.\n \n The great mystery which I personally struggle with and am unable to answer or satisfy is Gods continued respect for the continued existence and positions of the fallen angels/demons who followed satan in their mass revolt when 1/3rd of heavens angels refused to serve Man when God decided to create us in His image.\n \n For example, in Daniel it states this:\n Dan 10:12 Then he said to me, \"Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart on understanding {this} and on humbling yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to your words.\n Dan 10:13 \"But the prince of the kingdom of Persia was withstanding me for twenty-one days; then behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left there with the kings of Persia.\n Note the bolded. This angel who came to Daniel is explaining that a fallen angel who worked at harassing Persia spiritually speaking, had held him up for 21 days until Michael came and freed him up so he could finally get to Daniel in answer to his continuous prayers. \n \n This and other passages in the bible show that in spite of the rebellion and evil which satan and his minions represent on Earth, God has a relationship with them which is unique and special in that He continues to show them respect which is beyond my understanding for one, since they represent pure evil and hatred for Gods most precious creation which He created in His own image. \n \n We know that the satanic forces want nothing more than to destroy as many human beings as possible in order to deny God His prize. Yet God in His infinite love and wisdom still honors and respects their right to exist. This tells me that He honors all life in ways which we can't come close to comprehending. Yet you sit here with, as I said earlier, with the depth of understanding and foresight of a gnat, as you judge, demonize and condemn God even though your perspective is equal to an ant attempting to judge the motives of a contractor who is building a home over his ant hill. It is unfair to the point of self destructive foolishness for you to so harshly judge God as you are in this exchange since you have absolutely no real or true insights regarding what He knows and sees. \n \n So to summarize, even though there are aspects of Gods character and overall vision which is beyond us to fully appreciate, He has made His specific plan as it affects our relationship with Him known to us. That is what we should concentrate on as His children and not judging the larger picture which we are in no position to effectively judge from our current finite perspective. I guess that is what one would call the faith of the believers to know with confidence that no matter how it appears to our modern limited perspective, we know that our God is good and Holy so nothing He has ever done is evil or wrong according to His consistent values and character.",

   "What I still don't get is this:\n How did man end up with this fallen nature?\n\n \n I can't tell if your just playing dumb to frustrate me or if you are actually this clueless and uninformed regarding the basics of Mans fall from Grace. Are you unaware that God placed Adam and Eve in Paradise with one warning only? Not to eat of the fruit of knowledge of good and evil? God didn't want us to lose our innocence and know evil. To be as clear and specific as possible, although I can't believe you are unaware of this, that act of disobedience resulted in our fallen nature.\n \n \nWhich occured first? Man being created in God's image or 1/3 of the angels falling?\n\n \n Read Genesis, God said \"let us make Man in our image, in our image we will make him\" and Lucifer declared that with his position as Gods number 1 in heaven, he would never serve this creature of flesh and bone. A revolt took place in heaven and 1/3rd of the angels followed satan in rebellion. That was the start of the spiritual battle which exists to this day over the hearts and minds of humanity. Those who are not for God in this spiritual battle are most definitely against Him, and will be found to have been aligned with the spiritual enemies of good at the judgement.\n \n \nWere angels created to serve man?\n\n \n No, not originally. They existed and were created to serve God, and did just that, for only God knows how long, before humanity was created. But once we were created, Angels of Heaven have served our needs ever since but still only according to GODS WILL, not mans. \n \n Angels will never respond to your prayers if you pray to them directly. That is idolatry and blasphemy to pray to angels. But if one reaches out to the Lord in prayer, God will use angels to serve our needs in a seconds notice if that be Gods will. I know this because I have experienced it in my own life. \n \n \nAnd you still haven't stated what this divine plan is. From all you've said the only conclusion I can draw is that God's divine plan is to ultimately win and end the war. But I'm still not sure\n\n \n Yes I did. It was such a simple and unassuming answer though that you completely missed it evidently. Gods divine plan was to create creatures in His image with free will as only He possesses in time and space, who desire to love and fellowship with Him as much as He desires to love us and fellowship with us. That was Gods original plan, and it still is.\n \n But since our fallen nature is born into us through the Adamic seed/lineage, and we have a sin nature which God cannot fellowship with, He took the flesh of Man upon Himself, came and lived among us, was tempted as we are but overcame as an example that living a sinless and righteous life is possible, and then like the sacrificial lamb who was worthy of dying once, and for all the sins of Humanity, He gave His life willingly by way of the most brutal form of execution of the period. \n \n If you studied the OT animal sacrifices of Israel which gave temporary forgiveness of sins which is why the Jews had repeatable ceremonies for the forgiveness of sins, you would see that the Jewish Messiah is the final culmination of Gods plan to finally redeem Man and defeat death and the sin nature which had separated us from Him since Adams fall from Grace through disobedience. \n \n The gospel is so simple, it's impossible to miss it if one reads with an open heart, spirit and mind. This is Gods divine plan for Humanity in verse. It's also referred to as the Gospel of Salvation through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n \n for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,\n &#8212;Romans 3:23 \n \n For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n &#8212;Romans 6:23 \n \n because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. For the Scripture says, &#8220;Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.&#8221; For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him. For &#8220;everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.&#8221;\n &#8212;Romans 10:9-13 \n \n Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a \"new creation\". The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.\n &#8212;2 Corinthians 5:17 \n \n In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory.\n &#8212;Ephesians 1:13-14\n \n For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.\n &#8212;Ephesians 2:8-9 \n \n And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross.\n &#8212;Colossians 2:13-14 \n \n For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we might live with him.\n &#8212;1 Thessalonians 5:9-10 \n \n For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works.\n &#8212;Titus 2:11-14 ",

How did you come up with that timeline?\n \n God's divine plan: so his plan is to create humans with free will who will choose to worship him? Wait, didn't he already do that? How could that be the plan, the justification for all the questionable acts he commits? How does him drowning the vast majority of mankind help him to create humans who will freely worship him out of love? And if you want people to love you out of free will, why threaten them with eternal torture if they don't? Anyway, like you say, we can't know God's plans. It still seems like this is the case.\n\n Frankly, Paulie, that sounds terribly Calvinistic to me and I, as a former Lutheran, can never ever approve of such sentimental and untrue tripe.",

   "That isn't what I said or meant to say. I said that when God SAID let us make Man in our image, Lucifer revolted, refused to serve Man and took a percentage of Heavens angels with him in the process. Man hadn't been created at that moment yet. But satan had been cast out of heaven and was at that time dwelling on Earth. \n \n At some point after this God carried out His plan and created the Universe, the Earth as we know it and A&E, then came the fall and the rest is history, so to speak.\n \n\n What was the time lapse bewteen when God SAID let us make man in our own image and when man was actually made? Accoding to genesis it happened the same day, most likely within a matter of minutes, or however long it took to speak the words and then carefully mold the clay together. And in that space of time, while God was busy working on his earth masterpiece, he was also battling satan and his minions? And he had to do all of that, plus make eve, before sundown so he could kick back and rest on the sabbath? Sorry I'm having such a difficult time grasping the sequence of event but it still doesn't make much sense to me. \n \n \n \nYes He did that at the beginning. Then came the Fall, then came the spiritual battle which culminated in Christ Jesus coming and finally defeating death and sin by taking it all upon Himself. The choice belongs to each of us whether we will follow our Father or reject Him. \n \n At the judgement we will clearly see all of the times God reached out to us individually and prodded, not forced us to accept Him because that would deny us our free will. All He will do is lovingly prod and reach out to us. But we must respond to Him freely. This is the monster God you all constantly demonize and excoriate as if He's some mass murderer.\n\n So then his ultimate divine plan is to win the war and end it. Isn't that what I said in the first place? Or was it won when jesus died, which is what you seem to be saying here? Or is the divine plan to keep prodding the potential wheat into being separate from the chafe? Or is it to have all of mankind freely accept him as lord and savior? I know you're saying something here but somehow I feel like its still not what I asked. I'm not being snide or trying to attack you, but look back at your response, it still doesn't say what the divine plan actually is.",
