   "Why not say that science evolved from a milieu of faith, philosophy and epistemic crisis?\n\n \n 'Epistemic crisus' is a bit OTT, I think. The emergence of science is principally (I know not entirely) a post-Reformation phenomenon, and was contemporaneous with a return to sola scriptura and a more rigorously analytical approach to scriptural texts. I think it's no coincidence that after the pioneering efforts of Galileo and others, the development of what we would recognise as science during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries took place mainly in the Protestant north. (And before anyone points them out, of course there were exceptions, like Lavoisier.)\n \n \nWhy not say that science is culturally shaped and therefore necessarily fallable?\n\n \n Whom have you heard saying otherwise?\n \n \nOut the door with positivistic statements like, \"God does not exist,\" and \"The parts of an atom are irreducible,\" and \"Force always equals mass times accelaration.\"\n\n \n Science has nothing to say on the existence or non-existence of god.\n The parts of an atom were once proposed to be irreducible (you will know that is what the word means) but evidence - which it is the business of science to gather - has shown otherwise.\n The word 'always' rarely appears in formulations of scientific laws, but since force is defined as mass times acceleration this one is likely to stand.",

Calvin's stealing this idea from St. Basil, because \"the scientists permanently disprove themselves\".\n \n The problem about tying science to God is that many years ago many scientists believed the world was at the centre of the solar system. This seemed to have parallels with some of the OT. Religious people were keen to show that the Bible had already predicted this knowledge. Then that knowledge was given a shake up by Galileo et al.\n \n Another belief that was over-turned was \"Neptunism\" (the belief that the earth's layers were laid down by giagantic seas) - which seemed to support the idea of the Great Flood. Now everyone believes in \"Vulcanism\" that they layers were put down through stuff coming up from below.",
