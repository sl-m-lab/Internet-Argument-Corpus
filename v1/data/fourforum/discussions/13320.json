You've made this world such a better place.\n\n \n <Flush<\n \n From a prior post:\n \n Liberal Fundamentalism \n \n Someone once said to beware of zealots. Yet Jesus Christ was a zealot for the ways of God, and Mother Theresa was certainly a zealot for helping the sick and needy. Being a zealot, then, is not automatically a prescription for hated. Likewise, religious fundamentalism. One can certainly believe in the fundamental teachings of Jesus Christ and Biblical values, practice them, and not be a threat to society or one's neighbors. On the other hand, there's a new and particularly pernicious brand of fundamentalism making the rounds in America today - liberal fundamentalism. \n \n Liberal Fundamentalism is a failed and destructive philosophical enterprise, replete with a host of anti-Biblical, pseudo-religious doctrines that seeks to elevate the ways and \"wisdom\" of man above the wisdom and desires of God. Its principle aim is the sacking of traditional Judaic and Christian values and beliefs, which are revisited through suspect liberal \"scholarship\" or politically-correct dogma in an effort to replace them with the tenets of carnal moral hedonism and the failed social doctrines of today's liberal elitists. \n \n The genesis of today's liberal fundamentalists was the anti-traditionalist hedonists of the 1960's and 70's. They advocated fornication and \"free-love,\" illegal substance abuse, moral relativism, contempt for authority, and they enjoyed a prosperous America founded on the very hard work and enterprise they sought to distance themselves from. The freedoms they enjoyed were purchased by the blood, sweat and personal sacrifices of the very forefathers they held in contempt. \n \n Personal responsibility, self-restraint and self-sacrifice are often foreign concepts to them. \"Right and wrong,\" and \"good and evil\" were arbitrarily revisited, for such concepts had no objective meaning to them. They had no objective rationality for their hedonistic philosophy other than if it \"feels good, let's do it.\" The only righteous cause that qualified for support in their \"progressive\" mindset was the undermining and revising of traditional American and Judeo-Christian values. They said not to trust anyone \"over 30,\" and now they're over 30 and say, \"Trust us, and what we teach!\" Thank you, FOXNews.com - University of Colorado Board Votes to Fire Embattled Professor Ward Churchill - Local News | News Articles | National News | US News Ward Churchill. \n \n One of the most revered mantras of liberal fundamentalism is \"equality.\" The net effect of this experiment, in many instances, was to elevate women via the degradation of men, promote racial equality by instituting race-based preferences and reverse discrimination, engender class warfare against people of means via their socialistic redistribution of wealth schemes (a concept centered in greed for other people's money, rather than relying on one's own personal initiative and work ethic), and elevate wickedness (sodomy, fornication, pornography, and other ungodly issues) to the plateau of respectability at the expense of traditional Godly values. \n \n Along with the failed liberal concept of equality was the mantra of liberal \"tolerance.\" However, liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be. It is a contradictory, partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas. It assumes, for instance, a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge. This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality, abortion rights, and religious truth claims, leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs. But this posture is often dogmatic, intolerant, and coercive, for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues, and if one does not embrace it, one may likely face public ridicule, demagogic tactics, and perhaps even legal reprisals. Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant. \n \n Rather than truly embrace \"freedom,\" liberal fundamentalists seek to control virtually every aspect of the lives of the masses that are unfortunate enough to be under their fundamentalist rulership. They seek to outlaw SUV's, impose smoking bans while advocating marijuana use, prohibit freedom of religious expression in government and public schools, advocate compulsory training in politically correct opinions and attitudes, seek to enforce Bible bans in schools and the workplace, embrace a de-facto litmus test against pro-life judicial nominees, seek to criminalize pro-life demonstrations through the RICO racketeering statute, try to squelch legitimate religious speech via \"hate-speech\" laws (note Canada), and generally engage in a wide range of behaviors designed to subvert the U.S. Constitution and traditional American values. \n \n Ii is certainly arguable, then, that \"progressive\" liberal fundamentalism substantially undermines the basic effectiveness of the government and other societal elements of democracy. Despite the idealistic goals of liberalism, attempts to build a utopian liberal society in America have only led to heightened outbreaks of AIDS, VD, porno-related crime, social divisions, divorce, abortion, drug addictions, deficit spending, the welfare state, a crushing tax burden, the breakdown of the family unit, moral depravity, and numerous other such scourges which have resulted in enormous societal suffering and discontent. As a result, liberal fundamentalism is strongly associated with left-wing fanaticism, reverse-racism, anti-intellectualism, elitism, nihilism, godlessness, and societal violence.  - Author Unknown",

Funny but in the Constitution does it not say to protect the minority? and that ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL\n \n Lets be frank here Easy. You choose SELECTIVE rights to people. If anyone is radical it is you you charlatan. You take a religion that preaches love and treating your fellow man with equality and civility and turn it into a vindictive force filled with venom and self righteous indignation!\n \n ALL Gays want are EQUAL rights.

He, despite all the risks and the dangers is serving to protect everyone's rights and freedoms. EVEN YOURS.

That one of those \"heathens\" is a person who's heart is so pure and who's passion is so strong it brings tears to my eyes.\n \n He is twice no, three times the man you will ever be!

Moreso logic and rabbinical training. He's a bit like Mohammad in this story because both men saw the laws in their society, i.e. affecting women in marriage relative to the times they were living in, and therefore, needing to be changed. What worked once no longer did. It was a matter of women's rights. So Jesus gets a plus here, like Mohammad. With indicators that marriage and divorce laws could change again, with respect to what was respectful of women and their needs in society.\n\n \n ...we can all see that you think \"Jesus employed relativistic thinking.\" We see that you think it reflects \"rabbinical training.\" We can see that you think it had something to do with divorce \"affecting women in marriage relative to the times they were living in, and therefore, needing to be changed.\" That it was \"a matter of women's rights.\" But despite your protests, nowhere do you attempt to explain why it is you think these things -- i.e. give the sort of answer i've been trying to wring out of you.
