Don't expect post-ban prices to go down though, that's the current cost of parts. If anything, they'll go up due to lack of supply for a limited time.",

Several companies made enough extended magazines in anticipation of the ban that they're still available for a reasonable price ten years later. As a business person the only question is going to be if grandfather rights will again be available if new legislation is passed. I spoke with a gun dealer I know who said manufacturer distributors are already calling dealers trying to determine what post-ban demand might be for pre-ban configurations.
