   "Some interesting news about citibank today\"\n \n http://www.forbes.com/markets/economy/2008/03/05/citigroup-securities-capital-markets-equity-cx_md_0304markets25.html\n \n \nCitigroup, under pressure to raise capital, is making a big bet that it can raise money from yield-hungry investors. It is selling a $2.5 billion bond issue, most of which it is underwriting by itself. \n\n \n First of all, their CEO was out today ensuring investors that they were well capitalized and there was little or no risk. Now we find out that not only do they need to beg a few billion more, they cannot even get anybody else to underwrite the bond issue. This also means that they have run out of angel investors. No more pimping out to the arabs. \n \n \nWednesday, Citigroup (nyse: C - news - people ) said it would sell a 30-year issue, underwriting the lion's share -- $2.1 billion, or 84.0% -- itself. The relatively long-term issue has a relatively yummy yield: 6.875% of face value.\n\n \n And at loanshark rates. It is almost like they are planning to have them downgraded to junk.\n \n The rest of the article is just about previous desperate attempts that citi has made to shore up capital.\n \n There is an interesting link in all this to something we discussed here before.\n \n http://www.forbes.com/markets/currencies/2008/03/05/ambac-financial-closer-markets-bonds-cx_ra_0305markets37.html\n \n \nOn Wednesday, Ambac disappointed Wall Street, announcing it would raise $1.5 billion in the public securities markets to shore up its capital. But CreditSights analyst Rob Haines said it falls far short of the $2.5 billion the market had been expecting. \n\n \n If you will recall, a week or two ago we posted about an alleged bail out plan for Ambac. I argued that the plan was a load of stinky brown because it specifically cited Citibank as being a bank that would be putting up capital and I (and I think steeeve) pointed out that there was pretty much no way that Citbank was going to be caughing up a few billion to bail out ambac since they were basically bankrupt themselves. \n \n HEY...waddya know...the bankrupt bank is not going to bail out the bankrupt bond insurer.\n \n It WILL be interesting to see how Ambacs bond offering goes. Surely there are not enough people out there dumbe enouhg to buy that much bad debt??",

   "Nothing surprising obviously...How many CitiGroup articles have we come across that suggests these people are the next Enron? The only question remaining is why the stock is not selling for pennies. I had a friend of a friend invest in Bank of America the other week so perhaps it is just crazy people.\n \n As an aside, I've been looking at homes this week as I feel like its a good time to purchase while everything is dirt cheap and my dollar is still worth something. About a quarter of the stuff I was looking at was foreclosures...and that wasn't by choice but just what the realitor was showing. One property was sold and built for $266k and they foreclosed after 1yr and it is now being offered at just under 200k with an assessment of 234k. Another one was built for 550k and is now worth 70% less than that. \n \n In fact, the economist had an article on this. Seems value of these POS homes has gone down so much that people are better off just forecloseing instead of paying the mortgage. The loan officer said that they also were giving away loans to people with a 70-80% ratio of the income! Any company that dumb should go out of business and the person should loss their home. If you bail out XXXXXX they never learn and we end up with a false economy. Too late...",

Does Australia have deposit insurance similar to the FDIC in the US? Obviously I do not know your personal situation, but if I was you I would avoid any connection with citi right now. As I understand it they are offering high yields even on plain vanilla deposits in overseas markets in an attempt to shore up their capital base.",

I personally would go with the fixed right now, but that is pretty much because I think that in 6 years we will be in a world of economic hurt.

Then used trailers can be had for under 10-15K. @ $500/month that should bring in a decent return. Everything is moving West from the ocean anyway, so in a couple of years the land itself should be worth a pretty penny.",
