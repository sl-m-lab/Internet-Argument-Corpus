Scientists propose and test explanations for observed natural phenomena. How is that anti-biblical? Do you think that scientists should declare that some observations and tested conclusions must be wrong because they are in conflict with your literal reading of a book of mythology?\n \n Of course, satanists are on the same level as creationists. They believe in mythology and folklore as TRUTH.\n \nWe see on the net multiple examples of protests that ID should be recognised as a real science and how people who espouse ID sympathies get blackballed and the like.\n\n The \"poor me\" syndrome. If anyone could actually show why ID creationism should be regarded as science, then it would be. The fact is, creation science and ID creationism start from the conclusions and then reject any scientific finding that does not fit the theology. Present some evidence of a mythical designer and he/she/it wouldn't be mythology any more.\n \n As for the blackballing of creation scientists or ID creationists, it just isn't true. There is a plethora of examples of the publication of legitimate scientific papers by creation scientists and ID creationists. But all of those papers report science that is testable. None of them propose invisible beings as explanations for real events. The fact is that papers that propose creationism and ID creationism aren't science. They don't ever propose any new science and are easily debunked. For those reasons they are generally rejected for publication by legitimate scientific journals. Creation science and ID creationism have also been rejected as science by courts.\n \nIs this really happening?\n\n Nope. You're just paranoid. You think that just because you believe in your mythology, it must be true. Apparently, you haven't bothered to educate yourself about reality.",

   "Yet it is a conculsion derived without evidence. It is only based on what is seen in an instant, not what is seen through time.\n\n \n There is much evidence for evolution. The Lenski experiment shows natural selection pretty clearly. Deep homology, ERVs, and pseudogenes are very strong evidence of common descent. Calling the ToE a conclusion without evidence is laughable. \n \n The Lenski experiment was not an instant. It took thirty years and many thousands of generations for the bacteria to evolve to a citrate consuming state. Evolution with creatures of longer generations and lower reproduction take far longer to observe, but we can still study and document it. Transitional fossils and genetic indications, among other things, very strongly support the ToE.\n \n \nYou just proved my point that there is a preconcieved notion. It has been taught to you. (At least, I seriously doubt you have gone out and observed something evolving first-hand).\n \n\n \n Have you personally seen God himself creating something? No? That is a nonsensical objection. \n \n Evolution is taught as fact because it is a theory that unifies and explains pretty much all of the biological phenomena and evidence that we have today. When we get more evidence, it is either incorporated into the existing theory or the theory is tweaked to be more accurate. In 300 years schools will teach whatever theory is best supported with the information and evidence they have available. \n \n Good example: Physics. Newtonian mechanics were taught as fact until general and special relativity explained what they could not. IT did not mean that Newton was wrong or that schools had been teaching falsehoods, it simply means that more information required the theory to be tweaked. \n \n \nConstant mutation in every generation is not something observed. It still would not account for the extreme specificity of nylon.\n \n\n \n Bacteria DNA often mutates very very quickly, which helps natural selection select characteristics that will help the population survive. That's why bacteria rapidly become resistant to antibiotics, or evolve to eat nylon or citrate.\n \n Example:\n \"Did you know that your own bowels harbor something like a billion (1,000,000,000) E. coli at this very moment? So remember to wash your hands after going to the toilet, as I hope your mother taught you. Simple calculations imply that there are something like 10^20 = 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 E. coli alive on our planet at any moment. Even if they divide just once per day, and given a typical mutation rate of 10^-9 or 10^-10 per base-pair per generation, then pretty much every possible double mutation would occur every day or so. That's a lot of opportunity for evolution.\" Dr. Richard Lenski",

   "Science has been elevated as the sole authority to explain the workings of the world and to decide what should and should not be taken seriously. Science determines what should be believed, what is superstitious, and what is nonsense. In a sense, science has become the self-proclaimed judge of everything. From this vaunted position, science has imposed its will on everything, and spread its tentacles into politics, religion, education, culture, medicine, law, and practically every other field.\n \n Under the \"rule of science\", anything that is supernatural or metaphysical is often scoffed at or outright scorned. The scientific rulers have encouraged sceptics to belittle various phenomena, such as: UFO sightings, alien encounters, religious experiences, spirit communications, ghosts, astral beings, apparitions, inter-dimensional beings, reincarnation, past lives, continuation of consciousness, entity possessions, clairvoyance, clairaudience, prophecy, general psychic abilities, and anything else that does not fit neatly into scientific dogma.\n \n The elevation of science has been so effective that people are very fearful of its ridicule, scorn and rejection. Sceptics are confidently bolstered; they are proud that they alone can judge what is ridiculous and nonsense and what is true and acceptable. Sceptics are so self-assured in their positions as the judges of everything that they outwardly display an air of arrogance and contempt. Almost everything has to be subjected to the Scientific Inquisition, which is not so unlike the Spanish Inquisitions - knowledge and wisdom are their victims, too often suppressed and censored by the ignorant and the arrogant. In extreme cases, the sceptics proclaim that \"science is never wrong!\"\n \n Those who study science have not always been referred to as \"scientists\". Until the 1830s, the discipline was known as natural philosophy, and individuals who studied it called themselves \"natural philosophers\". The change in nomenclature allowed \"scientists\" to disassociate themselves from theoretical philosophers.\n \n Science presents its cases as if they were all based upon hard, empirical evidence. This is misleading. If every scientific theory were called a philosophical concept, everyone would be on guard as to its reliability and accuracy. Whilst scientists have gathered genuine data on some subjects, and conducted experiments to determine properties and \"laws\" of physics and other disciplines, they have also extrapolated, surmised, opined, and outright guessed in many other instances to develop various \"scientific\" theories about the composition of the universe and where humans stand in relation to everything in it.\n \n The theories are presented repeatedly, and with such ardent fervour, that everyone forgets they have little or no empirical basis. Even the inconsistent theories are presented as facts. For instance, modern cosmology, which began in the 1920s, postulates the theory that the universe is expanding. From this hypothesis, cosmologists have theorised that the universe began with a big bang, a convulsive explosion. An alternative view is the steady-state theory, which asserts that the universe has no origin, but is expanding based on the continual formation of new matter. The theories are contradictory. One takes the position of convulsive evolution, while the other emphasises gradual growth and development.\n \n Scientists of today will use the premises of these contradictory theories to mix and match their particular guesses at how the universe operates. For example, Darwinian evolutionary theory requires vast time-lines to be feasible. Therefore, the Darwinian view requires that the Earth be very old and to have gradually developed. On the other hand, another scientific theory about the extinction of the dinosaurs is that a catastrophic event wiped them out. This goes to show that the accepted scientific theories are not always based on consistent premises. It is often the case in science that the convenient theory becomes the accepted theory.\n \n History has shown how many huge mistakes natural philosophers have made. The flat-Earth theory was believed for millennia, as was the theory that the Earth was the centre of the universe and everything revolved around it. Copernicus disproved the likelihood that the Earth was the centre of the universe, instead offering the alternative view that it is a subservient satellite of the sun in our solar system. Even today, most people are unaware that what Copernicus presented is a theory. As more and more evidence emerges, it becomes more and more likely that Copernicus was correct. With regard to the two main theories of the origin of the universe, they are rudimentary hypotheses that should not even be elevated to the level of theories. Yet, the big bang is presented as though it is an absolute fact; Darwin\\'s theory of evolution is dealt with in the same manner.\n \n Many people want to accept the scientific explanation of the universe because they disbelieve the religious philosophy and dogma regarding Creation. A typical religious creation account is found in the Torah, which is part of the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. That account of creation was subjected to tremendous rigour by religious scholars and natural philosophers. It was accepted by many who went through this rigorous study that the Earth was approximately 6,000 years old. The rigour employed was referred to by many as one of the most rigorous endeavours of the pre-Renaissance era. Proponents of the 6,000 year-old Earth included Elijah, Augustine of Hippo, Bede, Thomas Aquinas and Martin Luther, among others. Even the esteemed natural philosopher, Isaac Newton, concluded that the religious scholars were essentially correct; the Earth is about 6,000 years old.\n \n Much of the 6,000 year-old Earth belief can be blamed on the King James Version of the Bible, which included annotations in the margins to put all the dates together for people to apply rigour in testing biblical dates for creation. Some extreme religious philosophers, who echoed the marginal annotations in the King James Version of the Bible, claimed that Creation occurred on Sunday at noon, on the 23rd of October, 4004 B.C.\n \n Science prides itself on employing rigour, which means that science has tested many of its theories over and over. The problem is that the rigour can be based on flawed premises, be flawed methodologically, or both. There was immense rigour applied to the geocentric model of the Earth, and it was fully accepted by religious and natural philosophers until Copernicus refuted it. Now, the same type of rigour is applied to the theory that the sun is the centre of the solar system. If, in the future, someone were to unequivocally refute the Copernican theory, all of the rigour in proving it would have to be abandoned. Such is the state of scientific discoveries that people would accept the new theory and laugh at the old.\n \n Science has presented us with the theory that carbon emissions are significant contributors to global warming. It has presented us with many scientific evaluations of the data to prove this position, and the scientific consensus is that carbon emissions must be reduced to check global warming. The raw data on which scientists have based this conclusion is not readily available; it is secreted in the United Kingdom. Some scientists have been proven to have intentionally corrupted the data base, and others have been shown to have intentionally manipulated the data to support the carbon emissions theory. Instead of scientists being aghast at the fraud, many have rallied around the theory, and asserted that the science behind the theory is good and credible because such immense rigour has been applied to the theory that it must be correct. Therefore, they argue, there is scientific proof that carbon emissions are significantly responsible for global warming and that it is critical to put a price on carbon and to pass an ETS. The geocentric model and the Creation account had equal rigour applied to them. For now, both theories are hopelessly wrong.\n \n A Scot named James Hutton devised a theory that everything on Earth is very old, and that the planet has been gradually shaped by erosion and occasionally rearranged by convulsive events. His analysis has provided the basis for dating everything on the Earth, including the planet itself. People now confidently parrot that the Earth is four billion years old, that certain dinosaurs walked the planet so many million years ago, and humans evolved into homo-sapiens so many tens of thousands of years ago, and so on. The believers claim that these dates are based upon scientific postulates, and that the results have been subjected to rigour, therefore they are correct.\n \n The hypothesis of plate tectonics describing the formation of continents has been subjected to such scientific rigour that the theory of continental drift is readily accepted and parroted by many. The hypothesis of a molten-core Earth is equally accepted, whilst the sceptical \"judges\" have scoffed at the theory of the hollow Earth.\n \n Doctors and psychiatrists who believe in metaphysical concepts and experiences should not be threatened by their respective licensing boards. Neither should lawyers or politicians be disadvantaged by acknowledging alien encounters. Psychics and those sensitive to metaphysical things should not be deemed mentally disturbed just because they can sense or \"see\" things that others do not.\n \n Although science has improved many aspects of living by providing technology in many fields, its unsubstantiated theories should be treated much like religious beliefs. There is no absolute proof or disproof of them, or they would be facts, not theories. People should not be subjected to ridicule for their beliefs just because their beliefs do not fit scientifically prescribed scrutiny.",

Its a statement, and a I stand by it. Objectivism displays numerous features of cults, right down to the excommunication of heretics, as perpetrated by Rand herself.\n \n \n[Matthew:] I am perfectly willing to acknowledge that all these \"failures of vision\" may be my fault alone. But truthfully, I really don't think so. I don't think you're being clear, even though I know that you think so, and I know you're trying hard to be as clear as possible for me.\n\n \n ...You are willing to acknowledge that not understanding my arguments may be a 'failure of vision' and may be your fault.\n\n \n Yup, it may be. But-- to repeat -- \"truthfully, I really don't think so.\"\n \n See, I think that I won our debate, long ago, which is why I didn't feel any need to keep beating a dead horse. It all boiled down to semantics, as I saw it: evolution can \"produce\" (to use an incredibly vague term) the features of a species, via the combined action of mutation and natural selection. I continue to think that the case you're making boils down to semantics: are we (or the public) confusing \"evolution\" and \"mutation?\" are we talking about individuals first gaining new features, or about later generations of an entire population gaining new features relative to earlier generations? Etc, etc. As I saw it, it's not that your argument gets defeated: it's that the entire problem you're arguing about just dissolves once subjected to scrutiny.\n \n And...\n \n \nI will continue to claim that my arguments on IC have never been defeated for there is no reason to think otherwise.\n\n \n ...you are of course entitled to disagree. But that doesn't mean I have to say that your disagreement is well-founded.\n \n \nAfter writing what you have written could you expect anyone to honestly believe that given the chance your little collective would not throw me off a college campus?\n\n \n Who would throw you off a college campus, and why?\n \n Objectivism is a philosophy, albeit not a well-informed one. It's failings are a topic for another thread, but I assure you, those mistakes are a more than sufficient reason to explain why there are almost no representatives of Objectivism in philosophy departments. (For a single example of the sorts of gross errors I'm talking about, look at Leonard Peikoff's essay on \"The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy.\" Then look at W.V.O. Quine's essay \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\" on the same about two decades earlier, and examine the history of that essay's influence. Then ask yourself, could anyone familiar with even just the recent history of the field, make the kinds of claims that Peikoff makes? The answer is clear: no. But I digress.)\n \n Similarly, Intelligent Design is a biological view, but not one that the overwhelming majority of biologists believe is supported by empirical evidence or sound argument. And that is why it gains no traction in biology departments.\n \n Do such exclusions represent some form of conspiracy? of mob rule or collective thinking? Unless one wants an anything-goes, completely relativistic approach, I daresay not.\n \n So you might not get into a philosophy or biology department. But if you wanted to hold these views, and they had no bearing on whatever your chosen field happens to be -- not philosophy or biology, I'm quite willing to guess -- why would that be a problem?",

   "i will relate the two, as Behe and other ID proponents have done - a complex biological system cannot be produced via random mutation/natural selection - it had to have been formed all at once. the key is that these systems cannot have been produced by random mutation - that is how evolution works. if random mutation didnt give rise to advancements, a designer must have created it with the function in mind.\n \n this is mirrored by your very arguments. something cannot be selected for until the system is fully functioning. how did the system get fully functioning? a massive jump in the genome? absolutely not. and besides, that would still be random mutation - one big random mutation, no less. instead, it must have been designed.\n \n at the Dover trail, Behe was asked if he could produce evidence of the designer, or a signature of the designer. you know what he produced? you guessed it! IC.\n \n youre still saying that IC has nothing to do with ID!? check out the ID website for the discovery institute. look who's book is featured second:\n CSC - Center for Science and Culture - Books\n \n WOW look at that! its Behe's \"Darwin's Black Box\" where he first coined the term \"irreducibly complex\". check out the review for the book on that site:\n \n \n...Behe sees the complex interaction of parts in irreducibly complex machines as indicative of the type of structure which could only be produced by the foresight and goal-directed planning of an intelligent mind. Behe's theory has accounted for the origin of these structures, but evolutionists are still conspicuously without detailed and credible accounts of the \"numerous, successive, slight modifications\" that could have produced the biochemical machines highlighted in Darwin's Black Box.\n\n \n wow! arent we learning so much? connection between IC and ID are outlined right there for you by the founder of the IC movement, and ID thinktank Disco-Insti senior fellow Michael Behe!! IC never had an association with ID? what a joke.\n \n who's the first on the list of discovery institute's senior fellow list?CSC - Center for Science and Culture why it's our old friend Michael J Behe! he undeniably has a very clear connection with intelligent design, and being the founder of IC, IC now clearly has a connection with intelligent design.\n \n how about something straight from Behe's mouth... from his Lehigh faculty page:\n Lehigh University Department of Biological Sciences\n \nIrreducibly complex systems appear to me to be very difficult to explain within a traditional gradualistic Darwinian framework, because the function of the system only appears when the system is essentially complete. (An illustration of the concept of irreducible complexity is the mousetrap pictured on this page, which needs all its parts to work.) Despite much general progress by science in the past half century in understanding how complex biochemical systems work, little progress has been made in explaining how such systems arise in a Darwinian fashion. I have proposed that a better explanation is that such systems were deliberately designed by an intelligent agent. (Behe 1996b, 2001)\n\n \n are you still able to honestly say that IC has never had a connection to ID? if so, then show me.",

You cannot use a single negative premise to conclude anything was designed, it is the implied premise that I object to and that you will state if you meet this challenge.\n \n I say if a system cannot be produced by random mutation and natural selection it cannot be produced by random mutation and natural selection; nothing more for I have no arguments for anything more.\n \n \nthis is mirrored by your very arguments. something cannot be selected for until the system is fully functioning. how did the system get fully functioning?\n\n I don't know, but since we all accept that unexplained phenomenon are miracles from God I suppose I must just be biased against religion :p\n \n \nat the Dover trail, Behe was asked if he could produce evidence of the designer, or a signature of the designer. you know what he produced? you guessed it! IC.\n\n Did not the judge of this trial conclude that there is no dichotomy.\n \n \nyoure still saying that IC has nothing to do with ID!?\n \n check out the ID website for the discovery institute. look who's book is featured second:\n CSC - Center for Science and Culture - Books\n \n\n Yes, IC has no logical connection to ID.\n \n Religion has no logical connection to science, shall I assault you with links to people who believe science is a religion or that religion helps science?\n \n \n \nWOW look at that! its Behe's \"Darwin's Black Box\" where he first coined the term \"irreducibly complex\". check out the review for the book on that site:\n \n wow! arent we learning so much? connection between IC and ID are outlined right there for you by the founder of the IC movement, and ID thinktank Disco-Insti senior fellow Michael Behe!! IC never had an association with ID? what a joke.\n\n You keep changing words, association has a different meaning than logical connection.\n \n I was never talking about what people thought IC could do for them, I was always talking about what IC was and could do.\n \n \nare you still able to honestly say that IC has never had a connection to ID? if so, then show me.\n\n It has never had a logical connection to ID. Shall I be on the lookout for negative evidence to prove a lack of connection?",

Plants/animals directly created by God. Macroevolution does not occur. Earth less than 10,000 years old. Reshaped by global flood. Universe Less than 10,000 years old.\n Belongs to the category 'God created life and this creation is it's explaination'.\n \n Gap creationism \n Humans Directly created by God. Plants/animals Directly created by God. Macroevolution does not occur. Earth scientifically accepted age. Reshaped by global flood. Universe scientifically accepted age.\n Belongs to the category 'God created life and this creation is it's explaination'.\n \n Progressive creationism \n Humans directly created by God (based on primate anatomy). Plans/animals direct creation + evolution. No single common ancestor. Earth scientifically accepted age. No global flood. Universe scientifically accepted age.\n Belongs to the category 'God created life and this creation is it's explaination'.\n \n Intelligent Design \n Proponents hold various beliefs. e.g. Behe accepts evolution from primates Divine intervention at some point in the past, as evidenced by what intelligent-design creationists call \"irreducible complexity\" Some adherents claim the existence of Earth is the result of divine intervention - Scientifically accepted age\n Belongs to the category 'God created life and this creation is it's explaination' albeit indirectly.\n \n Theistic evolution \n Humans evolved from primates. Evolution from single common ancestor. Earth scientifically accepted age. No global flood. Universe scientifically accepted age.\n Belongs to the category 'God created life and this creation is it's explaination' (the theistic part being that god designed the universe such that evolution of us had to happen).\n \n Given that every definition of creationism falls into that category I declare the key tenet of creationism is the belief that life is explained by God creating it.\n \n \n Since creationism can be said to be the belief that life is explained by god creating it, it as a whole falls under the category of 'explanations for life'.\n \n Since databed claims in this paragraph that 'Freedom has been very careful not to assert any explanation for life and its complexity', that universal must include the explaination of 'god created it'.\n \n Therefore this states at least \"Freedom has been very careful not to assert that life is explained by God creating it\".\n \n Since that belief is necessary and sufficient condition to be defined as a creationist the statement \"Freedom has never asserted (supported in the sense of argument) creationism\" can be deduced.\n \n The 'leap' from \"Obviously Freedom is some form of a creationist, but he will not admit this.\" to \"He is obviously a creationist\" is one of simple rearranging.\n\n \n In its broadest sense Creationist simply means believing that a deity created the universe. Within that there is obviously a range of beliefs.\n Theistic Evolution supporters have no conflict with scientific findings.\n Young Earthers reject science completely.\n Gap and Progressive Creationists find some sort of compromise position depending on their own emotions.\n IDers purposely set out to undermine scientific progress via legalistic means.\n They were defeated (or defeated themselves) and have fallen from their previously high profile, though some residual effects remain such as IC.",

   "You are moving the goal posts, that one cannot support ID with IC i.e. they have no logical connection is all I have claimed.\n\n \n Good Grief you can't be serious. Bennedict has pretty much raped and destroyed any argument you have presented and yet you still insist that you are right... That is laughable to say the least.. \n \n With one stroke of the keyboard I found this...\n Irreducible complexity - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \nIrreducible complexity (IC) is a pseudoscientific argument by proponents of intelligent design that certain biological systems are too complex to have evolved from simpler, or \"less complete\" predecessors, through natural selection acting upon a series of advantageous naturally-occurring, chance mutations.The argument is central to intelligent design, and is rejected by the scientific community, which overwhelmingly regards intelligent design as pseudoscience.[3] Irreducible complexity is one of two main arguments intended to support intelligent design, the other being specified complexity.\n Biochemistry professor Michael Behe, the originator of the term irreducible complexity, defines an irreducibly complex system as one composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning\". These examples are said to demonstrate that modern biological forms could not have evolved naturally. Evolutionary biologists have shown that such systems can in fact evolve, and Behe's examples are considered to constitute an argument from ignorance.\n In the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial, Behe gave testimony on the subject of irreducible complexity. The court found that \"Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large.Nonetheless, irreducible complexity continues to be cited as an important argument by creationists, particularly intelligent design proponents.\n\n \n Now I have admitted I am by no means a scientist, But even me, with my scientifically uneducated brain can deduce from this statement the original intention of the creation of the IC theory. You refuse to admit that you are a creationist, that's your right. However, when you claim to support The theory of IC, which is in FACT the engine that drives the theory of ID Which falls under the Creationism Umbrella then I have to wonder as I'm sure others to at the extent of your sanity.\n \n Back on Topic...\n Theistic evolution,Intelligent Design,Progressive creationism,Gap creationism,\n Young Earth creationism all fall under the umbrella of Creationism. If one supports either one of these categories their base belief is that we were CREATED by a supernatural intelligent life form. These people are what we Humans know as \"Creationists\" \n Science and more specifically the Theory Of Evolution refutes the Idea that we were created by a supernatural imaginary deity in the sky in any way, shape , or form.\n \n So.. Creationists cannot Prove a single one of their Theories through the use of SCIENCE. In order to do so you would have to be able to build a Model and test your theories to either prove or dispute said theory. Science can, has, and still does support the Theory of Evolution through many such models. Now before you go telling me to post some of those Models as proof I'll tell you now, I am not a scientist so if you want proof you'll have to just take my word for it, or Google something. \n \n as to the topic of this post, If there is any Conspiracy between Creationists and Evolutionists it is coming from the side of Creation. I would think that in most cases anyone who believes in the Creation Myth would most likely be of a religious Nature, more Specifically a Christian. Their own Bible is unsure on the Matter of Creation as you can find in the First and Second Book of Genesis. The only \" Evidence \" that a Creationist has to \" Prove\" Creation is the Holy Book that Christians Cherish above all. Since Darwin and his Theory the Christian Religion has launched a conspiracy to Dis-prove or de-bunk Darwin's Theory. They are so adamant in their believe they go to great lengths to try and prove evolution is not real, Like breaking up their Creationist views into specific categories like the ones above, so as to confuse the general population as to who believes what. \n \n Your Posts in this thread , Whether you admit it or not, Categorize you as a \" Creationist. You can sit on the fence all you want and use IC or ID or whatever to \"Claim\" you are not but just like every other post you have made you are wrong.\n \n So in closing I will say Yes, there is a Conspiracy. A conspiracy by Creationists such as yourself to devalue the Theory of Evolution in hope of saving your imaginary God from becoming Extinct.",

However, when you claim to support The theory of gravitation which is in FACT the engine that drives the theory of X Which falls under the B Umbrella then I have to wonder as I'm sure others to at the extent of your sanity.\"\n \n The physicist does not doubt his sanity, he returns to his work and rarely thinks of X, B, or the man who said he must believe them.

In science there is even a whimsical term for a machine or structure or process that does something, but the actual mechanism by which it accomplishes its task is unknown: it is called a 'black box.' In Darwin's time all of biology was a black box: not only the cell, or the eye, or digestion, or immunity, but every biological structure and function because, ultimately, no one could explain how biological processes occurred.\n\n \nIn concluding, it is important to realize that we are not inferring design from what we do not know, but from what we do know. We are not inferring design to account for a black box, but to account for an open box. A man from a primitive culture who sees an automobile might guess that it was powered by the wind or by an antelope hidden under the car, but when he opens up the hood and sees the engine he immediately realizes that it was designed. In the same way biochemistry has opened up the cell to examine what makes it run and we see that it, too, was designed.\n\n Michael J. Behe - ARN Authors Page",

   "You failed to support ID. Do you want to try again?\n\n \n so Behe fails as well? Dembski fails too? how about Johnson, he fails also?\n \n i would agree, they are failures, but their arguments are very similar to the one i posted.\n \n \nIrreducibly complex systems appear to me to be very difficult to explain within a traditional gradualistic Darwinian framework, because the function of the system only appears when the system is essentially complete. (An illustration of the concept of irreducible complexity is the mousetrap pictured on this page, which needs all its parts to work.) Despite much general progress by science in the past half century in understanding how complex biochemical systems work, little progress has been made in explaining how such systems arise in a Darwinian fashion. I have proposed that a better explanation is that such systems were deliberately designed by an intelligent agent. -Behe\n\n \n \nDarwinism, committed as it is to a gradual evolutionary process that incrementally builds complexity and function, now faces a dilemma. Darwinian evolution cannot produce an irreducibly complex system exhibiting a given basic function by having natural selection act on and improve simpler precursors that already display that function. The problem is that the function doesn&#8217;t exist, and therefore is not selectable by natural selection, until the irreducibly complex system is in place already. It follows that Darwinian evolution can produce an irreducibly complex system that serves a given basic function only by taking already existing systems that serve different functions and redeploying them to form the irreducibly complex system. But, as we shall see later in this essay, there is no evidence that the redeployments required to form such irreducibly complex systems could happen, much less be properly coordinated, by a gradual Darwinian evolutionary process. Instead, the evidence suggests that any such redeployment would require such massive coordination of the redeployed systems as to place the resulting irreducibly complex system beyond the reach of Darwinian evolution. Of course, such massive coordination bespeaks design. -Dembski\n\n \n \nBehe explains that biochemists are now able to explore part of the insides of that black box, and what they find inside is \"irreducible complexity.\" A system is irreducibly complex if it is \"composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning.\" Life at the molecular level is replete with such systems, and biochemists do not even attempt to explain how any one of them could have come into existence by the Darwinian mechanism.

Which are claimed to be answers to the question \"Can one support IC with ID\"?\n \n Note the question is a yes or no question, therefore I will be searching the following threads (again) for that boolean value.\n \n I will also note threads in which a pseudo answer is given.\n \n Pseudo answer A = \"Some people believe that ID can be supported with IC\"\n where some people can be anyone besides the person to whom the question is addressed\n \n Pseudo answer B = \"Well do you think you can?\"\n \n Pseudo answer C = \"So you are willing to say that those who think ID can be supported with IC are wrong?\"\n \n Note C implies B so I will only state C where this is the case.\n \n \ni will relate the two, as behe and other id proponents have done - a complex biological system cannot be produced via random mutation/natural selection - it had to have been formed all at once. The key is that these systems cannot have been produced by random mutation - that is how evolution works. If random mutation didnt give rise to advancements, a designer must have created it with the function in mind.\n \n This is mirrored by your very arguments. Something cannot be selected for until the system is fully functioning. How did the system get fully functioning? A massive jump in the genome? Absolutely not. And besides, that would still be random mutation - one big random mutation, no less. Instead, it must have been designed.\n \n At the dover trail, behe was asked if he could produce evidence of the designer, or a signature of the designer. You know what he produced? You guessed it! Ic.\n \n Youre still saying that ic has nothing to do with id!? Check out the id website for the discovery institute. Look who's book is featured second:\n csc - center for science and culture - books\n \n wow look at that! Its behe's \"darwin's black box\" where he first coined the term \"irreducibly complex\". Check out the review for the book on that site:\n \n \n \n Wow! Arent we learning so much? Connection between ic and id are outlined right there for you by the founder of the ic movement, and id thinktank disco-insti senior fellow michael behe!! Ic never had an association with id? What a joke.\n \n Who's the first on the list of discovery institute's senior fellow list?csc - center for science and culture why it's our old friend michael j behe! He undeniably has a very clear connection with intelligent design, and being the founder of ic, ic now clearly has a connection with intelligent design.\n \n How about something straight from behe's mouth... From his lehigh faculty page:\n lehigh university department of biological sciences\n \n \n are you still able to honestly say that ic has never had a connection to id? If so, then show me.\n\n A\n \n \nridiculous.\n \n If ic cannot support id, id has absolutely nothing going for it, right? Including their supporters of ic, since all of them with the exception of you use it to support id. Behe is wrong, dembski is wrong, johnson is wrong, every id supporter is wrong for using ic, because freedom the great thinks it's wrong.\n \n Daewoo:\n \n Ic is irreducible complexity, the idea that complex biological systems like the eye or bacterial flagellum could not have evolved through a gradual process, but had to have been formed all at once, by a designer with a function in mind.\n \n Id is intelligent design, creationism with new pseudo-scientific skin, a political ploy for creationism to gain scientific respect. It failed. Michael behe is an advocate of id who came up with ic.\n\n A , C\n \n \nive already answered that question. Post #101. Behe reiterates. Stop asking me.\n \"if ic cannot support id, id has absolutely nothing going for it, right? Including their supporters of ic, since all of them with the exception of you use it to support id. Behe is wrong, dembski is wrong, johnson is wrong, every id supporter is wrong for using ic, because freedom the great thinks it's wrong.\"\n\n A, C\n \n \ncan ic be used to support id? Yes, its the id proponent's main argument.\n \n Are you suggesting wikipedia is biased?\n\n \n \nif i were an id advocate with ic as my tool, i would say that since a novel system came all at once without random mutation, only the work of a designer with function and purpose in mind would have given rise to such a system, since one big leap in the genome is irrational. Behe along with all other id supporters use a very similar argument.\n \n However, this is still a false dichotomy (;)) as was said in that video.\n\n A\n \n \nwell since wiki is wrong i thought i would do a little browsing myself, i was curious as well. Well of the 20 or so sites and web pages i visited i found not 1 to support your position concerning ic. I did find tons of stuff like this though...\n \n irreducible complexity demystified\n \n behe's argument that ic cannot evolve is central to id, so it deserves our attention. His method is to divide evolution into what he calls 'direct', which he defines in a special way, and 'indirect' (everything else). He finds that direct evolution of ic is logically impossible, and indirect evolution of ic is too improbable. The argument against 'direct' evolution of ic is contained in this long sentence right after the definition: \n \n Lmao.. Give up dude, you have lost this round .\n\n A, plus I was asking you.\n \n \nso behe fails as well? Dembski fails too? How about johnson, he fails also?\n \n I would agree, they are failures, but their arguments are very similar to the one i posted.\n \n Furthermore, you said wikipedia is biased about the definition of ic, and you would rather see an unbiased definition.

I find it pretty far fetched to think he really did; Than I saw this:\n \n People, the question is whether ID follows the scientific method. Primarily because of Dawn's inability to address the topic of his own thread I made a very pointed request that an example of ID following the scientific method be presented so that it can be discussed. In Message 248 I requested responses to this list of requested information composed by Bluejay:\n \n \n An example of a researcher making observations of the natural world.\n \n An example of a researcher formulating an ID hypothesis based on those observations.\n \n An example of a researcher experimenting to test that ID hypothesis.\n \n An example of a researcher forming an ID theory based on the results of the experiment.\n No responses to this have been posted yet. Anything else from those taking the affirmative that ID follows the scientific method is off-topic. In my judgement, discussion of the topic has not really begun yet, and I don't think it can begin until there's a concrete example of ID research to discuss. To this point this thread is just a series of \"Does to's\" and \"Does not's\".\n \n If I could (and did) suspend anyone who I thought was failing to address my arguments, the number of posts made in pretty much all the threads I have posted in would be cut by 80%.\n \n Now all of you who have just finished assuring each other that I am an ignorant nincompop with no idea what I'm talking about and am in fact so deluded I don't even know what I believe myself, how would you feel about that?\n \n I doubt you would stay on any such forum for very long.\n \n Furthermore objective admins are a rare sight period, exercising this kind of power makes it just pointless to argue if you are arguing against a position they hold.\n \n Forum's can't operate that way, (besides jokes whose only point is to assure people that others hold the same opinion as them); this thread is a perfect example of what I mean when I say that. There are only three classes of entities reading these things.\n \n Debators, Trolls, Observers\n \n Debaters will ignore or call people on the illogical.\n \n Trolls don't care.\n \n Observers will make their decisions as debaters do.\n \n So this thread for instance contains about 40 posts generally in opposition to my statements on the relationship between IC and ID. None of them make a single valid point against my position, but what good would cutting all that out do?\n \n It would just madden the posters, I already ignore it, observers will make their own decisions and if they are confused by irrelevant language than they cannot be trusted to understand even if the thread was strictly on subject with concise debate.\n \n The only need for admins is to judge, not to silence those who are wrong but to get their best objective opinion even then in a known formal debate area where posts are expected to be removed.",

You would too if you would think about it with an open mind.\n\n \n The First Quote is YOU telling me that you do not believe that Evolution is Useful.

I get it now. You are one of those Creationists who is ashamed of being a Creationist. You use terms like Irreducible Complexity and Intelligent Design to Mask the fact that you are a creationist. You call these things SCIENCE, when in fact they have nothing to do with REAL science they are bogus theories implemented by desperate CREATIONISTS to attempt to add credibility to the entire Premise of Creation.

   "It is not.\n\n \n In the 1920's Here in the United States we had Some Christian Fundamentalist Movements that insisted on a literalist interpretation of the \"Genesis Creation Narrative\" and likewise opposed the Idea of Human Evolution. These groups succeeded in getting the teaching of Evolution banned in the United States public Schools. In the Mid 1960's a group calling themselves\" Young Earth Creationists\" began promoting the teaching of what they called\" Scientific Creationism\" using Flood Geology in public school science classes to support a purely literal reading of the Genesis account. \n \n Now here is where it gets Dicey..\n \n In the Case of Daniel vs. Waters (1975) the Judge ruled that teaching creationism in public schools contravened the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and the content of public schools teachings was subsequently stripped of overt biblical references and renamed \" Creation Science\".. \n Then\n in the case of Edwards vs. Aguillard (1987) the court ruled that creation science similarly contravened the Constitution and all references to \" Creation\" in school textbooks were changed to refer to \" Intelligent Design. These Creationists then took the term\" Intelligent Design\" and once again re-named themselves. They began claiming Intelligent Design to be a \" New\" Scientific Theory and began again an attempt to introduce \" Creation\" into our schools by masking it under Intelligent Design.\n another case.. The case of Kitzmiller vs. Dover ( 2005) the Court Ruled that Intelligent Design is NOT science, and contravenes the constitutional restriction on teaching religion in Public School Classes. \n \n I believe by now you get the Idea... \n \n Now to the reply to your post...\n \n I originally called you a creationist, which you seem to take offense to.\n \n You have stated that you do not support Evolution.. Yet you are not a Creationist... \n \n You have asked me to rescind my statement where I called you a Creationist.\n \n I have replied that I Will Not.. \n \n You can continue to change the term or whatever you wish, but a black kettle is black, a blue sky is blue , and a Creationist no matter what you want to call it is a Creationist. Currently the debate in this specific Topic is Creationism vs. Evolution. If you do not support one then by default you support the other. Call yourself God, it doesn't matter because at the end of the day if your position is that along the line somewhere there is a Creator involved then you are a Creationist.\n \n I simply stated that YOU should not be ashamed to call yourself a Creationists. There is no hidden meaning in my statement. There is no Sarcasm, or Ill feelings meant by my statement. Be who you are.\n \n And why worry over me calling you a Creationist?.. I'm just one Person among many who formed my opinion based on the evidence presented in this thread. You have not given anyone reason to believe you are not a Creationist?.. \n \n I hope that is clear enough now.\n \n Most of this information was found at Wiki.. the definition was from the Dictionary I have...",

A fully qualified yet concise definition of science would be similar to: the active or passive production of facts about the natural world through reason.\n \n Faith is the standard by which all religion exists and by which an idea can be accepted on the 'virtue' that it lacks objective proof. I have had ample exposure to various religions and the best answer (best being totally relative to the other absurd ones) to 'why doesn't god reveal himself' is 'if he did then everyone would believe in him and without faith they wouldn't be tempted to lose it'.\n \n There is a basic epistemological dichotomy between faith and reason because reason makes no room for other modes of knowledge. If it is not a rational conclusion it is a irrational conclusion.\n \n Therefore any means of gaining knowledge is to use a common phrase 'either for reason or against it', and one need hardly ask if faith is rational when the very fact that it need not be rational is always the first and key bulwark of defense in mystical apologetics.\n \n Reason doesn't just exclude faith, imagination, emotional need translated to self delusion; anything that is not explicitly rational is doomed to be irrational.\n \n If and only if something can be supported by sound or cogent argument can it be rational, therefore all that is supported by sound or cogent argument is rational AND anything that is not is irrational.\n \n Faith is not rational.\n \n Anyone who takes some things on faith but requires evidence for others is in a state of philosophical contradiction.

It is not a coincidence that this has been the only case where men work together peacefully, they must agree with each other on morality or there will be war and morality requires reason.",

   "i agree. religion and science cannot live harmoniously. religion requires faith and nothing more, science requires extensive evidence. the two are opposites. a person of faith has a hard time with science because in order to understand science, they need to be skeptical about everything that does not have evidence, and even skeptical about things that DO have evidence... and thats hard when your own spiritual lifestyle requires that you ignore all evidence and believe just because you can - or you should.\n \n some people have been able to do it, but it is rare. thats why the majority of science students or scientists are atheists. if someone believes that evidence is not required to believe something, they must not be scientifically literate, unfortunately. if someone believes that evidence IS required, they must not take a very strong religious path.\n \n in my opinion, the two should remain separate. in the world according to Bennedict, religion would not exist because people would turn to science above all other things. in real world, the religious will remain religious, and the scientific will remain intelligent... i mean scientific.",

   "As others have noted, scientific thought is based on verifiable evidence. Religious thought has its base in faith - i.e. belief not necessarily based on evidence but on a type of trust. However, I disagree that the two are mutually exclusive. \n \n The only type of religious faith that fatally clashes with Science is the type that automatically excludes scientific evidence if it contradicts dogma. Though many religions along with their followers are absolute in their dogma, I would say that the majority are not. Though it is rare for a religion to be completely flexible in adapting to new scientific discoveries, I would say that most have enough flexibility that, once scientific discoveries are certain enough and pass some test of time, they adapt a fair amount of their doctrine to match.\n \n Take some examples:[*]Lightning, earthquakes, and other so called \"acts of God\" were actually thought once to be purely acts of God. The great majority of people and religions now accept scientific explanations.[*]The earth was once thought to be at the physical center of the universe. Now, nearly everyone accepts that it is not.[*]Pope John Paul II had written a papal communication that accepted that the human body might have been influenced by evolution, though he claimed divine sources for the soul - \"If the human body take its origin from pre-existent living matter, the spiritual soul is immediately created by God \" from CATHOLIC LIBRARY: Truth Cannot Contradict Truth (1996) .\n So, though religious institutions are very slow to respond to scientific evidence, most do make an effort. The rise of the evangelical religions and other fundamentalist religions trouble me since they seem far more dogmatic than do even long established religions such as the Roman Catholic church. I am hopeful that this is just a phase that portions of the population are going through. Time will tell...\n \n On another point, even when the religious establishment holds a particular dogma, that does not mean that all of their followers agree with all of the religion's dogma. A majority of Catholics, for example, use contraception despite the Church's condemnation of it. Increasingly, people pick and choose what to believe in their religion. There is a comfort and confidence of purpose that many people gain in participating in organized religion. That does not make them slaves to its dogma.\n \n I, myself, oscillate between being a pure agnostic and being a very loosely believing Christian. There are times when I do like to believe in a personal God - especially in challenging times - and let myself indulge that belief. That does not mean that I have to believe that God created the earth, etc. I am certainly one that picks and chooses my beliefs. I simply stay away from any beliefs that are disproven by science. It is important to remind ourselves that lack of evidence against a belief is not proof against the belief. There are some places where Scientific evidence can disprove a belief - ex. in details of how the earth or humanity came to exist - but there are also many areas of belief that science has far more trouble presenting evidence that counters a belief. This may well be a religion of the \"gaps\". So be it. There are still wide gaps in science in which religion can fit.",

I would dispute that assumption. Though the great majority of religions hold fairly specific beliefs in a creation, there is nothing in the definition of religion that requires this to be the case. My guess as to the reason for religion stressing a role in creation is that many would find it difficult to have such great respect for a god who did not play a role in creation. \n \n Also, there were religions, such as that followed by many of the founders - i.e. deism - that held that God was like a \"watchmaker\" that set up the apparatus of existence and let it run on its own from there. The modern day equivalent would say that God instigated the big bang. Though there is no evidence against this, I agree that there is no evidence for it and I personally do not hold a view of any role of God or any other force in a supernatural creation. Nevertheless, without any clear evidence of what might have started a Big Bang, the gaps in science once again allow for supernatural belief in this narrow area to be unchallenged with direct evidence. Again, lack of evidence supporting something is not proof that it does not exist. Science cannot prove a negative.",

If, instead, you are simply talking about majority religious belief in the US, then I would agree with your points but, again, that cannot be used to extrapolate to an absolute statement on religion.\n \n \n Secondly, scientists constantly hold views that are either unsupported by evidence or tenuously supported by evidence. This often happens in the first stages of formulation of a hypothesis. The difference is in the degree of certainty. Good scientists will not feel a high degree of certainty in a hypothesis that has little or no evidence. Those who are strongly religious often feel a strong certainty in their beliefs and I would agree that there is some irrationality in that approach.

   "As others have noted, scientific thought is based on verifiable evidence. Religious thought has its base in faith - i.e. belief not necessarily based on evidence but on a type of trust. However, I disagree that the two are mutually exclusive. \n \n The only type of religious faith that fatally clashes with Science is the type that automatically excludes scientific evidence if it contradicts dogma. Though many religions along with their followers are absolute in their dogma, I would say that the majority are not. Though it is rare for a religion to be completely flexible in adapting to new scientific discoveries, I would say that most have enough flexibility that, once scientific discoveries are certain enough and pass some test of time, they adapt a fair amount of their doctrine to match.\n \n Take some examples:[*]Lightning, earthquakes, and other so called \"acts of God\" were actually thought once to be purely acts of God. The great majority of people and religions now accept scientific explanations.[*]The earth was once thought to be at the physical center of the universe. Now, nearly everyone accepts that it is not.[*]Pope John Paul II had written a papal communication that accepted that the human body might have been influenced by evolution, though he claimed divine sources for the soul - \"If the human body take its origin from pre-existent living matter, the spiritual soul is immediately created by God \" from CATHOLIC LIBRARY: Truth Cannot Contradict Truth (1996) .\n So, though religious institutions are very slow to respond to scientific evidence, most do make an effort. The rise of the evangelical religions and other fundamentalist religions trouble me since they seem far more dogmatic than do even long established religions such as the Roman Catholic church. I am hopeful that this is just a phase that portions of the population are going through. Time will tell...\n \n On another point, even when the religious establishment holds a particular dogma, that does not mean that all of their followers agree with all of the religion's dogma. A majority of Catholics, for example, use contraception despite the Church's condemnation of it. Increasingly, people pick and choose what to believe in their religion. There is a comfort and confidence of purpose that many people gain in participating in organized religion. That does not make them slaves to its dogma.\n \n I, myself, oscillate between being a pure agnostic and being a very loosely believing Christian. There are times when I do like to believe in a personal God - especially in challenging times - and let myself indulge that belief. That does not mean that I have to believe that God created the earth, etc. I am certainly one that picks and chooses my beliefs. I simply stay away from any beliefs that are disproven by science. It is important to remind ourselves that lack of evidence against a belief is not proof against the belief. There are some places where Scientific evidence can disprove a belief - ex. in details of how the earth or humanity came to exist - but there are also many areas of belief that science has far more trouble presenting evidence that counters a belief. This may well be a religion of the \"gaps\". So be it. There are still wide gaps in science in which religion can fit.\n\n Truth cannot contradict truth, yes this is the philosophy of aquinas which I mentioned.\n \n You have mistaken the knowledge that is generated for the conflict.\n \n Must a fairytale contradict an observed fact?\n \n No, of course not.\n \n The conflict arises in the method of knowledge not the knowledge itself.\n \n May one imagine an observed fact as they can a fairytale or can an observed fact be treated as unreal as a fairytale can?\n \n No.\n \n One may not slice up epistemologies like a buffet table and use one when it suits him and one when reality voices it's objection.\n \n If you choose reason you have already accepted that a lack of evidence means it is not knowledge.\n \n Reason cannot work another way, if something need not be rational than anything may not need to be rational (any attempt to setup boundaries between the two requires that a rational truth exists which can trump the faith that there are no boundaries).\n \n Faith in theory and practice has the only practical purpose of defying reason.\n \n It can be accurately defined as believing that which has no proof i.e. believing something irrationally.\n \n You can easily claim that you do not see the conflict because you 'believe' in both scientific knowledge and 'spiritual' knowledge (knowledge held through faith).\n \n You along with other religions have chosen carefully what knowledge you hold by faith so that it does not contradict scientific knowledge, that does not remove the underlying contradiction that you think you may choose faith as a method of knowledge.\n \n Some have observed that this produces a 'retreating' effect in which religious people over the centuries have consistently given up dogma for scientific knowledge because they were forced to back down from reason.\n \n This is merely a surface phenomenon of the underlying cause that no knowledge true or false can be gained by faith, and that is a dictate of reason not of any counter faith. A Christian's faith gained knowledge occupies the unknown because science cannot attack it there, but reason (the philosophical basis of science) may attack faith anywhere.\n \n That some religious pick and choose (using their individual irrational faith as opposed to the collective irrational faith) only supports my thesis on the nature of this infection. If you allow irrationality you destroy rationality, and no one can claim to disbar any knowledge. Take for instance this simplest of examples:\n \n I know reason in an improper way to gain knowledge\n How?\n Faith\n Well I think I could give a pretty good argument that reason is a proper way to gain knowledge\n An argument is based on rationality, therefore invalid\n \n One may choose to accept knowledge gained through reason and knowledge gained through faith, but one may not choose both reason and faith as means of knowledge. The ultimate honest truth about someone who thinks they can is that they accept science on faith.\n \n I am sorry for not responding to specific segments as is my custom, I hope you can correlate responses.\n \n \nI must not be very good at expressing my belief.\n\n I think you expressed your beliefs well enough, but why do you expect that anyone misunderstood you?\n \n \nI accept science as a law because it exist and I can see it. I also accept faith because I can see the result in my life. \n\n You say you accept faith because you can see the result in your life. Does that mean you have evidence that some piece of information you held on faith is true?\n \n \n I don't fight the science but those with no faith want to fight me and accuse me of being wrong or out of step. It is a short life compared to the creation of the universe, we will know soon enough who is right, maybe we both are.\n\n Reason cannot be 'wrong', if we both die and we both go before God; You may proudly proclaim that you believed in him the whole time. I will say \"It's lovely that you exist God, I believe in you now that I have evidence for you\".\n \n Let's assume that a fundamentalist christian is there with us, it interrupts me and says \"that doesn't count you need to believe before you see\".\n \n I will turn to God and say \"why did you create us as rational being, beings who could only survive on the earth by reason; but then expect us to contradict our nature and the nature of the universe you created to know of you?\"\n \n What do you expect him to say then singnelect?\n \n \"haha got you\"?\n \n \"the point of the universe I created was so that you would reject the rational and die\"?\n \n Far too many have assumed the latter because it makes the most sense in that context, every major religion has one thing in common besides faith; that death in some form is the ultimate spirtual achievement.\n \n For Christians it's a man bleeding out stapled to a cross in extreme agony.\n \n For Hindu's and buddhist it is 'liberation', and kings would starve themselves to death for this goal.",

I hear religious people all the time say they know God is real because \" they can see the results in their Lives\".. They will not admit that it's possible and highly probable that they would see the exact same result without God or \" Faith\" in their lives. I'll give you an example...\n Suppose a religious person goes to start his car in the morning and it won't start. As he pumps the gas and gets ready to try again he says a little prayer, and suddenly his car starts. A religious person will immediately give GOD credit for starting his car. All those little mundane prayers like this example are credited to an invisible being that doesn't exist. You see NFL football players pointing to the sky and thanking GOD after scoring a touch down. It's because of this kind of thing that Religion has Given People the Misconception that GOD is affecting their lives. All this unnecessary grand standing for the sake of a GOD that only exists in mans imaginations. \n \n Personally I don't care if YOU or anyone else chooses to believe. I am not attacking anyone in particular I despise religion for what it is and what it does to the human mind. When I had major back surgery 8 years ago I didn't give GOD credit for saving my legs, nor my Life. I gave credit to the Doctors, where Credit should have gone. In my opinion human kind will never progress into the future as long as we allow religion to guide our thoughts. Man is perfectly capable of thinking for himself, he has survived on his own without GOD long before religion reared it's ugly head into this world, and In my opinion we will when the world wakes up and realizes that God is Imaginary.
