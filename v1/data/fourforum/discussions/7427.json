   "Dear Readers\n There have been polls on national media websites, political forums, and e-mail's from stupid surveyors.\n Anyway. Let me explain my view on torture.\n I think the whole idea of torture is alright. As long as it is not taking place at innappropriate times. Now, governments today misuse this idea. Governments like Saddams tortured people during the Gulf War or the current war now with severe beating, beheading, so on. But, my stance on this is it is ok. Sometimes torture either physically or mentally is the only way to extract information from terrorists, prisoners of war, or whatever. But, it must not be innappropriately used like U.S. soldiers did at Abu Ghraib. Now, this is where most people get angry. The whole torture is not a good thing, and most countries misuse it. They use it improperly, and so on. Torture can be religious torture too. If some guy won't cough up information on something, don't flush his bible down the toilet, don't do anything like that either.\n But, torture can be beating a prisoner until he cracks, or so on. But, I guess if it takes place, it should be severely monitored, and it should not get out of hand. The CIA, prisons, and some other places use torture. But, I am 48 percent against it because I picture myself being tortured. I would not like being beaten by the enemy. I would want to be treated better. So therefore I would want to treat that person the way I would be treated.\n I don't expect you to agree with me. I know this is a international controversy. But, I am both against and for it. \n -John",

   "\n I think the whole idea of torture is alright. As long as it is not taking place at innappropriate times.\n\n Can you elaborate on what you consider to be appropriate and innappropriate situations for the use of torture?\n \n Sometimes torture either physically or mentally is the only way to extract information from terrorists, prisoners of war, or whatever.\n\n Have you not taken in any of the arguments that you must have read here concerning the fact that torture is an extremely inefficient way of getting information, for the main reason that people will make stuff up that they think their torturers want to hear, just to stop being tortured?\n \n If some guy won't cough up information on something, don't flush his bible down the toilet, don't do anything like that either.\n But, torture can be beating a prisoner until he cracks, or so on.\n\n So in a world where putting a book in a toilet is a violation, beating the XXXX out of someone is ok? You have some weird morals my friend.\n \n \n But, I guess if it takes place, it should be severely monitored, and it should not get out of hand. The CIA, prisons, and some other places use torture.\n\n Out of hand? But this is the whole argument! When does unpleasant treatment become torture? Who decides when something is getting out of hand? How would a monitoring system work? Surely the public would have to know what was going on, and how do you think they'd react?\n \n \nBut, I am 48 percent against it because I picture myself being tortured. I would not like being beaten by the enemy. I would want to be treated better. So therefore I would want to treat that person the way I would be treated.\n\n \n So basically you're happy for other people to be tortured as long as you don't have to be involved, don't have to see it or know about it, and definitely as long as it doesn't happen to you.",
