   "How many of you seen an abortion performed and after seeing this done believe it is ok to do this. And have you really researched all the facts, or is it just about the rights of the mother to you\n\n I haven't personally seen an abortion performed, but I have seen some of the images of aborted fetuses - which is at least a partial experience of abortion. I can understand the gut reaction that people have at seeing the images of the mangled bodies of aborted fetuses. My initial reaction is the same - disgust and sympathy. However, we cannot always trust our gut reactions. After all, when we see pictures of autopsies being performed, we get much the same reaction of disgust and sympathy. With autopsy images, however, most people quickly adjust their gut reaction to accomodate the reality that we know full well that the corpse is not experiencing pain or suffering when it is openned up. So, our initial feeling of sympathy disappears after we use our intellect to realize that our initial gut reaction was wrong.\n \n Where the images of aborted fetuses are concerned, those reactions might well be right for late term fetuses. In late term, fetuses can experience pain and might well have some mental existence. So, it might well be possible that they did suffer during that abortion. However, for early term abortions (which constitute the great majority of abortions), there is no possibility of the fetus experiencing pain. Indeed, there is no mind or mental existence whatsoever - just an empty shell of a developing body with \"nobody home\". In those instances, images of aborted fetuses (no matter how human they may look) should not justify a feeling of sympathy since there was no suffering that happened, nobody in that body that was aborted. As with autopsies, we need to step back and ask ourselves whether our gut reactions are right.\n \n Just to let you know how all this affects my stance on abortion. Since it is mental existence that I find most important in the very existence of a person with rights, I think that, up to roughly the beginning of the third trimester (when the brain can be developed enough to have some level of mental existence), abortions should be allowed for any reason. After that, one must balance the rights of the mother with the rights of the fetus since the fetus might now have a mental existence - he is a new person that deserves some level of rights. So, I would restrict third trimester abortions to the main exeptions (risk to life or major risk to health, rape, incest, etc.).",

If she wants the embryo or zygote, she's entitled to call it a baby and cherish it as a human being. Her choice, and no-one has a right to argue with it. If she doesn't, then she can regard it as an unwanted alien intrusion and dispose of it. Again, her choice.

It doesn't even develop a brain till the second trimester, and it's mostly the first we are concerned with here (barring considerations of health risk to mothers at more advanced stages of pregnancy).

I was mainly speaking of the early fetus / embryo, where there indeed IS a very big difference between a baby and that early stage. I certainly agree with you that, at the very late stage, the difference is mainly only one of location. I have posted many posts that support restricting abortion rights in the late term. The critical characteristic in my view is when the fetus starts to develop a mental existence. For Roe vs Wade, viability seems to be a critical point where the state can start restricting abortion rights. \n \nIndeed, the mother is looking forward to the birth and that's why she calls it a baby, as should be the case.

However, people do differentiate between the worth they place on the fetus at late stage vs early stage - where over 80% support restricting abortion rights for 3rd trimester abortions while over 60% would keep it generally legal for 1st trimester abortions. So, the stage of development does matter to people when considering rights of fetus vs rights of mother. The great majority of abortions happen with early term embryos / fetuses - a stage where far fewer people support restrictions on abortion rights since they recognize that the embryo is still very different from a baby with rights, unlike a late term fetus.",

You you just called it bullocks to do so. emoticon_xdonno \n \n \nSecondly, as you point out, it's the attitude of the mother that makes all the difference. If the mother wants to regard the conceptus...foetus as her \"baby\", that is her prerogative and we should respect it.\n\n \n Sorry, but you just got through saying above it's bullocks to say so. Either it's bullocks, or it's not. Whether or not it's bullocks doesn't change depending on who says it. Again, inconsistency on your part. \n \n \nIt all boils down to perception. What the anti-abortionists argue is that everyone should be legally compelled to share their perception; what the pro-choicer advocates argue is that women should be free to act by their own. Whatever it is.\n\n \n What are you talking about? No one is trying to 'compel' you to share any perception. You can call it whatever you want.

The silence is deafening. Surly if God was so against abortion he would have added it to his ten commandments, maybe even making it his first commandment, but nope, not one word about abortion can be found in the bible. Weird.\n \n The Hebrew word for \"kill\" in the commandment \"Thou shalt not kill\" is rasach, which is more accurately interpreted as \"murder,\" or illegal killing judged harmful by the community. It is itself a relative, legalistic term! &#8232;&#8232;Many forms of killing were considered legal in ancient Israel, and levitical law listed many of the exceptions. Generally, levitical law permitted killing in times of war, the commission of justice and in self-defense. Now here is an interesting bit of information that you will never hear a anti-choicer admit. Sometimes, God even gave Israel permission to kill infant children. In Samuel 15:3, God ordered Saul to massacre the Amalekites: \"Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; put to death men and women, children and infants, ox and sheep...\" &#8232;\n \n Read 'em and weep archangel. \n \n Most Christians do not know about this because it has been hidden, mislabeled or censored from them so they are uneducated about it, and who do you supposed censored it?\n \n The ancient Jews passed down their laws orally, and only wrote down the more complicated laws to jog their memory. Fortunately, the Jews are legendary for their fanatical preservation of the law, and they have never considered abortion to be a sin. That alone should make many anti-choice advocates stop and reconsider the legal basis, holy or otherwise, for their opposition to abortion.\n \n \nbut not the people whom Jesus came from or came to die for. They didn't allow abortions or condone them.\n\n Yes they did, read the lost scrolls. Oh wait, that's right, if someone hasn't already 'programed' you with this information then it can't be true, right? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nNothing Palin has said or done in her professional or personal life could be construed as hypocritical at all. \n\n I have news for you archangel, slavery is no longer a part of this country, and yet palin wants to treat women like a slave by forcing them to do something against their will, and taking away their freedom of choice.

You truly have a warped view of the world :( Thanks for revealing yourself (again).\n\n \n You would rely on Constitutional conflicts in order to justify a bad decision. But that doesn't change the fact that abortion is wrong, unethical and immoral. Remember, slavery was once allowed according to the Constitution, but that didn't make it right or ethical, now did it. Here are some obvious problems with it.\n No decision of the Supreme Court in the twentieth century has been as controversial as the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision holding that women have a right to choose to have an abortion during the first two trimesters of a pregnancy. Attorneys for Roe had suggested several constitutional provisions might be violated by the Texas law prohibiting abortions except when necessary to save the life of the mother. The law was said to have been an establishment of religion in violation of the First Amendment, unconstitionally vague (the ground used in Blackmun's first draft of his opinion), a denial of equal protection of the laws, and a violation of the Ninth Amendment (which states that certain rights not specified in the first eight amendments are reserved to the people). The Court in Roe chose, however, to base its decision on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the so-called \"right of privacy\" protected in earlier decisions such as Griswold v Connecticut (striking down a ban on the use, sale, and distribution of contraceptives). Deciding HOW to protect the right to an abortion proved as difficult. Justice Blackmun's approach, one clerk at the time said, \"As a practical matter, was not a bad decision--but as a constitutional matter it was absurd.\"http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/abortion.htm\n \n You see, the reality is that relying on the right to privacy clause in allowing one American to end the life of another INNOCENT American IS absurd on every level of rationale. When ones right to privacy denies another the right to life, then a very deep ethical flaw exists with that premise. Each State should decide for itself, based on the will of its citizens if abortions should be allowed in their respective State. It should not be a Federal decision at all.",
