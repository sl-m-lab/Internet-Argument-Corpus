Shocking, but true!\n\n \n What Air America proved was that they couldn't pay people to listen to the drivel they spewed there. As shown here...\n Air America's failure shows liberals have no place on talk-radio airwaves\n Troy Appel\n \n Issue date: 4/16/04 Section: FORUM\n PrintEmail DoubleClick Any Word\n Page 1 of 1\n The battle for the airwaves took a new turn March 31 with the addition of Air America Radio, a liberal talk-radio network, to the dial in nine cities, including Chicago.\n \n Many liberals rejoiced at the thought of having a forum to challenge Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, Michael Savage, Neal Boortz, Laura Ingraham and other conservative talking heads.\n \n The Left decided to counter with lightweight hosts such as comedians Al Franken and Marc Maron, comedienne-actress Janeane Garofalo and rapper Chuck D.\n \n The list omits most Democratic heavy-hitters. Why should we care what someone like Janeane Garofalo has to say? After all, this isn't \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n \n The debut of the station has been far from smooth, with its Los Angeles affiliate having signal troubles, the San Francisco launch being delayed and the Chicago station knocking a Spanish-language station off the air.\n \n In the past two weeks, we have learned all we need to know about this operation: It is being done on the cheap.\n \n The Chicago Tribune reported this week that the network is facing serious cash-flow problems. Its signal has been knocked out in Los Angeles and Chicago because the network owes $1 million total to station owners in the respective cities.\n \n With a network two weeks old already against the ropes, we must recognize the shoddy nature of Air America Radio and tune out.\n \n Those who are politically attune deserve better than hearing shows titled \"The O'Franken Factor,\" \"The Morning Sedition\" and \"So What Else is News?\" With these pathetic shows, liberals could not possibly think they have made a dent in the empire of Limbaugh.\n \n Alas, they believe that entertainers are the way to radio equality.\n \n They aren't.\n \n In listening to Franken's show you hear the usual rhetoric we have all come to know and love: Bush is not intelligent, Iraq was a mistake and all the usual golden nuggets of the day.\n \n Even Franken's presence is unnoticeable on the radio. His co-host, professional broadcaster Katherine Lanpher, carries the show, with Franken occasionally jumping in with comic one-liners.\n \n The show also featured the winner of the \"MoveOn.org Stupid and Misleading Quote Contest.\"\n \n All in all the station fails to put together captivating programming that I can't read in The New York Times, watch on CNN or hear from James Carville.\n \n \"Air America's problem is that it is an artificially-generated public-relations ploy,\" said Guy Benson, a Medill freshman and the conservative co-host of WNUR FM-89.3's \"Feedback.\" \"Prior to its inception, the open market clearly did not demand a high-profile, left-wing radio network, or else one would have evolved on its own.\n \n \"The fact that a small group of wealthy liberal elites decided that such a network was necessary means very little,\" he added.\n \n In the end the Left must realize it has network and some cable television, print media and Hollywood all firmly in its corner. You just have to know when to stop.\n \n We as Americans do not want to hear what comedians and rappers think about politics -- just ask The Dixie Chicks.\n \n No signal, no cash, no point: Liberal radio has left a dubious mark in two weeks. So you better catch Al and Janeane now.\n \n They might not be on the air any longer by the time you read this.Air America's failure shows liberals have no place on talk-radio airwaves - FORUM\n \n Here's one reason why they're trying to reintroduce the Fairness Doctrine: The Fairness Doctrine: Revenge for Air America's Failure | NewsBusters.org",

To get more in-depth, Nancy Pelosi is essentially saying \"You have to express both opinions on your radio and TV talk shows.\" Don't we have a free will anymore?\n\n \n Please, please stop exaggerating the views of others. That is not what the Fairness Doctrine is about. In fact, I've heard a lot of commentators claiming that they'd be \"silenced\" by the Fairness Doctrine, without a single word about what it actually was. A portion from Wikipedia:\n \n \nIt did not require equal time for opposing views, but required that contrasting viewpoints be presented. The Fairness Doctrine had two basic elements: It required broadcasters to devote some of their airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest, and to air contrasting views regarding those matters. Stations were given wide latitude as to how to provide contrasting views: It could be done through news segments, public affairs shows or editorials.\n\n \n If the Fairness Doctrine were reintroduced, Rush Limbaugh would not suddenly have to devote half of his three hour program to liberal viewpoints, nor would any individual radio or television show, as Ethmi seems to be implying. It would only apply to broadcasters (that is, individual stations), and even then would likely allow for broad interpretation.\n \n I think people might want to take a look at why the Fairness Doctrine existed in the first place. You have to go back to before the internet, before cable. There was a realization that the airwaves should belong to the people, but the spectrum itself - the space taken up by the signals - is limited. So, the FCC in the United States was created to ensure that broadcasters would serve the public (and also to reduce signal interference, among many other things). This is why you have the implementation of concepts like the Fairness Doctrine, and the idea that broadcasters should serve \"the public interest, convenience, and necessity,\" - a concept that still rightly exists (though its enforcement in some areas is suspect).\n \n Even if Fairness Doctrine came back, I seriously doubt it would have much of an impact, given the wide range of media that exist today. And, frankly, I doubt Fairness Doctrine will return at all. Despite what NATO 556 claims, Obama does not support it:\n \n \n\"Sen. Obama does not support reimposing the Fairness Doctrine on broadcasters,\" press secretary Michael Ortiz said in an e-mail to B&C late Wednesday.\n \n \"He considers this debate to be a distraction from the conversation we should be having about opening up the airwaves and modern communications to as many diverse viewpoints as possible,\" Ortiz added. \"That is why Sen. Obama supports media-ownership caps, network neutrality, public broadcasting, as well as increasing minority ownership of broadcasting and print outlets.\"\n\n \n It seems that talk of being \"silenced\" by the Fairness Doctrine is little more than an attempt to scare people and make them think that those with different ideas somehow hate free speech.\n \n Also, Jo, just to clarify, Fox News would not be touched by the Fairness Doctrine because it is on cable/satellite.",

The question is, then why didn't he ask that question during the campaign? Chris Mathews said it's his job to make sure the Obama presidency succeeds which is why he wont ask any hard questions. Is that fair and balanced reporting? Will you insist that those so called journalists will ask relevant question which actually seek to answer the concerns that 48% of all Americans have about this unknown empty suit? Of course you wont.\n \n Because it isn't the truth you seek, it's the opportunity to squelch the other sides ability to question the anti-american policies this poser represents, just as Pelosi and company want to do. The fact is, that conservative talk radio works because people get something from it. If they didn't, they wouldn't listen, advertisers would buy time to market on them and they would fail just as liberal talk radio did.\n \n The reason the Republicans lost this election isn't because conservatism is dead as you would love to believe.

Wayne Phillips, a Democratic National Committee staffer described the aftermath of the ruling, explaining that \"Even more important than the free radio time was the effectiveness of this operation in inhibiting the political activity of these right-wing broadcasts\".\n\n \n Well, that doesn't at all address the question I asked which was regarding what you brought up about religious programming. The text you are citing is clearly talking about political speech, not religious speech. It also is quite vague about any actual impact the Fairness Doctrine had on \"right-wing broadcasters,\" only that it was used strategically against political opposition. I will say, though, that is something better served by existing regulations regarding election campaigning.\n \n Once again, I think people are missing the point about why the Fairness Doctrine existed in the first place. I'll paraphrase from the decision on Red Lion v. FCC, from answers.com:\n \nThe finite number of broadcast frequencies meant it was \"idle to posit an unabridgeable First Amendment right to broadcast comparable to the right of every individual to speak, write, or publish\"\n\n Since not everybody has access to the airwaves to be heard, it was determined to be the responsibility of broadcasters to allow for opposing viewpoints so that those logistically excluded from broadcasting were not inherently silenced.\n \n And let me be clear: I don't personally support the reintroduction of Fairness Doctrine. I believe that it is largely obsolete. But I also believe that talk of its impact has been just that- all talk.\n \n \nThe link you cited was wikipedia. Wikipedia is not particulary credible, as one could edit the article, then cite it as a source. Not that I'm accusing you of doing this, but...\n\n \n Wikipedia is perfectly credible for simple reference, which is why I went to it. A lot of people were talking about the Fairness Doctrine and some perceived implications without seeming to understand what it was actually all about, and I felt the Wikipedia article described it accurately. Wikipedia is quite well moderated, and most edits to articles which stray too far from accepted facts or introduce possible bias are usually rectified. But, your concerns are warranted. If you have any information about how the Fairness Doctrine operated that contradicts the description I provided, feel free to provide it.",

   "The notion of requiring someone to air opposing view points is asinine.\n \n Would you REALLY want that tripe to be practiced? Across the board?\n \n It creates a slippery slope.\n Can be used to spring board ID into school science classes ya know. \n \n Damn ignorant liberals. THINK.\n \n Also, there are MANY stations that air highly liberal news with plenty of biased commentary. I'm PAID to watch it daily.\n \n I say let the blow-hard righties have Fox News and their propaganda networks and radio.\n Create your own competing channels.\n \n Geesh, it's a free and capitalistic nation. Quit seeking to force others to conform to your ideas and opinions...you're starting to sound EXACTLY like those you tend to loath. Fundies who want to shovel their garbage down your throats.\nWell put. The inability of liberals to come up with profitable radio talk shows is the basis of their disdain for today's talk radio and their drive to control it with the \"Fairness\" Doctrine.\n \n \nFishbulb, I beg your pardon! I was reacting angrily because there are so damnably many religious radio stations in that area and one can't listen to any decent, reliable broadcasting at all.\n \n It is so annoying to never be allowed to know the truth in this country and sometimes I attack people unfairly because I am so angry about all the stupid propaganda I am exposed to.\n \n I can't even stand to watch American TV because they either leave a whole lot of information out or distort the piddling, miserable bit of information they do broadcast.\n \n And that damnable Rupert Murdoch and his murky, icky level of salacious, sex-filled broadcasting. Murdoch is the absolute whore of American media!\nThen why don't you get together with people of your ilk and establish stations that meet your approval. All it takes is money. However, in order to be financially successful, your station would have to attract advertisers willing to pay big bucks to get listeners exposed to their ads so they they could sell more of their products. It is unfortunate for the liberals that this is a difficult to achieve...the message has to be worthy of attention...the shows have to be interesting. Liberals can't seem to remain either interesting or worthy of attention long enough to hold an audience through a commercial break.\n \n \nUm, I don't remember Democrats getting into a snit and screaming hysterically because Janet Jackson's breast was exposed.\nThat's because they are more permissive of trash and perversion being broadcast.\n \n \n\n I am, however, opposed to excessive violence and explicit sexuality on television and violence-inciting and other political ugliness on radio.\n \n Do you have a problem with that?\nOn broadcast TV, I have no objection to disallowing excessive violence and explicit sex. However, oftentimes the excessive violence is found in cartoons intended for children wherein the victim simply gets up and walks away...seeing stars for a while, but returning to normal in no time at all.\n \n We are programmed to accept the portrayal of violence...as long as it happens to someone else.\n \n A glimpse of explicit sex is usually titillating even to self-righteous Victorians. You can't defeat Mother Nature...we are programmed to like sex.\n \n \nYou cannot say what you wish over the public airwaves. There are seven forbidden words which may not be uttered over the air.\n \n Obviously, Janet Jackson's nipple is verboten over television broadcast through the air.\n \n Surprisingly, endless advertising about erectile dysfunction is quite acceptable but it is forbidden by conservative broadcasters to air ads for birth control, especially condoms.\n \n Most broadcasting facilities are owned by conservatives and conservative values rule the airwaves.\nThen why don't you and some fellow liberals start your own broadcast company and apply for licenses? All you need do is make a profit by attracting advertisers...or support it yourself until your bankroll dries up.\n \n \nGuess what, Jack.\n \n November 4 turned you and your movement into footnotes.\n \n Get used to the idea that you and your ilk are impotent irrelevancies.\n \n As Cromwell said to the Long Parliament, \"Begone ye rogues; ye have sat long enough.\"\nThis is the attitude of a pompous pig. The government is intended to be for all of the people, not just the party in control at the time.\n \n \nIncidentally, every conservative radio show I've ever listened to allows callers with opposing points of view to the front of the line.\nQuite so...and they usually get their head handed to them in a basket. I'm continually amused by the liberals that refuse to answer simple questions in the course of having conversation intended to expand one's knowledge of facts.\n \n \nNancy Pelosi is right on it's about time both opinions have equal time on the radio. There is to much of one side on issues.\nBoth opinions already have equal opportunity to access the airwaves. The liberals just can't make a success of it. That's why they feel a need to stifle the conservative success.\n \n Equality already exists in the opportunity arena.

Only affirmative action (forcing those incompetent to the forefront) will solve the liberal's dilemma. It's called \"dumbing down\"!\n\n \n This is exactly right. Air America for example had wealthy backers and was given every opportunity to succeed, but could not pay listeners to listen, or advertisers to buy time on their shows. That's because their message is shallow, hollow, angry, bitter and self serving with no foundation in any truth at all. And that gets old real fast in real time.\n \n Since they can't win in the arena of ideas, they must force their views on the public by attempting to enforce this so called fairness doctrine. The rub is though, that there is nothing fair about it. If the Leftist message was so right and true then the masses would gladly and eagerly support the shows that promote them in an open marketplace. The reality is though that they couldn't hold onto listeners at any cost. That isn't the fault of conservatives or the message they offer. It falls directly at the door of the Liberals failed message and philosophy which listeners in a commercial market place reject, which by it's very design is as fair as fair can be.\n \n Listeners = sponsors. Sponsors = revenues for the Radio Station. Radio Station makes money and promotes radio show which draws more listeners.\n \n This formula is tried and true and works every time as long as one part of the equation succeeds, and that is that the radio show can draw and HOLD ONTO LISTENERS. That part of the formula was the great achilles heel of Air America and every other leftist radio personality and format. Listeners hate the negative whining and complaining message which does nothing more than condemn and demonize America at every turn as the big bad wolf of the world. The bottom line is that the liberal shows never existed to discuss and debate ideas at all. They existed in order to indoctrinate and to tell people what and how they must think about issues.",
