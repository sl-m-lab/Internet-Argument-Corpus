The public is generally angered at the thought of government subsidization of private business, whether or not it's actually true. \n \n The bottom line is, when all the taxing and regulating is done, OTR trucks pay many times more tax per mile traveled than owners of luxury cars, single axle diesels, etc. Part of it is justified because they do more damage to roads.

That should be one gain.

At a conversion rate of 4 barrels/ton and a projected usage of ~2Billion tons/year, that's 800 years worth of hydrocarbon fuel, none of it coming from unstable OPEC countries that we spend $100's of Billions to protect.

Hydrocarbons are the currency of the chemical industry. Cheap oil is necessary for MOST chemical plants to survive. Fuel is only one of many essential uses for HCs. \n I don't know hom much chemistry you know, but I'd like you to tell me how you can make Nylon easily out of plants, for example. Nylon is a polymer based on aromatic rings. Plants don't synthesize aromatic rings to any extent. The primary compositions found in plants are celluloses (polymeric sugars) and linear fatty acids. \n Recycling plastic consumes more HCs than are recycled, so it's a loser right from the get-go. Transportation, cleaning, separation, shredding, etc., al take lots of energy and the plastic that's produced is of poorer quality than virgin material. So, you go through extra-ordinary efforts to produce an inferior product. emoticon_xgood",

   "Mining techniques today are much better than the Nazis had in the 30's. That should be one gain. As the cost of oil goes up, the economics of producing the liquified coal only increase unfavorably if the net energy balance is unfavorable. \n Transportation costs can be reduced dramatically by building conversion plants close to the mines and using cheap transportation means (rail, ship, coal slurry pipeline) . \n\n \n This is the problem. We do not just need energy, it has to be CHEAP energy, and it has to produce useful chemicals as a by product. Currently, we use about 27% of our oil for transportation.

In order for our society and industrial infrastructure to stay in place, we have to have CHEAP energy and cheap chemicals. Coal liquification does nto provide this.\n \n \n \nWe have known coal reserves in the US of 1,600Billion tons. At a conversion rate of 4 barrels/ton and a projected usage of ~2Billion tons/year, that's 800 years worth of hydrocarbon fuel, none of it coming from unstable OPEC countries that we spend $100's of Billions to protect.

Then it has to be stored and transported in hermatically sealed containers and pipelines. The cost for that is so high that there are not even any decent estimates out there. Last year the DOE released an estimate for the US, and such a system for the eastern and western seaboard (apparently those of us in the middle of the country don't count) was estimated at \"$200-$300 trillion\". Thats right, folks TRILLION...with a T. \n \n Recycling plastics is nice, if you have cheapo energy sources you can use to reprocess it. Plastics from plant materials is also nice, and only costs about 600x as much as plastics from hydrocarbon based sources. Those costs INCREASE with increased energy costs, because plant matter is a low density feedstock. \n \n It is NOT just fuel that requires cheap oil. It is the chemical processes that require cheap oil. Oil prices could triple and we could adapt to the increased fuel costs. Mass transit would become a necessity, but it could be done. The biggest problem with increased oil costs is actually food production. We use oil to make pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers.

First, what is being produced at that $35 per barrel is not diesel fuel, it is a sweet crude that can be turned into diesel fuel. They do this in S Africa with an ingenious portable refining rig. You essentially pour in the raw syn crude and it craps out #2 and #3 diesel fuel and gasoline. It uses a catalyzing burner and burns off the light ends for the heat input for the reaction, which makes it entirely self contained. It is a slick setup. S Africa hs very little refining capability, and the mobile setups allow companies that just need fuel to essentially refine it on site, whihc is cheaper than buying imported refined goods. \n \n Second, as the price of fuel rises, so does the cost of the process. It used to be that people claimed that $20 per barrel was the break evn point. Now it is $35 per barrel. If oil reaches $80 per barrel, the syn crude can be produced for $60 per barrel. The problem is not that it can't be done, but that it can't be done cheaply enough to provide the cheap energy and chemicals that the world economy is based on. \n \n \nIs your 14% conversion efficiency based on HC content or energy produced minus consumed in production?\n\n \n Potential enery produced minus production consumption. To put it another way, the energy ratio of coal liquification (including transport) is 4. By comparison, the energy ratio for oil, incluidng transport, is 85. No, I don't know exactly how they calculate this XXXX, or where they come up with the scale since it is certainly not an order of magnitude thing, or a percentage. \n \n \n \nAnd the $16Trillion isn't start up costs, it's the cost to fully displace current technology. The rate of introduction depends on the economics at the time. If oil demand drops, we can stretch out the conversion process. If the price of oil goes through the roof, we can accelerate the rate of conversion.\n\n \n The $16 trilllion is infrastucture costs to replace current systems. If the cost of oil goes through the roof, those costs will escalate. The only way we could possibly do it, and be able to afford to do it, is to start TODAY and hope we get either enough of the infrastucture done to insulate us from increased energy costs, or hope that we can get it all completed before significant increases in energy costs occur. I am unaware of anybody who is suggesting that energy prices will be declining at any foreseable point in the future. \n \n The problem of course is that we do not have $16 trillion to invest TODAY. A 20% further increase in energy costs (which some analysts are suggestign we may see before the end of this year, and the most optimistic number I have seen is 2 years) would cripple our economy, and probably the world economy. When where are we going to come up with over $16 trillion (my numebrs say at a 20% increase in energy costs the cost ballons to over $20 trillion...assuming that we still haev factories operating to produce the needed bits and pieces). Realistically, getting funding together is just a first step. The transition and infrastructure imporvements could not possibly take place in less than 20 years, and that is going balls out. Short sightedness coming back to bite us in the butt. This is the problem with ALL the alternatives to oil. We needed to start 50 years ago. Now it is too little too late. If the peak oil estimeates are correct, and we are really looking at a decrease in world oil supply in the next 5 or 6 years, then it is unlikely that we will be able to feed our people for even 3 years, the minimum amount of time to get even one coal conversion plant up and running, and without transport infrastructure.\n \n \nCoal is the cheapest today, but just a couple of years ago, it was natural gas. In any case, we need to build nuclear plants to handle our electricity so that HCs can be used as feedstocks instead of lighting bulbs.\n\n \n And demand for natural gas increased as oil prices ballooned, making it uncompetitive. Coal prices are starting to rise as well.

Since coal sells for $120/ton domestically (last time I checked) and you get 4 barrels of refined HCs per ton, that still makes coal to liquid conversion attractive even if conversion costs are $30/barrel or so.\n\n \n Good coal (low sulphur with a low impurity level) is currently running closer to $280 per ton, and gets a boost every time oil does.\n \n I agree with you about the nuclear power option. From a practical standpoint, though, thre are 2 problems with this. First, we ahve the \"too little too late\" problem above. Nuclear power plants are difficult and time consuming to build. It woudl take 50-75 years to JUST replace current hydrocarbon based plants with nuclear plants. The second problem is that Uranium production has probably already peaked. From http://www.worldenergy.org/wec-geis/publications/reports/ser/uranium/uranium.asp\n \n \nWorld uranium requirements were about 61 600 tU in 1999 and are projected to lie within a range of 54 500 - 79 800 tU/year by 2015. The annual production capability in 1999 was 45 800 tU, or about 75% of requirements. Projections based on available capability developments and the phase-out of existing mines show that the capabilities for 2015 may range between 42 000 and 62 000 tU/year. \n \n The total world uranium resources could supply ample quantities to cover the demands of existing and planned nuclear power stations over the next decade. However, because of the amount of anticipated supply from non-production sources, it is expected that mine production will continue to meet only a portion of the annual requirements over the next five to ten years. \n \n Provided that non-production supplies continue to be available, the combination of mine and non-production supply could meet the requirements. However, if there is an unexpected interruption in supply a shortfall could develop. This could lead to unstable market conditions until the equilibrium between supply and demand is re-established. \n\n \n \n A massive shift to nuclear power, or addition of plants to make up for energy shortage would toss the forecasts here out on their ear. \n \n The problem seems to be very real, and there is no easy solution. At this point, it seems that there is NO soultion that will prevent large numbers of people from dying. The up side is that if enough people die, we will have plenty of energy for those who do not.",

In addition to the fact that the ROEI on ethanol is only 4.5 (yes, that is using the new method), that ROEI does NOT include inorganic chemicals that are essentially required in the modern world to grow the feedstock in any decent quantity. Increased feedstock production costs (due to increased HC costs) really screws up the formula. Realistically, ethanol shares the problems of biomass gasification. Low density feed stock is expensive to transport. In order for the ROEI to remain reasonable, the plant can really only process feedstock form about a 10 mile radius. Beyond that, transport and handling charges make it cost prohibitive. I think that ideally, ethanol would be produces places like saw mills and nut shelling facilities where a huge amount of feedstock is available as a waste product.\n \n \nAgreed. We are way behind the 8-ball on this one. The good news is that nobody else is in any better shape. European cars may be more efficient, but they're still paying near equivalent $/miles driven due to their higher fuel costs.\n\n \n Europe is behind in technology. China is a decade ahead of us on coal liquification (including a new catalytic unit that nobody can duplicate) and their massive hydroelectric program gives them an advantage. S Africa could transition fully to alternative fuels in a year without a hiccup. I think that from a social atandpoint, though, most of the world is ahead fo the US in regards to such a disaster. First, most of the world has a more socialist mindset than then US. Cuba, for example, has essentially had their peak oil with the fall of the soviet union. Their exports (and imports) dropped by 85% overnight, and their oil was cut by over 50%....a bad thing when you cnsider that their electricity is oil generated. \n \n They started pretty serious urban farming programs, banding together into communal food production teams. They have, in many places, formed communal electrical production centers. Can you really envision a bunch of new yorkers banding together to start a communal farm in Central Park? If they did, I can virtually gaurantee you that anothr group would kill them and take their food. A capitalist mindset is NOT a good thign if you have to depend on people doing the \"right thing\" in order to survive. Additionally, many places in the third world could make the transition to a mroe sustainable lifestyle simply becuase they are already living low energy consumption lifestyles. \n \n I read a report form FEMA a while back that concluded that loss of major utilities (electrical in that case) for two weeks would result in the deaths of over half the American population. Americans do not know where or how to get fresh, drinkable water if it does nto come out of their tap. They do not know how to keep food without refrigeration. Face it. Americans minus their machinery are not survivors.\n \n \nMost of the low sulfur coal is on land that Clinton had converted to \"national park status\" and belongs to the government. This can actually work to the public's advantage. The possibility of regulating the mining of these areas may provide some relief for the public if politicians can be kept from selling us out.\n\n \n Yea, right. they will lease it to their buddies for rediculously low fees, then their buddies will pump themarket price despite the fact that their operation is essentially being subsidized by the taxpayers. A replay of the oil situation.\n \n \nNo, the only solution is to throw money at the problem and hope that you don't run out of money before you solve the problem. :xbanghead\n\n \n It has already been established that we do not have that much money. We simply do not have the funds, or the ability to produce alternatives quickly enough to meet this problem head on. There are several folks out there that agree that we actually passed peak oil last december. Many more have us hitting peak in the next year or two. Most conservative estimate put the price of oil 3 years after meak at between $120 and $160 per barrel. At $110 per barrel, half the world populaiton starves to death and fairly large tracts of productive land go fallow because the cost of production is more than most people on the planet can affrod to pay. It takes 6 calories of HC energy to produce 1 calorie of food in the US. \n \n You might be better off using that land to grow food rather then feed stock for fuel. Of course if you do that, you may also want to invest in some fencing materials, and some small arms...preferably belt fed. Starving people seldom say \"please\" when they see food available.",

Only the governing class and military could afford to operate vehicles.\n\n \n when you get into mom and pop ethanol operations, energy efficiency drops to .76, meaning you loose energy in the bargain. Higer efficiency is based on commercial production, using a 3 vat process with sulphuric acid to break down the fiberous material.\n \n Used fry oil? Who the hell is going to be able to afford fry oil if fuel costs are actually high enough to justify widescale biodiesel efforts? Producing veggie oil is energy intensive.\n \n The GOOD news is that with advances in the ethanol process, we would now only have to plant Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa, Oklahoma, and North and South Dakota in corn (or other biomass) JUST to provide the amount of gasoline (does nothing for diesel or HC chemicals) we use. That is 4 states off the list!!! Also, since the new process is not so space intensive, we would ONLY have to turn Nevada into a giant processing plant, instead of Nevada and Arizona as under the old system!! \n \n I have spent a small fortune investigating various alternative energy schemes as investment opportunities and as far as I can tell, it is time for people to realize that we simply do not have the time or the money to implement the needed changes. The world population is unsustainable without massive amounts fo cheap oil. Realistically, it will take us a minimum of 100 years to replace oil as an energy source since all the current alternatives require massive amounts of energy to implement, and if oil does indeed go into decline, that is massive amounts of energy we do not have. \n \n At $85-$95 per barrel economies start imploding (including the US economy)\n At $95-$100 per barrel, 2/3 of winter heating needs will nto be met\n At $100-$110 per barrel, half the worlds population starves to death (much sooner if economies have collapsed)\n \n Beyond that, it really does not matter, because there is a good chance that we will not be extracting any more oil anyway. We will not have the people and the infrastructure left to need it. \n \n Somewhere between all that there is almost certain to be some pretty entertaining slaughter, murder, and mayhem as we sink into an energy warfare scenario. Of course, if anybody uses nukes, all bets are off the table.",

   "I have only ever seen 2 estimates for fully self fueled coal liquification (no oil in the mix anywhere) and both ran in the $80-$85 range. This is not a good thing. I think you are right, we are at the end of the cheap hydrocarbons. The problem will be figuring out what we do now. I think the biggest concern is keeping the population fed. \n\n I'm not concerned with keeping the whole population fed, only the US'. Altruism be damned. \n \n\n Ethanol is actually worse than coal.

Whatever I didn't burn, I could drink to forget about what it was like in the \" good ole days\". emoticon_xhoho \n \n\n Europe is behind in technology. China is a decade ahead of us on coal liquification (including a new catalytic unit that nobody can duplicate) and their massive hydroelectric program gives them an advantage. S Africa could transition fully to alternative fuels in a year without a hiccup. I think that from a social atandpoint, though, most of the world is ahead fo the US in regards to such a disaster. First, most of the world has a more socialist mindset than then US. Cuba, for example, has essentially had their peak oil with the fall of the soviet union. Their exports (and imports) dropped by 85% overnight, and their oil was cut by over 50%....a bad thing when you cnsider that their electricity is oil generated. \n\n France is better off from an electricity standpoint, but that's about the extent of it. As for smaller socialist countries, I agree that it's easier for them to transition since they are accustomed to thinking \"collectively\" and letting gov't dictate policy.\n Look at Brazil, for example. In the 80's when gasoline was very expensive there, 90% of the new vehicles sold ran on ETOH. But, with an increase in the cost of ETOH, they're back to 90+% gasoline. \n \n\n They started pretty serious urban farming programs, banding together into communal food production teams. They have, in many places, formed communal electrical production centers. Can you really envision a bunch of new yorkers banding together to start a communal farm in Central Park? If they did, I can virtually gaurantee you that anothr group would kill them and take their food. A capitalist mindset is NOT a good thign if you have to depend on people doing the \"right thing\" in order to survive. Additionally, many places in the third world could make the transition to a mroe sustainable lifestyle simply becuase they are already living low energy consumption lifestyles. \n\n Agreed.\n \n\n I read a report form FEMA a while back that concluded that loss of major utilities (electrical in that case) for two weeks would result in the deaths of over half the American population. Americans do not know where or how to get fresh, drinkable water if it does nto come out of their tap. They do not know how to keep food without refrigeration. Face it. Americans minus their machinery are not survivors.\n\n We saw dramatic confirmation of that during the East Coast blackout a couple of years back.\n \n\n Yea, right. they will lease it to their buddies for rediculously low fees, then their buddies will pump themarket price despite the fact that their operation is essentially being subsidized by the taxpayers. A replay of the oil situation.\n \n\n While I'm a capitalist, I'd shoot the b--tards that allowed sweetheart deals on US owned land.emoticon_xkill \n \n\n It has already been established that we do not have that much money. We simply do not have the funds, or the ability to produce alternatives quickly enough to meet this problem head on. There are several folks out there that agree that we actually passed peak oil last december. Many more have us hitting peak in the next year or two. Most conservative estimate put the price of oil 3 years after meak at between $120 and $160 per barrel. At $110 per barrel, half the world populaiton starves to death and fairly large tracts of productive land go fallow because the cost of production is more than most people on the planet can affrod to pay. It takes 6 calories of HC energy to produce 1 calorie of food in the US. \n \n You might be better off using that land to grow food rather then feed stock for fuel. Of course if you do that, you may also want to invest in some fencing materials, and some small arms...preferably belt fed. Starving people seldom say \"please\" when they see food available.\n\n \n I wonder what the going price for Claymores is on the black market. ;)",

   "I'm not concerned with keeping the whole population fed, only the US'. Altruism be damned. \n\n \n If that is your concern, you may as well give up all hope now. Our food production is more petro intensive than anywhere else on the planet. We are only more petro intensive than Europe by about 5%. Our production is 4x more petro intensive than that of china, 6x that of other asian countries, and nearly 8x more petro intensive than most of S America. \n \n This is one of those places where being a developed nation works against you in a BIG way. We have had the advantage of all the latest and greatest techno gizmos and gadgets, and as our society has evolved, it has been able to do so in an entirely unsustainable manner. Our population is primarily clustered in urban centers, with massive suburban spraw using up all the surrounding farmland. Using Kansas City for an example (because it is the example I know best), with oil at $110 per barrel, you can only produce enough food within a cost effective transport radius to feed about 40% of the population. This is KANSAS CITY we are talking about, surrounded by some fo the richest farm land in the nation and with relatively minimal urban sprawl. Can you imagin what those numbers would be like for New York? Even a mass exdus to the country is not a winning strategy because the fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides that we use to grow our food are all petro based, and they travel great distances. Most fertilizers require at elast 11 steps for production and trravel nearly 2000 miles befroe they get to the store shelf. \n \n Organic food production is no longer a choice in much of the country. It used to be that most farmland was broken up into homesteads, with fence rows and some natural cover. This natural cover provided habitat for birds and other animals that helped control the insect population. Most of that natural cover has been bulldozed over the last 40 years. Instead of an average unobstructed plot size of 85 acres, we have an average unobstructed plot size of 1200 acres. It would take 30 years to put that habitat back, and for animal populatiosn to increase to needed levels. Then, after you finally have some natural control for your bug problems, you are still trying to produce that food with fertilizers that cost 10-20x what they do today, using a tractor that burns through a lot of gas, and when you produce your crop, the transport costs make it a waste of time to send it to market, becuse nobody can afford it. \n \n \nI'm well aware that ETOH is an energy loser on a large scale, but I was only talking about personal use. Whatever I didn't burn, I could drink to forget about what it was like in the \" good ole days\". emoticon_xhoho \n\n \n Not any more. Now 30,000 barrels is the size that give you the best EROI. Of course it also produces thousands of gallons of waste, and a hell of a lot of that is sulphuric acid. You can' have everything.\n \n As for me, if things really are that bad, I'm drinking it. By that point there would really be nowhere good left to go. Sit on the porch. Get hammered.\n \n \nFrance is better off from an electricity standpoint, but that's about the extent of it.

But, with an increase in the cost of ETOH, they're back to 90+% gasoline. \n\n \n for the most part I agree here, with one excpetion...China. Even if we got knocked back into teh stone age tomorrow, China would be ok because 60% of their population is already living in the stone age. The majority of their agricultural industry still involves hitching up a team of oxen. \n \n \nWhile I'm a capitalist, I'd shoot the b--tards that allowed sweetheart deals on US owned land.emoticon_xkill \n\n \n There is a difference between capitalism and theft.",

Scarcity and uniqueness is what created the value. I remember people calling junk yards to take them away for dismantling after sitting for years.

In 1981 I bought two complete Ford 429SCJ engines, pristine, for $250/ea. Within ten years the heads alone were worth $4k, blocks $3k. Police cars with 429CJs, C6 performance servo and clutch pack transmissions, etc. and 9\" differentials having 31-spline straight axles were $500 for the entire car.
