   "Just got through looking at \"Wall Street\" that was made back in 1987. Most here know the story of the insider trading and stock manipulation. But one line caught my ear and that was when Gordon Gecko got up before the stockholders of a company he was trying to buy out and in his speech to the stock holders was extolling the virtues of \"greed\" and preceded this by declaring that our nation was on the verge of disaster with the twin disasters of the trade deficit and fiscal deficit and that our industrial infrastructure was melting away.\n \n My point, which should be obvious, is that even two decades ago we were being told by some that the end was near. Somehow the end never comes. This goes to the argument I have made and that is that capital inflows balance out the trade deficits and the fiscal deficits are well within our GDP percentages. In other words, this \"problem\" is no problem at all and the Fed which naturally doesn't like deficits isn't all that concerned or they would rachet up the interest rates to cool the economy or tame inflation; all of which would play a part in the trade deficit as we would have less money to spend. The fiscal deficit would, however, grow because tax revenues would drop with a lower GDP as the economy cooled down.\n \n I first started hearing about the trade deficit about four decades ago. It was declared a major problem and ruin was right around the corner. All I want to know is when does it arrive? That's when I want to get out of Dodge.",

When I first heard about the \"trade deficit\" it was like $30 billion or so. That's a mere drop in the bucket, compared to today. But as one of the posts that I did sometime ago the \"capital inflows\" balance out the \"trade deficit\" almost entirely. Even if the Chinese stopped accepting U.S. dollars, they would essentially become worthless and they could use them to keep warm with. That's not going to happen. So they will recycle it back into the United States.\n \n We used to hear how \"Japan Inc.\" was going to bankrupt the U.S. but they had a decade long recession and their national debt to GDP is 170% to our middle of the road 65%. Obviously that didn't happen. \n \n I would also argue that it is we who have the upper hand and I believe this absolutely. The Chinese are the ones who cannot give up the U.S. market. We can, however, give up the Chinese market and purchase our goods from other sources, such as India, Indonesia or any one of other emerging economies. I even have two pairs of overalls and they are made in of all places -- Russia. The Japanese and German automakers didn't invest all of that capital into the U.S. economy because we were going down the tubes. That would be completely stupid. It's because they know we have a stable economy and government and it is the best place to put their money. The outflows of money to other nations in Europe is more a function of their higher interest rates than the value of the dollar. If, for example, our interest rates doubled overnight, the boatloads of dollars flowing back into the United States would be incredible. \n \n In the end the trade deficit is self-correcting. The dollar may depreciate to a lower level but that makes our exports more competitive (and our exports have grown substantially). If the dollar depreciates substantially, where are the major airlines likely to purchase their new airliners; here or in Europe. Who would pay double for the same thing? \n \n The Fed has no interest in manipulating figures. They are not carrying the administration's water. They'll do what they have to do to keep our economy humming along and our interest rates as low as possible to keep inflation under control. Right now we are doing fine. They could, in theory, raise interest rates so high that the economy would come to a screeching halt and then the interest rates would fall preciptiously. At some point they might even go to zero as they did in Japan. And it almost got to the point there where they went into deflation which is far, far more dangerous than inflation, since the interest rate can't go below zero %. It's the \"real\" interest rate that is important. If the inflation rate is 2% and the fed rate is say 5%, the \"real rate\" is 3% or so. In Japan, when they were on the verge of deflation, if the interest rate was already zero % and if the economy declined 5%, the \"real\" interest rate would have been 5% or a full 2% greater than our interest rate. That's when the economy truly tanks. We have none of that here in the United States and there are no signs that anything more than a soft landing may be in store for us as we slow the economy down. The stock markets know this and they reflect this in the stock values. No one is going to invest in an economy if they believe it is going to founder on the rocky shore ahead.\n \n Let's stop all this unnecessary doom and gloom and reflect on the good fortune we find ourselves. That would be a refreshing change.",

Picking and choosing is the government method of expressing economic conditions, as gamehuis and others have pointed out.\n\n \n I didn't quote any of Friedman's theories but I think he had it about right. All of this other stuff you put in here just obfuscates the basic facts of economics 101. Which is: a growing economy typically leads to inflation if it becomes overheated which leads to increased interest rates. Conversely, a declining economy leads to a lessening of inflationary pressures which will lead to declining interest rates. In extreme cases, the \"Pump will be primed\" to \"jumpstart\" the economy to get it back up and running. Ideally, the Fed will attempt to balance all of the factors to keep the economy running at a sustainable rate that is mostly inflation free. It is difficult but not impossible. In recent years we have had some of the longest peacetime expansions in our history. So we're getting better at it. But it is an inexact science.\n \n This is not exactly rocket science to use a common cliche. It is usually covered in the first semester of Econ 101.\n ===========================================================\n This is a pretty good and simple to understand discussion of the \"trade deficit.\"\n \n Dear Dr. Dollar:\n Can you explain what trade deficits are? Who owes what to whom or is it just an accounting device?\n --Jack Miller, Indianapolis, Ind.\n \n I see that the United States has had a negative international trade balance for years. What happens to those dollars we've sent overseas?\n --Bill Clark, Chillicothe, Ohio\n \n If Americans collectively import more goods and services from foreigners than we export, we are said to have a trade deficit. Paying for the things we import accounts for most of the flow of dollars out of the United States. However, money flows out of the country for other reasons as well. The U.S. government provides foreign aid and supports overseas military bases; immigrants to the United States send dollars back to their families; foreigners who own U.S. businesses or financial assets take income out of the country. \n \n When these factors are added to the trade deficit, the net outflow of dollars is called the current account deficit. In 2002, the U.S. trade deficit amounted to $418 billion, and the current account deficit totaled $480 billion. Data for 2003 is not yet available, but preliminary reports indicate the current account deficit will be at least $550 billion. \n \n Once the dollars leave the country, three things can happen...\n \n (snip)\n \n http://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/2004/0304dollar.html",

Money is like any other commodity. The more of it the less it is worth and the less of it the more it is worth. \n \n The actual printing of money should lie roughly in line with the expansion of the economy. For example, the amount of money that existed in the economy of the emerging United States with a population of 4 million and an economy that was a minor fraction of today's economy would be much less than what must exist today to support today's economy. If a country merely just ramps up the printing presses and there is no increase in output by the nation, then obviously that will lead to massive inflation and one gets back to the \"era of warm beer\" that existed in post WWI Germany when people would order several beers at one time because they knew when the second and third rounds would be ordered that the price would have risen. People had to have wheelbarrows of cash to buy a loaf of bread. This is essentially what is going on today in Zimbabwe with a collapsed economy.",

And inflation doesn't apply across the board. The television I purchased in 1980 costs 25% of what I paid last year. Factoring in inflation I probably paid about 1/6 or less of what I paid in 1980. The cost of gasoline is often cited as being high priced but in inflation adjusted numbers the high water mark was in 1981. Virtually everyone's income has increased substantially since then. I know mine has. Check this out. If you will notice, the worst years of our economy were during periods of DEFLATION; especially during the Great Depression. But the second worst period was during the Carter years when inflation got out of control.\n \n http://woodrow.mpls.frb.fed.us/Research/data/us/calc/hist1913.cfm\n \n The Fed could bring the inflation rate to 0% if they wanted to but it would bring our economy to a screeching halt. Ideally, we would probably want it to be between 1 and 2%; about 1.5% would be about right. If a person would invest in a CD paying say 4% (a low figure), the real return would be 2.5%. Investing in the stock market, of course, would yield much higher returns such as over 500% in \"Google\" which is now selling for $473 a share after an IPO of about $85.\n \n http://www.smartmoney.com/eqsnaps/index.cfm?story=snapshot&symbol=GOOG",

Why am I wrong?\n\n \n No institution staffed by political appointees can ever be insulated from politics. This is doublethink if ever it existed. \n \n \nDoes the Fed actually print the money? I thought they essentially controlled the money supply through interest rate adjustments. \n\n \n This is a serious misconception held by most americans. The Fed does not just control interest rates to control the money supply. They also monetarize government bonds. That is where the real money creation ability of the fed lies. In interest rates, they lower the demand for loans, which slows the creation of fiat currency, which leads to less money in circulation (most of our money now is electronic, not paper). \n \n M$ included the monetarization of government bonds, which is, IMO, why they stopped publishing it. Private numbers folks are still providing the M4 numbers, and M4 is growing at an astonishing pace. There are 2 ways the feds can monetarize a government bond. The first is when a member bank puts one on deposit. That member bank deposits the bond, and the fed puts the value of the bond in their account. That is not such a big deal, since basically they are using the bond for collateral. The second way, however, IS a big deal and is part of what M4 measured.

Until I see some reputable economist actually produce a viable argument that the sky is falling I am going with what the Fed is saying about the economy. I don't spend a lot of time listening to the crackpots who are always making news about the coming end of civilization. They're never right so why should we believe them now?\n\n \n What the fed has been saying about the economy is that our biggest oncern is inflation, and that slower growth has not taken the edge off of inflation....translation....the fed is saying \"stagflation\".\n \n You have made this \"reputable economist\" demand before, and I provided you with a half dozen. then you demanded statements from eitehr greenspan or bernanke...I provided you a link to greenspans statements to the russian oil federation where he openly stated that putting russian oil money in dollars was foolish because it was common knowledge that the dollar was expected to experience massive inflationary pressure.\n \n You stopped ebing honest about the economy a long time ago.

   "No institution staffed by political appointees can ever be insulated from politics. This is doublethink if ever it existed. \n \n This is a serious misconception held by most americans. The Fed does not just control interest rates to control the money supply. They also monetarize government bonds. That is where the real money creation ability of the fed lies. In interest rates, they lower the demand for loans, which slows the creation of fiat currency, which leads to less money in circulation (most of our money now is electronic, not paper). \n \n M$ included the monetarization of government bonds, which is, IMO, why they stopped publishing it. Private numbers folks are still providing the M4 numbers, and M4 is growing at an astonishing pace. There are 2 ways the feds can monetarize a government bond. The first is when a member bank puts one on deposit. That member bank deposits the bond, and the fed puts the value of the bond in their account. That is not such a big deal, since basically they are using the bond for collateral. The second way, however, IS a big deal and is part of what M4 measured. The second way the fed monetarizes bonds is that the government hands them a bond, and the fed cashes it. No repayment is ever made on these bonds.

The LAST thing you want to see is any reputable economist saying things that you don't want to hear. Paul Volker has on many occasions predicted an economic crash for the US. Is volker not reputable??\n\n \n Yes, Volker is credible but he was involved with the Fed many years ago. There is no particular reason that I know of that establishes he is more right than Greenspan or Bernanke. \n \n Let's cut through the rhetoric here. There are thousands upon thousands of economists of all political persuasions who look at these numbers all the time. If we were on the precipice a good number of them would be screaming from the rooftops to do something. They are not there. What you are essentially saying is that there is this huge conspiracy of all of these economists who are keeping the truth from the rest of us peons. I just don't buy that argument.\n \n I bolded the above. We are not in disagreement. This is precisely what I have been saying. The raising of interest rates is what slows the demand for loans which depresses the creation of money. If there is less money in circulation then it increases in value like any other commodity, which money is, as you well know. Your argument seems to rest on the bond issue. But if the interest on the bonds is not enticing enough, it follows there will be less demand for those bonds. Nothing mysterious there. Europe in particular has been raising their interest rates making them more competitive for investors. That would logically depress the competitiveness of our bonds would it not?\n \n We are in no way shape or form like Argentina, Russia or Germany way. That's just ludicrous to claim we are. Let's keep some reality in this discussion.",

Agency officials told us that they had concluded on their own that the original draft included no classified material, but that they had to bow to the White House.\n \n Indeed, the deleted portions of the original draft reveal no classified material. These passages go into aspects of American-Iranian relations during the Bush administration's first term that have been publicly discussed by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice; former Secretary of State Colin Powell; former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage; a former State Department policy planning director, Richard Haass; and a former special envoy to Afghanistan, James Dobbins. \n\n \n The NYT, apparently ###### about the situation, then published the report WITH THE BLACKOUTS so people could see how heavy handed the Bush administration is being with their power to control what our \"free\" press writes.
