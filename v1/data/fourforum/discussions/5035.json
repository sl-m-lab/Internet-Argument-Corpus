You are assuming that evolution has to behave in a manner that makes sense to you. It doesn't- DNA is a chemical structure, and like many other chemicals it is synthesised, the difference here being a refinery of time and environmental conditions.\n \n \nThat is a scientific observation, a law of nature.Give me one example in the history of the Universe of matter creating information.\n\n \n Still stuck up on this \"information\" term I see. Lets think of it this way, can we find examples of chemical structures being formed in the universe? off course we can- you seem to be blinded by DNA because it happens to function as a coding chemical for life.\n \n \nIf you cannot then evolution is falsified because information cannot evolve it has to come from a mind.\n\n \n As we are playing the falsification game, prove that statement.

Evolution (macro and micro) was not postulated to make life conform to an atheistic world-view. That is ridiculous. It was developed to explain the diversity and organization we see in the life on this planet. There were no preconcieved notions. Only questions. It is the creationist that is guilty of this, starting with the premise that the Bible is correct and interpreting evidence to fit the theory. \n \n 2. Matter creating information: matter behaving according to a set of rules (physics) will tend to organize itself in certain ways. On a large scale this allows things like galaxies and solar systems to form. On a small scale, this can lead to a molecule forming that is able to duplicate itself. Is this new information? That depends on your definition, but it is without a doubt order arising from chaos, something which you and many creationists don't seem to think is possible. \n \n 3. To specifically address (what seems to be) your concern about DNA creating new information, you would do well to look into some of the current research on transposons, mobile bits of DNA that can jump from chromosome to chromosome, creating novel genes and, as you would call it, new information.\n \n 4. For crying out loud, please learn to use the quotes tool the editor gives you. Many of us are willing to put up with grammar, spelling and even quoting mistakes, but you have had more than enough time to learn to use these tools and we are growing very tired of having to search through your posts to figure out what you're quoting and what you're saying yourself.",
