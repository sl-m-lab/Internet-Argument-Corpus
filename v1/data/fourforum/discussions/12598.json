   "A beauty of a controversy is brewing - thanks to Miss USA.\n \n At Sunday night's competition, gay activist and celebrity blogger Perez Hilton had a question for Miss California about same-sex marriage.\n \n But the outcome wasn't pretty.\n \n \"Do you think every state should follow suit? Why or why not?\" asked the \"out\" and outspoken Hilton, who was a Miss USA judge.\n \n Miss California, Carrie Prejean, decided to tell Hilton what she really felt about same-sex marriage, and it might have cost her the Miss USA crown.\n \n \"You know what, in my country, and in my family, I think that I believe that a marriage should be between a man and a woman - no offense to anybody out there,\" she said. \"But that's how I was raised. And that's how I think that it should be between a man and a woman. Thank you.\"\n \n Hilton reacted angrily after the show, posting a video blog on his Web site.\n \n \"I am so disappointed in Miss California representing my country,\" he said. \"Not because I believe in gay marriage, but she doesn't inspire and she doesn't unite.\"\n \n ....\n Hilton stresses that she shouldn't have lied at all, but that she should have used a different approach that wasn't insensitive.\n \n \"There were various other ways she could have answered that question, and still stayed true to herself without alienating millions of people,\" he said.\n \n Hilton gave an example of how he thought she should have handled the question.\n \n \"A very simple way she could have answered it is, 'as a future Miss USA, it is my job not to be a politician, but to be someone who represents and inspires the women and the troops, and I think it's great that the states get to decide for themselves.'\n \n \"Something like that, she would not have had to insert her own personal politics into it,\" he said. \"And I'm not saying it's bad to insert your own personal politics. But you have to answer the question as Miss USA, not as Carrie Prejean.\" \n\n Perez Hilton Not A Fan Of Miss Calif. - CBS News\n \n It is like a job interview.\n \n If somebody had come up and said they felt segregation was their \"family values\", it would cost them.",

   "Roland S. Martin - \"A lot of folks are always saying they like to keep it real, that they want authenticity and straight talk. Yet when someone actually does it, there is hell to pay.\n \n Welcome to the world of Miss California, Carrie Prejean, who, since she answered a question regarding same-sex marriage in Sunday's Miss USA pageant, has been savagely attacked by those who oppose what she had to say.\n \n Leading the burn-her-at-the-stake parade is media opportunist Perez Hilton, the self-described gossip queen, and the individual who kick-started this controversy by asking the initial question as to whether the issue of same-sex marriage should be left up to the states.\n \n It seems that Hilton, who is gay, was none too pleased that Prejean chose to actually give her personal opinion on the issue, and ripped her on his blog after the show, using crude obscenities as he continued to attack her at every turn on his media blitz.\n \n Hey, Hilton, from a real journalist to a wanna-be who traffics in gossip: Never ask a question if you're unprepared for the answer!\n \n Frankly, this whole story is pretty stupid. Isn't the whole point of asking a question to get someone's true feelings, rather than the plastic and superficial answers we are all used to receiving?\n \n Sure, Prejean could have gone the safe route and given one of those answers that reveal nothing and is hard to decipher -- you know, the ones politicians give all the time -- but no! She actually gave her real opinion, and is now being torn to shreds for it.\n \n She opposes same-sex marriage. OK, fine. So what if she had said, \"Hey, I'm in full support of same-sex marriage.\" Would she now be celebrated on gay-focused blogs, magazines and Web sites? Would her detractors actually be saying how open she is and that she's a great person?\n \n Same-sex marriage is undoubtedly a hot button issue. And being from California, the site of Proposition 8, the ballot initiative that voters approved outlawing same-sex marriage, Prejean has surely had to hear the debate go back and forth. But her remark isn't outside the mainstream. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll shows that 55 percent of Americans are against same-sex marriage, and Proposition 8 did pass in her state 52-48 percent. \n \n What's interesting about this is that many of the same folks who are slamming her for her remark voted for President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, who both have the same belief: that marriage should be between a man and a woman.\n \n Even Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made it clear that she has the same view, and it was her husband, President Bill Clinton, who signed the In Defense of Marriage Act, the federal law that forbids states from having to recognize gay marriage in other states.\n \n In other words, four of the biggest liberals in the country have the same belief as Prejean, but a beauty pageant winner is being torn to shreds. Hello, hypocrisy!\n \n Those who criticize Prejean have the same right as she does to express their viewpoints. But enough with all the political correctness, where someone says she should have danced around the issue, smiled and move on. iReport.com: 'Thank you, California!'\n \n At the end of the day, we all have to be true to ourselves. Whether it's a gay gossip writer who favors same-sex marriage or a heterosexual woman who is against same-sex marriage. The day we condemn folks for speaking honestly is the day we become a bland society.\n \n Maybe we're already there.\"\n \n Commentary: Miss California, thanks for being honest - CNN.com",

Here are the results of googling her name< Carrie Prejean - Google Search \n \n But now, since this dangerous monster dared to give her opinion on homosexual marriage, the full force of the leftists politics of personal destruction kicks into high gear and will remain their until they believe they have effectively neutralized any possible impact her one and only socially relevant opinion might have on public opinion. It also serves as a warning to anyone else who might get access to a pubilc podium that they dare not oppose these reprobates version of political correctness or else the same powers will focus all of their efforts on destroying them also.\n \n Win through intimidation at all cost is the mantra of these insecure hate mongers who dare to call anyone who disagrees with them bigots when everything this militant community represents is precisely what they accuse others of.

   "Oh boo freakin hoo Archie. No one really gives a damn. Perez is an over dramaitc queen who baited a bimbo. And she was obviously too dumb to even give a solid answer! She believes in opposite marriage umm ok? lol. \n\n \n And yet there has been no public claims by the homosexual community defending her honest answer to an obvious politically motivated question. It doesn't really matter how truthfully you define what Hilton represents here if you continue to insult and excoriate Prejean with the insulting lies which you are also continuing to tell. \n \n \nto be honest this thing has really been blown so out of context. Point is they shouldn't ask these people with IQ's that of chimps real world questions. Jsut stick to world peace questions and show off your huge fake breats and be a piece of meat for us all to oogle at....\n\n \n See what I mean? How pompous, condescending and demeaning of you as you insult her intelligence like this. Rather than defend her right to give an honest answer to that question.\n \n \nAnd for the record Perez does not represent the gay community. He's an overblown winded queen who clearly gave same sex marriage opponents more ammo to fire at us....\n\n \n Sure he does represent the homosexual community. That is apparent in almost every video blog he posts. It is also obvious since that one question and his response in his video blog has received national attention and has NOT been excoriated by the MSM like this formerly unknown beauty queen has been. So your excuses are nothing more than self serving apologetics with no basis in fact at all. Not in the real world anyway. But I would expect nothing more from you. emoticon_frazzled",

   "WOW, what blind tunnel vision you have. The Right has attempted to defend and shield her from the unfair attacks from the Left. Can't you see that had these unfair attacks never taken place for her just giving an honest answer to a political question, the Right never would have had to defend her. But you are completely blind to that fact, huh!\n\n \"attacks from the left\"??? emoticon_frazzled\n She was attacked BY ONE BLOGGER. Hilton.\n Other people have voiced disagreement with her position, but that isn't an \"unfair attack\".\n \n The right has attempted to portray her as a victim of \"the left\", when the truth is that ONE BLOGGER has attacked her viciously, and \"the left\" has typically admitted that this ONE BLOGGER was out of line... emoticon_angry\n \n \n \nAnd rightfully so! But only after the national excoriation from the pro-gay Left. And Hilton is not alone as the link I posted proves.\n\n What a thorough line of b.s.!\n Your link was just a link to a GOOGLE SEARCH of Hilton.\n THAT IS IT!\n Most of those items were NEWS items talking about PEREZ (one guy) had attacked Prejean.\n It is RIDICULOUSLY DISHONEST of you (but typical Archie) to pretend that just GOOGLING her name shows how \"attacked\" she was...\n \n \n \nThe entire homosexual and Liberal community has attacked her from every possible angle en-masse which your posting the story of some modeling pictures proves.\n\n And there we go with THIS b.s.\n Prejean did something WRONG, and when others point it out you claim that's an \"attack\"???\n If only you had similar standards FOR YOURSELF, but whenever you take a similar approach towards homosexuality you defend your actions.\n \n And it wasn't \"some modeling\" picture.\n Have you even SEEN this picture???\n \n \n \nThe problem is that Prejean did an ad layout. Not a nude layout.\n\n NO!\n It was NOT \"an ad layout\". It was a self-promotional shot. It never appeared in any ad, nor was it intended to.\n Furthermore, I doubt any \"ad\" would have accepted that shot CAUSE SHE WAS 17 doing semi-nude work.\n \n And no. It wasn't \"nude\". She had panties on, BUT NO TOP.\n \n Janet Jackson was completely clothed except for one exposed breast, and conservatives scream and yell!\n Prejean wears NOTHING BUT PANTIES, and Archie tries to pretend it's an \"ad layout\".. emoticon_emb\n \n \n \nAnd how judgmental and hypocritical are you for attacking her for an underwear ad when you have boldly stated that you endorse porn as a right and good thing. \n\n 1) Archie, she was 17. I don't get why you just pretend that's okay.\n 2) Archie, archie, archie...\n What you don't seem to get is that it is NOT MY VALUES which are being exhorted here.\n It is FAMILY values.\n A better question would by why people like you have such a problem with porn, but then TURN THE OTHER WAY when one of your own is exposed???\n 3) She LIED to the Pageant group.\n \n 4) Archie, here's where I stand on the picture.\n If she had done it at 21, and hadn't lied about it to anybody, and hadn't presumed to throw out her values to limit other people's lives, I wouldn't have a problem with it.\n \n \n \nPlease foundit, let your sarcasm at least be based in reason and common sense, ok?\n\n It is.\n But like many things, it just goes flying over your head.\n \n The thing you can't seem to grasp is that this would be a VIOLATION OF PAGEANT RULES REGARDLESS of how she had answered that question. emoticon_xagree\n But people like you are caught up in your \"victimhood\" delusion, so you ignore that...\n \n \n \nSo now it goes from semi nude above to virtually pornographic a couple of paragraphs later?\n\n emoticon_frazzled\n Quite frankly, I see the two as almost synonymous.\n And Archie, do you know what \"semi-nude\" means in the first place???\n She was ONLY WEARING PANTIES. No top clothing.\n And they SHOWED from her thighs up to the top of her head.\n \n I am really curious how the network TV shows are going to handle this. I don't think this picture is \"safe\" for TV. I think it would violate the television censors.\n \n \n \nAnd this is your version of an objective and truthful description of what her modeling photo represents? Here is the photo in question foundit, is this virtual pornography to one who embraces porn as right and good? Carrie Prejean's New Controversial Pictures | Twirlit\n\n Archie, I am really shocked that you posted that on this message board.\n I didn't want to post it, cause I really did NOT think it was something that should be posted on this message board.\n \n Just because I think \"porn\" is okay doesn't mean I want it paraded out in public view. There are NO AGE FILTERS required for this site.\n If a teacher saw a student with a picture like this, I would expect the teacher to confiscate it.\n \n And here you are just posting it out in the open.\n I swear. The depraved nature of the anti-gay where they lose their mind and morals in trying to attack gays at the drop of the hat...\n \n \n \nI repeat my original post so the message of your sides hypocrisy isn't lost on the objective observer.\n\n I really don't get why you pull that junk.\n You're basically spamming the board with stuff THAT WAS ALREADY ADDRESSED.\n \n An \"objective observer\" can just go back a couple posts and RE-READ what you had said there, instead you posting the same junk over and over and over again, ad nausieum.",

In the case of Miss California Carrie Prejean, the answer may lie in an ugly divorce that may have cemented her views on gay relationships.\n \n Carrie's parents filed for divorce in 1988 and the divorce and custody fights went on for more than a decade -- it was a divorce filled with homosexual allegations hurled by both sides.\n \n In one of the docs, Carrie's dad describes a confrontation he had with her mom in 1996, in which he recounts an argument in a restaurant parking lot, where \"Ms. Prejean accused me, in front of our daughter, of homosexuality.\"\n \n The papers also quote a court-appointed doctor who said \"The mother questioned [within hearing of the girls] whether [her father] was a homosexual or had a homosexual roommate.\"\n \n Carrie's mom says the \"gay\" allegations went both ways. In court papers dated May 16, 2000, a report from the court-appointed counselor says \"The mother also alleges the father told the girls their stepfather was gay, that all men with mustaches are gay.\" The father's response: \"The father acknowledges talking with the girls about the stepfather's brother being gay, not the stepfather.\"\n \n Also in the docs -- a handwritten letter from Carrie's older sister, in which she recounts a weekend stay with her dad: \"One time my sister & I went in the hallway of my dad's apartment, & his roommate's door was open all the way & we saw [the roommate] in bed with another man.

She shot a print ad April 28 slamming Proposition 8, the initiative that bans gay marriage in California.\n \n On Tuesday, pageant owner Donald Trump announced Prejean would keep her crown despite failing to reveal she had posed in her underwear as a teenager.\n \n (Prejean said the pictures were leaked to humiliate her because of her anti-gay marriage views, calling it a \"vicious and mean-spirited\" attacks. Even more photos hit the web before Trump's press conference Tuesday morning.)Shanna Moakler Resigns as Miss California Pageant Director - omg! news on Yahoo!\n \n So now we see that the Pageant Director herself has been aligned against Prejean and must have actively worked to get her dethroned from her title. Otherwise she wouldn't be resigning now in anger that she didn't get her way. So to infer that the attempted public crucifixion of this girl wasn't a concerted effort from every possible angle to destroy her by is disingenuous at best and completely dishonest at worst.",

I wouldn't expect anything more...\n\n Way to avoid my point.\n SEMI-nude.\n Semi=somewhat/partially.\n nude=not covered by clothing.\n Seminude=partially not covered by clothing=bathing suit.\n or...\n Seminude=partially not covered by clothing=ankles exposed.\n \n \n \nDo you believe that the middle picture is partially nude/semi-nude? If you do, then how is a bathing suit NOT seminude?\n\n You have again reached a stage where there is no point arguing with you. Your claims are denied by routine logic of reality. It would be like trying to refute you saying the sky is green, completely unnecessary.\n \n The beauty pageant busted Prejean for lying on her questionnaire about taking nude or semi-nude photos.\n By your logic, Prejean should have said \"Yes\" just for doing a swim-suit.\n By your logic, EVERY SINGLE CONTESTANT who has ever done swim-suit photos should answer yes.\n \n Your standard is absurd and not worth refuting, cause it's obviously false.\n \n \n \nWho are you arguing against?\n\n I am not arguing against anybody.\n I am pointing out problems with the situation that the neo-con anti-gay agenda-ists IGNORE just because they've got their newest favorite poster child who they don't want to criticize...\n \n \n \nNone of that relates to the actual arguments the religious right is making: \n 1. The pictures should never have been released to the public. \n\n Considering Prejean is ultimately responsible for those photos, and that she released these photos as part of her advertising her \"model\" career...\n She is the one who has the ultimate blame.\n \n \n \n2. The question should never have been asked with a biased judge (Imagine John C Calhoun as a judge over a Martin Luther King Jr. trial). \n 3. Perez should have never been a judge. \n\n Hilton should never have been on that panel.\n You can thank \"Donald\" for that nonsense...\n \n \n \n4. Because she has a conservative opinion, the media is targeting her.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n The media is targeting her cause she's a public figure in the news.\n The media investigates people who are in the news. That's what they do. \n \n \n And one of my points is some of the arguments that the religious right IS NOT making.\n Note, NO COMMENT on whether or not it was improper for her to have those pictures taken under the age of 17. NO COMMENT as to the improper nature of those photos. NO COMMENT as to her lying about those photos...\n emoticon_frazzled",
