   "\"U.S. exports rose 3.0 percent to a record $106.4 billion,\"\n \n We must be making something that the rest of the world wants. If Europe would come out of its recession that would also push our exports up. If Europeans have no money and/or stuffing it under the mattresses it will not be reflected in our export figures. It also holds down tourism. Meanwhile the chicken littles here will tell us that we are going to hell in a handbasket just like they have been doing for 35 years. \n ======================\n \n Industry\n \n Trade gap widens less than expected\n \n Friday June 10, 9:07 AM EDT\n \n By Doug Palmer\n \n WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit widened less than expected in April to $57.0 billion, as both exports and imports set records, the Commerce Department said on Friday in a report boding well for U.S. economic growth.\n \n The monthly trade gap expanded 6.3 percent from March, but was below the median forecast of $58 billion from a group of 35 economists surveyed before the report.\n \n The Commerce Department also lowered its estimate of the March trade gap to $53.6 billion, from $55.0 previously.\n \n The better-than-expected figures for both March and April gave a boost to stock futures and pushed the dollar higher.\n \n \"The trade numbers are a little more moderate. The rate of deterioration is slowing. That's good news for the economy. It's being less of a drag,\" said Dana Johnson, chief economist with Comerica Bank in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n \n Despite the monthly improvement, the deficit remained on track to surpass last year's record of $618 billion.\n \n The gap for the first four months of the year was up 22 percent from the same period in 2004.\n \n Surging oil prices helped push overall imports up 4.1 percent from March to a record $163.4 billion, the largest monthly increase since November 2002. Imports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) were a record $9.8 billion. The average price for imported oil in April was a record $44.76 per barrel.\n \n U.S. exports rose 3.0 percent to a record $106.4 billion, aided by an increase in exports of civilian aircraft and other capital goods. Shipments to China and South and Central America also set records at $3.4 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively.\n \n The politically sensitive trade gap with China widened 14.0 percent in April to $14.7 billion, despite the record U.S. exports to that country.\n \n Imports of clothing and textiles from China jumped 11.1 percent in April, after falling more than 20 percent in March. The increase helped boost overall imports from China to $18.1 billion, up 11.8 percent from the previous month.\n \n China's shipments of clothing and other textile products totaled $7.42 billion for the first four months of 2005, up 51.7 percent from the same period last year. The surge -- which follows the end of a global quota system on Jan. 1 -- has prompted the Bush administration to impose emergency import curbs on some Chinese clothing products.\n \n U.S. imports of clothing and textiles from around the world have increased only 10.2 percent in the first four months of 2005, as the increase from China has been offset by a drop off in shipment from other suppliers.\n \n Meanwhile, a second government report showed U.S. import prices fell a much larger-than-expected 1.3 percent last month, suggesting even less inflation pressure from the trade sector than analysts have thought.\n \n It was the first decline since December, as prices for petroleum and industrial supply imports dropped sharply.\n \n Stripping out the impact of a 6.5 percent plunge in petroleum import prices, the cost for imported goods slipped 0.3 percent, the Labor Department said.\n \n The drop in nonpetroleum import prices was the first since October and the largest since August 2003.\n \n http://finance.myway.com/ht/nw/bus/20050610/hlm_bus-n10417236.html",

If a trade deficit is created because of the imporatation of goods that will eventually be income producing it is a good trade deficit. If the deficit is for basic consumables then it is a bad trade deficit\n\n \n But that was 25 years ago. He took office in 1980. We are still standing and our economy is larger and more dynamic than ever. \n \n Interesting analogy. But let's examine this a little and puzzle it out. Let's use China for example. I don't know offhand what the trade deficit is with them but let's assume it is $100 billion a year. They in turn import 1/3 of that from us. So we are $67 billion in the hole. That's sounds terrible but all of those goods are enriching our lives and our standard of living has increased still further than if we were paying twice or more from elsewhere. That's one element.\n \n The second part is that we do export to China. They in turn purchase for example airliners from us. (That's the most conspicuous of the examples I can think of.) Say $20 billion is for that. That's $20 billion injected into the economy that wouldn't otherwise be there. That employs a lot of Boeing employees and they in turn use their high pay to spend in the local economy. As most people know from Econ 101, every dollar spent equals about $5 in spending as it is spent at the grocer, the baker and the candle stick maker. So instead of $20 billion there is about $100 billion in total economic activity. I call that \"wealth.\" What do you call it?\n \n The bottom line is that all of the American consumers have more wealth; more material goods and a higher living than they would otherwise have. Additionally, we do have trade that reverberates throughout the entire economy. At worse it is a wash.\n \n Over time the trade imbalance will even out. At some point the Chinese and Indian standard of living will increase and they will take their place on the world stage as affluent consumers. There may at some point come a time when they are importing American made goods. Certainly they are having to import intellectual property such as software from Microsoft and the like. That's an area that we need to tighten down. The counterfeiting of software and other items like DVDs is money that would otherwise flow back to the U.S. On that score I would fault the Bush administration. They should demand that the WTO agreements are adhered to in its entirety.",

In California? That doesn't represent middle America where I live at. \n \n Here is a real simple test. Everyone must have a house to live in. That's a given. We can rent or we can own. The rental prices are $x.xx per month. If one can buy that same house for about the same amount per month (as is more likely than not), how do they lose? They live there and build equity. It is in their interest to put as little as possible into the house and use their money for other investments. If they would rent, all they have are rent receipts. The home owner is almost always going to come out ahead. The interest rates are extremely low at about 5.5%. I can remember when they were 18%. The interest is tax deductible and one has the satisfaction and control of owning his own property that a renter does not enjoy.\n \n As to those speculating on homes in California or elsewhere, I have no particular sympathy if they go broke. But for most of us we will do just fine. We came into this world with nothing and we will go out with nothing. All of this business about creating wealth just for the sake of creating wealth is meaningless if all one has is a pile of money to show for it. I prefer to live well while I am here. Use common sense when purchasing and borrowing and one will come out just fine. If a person doesn't feel comfortable taking on debt then by all means don't do so.
