   "Chechen terrorists web site begun to work again from Sweden!!! \n\n \n A link please? I haven`t heard anything about this in the news (though my subscription for DN just expired so I could have missed it).\n \n \n It's well-known that it propagandizes terrorism, Islam in very radical forms, anti-Semitism and last time - the hatred against any European! \n\n \n Hatred and anti-semitism is not enough to shut a web site down. Even though we have laws concerning inflammatory speaches and encouraging violence against minoritees. \"Propagandizing terrorism\" would definatly be a crime. Something tells me that your definition of terrorism is different though...\n \n \n I think that this only one reason for it - Sweden under terrorists' black mail. \n\n \n Hahaha... haha.. You`re not even a Swede, are you? The sole fact that you know how to spell Chechnia in English is a dead give away :p What puzzles me is that you have that name \"vikingtid\" (Wikingtime)? To make it appear like you are from Sweden?\n \n \nAnd I will not surprise if we know in future that Sweden police avert some acts of terrorism. \n\n \n They allready have. But not from fundamentalist muslims or chechens, but from fundamentalist christians. \n \n \n Moreover it was organized by anonymous call with warning to stop any work against terrorists' web site. Im sure that ringing people threatened with series of acts of terrorism!\n\n \n What was \"organised by anonymous calls with warnings\". You don`t make any sense. \n \n \n \n And car explosion near Russia diplomatic representatives is a first notice. Well, Sweden officials fell terrorists black mail and of course now Sweden isn't so secure country as it was earlier!\n\n \n Errr... The aledged terrorist web site hardly makes Sweden any less secure unless the Russian government decide to treat Swedes as they treat Chechens because of it (not very likely though due to our affilation with EU). The bombing of the car outside the russian embassy was a bit scary, but no-one even got wounded. Furthermore, it was clearly directed towards the (murdering) russian government. For all I care, Chechens could organise themselves in Sweden as long as they pay taxes and abide our laws. I`m on their side in their war against Putin. He should pull out his troops and tanks out of Chechnia as soon as possibly anyway. There is no love for Russia in the Swedish heart.\n \n Oh, and I`m amusing that you`re one of those one-post wonders. Trolling every political discussion board on the net with the same post.",
