Galatia was named for the immigrant Gauls from Thrace, who settled here and became its ruling caste in the 3rd century BC, following the Gallic invasion of the Balkans in 279 BC. It has been called the \"Gallia\" of the East, Roman writers calling its inhabitants \"Galli\".\n\n Galatia - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",
