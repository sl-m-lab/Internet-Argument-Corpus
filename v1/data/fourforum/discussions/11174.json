   "There is a basic intelligence test that every candidate running for a national office should be made to take. That test is simply answering the question of knowing what we know today about the war in Iraq - was it a mistake to invade that country? If the candidate claims that the positive value of killing Saddam Hussein and his two sons was worth the cost of:\n [*]4000 American deaths[*]30,000 severe American injuries[*]300,000 American cases of Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome[*]3 trillion dollars added to our staggering national department[*]800,000 Iraqi deaths[*]4 million displaced Iraqi citizens[*]The initiation of open warfare among the 3 Iraqi ethnic sects[*]The elevation of Iran as a dominant force in the Middle East[*]The publicized vulnerability of our armed forces to fight insurgencies[*]The animus of the worldThen they do not have the requisite intelligence or judgment to represent the best interests of our country and should not be elected to public office. John McCain doesen't have the moral courage to admit that the war was a mistake, and attempts to skirt the question (should we have launched the invasion) by using the old \"we are where we are\" argument. The fact is that we got where we are because of the Bush/Cheney lies and the lap dog congressmen like McCain, et.al. who put their personal ambitions and their political party ahead of the best interests of our country. He does not deserve to be elected to the office that he is seeking.",

The only candidate out of the ones that ran who would have made a decent president in terms of the issues was Ron Paul. So at this point a lot of people will be voting just to keep certain candidates OUT of the office rather than truly FOR anyone, and it will just be a big hodge-podge, impossible to predict at this point.",
