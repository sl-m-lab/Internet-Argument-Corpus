   "Muslim Fundamentalists Attack Xtian Female Students in FUT\n \n Daily Champion (Lagos)\n September 22, 2005 \n Posted to the web September 22, 2005 \n Iliya Garba\n Minna \n \n \n \n Academic activities were yesterday disrupted at the Federal University of Technology (FUT) Minna, Niger State as suspected Muslim fundamentalists attacked female Christian students whom they accused of improper dressing.\n \n The fracas which took place at Bosso campus of the university about 9 a.m., saw the armed fundamentalist invading the lecture-theatres and beating up female students they claimed were not properly dressed.\n \n \n An eye witness informed Daily Champion that the fundamentalist numbering about six, dressed in black clothes with red bandage on their heads, disrupted lectures by beating unsuspecting female students with horse-whips for alleged improper dressing.\n \n It was further learnt that the male students on seeing the unprovoked attack on their female colleagues moved to intervene an action that prompted the fundamentalists to use knives to inflict deep cuts on them.\n \n With this development, the university community broke into a free-for-all fight as Muslim students gathered themselves on one side, while the Christians equally mobilized themselves and this led to throwing of missiles at each other by the parties to the conflict.\n \n However, the timely intervention of security agents comprising armed military men and mobile policemen prevented the situation from spreading to the host community.\n \n Governor Abdulkadir Kure who visited the school took time to address the students at the convocation square where he appealed to them to remain calm as measures would be taken to avoid recurrence.\n \n He promised adequate security would be provided in the institution to ensure their safety and fundamental rights, adding that \"those involved in the crisis would be brought to book.\"\n \n The governor who was accompanied by the state Police Commissioner, director of the State Security Services (SSS) and the deputy Governor, Dr. Shem Zagbayi Nuhu ordered the students to go back for their lectures.\n \n \n http://allafrica.com/stories/200509220311.html\n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1339 Muslim Violence Destroying Economy in Southern Thailand \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1336 1,400 years of Islamic Imperialism and Colonialism: The Forbidden History \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1334 London Man 'Shot dead for not being Muslim' \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1326 Islam's Supremacist Past Is Its Present \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1321 Tolerance and Pluralism: Indonesian Muslims call for death for Christians \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1312 The Myth of Islamic Tolerance \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1303 Multiculturalism, Tolerance and Pluralism in Islam \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1170 Symposium: Gender Apartheid and Islam",
