   "I did an interview for a Louisville music magazine. The mag is still unnamed, but the first issure will be out in May.\n \n Rest of interview\n \n 1 What type of music do you create? \n \n My music is a blend of different styles: rock, pop and country with a smattering of blues. My lyrics can be personal, drawn from my own life experiences. Recently, I worked with a number of female vocalists in Louisville and Nashville. It was a challenge to write from the female perspective and fun to go into the studio with a bevy of pretty girls. Much of the material came off as \"feminist rockabilly.\" Veda Radanovich, who performs regularly in Printers Alley in Nashville, recorded 17 songs with me. \"All Roads Lead To You\" and \"The Truth\" are doing very well on the web. Veda resembles Shania Twain, and I tried to create Shania-esque girly images for her. Visuals are important in songwriting, and I strove to dress them in upbeat melodies. \n \n 2 What made you pursue music? \n \n It was in me from the beginning. It was a need. I felt driven to write and record. It sounds crazy, but it was like I had to pursue music to validate myself, to prove that I could succeed at least to a degree in this field. I wanted to go to Nashville from age 19. It took me a decade to get there because of the Army and college. Once in Nashville, I befriended a musician who had a studio in his back yard. We recorded song after song and produced an album called \"Rising From The Ashes.\" I was finally able to express what was in me. The result was like a catharsis. \n \n 3 Who and what are some of your inspirations? \n \n There have been many inspirations across the years. 1950s rock and roll started everything. Little Richard lit a fire under me. From the moment I heard \"Good Golly Miss Molly\" on the radio, I knew I had to buy a copy of that 45. A Little Richard influence pervades my catalog, evident in such songs as \"Hard Earned Love.\" I may have been the first white kid in the east end of Louisville to buy black records. Of course, I was hypnotized by the rock and roll of Elvis Presley and still perform his songs today. I have made two trips to Graceland Mansion in Memphis. In the 1960s and 70s, it was The Beatles and ABBA from Sweden. I traveled to Stockholm and wrote a book about ABBA, parts of which are on my website: JimColyer.com \n \n 4 How would you describe your sound? \n \n I place importance on good production. To me, a quality production is one which stresses the vocals. People want to hear the singer. They want to be able to understand the words. They want to sing along. Instrumental tracks need to support and augment the vocals. Lead guitars and keyboards should stay true to the melody while improvising just enough to create some interest. Drums and bass are the foundation. The other tracks sit on their shoulders. In the end, the record is the thing.",
