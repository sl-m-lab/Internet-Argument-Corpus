   "http://news.yahoo.com/s/po/20060517/co_po/judgestrikesgeorgiagaymarriageban\n \n It seems the reason this admendment was struck down could apply to all state constitutional admendments banning same-sex marriage that have the \"single subject\" rule. I don't know which other states, if any, have this rule. Maybe some here could enlighten me. I think every state constitutional admendment not only says that marriage is between one man and one woman but also goes on to say that nothing similar to marriage would be allowed. This prevents a person that wants to vote against same sex marriage to allow something like civil unions. It's all or nothing and this doesn't seem to be fair since the majority is for some sort of rights for same sex couples.",

All of these amendments were prepared and supported by the same national organizations working with local groups. They've heard the arguments about how broad these laws are and haven't changed a single one. They know exactly what they're doing. In a few cases, after assuring people that they didn't intend to interfere with domestic partnership legislation, they filed suits to do exactly that once the amendment passed.",
