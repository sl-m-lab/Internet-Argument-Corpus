   "Present day politicians have reduced the scope of the franchise to a choice among follies.\n \n The ruling liberal consensus has a large constituency of members who couldn't even defend the core values of economic liberalism. The conservative \"alternative\" desperately seeks the \"middle ground\" of an adulterated liberalism which appeals to nobody but committed activists. Voters are left with a bogus choice between Tweedledum and Tweedledee. \n \n Everywhere, all electable politicians chant the same politically correct slogans by which they hope to insinuate themselves into power. They know only too well that forsaking the orthodox sentiments of the day leads to silence and oblivion.\n \n Whatever administration is formed (after the pantomime of voting for it), we know that we have merely chosen a sentimental folly, and the drain down which our money will be poured.",
