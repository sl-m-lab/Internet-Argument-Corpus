   "THE PARADOX OF BOURGEOIS MORALITY & FEMINISM  \n \n The vast majority of suicide victims in Australia are male, \n but god forbid if a Faculty is not dominated by female staff! \n \n The vast majority of violent deaths are males, \n but god forbid if females lag behind male CEOs! \n \n The vast majority people in jail (97%) are male, \n but god forbid if the bourgeois police are underrepresented by females! \n \n The vast majority of homeless people in Australia are male, \n but god forbid if a female body is portrayed as anything but a divine entity! \n \n Females outlive males (this means females get to savor life longer than males), \n but god forbid if one uses male pronouns in HIS assignments! \n \n The vast majority of all child abuse is committed by females against males, \n but god forbid if this statistic is identified in the literature! \n \n Bourgeois feminists demand to be EQUAL to males in every way in Australia, and yet they remain SILENT when it comes to the nasty dimensions of male 'privileges'. More, they are contemptuous! \n \n Now here is a question for toady bourgeois academics: As a man, and being conversant in these gender facts, why should I give a single toss about greedy bourgeois women demanding to outdo male CEOs, when men are killing themselves at a FASTER pace than the national road toll? Which issue is more deserving of attention...of empathy? \n \n Hmm maybe I have my priorities mixed up....maybe materialism, domination and power for women is more important than male homelessness, suicide, imprisonment, ill health, unemployment, abuse, alienation and so on. \n \n Feminism is bourgeois morality par excellence: it's all about divvying up the spoils of materialism and elitism, it has little to do with social justice (Indigenous males have a life expectancy of 45 years - where are the feminist screeches?) \n \n Feminism is a fallacious (and malicious) ethic, benefiting the bourgeois classes, further compounding the grief of the oppressed. It gives nothing to the average man on the street, it takes from him, and then after stripping him - its blames him! \n \n We often hear the grievance how bosses are mainly male! Yes it is really unfair, why the poor and enslaved live for the day when they can wake up to a world of 'balanced' elitism in which an equal proportion of the bosses are female! What a SCAM, the bourgeois have brainwashed the herd to the point that they believe that by changing their masters into mistresses their lot will somehow improve. This is the biggest fallacy of feminism; it is not about equal rights, it is about equality among the bourgeois classes and the sharing of wealth and power. \n \n In terms of the struggle for authentic social justice FEMINISM is a huge impediment: it serves to aggravate the conditions of the oppressed, while at the same time disguises the material greed of the bourgeois elite.",

Morals and opinions are mostly imposed and shaped by the upper classes - the lower classes including the middle, compulsively adopt (or swallow) the morality as prepared by the bourgeois.\n \n The middle and lower stratums of society may think that they share or indeed design the prevailing order of morality, but in fact they are profoundly wrong. As in any culture, members are socialised and indoctrinated into conformity. The success of this 'socialising' and 'indoctrination' manifests in the fallacious belief that we (the lower classes or in Nietzsche's words - the herd) are masters of our moral and ethical fate. When in fact we are not masters, but mere slaves, who are led to think we are IN control.\n \n I hope this answers your question (ambigous as it was).",

Is simply the asking of such a question sufficient evidence for your accusation to stick?\n\n \n In the context of my discourse, the term bourgeois is used to represent the establishment and elites - the 2 (bourgeois and establishment) are synonymous, in that these 2 tiers share identical value systems. If you want to collapse this social element into sub-elements, then please do, it makes negligible difference to my position.\n \n \n \nI am obliged to you for referring me to Derrida so that my previous comments could be explicated with his assistance. Unfortunately, I cannot make sense of his \"deconstructionist\" theory since it is devoured by its own hypotheses.\n\n \n \n I agree, and so would Derrida, and I think he acknowledges this 'paradox' in his 'texts'. However I do think Derrida has a point when his claims the impossibility of a reader understanding the exact meaning of the text as intended by the author. This is just common sense. His own texts are an excellent example of this axiom: no-one reader knows what the hell he really is on about!\n \n \n \nFurther consideration of your concept of feminism: there is no single accepted definition of feminism that includes agitation for political and legal rights, equal opportunities, sexual autonomy, and the right to self determination.\n\n \n You will recall in my previous post on the definition of feminism I underscored the adjective - conventional. Perhaps the term layman (whoops laywoman) would have been a more obvious marker to what I intend as the operational definition of feminism. In any case, I am sure you are reasonable enough to concur that the clarion call of feminism has been and is, Equal Rites or Gender Equality etc. Etymologizing the word feminism is not my purpose, or though, if you feel it necessary then you're most welcome to do so.\n \n \n \nSo far, all you've managed to demonstrate is an animus against feminism disguised as a \"paradox\" without substance.\n\n \n Hmm. Let's try this again. If we can converge on this notion that the general ethical thrust of feminism is gender equality in all facets of life (read - only the positive areas) in the market economy (or more accurately plutocracy: but this is not the occasion to debate this provocative point) then the contradictions, I suggest, manifest instantly.\n \n Market economies or capitalistic societies do not thrive on equality or the now preferred bourgeois phrase of equal opportunity. Market economies are driven by competition (see Smith, Keynes or the more recent Vickrey and his one time neo-liberal rival, Friedman). Pure equality and capitalism are antithetical (if you disagree, please prove otherwise). This is all very elementary stuff, but it is necessary to repeat it to demonstrate my contention of how feminism and its principal ethic of equality is manifestly incongruent with the social, material and political realities in western market democracies [plutocracies].\n \n If we agree that unconditional equality is impossible in market economies, (NB: this is not meant to be a position of morality, its just plain logic), then any movement (in this case feminism) that seeks to operate within this exploitative order has perforce become part of that order. The cult of feminism (along with politically correct morality in general) seeks not to dismantle the exploitative system of capitalism, but merely to amend it, so to permit more of one gender into the upper echelons of materialism and authority. Therefore feminism is all about CONDITIONAL equality - agitating for the 'privilege' of more white women to penetrate the domain of power, exploitation and greed, an elitist sphere that has traditionally been dominated by males. This to me is paradoxical and has absolutely nothing to do with equal rights or opportunity for ALL.\n \n \n How does this all relate to bourgeois morality? The bourgeois that is, the middle-classes, under the direction of the elites (again, the division between the 2 classes are in fact so blurred, it's redundant to distinguish between them) appear to be the greatest advocates, churners and believers in pc / feminist morality. The premise underpinning their \"herdish\" moral convictions is based on the false gospel of democracy and equality, which serves only to reinforce the status quo of the current order of market exploitation etc. Clearly the bourgeois along with the elites stand to gain from any SCAM that operates as a moral legitimizer of the capitalist order. The losers are the millions barred from (but tethered to) the bourgeois realms of material gluttony - for these losers; (working / enslaved / marginalized classes - male and female) bourgeois morality along with its frontrunner of feminism means nothing. It's another smokescreen to obfuscate the reality of bourgeois excess and plunder, feminists included!\n \n In terms of originality, my \"animus\" that seeks to debunk feminist morality is not new. More than 100 years ago, that supreme iconoclast - Friedrich Nietzsche, having dealt once and for all with the twaddle of Christian morality, predicted the rise of a new terrestrial breed of bovine morality (no pun intended).\n \n On the emerging \"monstrous stupidity\" of feminism Nietzsche wrote:\n To blunder over the fundamental problem of man and woman, to deny here the most abysmal antagonism and the necessity of an eternally hostile tension, perhaps to dream here of equal rights, equal education, equal claims and duties: this is a typical sign of shallow-mindedness, and a thinker, who has proved himself to be shallow on this dangerous point - shallow of instinct! - may be regarded as suspect in general, more as betrayed, as found out: he will probably be too short, for all the fundamental questions of life, those of life in future too, incapable of any depth.\n \n And;\n \n O Europe! Europe! We know the horned beast which always attracted you most, which again and again threatens you with danger! Your ancient fable could once again become history - once again a monstrous stupidity could master you and carry you off!

The lamentable fact that his unintelligible verbiage is being \"studied\" with alacrity in (some) degree courses, is perhaps a telling reflection on the academic rigour expected from students enrolled in, and the university tutors who contrive such courses.\n \n There are a number of controversial assumptions buried in your commentary. For instance, capitalism is decribed merely as an \"exploitative\" system - from which we may imagine a picture of relentless mistreatment of wage-slaves by the pitiless rich ? You have no qualifying clause mentioning that the market economy (or capitalism if you prefer) is arguably the most efficient means of disseminating prosperity in an advanced society. (Notice I do not claim that the market economy has been devised by the calculations of man).\n \n You seem to assume that while \"unconditional equality\" is impossible in a market economy, it might be possible in an alternative economic environment: do you have the command/planned economy of a socialist state in mind here ? You don't say. In any case, talk of \"equality\" is virtually meaningless unless you stipulate in what respect(s) equality is desirable. Perhaps you have the philosopher's stone of socialist theory - i.e. equality of economic outcomes - in mind here ? Again, you don't specify.\n \n You mention \"scams\" that operate as moral legitimizers of the capitalist order: is the \"false gospel of democracy\" one of these scam legitimizers ? Are there others ? Despite your use of the word \"clearly\", it's not at all clear what you're driving at. \n \n Lastly, for the time being, we come to your take on feminism. You seem to be arguing that feminists have thrown in their lot with the hateful bourgeoisie and have adopted a bourgeois world view in order to further their materialist ends. Instead of which, feminists \"ought\" to have been pursuing a thoroughly revolutionary agenda that would undermine the capitalist system and liberate the working, enslaved, and marginalised classes ? If my inferences are correct, then where did the \"ought\" come from ? Have you never considered the possibility that the bourgeoisie itself can be represented as a revolutionary force and the quest for gender equality might be intrinsic to its program ?\n \n I cannot understand why you've chosen to conclude your discourse with a reference to the lunatic prophecies of Nietzsche.

Instead of which, feminists \"ought\" to have been pursuing a thoroughly revolutionary agenda that would undermine the capitalist system and liberate the working, enslaved, and marginalised classes ?\n\n \n \n This perhaps forms the only valid observation in your reply. I'll try and be as concise as I can, cause I feel this is getting repetitive. The ethical rhetoric of feminism is equality and social justice. There is nothing wrong with the demand for social justice - the problem / paradox lies in how this justice is being achieved by feminists. By petitioning the Establishment for this 'justice', is akin to petitioning a gang of thieves for an equal share of the spoils. This is not a moral judgemnet, this is about logic. If the greatest perpetrator of injustice is Authority, (and it must be because it monopolises power and control) then any Association that embeds itself into the culture of this Elitism is itself just as oppressive / guilty. Try this analogy - when whining slaves revolt, many separate from or kill the slavers, however some jump into the bed with the slaver. This is feminism - it whines of injustice towards women, of their enslavement to oppression, and yet it is happy to walk hand in hand (albeit with some friction) with the same Agency that once operated to oppress them and every other peasant regardless of sex.\n \n My 'crusade' is not directed against bourgeois and feminists per se, rather my axe is aimed at the nausetating hypocrisy that both these self-serving agencies spew in defense of their fiefdoms. This is what I find most irksome about bourgeois morality - its fallaciousness and hypocrisy. Regardless of how I feel about the massive incogruency between the moral doctrine of feminists and their collusion with the bourgeois establishment, the issue is still a matter of logic and can be objectively dissected to reveal the incogruency.\n \n \nI cannot understand why you've chosen to conclude your discourse with a reference to the lunatic prophecies of Nietzsche. This is surely a sign that you've hit the buffers in your attempt to assemble a rational argument IN YOUR OWN WORDS.\n\n \n Im sorry I wasnt aware that you are a member of the flock. In this case we should desist our exchange, (alternatively, you may want to address the fallacy or veracity of religious). \n \n Finally, your abuse of Nietzsche comes across as a highly emotional and irrational outburst, and again demonstrates your inabilty to remain objective.",

For your information I detest charity and philanthropy (philosophically speaking).\n \n Your simian barks from the sidelines are entertaining, but nothing else.\n \n \n Now to the other heckler Waxy, who at least offered more than an unintelligible grunt in his / her heckle.\n \n \nI've never seen anyone so emotionally invested in a subject on a debate forum before as you are, especially in such an obscure and IMHO irrelevent one, not even in the abortion threads. \n \n \n Say what! Me emotionally invested! How ironic that I should be accused of this, when in fact the very subject that I seek to deconstruct is morality and all the nauseating passion and irrationalism that drives it. \n \n \n \nHere's my 5 second stereotype - you're exactly like all the other wanna be intellectuals out there that worship at the altar of Nietzsche - lost in a dream world of angry bluster, academic irrelevence and endless self-righteousness\n\n \n \n \"Worship at the alter of Nietzsche\" - now that's an outburst of righteousness if I've ever read one. \"wannabe intellectual.\" Thank you. This charge must mean that I am a lot closer to being an intellectual than the many others in this forum, in particular slack jawed hecklers who believe wild abuse is a substitute for sound debate.\n \n \n \nWaxy, Sinjin, Back off, he was just getting to the point where he actually makes his argument (though I am not sure he actually knows what his argument is). THEN we swoop in and tear him down, not before.\n\n \n And then there is Daewoo, who like a scavenger is waiting, in its own words, to \"swoop down\" on me! \n \n Get a life or a brain. \n \n If you 'hilarious hecklers' really want to engage in a battle of abuse, then I guarantee you I will rise to the challenge, more I will have you crying into your Kleenexes (or your mama's apron). However I would really rather not go down this path, because I find that when I shred people's egos, and show them how really small, insignificant and fragile their craniums are, it leaves me quite unfulfilled.\n \n Pardon for the diversion Alan, you now have my full attention.\n \n \nI'm neither a pedant nor a \"semiologist\" : I was obliged (some years ago) to get acquainted with the \"science of signs\" by reading an introduction to the work of Roland Barthes. I abandoned the task because the deliberate obscurity of the material made the study of it intolerable.\n\n \n OK you are not into signs and symbols, but your enthusiasm to nit-pick my text structure has me concerned (Im sure you understand this is not the place to forge a rigorous manifesto on social theory - thus much of the 'diatribe' [mine] has to be truncated). Having said this I welcome your criticism to the text substance. I find your discerning wit a refreshing change from the usual retard posts, my 'unorthodox' topic usually draws. See above for an example.\n \n \nI'm not a member of any \"flock\" whether secular or religious. \n \n \n Roger that. Nietzsche's violent atheism is not an issue for you.\n \n \nYou have an unfortunate tendency - judging by the rather glib tone of some of your remarks in these exchanges - to slap pejorative labels on the (only) other party in the discussion. You cannot have any real understanding of my considered views on the basis of what you have inferred from what I've said here.\n\n \n Point taken, I'm a little fast on retaliation. However it would help if you could cut to the chase and take me up on a specific issue of substance e.g. is injustice / oppression an unavoidable consequence of free markets? Alan, a simple yes or no will suffice, (the negative should naturally follow with a qualification)\n \n \nMy remark about Nietzsche was an hyperbole - which as an experienced debater (?) I assumed you would recognise as such. I have read his major work in which he develops his idea of the superman - which I found esoteric and rebarbative. I am allowed an opinion here I assume ?\n\n \n I concede that the notion of a superman (the amoral man consumed only with a will to power) could be rebarbative (I like your word mastery) to some. The \"superman\" is, how should I put this...one of Nietzsche's more adventurous concepts, however the primary Nietzschean theme of herdish morality and how it retards, rather than excells the spirit of man is devastatingly brilliant.\n \n \nNow you know a little more about \"where I'm coming from\" (your phrase) perhaps you could adjust your notion of my perspective and allow for a little humour creeping in ?\n\n \n Detecting humor is sometimes difficult in text (Derrida again), and I'll will make a point of watching out for it in future. But I am convinced that your displeasure  to my use of analogy and sources was not an attempt at humor, which brings me back to the original discourse.\n \n I acknowledge that much of my text has been interspersed with provocative adjectives and maybe some superlatives too; I also understand how this may seem hypocritical, when I am arguing for case against morality and so forth. But the terms oppression, subjugation exploitation, poor, rich etc are standard descriptors used by many social theorists in their analysis of society. The general consensus is that capitalism, although benefiting many, wounds more. Marx obviously has much to say about this, but even the very dry sociologists / structuralists such as Talcott Parsons acknowledges the 'imperfections' and 'inequities' (is that better?) of market societies.\n \n When I contextualize the partial outcomes of capitalism negatively, I am merely stating the obvious, humor me further as I regress into analogizing once more. When a bystander witnesses a burning house and remarks the awful consequences of that fire, is he being any less objective in his analysis of the situation? Alternatively, he could simple observe, \"the house is burning\", period. But this is not enough!\n \n The moral foundation of feminism is 'equality'. The foundation of market societies is 'exploitation.' Feminism has been absorbed into the market, and is administered by the bourgeois classes. Feminists are now part of the bourgeois / elite structure. Therefore their foundation of equality is erroneous. My illustration of the moral incongruity of feminism is not  about what it should do or not do, (I just don't care) it is a statement of what they are, as opposed to what they claim they are. \n \n My subsidiary claim is how the establishment subsumes threats and turns these threats to its own advantage. Again this is not an expression of my values; it is a statement of what is. In terms of resilence, the elite / establishment is to be applauded for its tenacity to withstand external threats.",

   "OK Mac: you've seem to have got a lot off your chest in your last response - which might leave just enough scope to continue the discussion on a more restricted and less volatile basis ?\n \n Before suggesting a topic for debate taken from the variety of propositions that you've introduced so far - none of which (as you know) would I consider to be adequately supported by reasoned argument - let's just clarify certain points arising from the Nietzsche business. \n \n 1. I think we might agree that no rational argument can prove the existence of God (or the contrary).\n \n 2. While I'm not in sympathy with Nietzsche's profound or militant atheism, I would still describe myself an atheist. The literal meaning of atheism is simply \"without God\" (cf. asymmetric; amoral; abiogenesis; same \"a\" prefix signifying \"without\"). Even if God (or gods) existed, I would be content to live without him (or them). I do not feel compelled to disturb the faith of people who believe in God, the afterlife, Satan, and so forth. If they are comforted and given hope in a suffering world by religious myths, I see no harm in that.\n \n With this preamble out of the way, we might examine your claim that free markets inevitably operate through \"exploitation\", or your assertion that a general consensus exists on an answer to the question of whether capitalism harms more than it benefits.\n \n If you prefer to debate your views on feminism and egalitarianism or the role of bourgeois morality/hypocrisy in corrupting the values of feminism, please specify.\n \n If none of these suggestions appeal - just come up with a singular hypothesis that expresses some vital aspect of your view and we can take it from there. I do not care to get involved in a discussion that depends on vast chunks of quotation and counter quotation from material that has been cut and pasted from text books or even from the original sources.",

   "And then there is Daewoo, who like a scavenger is waiting, in its own words, to \"swoop down\" on me! \n \n \n \n Yep, thats pretty much what I am doing. Thus far, I have only seen two statement worthy of debate.\n \n 1- Nietzsche was a genius\n 2- Nietzsche is best known ad the man who claimed that god is dead.\n \n Neither of these are correct. Nietzsche is best known as the man that devised an economic mentality without factoring human greed into the equation, an oversight so severe that it instantly removes him from the \"genius\" category, regardless of what else he may or may not have accomplished.\n \n This thread is on its second page, due mainly to the fact that for some reason Alan Rand seems to want to draw this out at least as far as getting you to actually state your point. Frankly, this exhibits far more patience than I personally posses.\n \n Once you have made a debatable point, I will likely sit back and watch it demolished by AR. You are outclassed badly.\n \n If Alan grows bored with it, I will likely say something. I don't think my statements above were worthy of contempt. I told the others to stay out of it at least until you have come to a debatable point. If, and when, you ever do, it will likely be smashed rather quickly, either by AR, or by one of the 15 yr old kids that runs around here. \n \n I have concluded this because you do not seem to have a firm enough grasp of your subject matter to even formulate a debating point. This does not bode well for your ability to defend that point once it matures.",
