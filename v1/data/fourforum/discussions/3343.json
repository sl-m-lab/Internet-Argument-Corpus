   "Terrorism -The Unexamined Moral Issue\n \n by Bradley Smith\n \n Let's define what we're talking about. \"Terrorism\" is the intentional killing of innocent, unarmed civilians to gain a political end. We all condemn terrorism.\n \n Terrorists argue that their motive for killing innocent, unarmed civilians is to achieve a \"greater good\" for those they represent. Their sincerity is confirmed by the voluntary sacrifice of their own lives for this \"greater good.\"\n \n It is argued by those who support Al Qaeda that the young Arabs who voluntarily sacrificed their own lives to intentionally kill some 3,000 innocent, unarmed American civilians in the World Trade Center, did so in the sincere belief that it was for the \"greater good\" of Arabs and Muslims everywhere.\n \n When Hamas volunteers sacrifice their own lives to kill unarmed Israeli civilians, they claim that it is for the \"greater good\" of all Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims everywhere. Their own voluntary deaths confirm their sincerity.\n \n Terrorism is not a black and white issue, but a morally complex one. One that is not yet being addressed by Americans.\n \n Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike, argue that when they burned alive the civilian populations of Nagasaki, Hamburg, and a hundred other Japanese and German cities, that it was for a \"greater good,\" and therefore that it was \"morally right.\"\n \n There is a consensus in American culture that intentionally killing innocent, unarmed civilians during a war is one thing, while intentionally killing innocent, unarmed civilians when there is no \"war,\" is something else. Then it is \"terrorism.\"\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.breakhisbones.org/outlaw/apressroom.html\n \n \n \n .",

Barbarism does not matter. All that matters is winning (in the terrorist mind). There are people that could be held accountable if they are caught. \n \n This is not a chess game where you expect the other player to play fair. The British were horrified when the Americans began using guerilla tactics. We did not fight fair. We did not line our troops up and shoot at each other in an open field.\n \n If you have very little chance at winning a conventional war, what would many people do? The Japanese cut off American POW heads. Vikings were very vicious, killing whole villages. \n \n I agree with the other posters. I especially agree with georged here:\n \n \nWell stated.

It was just announced that the Admin will be asking for another $70 billion for Iraq/Afgan, bringing the total to over $225 billion and counting. Today I heard someone say, referring to our enemies, \"Are we killing them as fast as we are making them\"? I think we all know the answer to that one.\n Dono",
