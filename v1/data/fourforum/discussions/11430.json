Just because we choose to own an AR-15 instead of a Pennsylvania Long Rifle doesn't change this fact, nor does it give any ground for your mistaken belief that the Second Amendment is out of date.\n\n OK, an analogy. Let's look at cars. In the UK, until 1965 some roads had no speed limit - hence the term 'derestricted'. This was perfectly fine, as cars could not really go faster than the 60/70mph that was introduced in 1965. However, as cars got more powerful and able to push their speeds to unsafe levels, a limit had to be introduced in order to regulate it.\n In the same way, guns have become more lethal and easier to facilitate concealed criminal use than they were when the Constitution was laid out. Thus, regulation needs to be put in place to protect the safety of the general public - just as the limit on speed was introduced for cars.\n \n \nYou ever see the $80 guns being sold in the states?\nNo?

There's also no evidence to show that pepperspray can still work when it's raining or if there's high humidity.\nBy you, it's fine if you want to use it to protect your home, unless your roof leaks...\n I did some research, however, as your knowledge seems to be based on (minimal) personal observations of use (how many times have you seen pepper spray used in the dry?). Heavy wind or rain can limit the range of pepper spray from ~15ft to ~4ft. Heavy rain will also shorten (very slightly) the length of time over which the spray is effective - really heavy rain is the equivalent of the criminal bathing their eyes. However, this difference is fairly minimal, and at close range pepper spray continues to be effective.\n \n Pepper spray itself does not degrade over time ('chemicals degrade' was not a good statement to try and use on an ex-chemist). However, the container itself may degrade, and will have an expiry date. However, this is not really an issue, as it costs less to re-stock yourself with spray every year or so than it does to buy a gun.\n \n \nYour quote which implies you are for widespread nukes is: \"Until somebody proves that they have criminal intentions then there's no grounds for treating them like criminals.\"\nI fail to see how that quote relates at all to nukes.\nWhy do you not want other countries to have nukes, if not for the fact that they might have criminal intentions?\n \n \nYeah I bet you'd think that. Such isn't always the case however.\n ...\n This still doesn't prove that somebody who's armed is going to commit harm to someone else.\n ...\n Your evidence please?\nWell, I would say that if a person has a weapon, they are more likely to take aggressive action - as you have agreed. I would also say that if someone takes aggressive action, they are more likely to cause harm if they are armed, and the better they are armed, the more likely it is that they are going to cause serious/lethal damage. You disagree with this, but I'm not sure on what grounds.\n \n Therefore, if someone has a gun, they are more likely to attack someone and more likely to kill them in an attack. I fail to see how you can deny this.\n \n As for proof, half an hours searching reveals no statistics on pre-meditated crime, either for my argument or against it. However, I would say that all of the violent incidents I have witnessed (not very many, mind you...) were not premeditated.\n \n \nWhat's so hard to understand about the argument? I don't want some punk who should still be serving his sentence for armed robbery, to decide that I look like an easy mark that's just ripe for the picking.

However, this difference is fairly minimal, and at close range pepper spray continues to be effective.\n\n \n So the weather conditions do have an adverse affect on the effectiveness of pepper spray.\n \n \nPepper spray itself does not degrade over time ('chemicals degrade' was not a good statement to try and use on an ex-chemist).\n\n \n Never heard of a half-life?\n \n \nHowever, this is not really an issue, as it costs less to re-stock yourself with spray every year or so than it does to buy a gun.\n\n \n How do you guarantee that the chemical mixture was properly balanced and will last?\n \n \nWhy do you not want other countries to have nukes, if not for the fact that they might have criminal intentions?\n\n \n I'm avoiding the nuke discussion entirely.\n \n \nWell, I would say that if a person has a weapon, they are more likely to take aggressive action - as you have agreed. I would also say that if someone takes aggressive action, they are more likely to cause harm if they are armed, and the better they are armed, the more likely it is that they are going to cause serious/lethal damage. You disagree with this, but I'm not sure on what grounds.\n\n \n I've seen people get their necks broken by someone who was unarmed and empty handed. I have a hard time supporting the belief that somebody has to be armed before they can cause serious harm to a person.\n \n \nTherefore, if someone has a gun, they are more likely to attack someone and more likely to kill them in an attack. I fail to see how you can deny this.\n\n \n Because I know more about the wounding potential of various kinds of ammunition. Being shot doesn't make you \"more likely to die\" unless you've been shot in a key location, and even then it's no guarantee of death occurring in any orderly fashion.\n \n \nSo why do we arm our police force with them?\n\n \n A better question would be why aren't pepperspray and stunguns the primary weapons of the police? If they were effective enough then we wouldn't need to arm them with handguns.\n \n \nPepper gas is banned from use in a war zone as it is a chemical weapon. And soldiers do not want to temporarily disable the enemy, they want to kill them - and kill many of them, which doesn't work so well with a non-automatic weapon.\n\n \n Civilian access to automatic weapons is tightly restricted, and only one known crime has ever happened with a legally registered machinegun.",

   "Well, if guns are now more accurate, more concealable and more reliable then it makes them much less defensive weapons and much more offensive weapons.

When your life is in danger you're not going to be concerned with the wellbeing of the person that's threatening you, nor should you me.\nI assume you would be worried about your own wellbeing, however?

You're grasping at straws again.\n\n \n Not really. A gun doesn't rust because it's either made of rust resistant materials or it's properly oiled and protected against oxidation. Unfortunately the effectiveness of chemicals tends to decrease overtime, that's why you're not supposed to take old medication after it reaches a certain date.\n \n After a certain amount of time passes the limited effectiveness of pepperspray will decrease even more, and there's no way of determining how long it's been sitting in some warehouse before you got it so it could be decades old by the time it comes into your possession.\n \n \nFor the same reason you are avoiding the 'modern technology' discussion - that your logic doesn't stand up to it, so it 'must' be wrong.\n\n \n No I'm avoiding it because it's nonsensical. No matter how you argue it guns and nukes aren't the same thing and aren't comparable to one another. Because when you start comparing a pocket gun like the Kel-Tec P3AT to something like a nuclear warhead and trying to draw parallels between them you're just a nut.\n \n \nShow me where I said that? I merely said that if you are armed, you are more likely to do damage than if you are not.\n\n \n And I've never seen evidence to support this fact. Too many people die from being choked to death with empty hands for me to believe that somebody who isn't armed is less likely to cause damage than somebody that is armed. It's not an exact science.\n \n \nWould you rather you were attacked by someone with a knife, or someone with a gun?\n\n \n I'd rather not be attacked at all.\n \n \nNeither does being stabbed. However, being shot is still more likely to hit a vital spot.\n \n \n Only if you're capable of precise aiming.\n \n \nAgain, would you rather be attacked by a knife or a gun?\n\n \n Again, I'd rather not be attacked at all if I had the option of choosing.\n \n \nNo, that would be avoiding my question, along with the nukes and the tech. Although in the UK the police do not carry firearms as a primary weapon. In the US I presume they carry because they are more likely to meet someone who might shoot back, what with the higher (gun) murder rate and all.\n\n \n We're more realistic in our approach to doing things. We don't say that arming police will only encourage criminals to arm themselves better, because that's just stupid and would admit that criminals can easily get guns despite such being illegal.\n \n \nSurely this proves that gun control on automatic weapons can be a success? Why do you think that this will not be the case with handguns?\n\n \n The question is why should we regulate handguns in the same manner that we regulate machineguns? There's a very large difference in the capabilities of the two, there's no reasonable argument for requiring someone to get police permission, permission from the ATF, being photographed and fingerprinted and kept waiting for months at a time, just to buy a handgun.\n \n \nSo you are left with the option of 'freaking people out' and marking yourself as a target for anyone who might want to steal a gun, or have your gun make very little difference in the event that you are attacked.\n That's not the most attractive of scenarios, to me.\n\n \n Criminals have said before that they fear an armed victim than an armed police officer. And since they don't have much way of knowing who is armed and who isn't when concealed carry is the way things are done, they're going to feel less inclined to randomly attack somebody that they don't know and can't tell if they're armed or not.",

You don't have the option of 'not being attacked' - would you rather someone attacked you with a knife or a gun?\n\n \n Well considering that a deep enough cut across the stomach will let your intestines fall out in a pile, I'll take being attacked with a gun. At least with a gun there's always the chance that the guy will be an idiot and forget to take the safety off, or the first round will be a dud and not go bang.\n \n \nOh, and not all chemicals degrade, although I see you still have trouble admitting this, too.

You've consistently ignored tasers (apart from more unfounded remarks about reliability), but meh...\n\n \n I don't give a damn. The fact remains, you do have to buy new pepperspray to replace your stock because it does lose its effectiveness over the course of years and the weather does prohibit its effectiveness. A good gun on the other hand will be just as functional a hundred years from now if properly maintained, and good ammunition will remained perfectly reliable decades from now when you're dead and gone. No chemical defense is gonna have that kind of longevity.\n \n I also consider tasers useless, because you've got only one shot with them and they have a maximum range of 15 feet, so you'd better be pretty damn accurate or else a taser is just as overly expensive rock. They cost more than a good gun, have far less range, and you only get one shot from a single cartridge.\n \n \nYou've also twice (and a half) refused to remain consistent with your logic. You've said that speed limits should be put in place to respond to faster cars, but refused to do anything more than immediately discard the notion that gun restrictions should be put in place to respond to more lethal and concealable guns.\n\n \n That's because there's absolutely no point in putting more restrictions on guns just because the technology has changed! The function, purpose and use of guns has remained constant throughout the centuries, the laws we have now are perfectly adequate.\n \n Your argument that the Second Amendment is out of date just because firearms technology has changed is nonsensical. By the same token it could be argued that the First Amendment's protection of free speech is out of date because of the existence of computers and laser printers and paper and automated printing presses that churn out hundreds of newspapers an hour.\n \n \nYou then tried to claim that it is reasonable to trust all non-criminals with weapons, but unreasonable to trust all non-criminals (or non-criminal nations) with nukes, on the unfounded basis that 'the two aren't comparable'.\n\n \n That's because they aren't comparable. A nuclear weapon leaks deadly radiation even when dormant and has to be specially stored to keep everybody near it from dying of radiation poisoning, and when used they have the potential to kill a million people all at once and there's no way to stop it. No gun has anywhere near that kind of power.\n \n \nThe (and a half) comes from refusal to accept the argument that having a gun makes you more likely to attack someone, even though you have previously agreed this to be the case.\n\n \n There's no evidence to show that simply having access to a gun is more likely to make you attack someone. If this were the case then police shouldn't have guns because they might wind up abusing their authority and start killing innocent people over something like jaywalking or littering. But they aren't! Even though police have guns they aren't out attacking people for no damn reason! And if they aren't even though they could, there's no reason to believe that anybody else will attack for no reason just because they have a gun!",

   "Omega, most of your replies had already been raised by Ethmi, and I answered them. Simply parroting him will get you nowhere, whether it was intentional or not.\n \n To go through your post (and Ethmi's where I can tie the two together)...\n \n You and Ethmi have both stated that you would rather be attacked with a knife than a gun - possibly because it was the only way to preserve your integrity a little longer. You both, however, want to own guns for self-defence, not knives.\n Why the incongruity? Surely you would want to attack a criminal with the weapon you would least want to be attacked with?\n \n That pepper spray needs refuelling due to poor canister design (propellant leakage would be my best guess at the reason) does not affect it's usefulness, as you can live a lifetime restocking with spray and still pay less than you would have done for a gun. Goggles work well against pepper spray, but they restrict peripheral vision and (partly) hearing, so it's doubtful that a \n burglar would be wearing any.\n \n Tazers are not 'one shot', as my link from above shows - reload in seconds. While you are vulnerable while reloading, this is just as true with single-shot weapons (some shotguns, for example), and even semiautomatic weapons take a trigger-pull for the next round to load - missing your shot with any weapon is not advised, which is why I see the best course of action to be not taking the risk that you might miss.\n \n That nukes are far more lethal than guns makes no difference.

Sorry, my bad. My argument doesn't really stand up unless this irregularity (rather be attacked with a knife, rather attack someone else with a gun) is present - I just mixed up my implements for a sentence.\n \n Ooops.\n \n \nWhy a gun rather than a knife? I'd rather have a gun because of the fact that I can stop the attacker from a distance. Knives and stun guns both have one tragic shortcoming: the need to be right up against the person seeking to do you harm, before they can be used. And when you're facing somebody intent on hurting you, distance if your friend.\nAnd yet if you are facing someone who wants to hurt you, you'd rather they had a gun?\n \n This is the irregularity I'm talking about. Take your arguments from your first quote, apply them to the second - and vice versa. It's not logically consistent.\n \n To re-phrase: Either a gun is better for attacking, or a knife is. You've said both - a gun is better because it is ranged, and a knife is better because it is free from mechanical failure. You can't have it both ways.\n \n \nI don't care!

You just can't do something like that with a taser, it just doesn't happen.\nFair enough on the single-shot firearms, from what you've heard at least.

However, this statement directly contradicts earlier ones you have made previously about 'modern weapons being just as lethal as older ones'.\n\n \n I don't see how it's a contradiction.

I'll freely admit that there is a larger jump between guns and nukes than knives and guns, but there is still a direct difference in lethality.\n\n \n As I've said before, I don't care if somebody was shot to death more than I do if they were stabbed to death, all I'm gonna care about is that they were killed. I'm getting damn tired of there being so much outcry when somebody gets killed by being shot, but there being little if any outcry when somebody's killed by being stabbed. The fact remains that they're dead, the tool used makes absolutely no difference. It's not like you can be made deader by a bullet to the head than a knife to the heart.\n \n \nSo what is your reasoning for not allowing countries nukes, if not that 'they might attack us (or each other) with them'?\n\n \n If your neighbor wanted to make a rock garden on their front lawn with raw plutonium, would you want to be anywhere near them?\n \n \nIf they won't make a difference, why are you so opposed to them?\n \n \n Because they'll only serve as an inconvenience to those that have no intention of breaking them! Gun owners already suffer enough inconveniences because of bad legislation, we don't need to face anymore just because criminals are breaking the laws.\n \n \nEach time you've repeatedly said it I've repeatedly replied to that the answer is to enforce laws - and tighter gun control will allow for easier enforcement.\n\n \n No it won't! If this were true then Washington D.C. would've been the most peaceful and gun free place in the entire United States! They had the tightest restrictions and more than enough power to enforce them, and they still had increases in the crime rates! I don't care if it was an urban environment with lots of people, your statement that stricter laws allow for easier enforcement makes absolutely no distinction of urban vs. rural and doesn't take population density into account.\n \n Your statement is basically \"more gun control makes it easier for the police to enforce\", well DC had just about all the gun control you could ever ask for, almost everything was banned from ownership under poorly worded rulings, there was absolutely no legal excuse of any sort for having a gun that was loaded, assembled or outside of the house, the police had the authority to arrest anyone and everyone for being in possession of a gun, and still they earned the title or Murder Capital of the United States.\n \n \nIf someone is carrying a gun and there is tighter gun control, chances are it's illegal and worth looking into. At the moment, you see someone with a gun and chances are they have a licence for CCW, so it's not worth perusing, despite the fact that, it may well be an illegal firearm.\n\n \n The police have the authority to investigate any case of someone carrying a firearm and have the equipment and resources necessary to determine if you have a concealed carry permit or if the gun has been stolen.\n \n \nAlso, way to change the argument.

   "No, hiding as an option has not changed since the days of old, with the slight difference that it used to be easier to get out of range. I'm talking about mace, stun guns, tazers, home security (double glazed windows, rhino locks, burglar alarms, CCTV/fake CCTV, panic rooms) and so on.\n\n \n So I guess instead of me spending $600.00 on a hand gun, or a shot gun to protect my family, and my home, I have to spend tens of thousands for adequate protection (Panic rooms, and I use the word adequate because this will protect, but so will my gun!), or spend upwards of over a grand for a real security system that will give me a false sense f security. Tazers, yeah you're for them until more people die from them, then off to ban those as well... Mace, please mace is garbage. It would be my last resort. It hardly ever works.\n \n \n \nAlthough you are quite right to point out that hiding is an option. Non-confrontation for the win.\n\n \n You think like a victim! I don't want confrontation ever to cross my path, but then again I am not God, or a rich man that can afford to hire \"armed\" security and unfortunately in the real world, sometimes you can' avoid a confrontation, sometimes it comes looking for you.\n \n \nHighwaymen? At the time of the Constitution there weren't exactly vast suburbs that could be prowled by thieves looking for an open window. Burglary today is more... casual than it used to be, largely thanks to the wonders of home insurance.\n \n\n \n Dumb assumption. Burglaries happen everyday, what planet do you live on? Have you seen videos of the L.A riots? You should just so you see what happens in times of civil unrest (yes even in America this happens, you don't have to be in the 3rd world). Worst thing was that in some videos you can actually see police men standing \"on the side lines\" s to speak watching this happen as innocents were brutally mauled by thugs, and looters (persons that people like you would say we \"misunderstand\".)\n \n\n No, unjust laws are still passed.

   "First of all, how are your scenarios more valid? I don't see what point you have other than attacking mine. \n\n Well we could look at the attacker running at you with a knife for starters. Do people really do that, because it is a really stupid thing to do? Letting it be known that you are going to attack someone with a short range weapon is a very stupid thing to do, even by your standards.\n \n \nNow shut up and listen.\n\n Oh, the old 'shut up' gambit. Your debating skills are improving.\n \n \nThen why would I go where he is?\n\n The point of this scenario is that your attacker, if carrying a knife would not run at you screaming (as you might seem to think - because that's just plain stupid). He would lie in wait until you were within arm's reach and then ambush you. You wouldn't realise that you had 'gone where he is' until you were actually there. That's what sensible knife attackers do.\n \n So your question is just plain silly. Try putting some thought into your next one.\n \n \nAs long as I'm there, he can't shoot me. He'll have to close in to shoot me. \n\n So, you've hidden behind this thing that was so handily placed when the gunman attacks you, he sees you hide and you think you are safe? Does this thing you're hidding behind protect you from all angles? Do you think he will simply walk right up to your hidding place and pear round it?

Let's try one more time.\n \n You chose two scenarios (stupid ones at that) the first to prove that you were better of with a knife, and the second to show that you were better off with a gun.\n \n See anything odd yet?\n \n I asked why you had not considered two other possible scenarios, which you had obviously not considered as they proved the exact opposite of your scenarios.\n \n So, the question is (still) why did you choose two scenarios that supposedly supported your theories (even though they were mutually exclusive), rather than considering other scenarios that showed your theories to be complete rubbish.\n \n Two possible answers could be that . . .\n \n 1) You did not examine all possible scenarios, because you don't have the capacity.\n 2) You did examine other scenarios, but chose to dishonestly ignore them so that you could support your own illogic rather than looking for something closer to reality.\n \n Do you get the point yet?\n \n Are you trying to prove that you are better off with a knife or with a gun? How can you pick scenarios that 'prove' that either weapon will give you the advantage? Why did you not think about this more before coming up with this rubbish?\n \n Smiley",

Apologies, but I don't have time to respond to a carpet bombing.\n \n \nPersonal preference. It's easier to avoid being shot if you keep moving, than it is to avoid a knife if your attacker is within range.\n\n When I said 'would you rather be attacked by a gun or a knife', did you take that to mean 'would you rather be attacked by a gun at long range or a knife up close'?\n I didn't mean it that way.\n \n \nSuch a narrow minded view...\nYes! Bring forth the gun that shoots swords!.\n \n No, seriously. You're being inconsistent in your view, unless you're aiming for \"they're both equally good\" - in which case, why object if guns are controlled?\n \n \nIf you wind up not needing to use your self-defense item until ten years after you bought it, wouldn't you rather have the one that'll last those ten years and still work just fine?\nWhy? If the one that I'll have to restock for ten years cost me less, why would I want a more expensive item?\n Note that this isn't a question about effectiveness, purely it is regarding the effects of longevity.\n \n \nIn a world filled with so many options, why would you willingly limit yourself to something that only gives you one shot before you need to reload, and trust this for your own personal protection?\n\n Because that one shot is not lethal, is far less likely to damage my property or other people if I do miss, and will incapacitate the criminal wherever I hit him with it?\n \n \nI don't see how it's a contradiction. Nor do I remember saying what you've implied. I remember talking about newer designs being more efficient than the old designs and arguing that their efficiency doesn't make the Second Amendment out of date.\n\n It's a contradiction because it agrees with your statement about efficiency. If a lethal weapon gets more efficient at it's task, it's fair to say that it's lethality has increaced.\n \n \nHow should I know why you believe what you choose to believe?\nNo, I meant why do you believe that people with a taser will panic and mess up as opposed to a gun owner calmly responding to a home invasion.\n \n \nAs I've said before, I don't care if somebody was shot to death more than I do if they were stabbed to death, all I'm gonna care about is that they were killed. I'm getting damn tired of there being so much outcry when somebody gets killed by being shot, but there being little if any outcry when somebody's killed by being stabbed. The fact remains that they're dead, the tool used makes absolutely no difference. It's not like you can be made deader by a bullet to the head than a knife to the heart.\nThis applies to people being killed by a nuke to, surely? The only difference is number of people affected, which (as I've said before) is admittedly much greater. But the issue is still trust.\n \n \nIf your neighbor wanted to make a rock garden on their front lawn with raw plutonium, would you want to be anywhere near them?\nNo, because I don't trust them with it and their mere ownership would be harmful to me. But I have no issues with taking peoples guns away because I don't trust them with it. You're the one who thinks everyone should be trusted until they mess up.\n \n \nBecause they'll only serve as an inconvenience to those that have no intention of breaking them! Gun owners already suffer enough inconveniences because of bad legislation, we don't need to face anymore just because criminals are breaking the laws.\n\n So your entire argument has been reduced to \"but new laws would be inconveniant\"? Sorry, but I think that if the pure reason you don't want new laws it that you can't be bothered, you're not onto a winner.\n \n \nNo it won't! If this were true then Washington D.C. would've been the most peaceful and gun free place in the entire United States! They had the tightest restrictions and more than enough power to enforce them, and they still had increases in the crime rates! I don't care if it was an urban environment with lots of people, your statement that stricter laws allow for easier enforcement makes absolutely no distinction of urban vs. rural and doesn't take population density into account.\n \n Your statement is basically \"more gun control makes it easier for the police to enforce\", well DC had just about all the gun control you could ever ask for, almost everything was banned from ownership under poorly worded rulings, there was absolutely no legal excuse of any sort for having a gun that was loaded, assembled or outside of the house, the police had the authority to arrest anyone and everyone for being in possession of a gun, and still they earned the title or Murder Capital of the United States.\n\n And yet when they tried it in Kansas, it worked fine. When new policing methods were introduced in San Fransisco (I think...), crime rates dropped drastically. Does this not suggest that DC isn't being enforced as tightly, possibly because it's very hard to enforce laws that apply to a single city only and the criminal underbelly of DC was huge to begin with?\n \n \nThe police have the authority to investigate any case of someone carrying a firearm and have the equipment and resources necessary to determine if you have a concealed carry permit or if the gun has been stolen.\nSo why aren't all gun owners investigated every time their gun is seen by an officer? I'm fairly sure that although the police have the computer resources, they don't have the time to investigate everyone, especially in city areas.\n \n \nBoth cases are equally true.\nNot if you want to repeal gun laws, which I have a feeling you've said before...\n \n \n\"He that is good for making excuses is seldom good for anything else. \"\n\n \"He that gives a valid reason for his actions should not be persecuted for them\" - Morality (paraphrased)\n \n \nYour logic is BS, man. Unless you're psycic, it doesn't help. Let me explain (these both assume that you're the defender):\n \n If you're being attacked with a gun, you can find something to hide behind, forcing your attacker to close in on you to attack. If he gets close enough, you can ambush him with a melee weapon before he has time to attack.\n \n On the other hand, if someone's charging at you with a knife, then you can pull out your gun, you don't even have to fire, and they'll run away. If they're persistant, a few shots (intentionally missed) will force them to take cover, giving you time to run away.\n \n Viola. \n\n So, guns and knives are equally good. So why do are you not content with just owning a knife and trying to restrict criminal access to firearms?\n \n \nHow is this relevant? I've shown that to buy one set of gun and ammo costs more than restocking pepper spray until you've reached 71 years-worth of spray (assuming improved propellant systems and even better defence systems haven't come along by then). A gun is still more expensive.\nPerfection has it's price.\nIn other words, it's not relevant.\n \n \nI won't deny that they have... which is why I'd like to have one to defend myself from one. You can't fight a swordsman with a plastic butterknife (unless you're incredible).\nIf you make it harder for him to get his blade in the first place, you may not have to.\n \n \nI don't know of too many innocent bystanders walking around in my house... and I keep that irreplaceable object out of my line of fire. And, just what if a criminal did walk into my line of fire and I missed?\nI'm not sure I understand; you mean what if you accidentally shot the criminal? I would guess it would be better if you had a taser, because you wouldn't have accidentally killed someone.\n \n \nTranslation: There's not a snowball's chance in hell that I'll get the numbers because they don't exist, so I'll try to get another source and pretend like it actually helps.\nNuh-uh. Translation: The numbers are there, otherwise the abstract (and all of my other sources) would not make the claim unfounded. The numbers are merely hidden behind a $30 registration fee, which I'm not going to pay to prove my point to someone who refuses to accept an abstract as a valid summary of a scientific investigation.\n \n \nYour source is a .org, get a .gov or at least a .com!\nYou don't know much about URLs, do you?\n The .com suffix:  there has been no restriction on who can register .com domains since the mid-1990s.\n The .org suffix: anyone can register a .org domain. \n .org and .com are fairly identical in availability. .gov is less available, but that is only for government purposes - most scientific studies are not goverment-owned.",

   "Well the gun debate will probably go on for years with both sides being determined to win.I support gun ownership whole heartedly, but i do not support the general public owning nukes and this is why,if a person flips out with a gun or has an accident millions dont die as a result.Also it is a lot easier to learn to operate a gun than a nuke,I have seen lots of people at the range practicing with their guns but i have never seen anyone practicing with a nuke.As far as the knife vs gun scenerios,i will take the gun everytime.Now if someone gets the drop on you with a gun,unless you are real quick to duck and dive out of the way,having a gun of your own is probably not going to do you any good because you will probably be shot before you can get to your gun.And if someone gets close enough to you to use a knife, unless you are a woman he wants to rape,he will probably kill you first and then take what he wants with no chance of there being an altercation.So if having your own gun does no good in these scenarios,what makes you think that meelees and pepper spray and tasers will do any better.Best course of action is to stay out of areas where this is most likely to happen.There is nothing full proof in this world,but in areas where crime does not happen everyday your odds of someone getting the drop on you with a gun or knife is highly decreased, and thus having your own gun and being able to get to it first is highly increased. Why,because most criminals in high crime areas a very smart and cunning compared to the criminals in areas where crime is not an everyday thing.Its a little thing called street smarts.Now if all the good guys had guns it would all but negate the above scenarios because if someone got the drop on me,chances are that someone might get the drop on the bad guy before he could accomplish his intentions and might distract him long enough for me to get to my gun.",

And gun control isn't purely about 'self defence', but 'self-defence by means of a lethal weapon'.

I wonder how the veterans felt, I'm sure betrayed but hey so what, it's just your rights.... \n \n \nOh, and I don't see how my mentality affects the validity of my logic, unless I base my logic on my mentality...\n\n \n Because this is and agenda that has been pushed into your psyche. It was never an issue until those in power manipulated your mind. Back in the day it would've been an accident if someone was accidentally killed by a gun, now you've been made to believe that it was intentional, and that civilians have no place owning a gun, and that the Gov't should see to it that these controls are enforced. Sounds like you want a police state to me. I'm sorry but I wouldn't feel safer living in a society where only cops, and criminals gave guns. Usually what happens in those societies is that the fine line that distinguishes the 2 erases rather quickly.\n \n\n See previous topics where I have questioned the existence of 'human rights' - I only accept that a 'right' exists if it can be justified under the conditions of the time/place.

EFFECTIVELY... And as far as lethally defending myself goes, hey I wouldn't be looking for it so if you decide that today is a good day to assault or kill me, especially if I am with family, then I can defend myself accordingly which means to neutralize the threat as quick, and as effectively as possible. This means keeping distance to prevent bodily injury, as well as have the stopping power on hand, and more than one chance to utilize it so if I miss I don't use up my only \"alloted\" defense.\n \n \nYou're right that gun control isn't about guns, however, but 'control' is a secondary matter, a means to an end.

Look at Iraq, it's the Vietnam of my generation!\n \n \n \nI imagine that if we were under direct attack there would be emergency measures introduced, just as the patriot act has been forced through US courts under the excuse of a perceived threat...\n \n\n Yeah like \"if you aren't enlisted then you need to go to one of these civilian camps until we have everything under control. If you are enlisted then await your orders....\" Sorry in case of national emergency I am flying solo. Remember the Jews in Auschwitz thought they were all just going to take \"showers\".... I don't trust the Gov't. Neither should you. Remember a Gov't large enough to give you everything can take it all away.\n \n \n\n ...you're comparing the holocaust with gun control?

It allows for vigilantism and a lynch mob mentality, and gives a media-swayed public the power to take the law into their own definitions.\n\n \n It's the best example of the 20th century. Here are a \"few\" more:\n http://jpfo.org/filegen-a-m/deathgc.htm#dgc\n Here are some great quoted from very famous people:\n \n \"The most brilliant propagandist technique will yield no success unless one fundamental principle is borne in mind constantly . . . it must confine itself to a few points and repeat them over and over.\" - Joseph Goebbels, Nazi Minister of Propaganda\n \n \"The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by doing so\" --Adolph Hitler.\n \n \"All military type firearms are to be handed in immediately...The SS, SA and Stahlhelm give every responsible opportunity of campaigning with them. Therefore anyone who does not belong to one of the above-named organizations and who unjustifiably nevertheless keeps his weapon...must be regarded as an enemy of the national government.\" -- SA Oberfuhrer of Bad Tolz, March, 1933.\n \n \"If you wish the sympathy of the broad masses, you must tell them the crudest and most stupid things.\" - Adolph Hitler\n \n \n\n I seriously doubt that you could prevent a government like the US government from becoming tyrannical. You over-estimate the power that guns give you, especially against large, well trained, well-equipped and well-organised armies.\n\n \n Funny those Vietcong boys sure seemed to be able to handle themselves alright.

Unfortunately people's minds here were swayed in that direction. 9/11 was pretty near, and dear to the majority of the country so when we saw the towers fall, of course we were mad.

If you're trying to make a political argument then guns have very little place short of armed revolution. Would you do that?\n\n \n Tell that to Mao Tse Tung.

Sure the scenario is dire, and most likely won't happen, but is it possible.... I think we all know the answer. Also have you ever heard of the New World Order? It may sound like some conspiracy theory, and much of it may be just theory, but everything that has to do with this term is absolutely negative! It truly brought to fruition it would be sold as a good thing, and many a sheeple would buy into it. The mere fact that an America president said so on national TV says a lot.

   "In cities where the average citizen doesn't have the same rights as the one that can carry. I have never been a victim of violent crime, so as far as your \"immense crime rates\" go....\n\n \n Maybe not, but given that your population is something like 4 times ours, your actual number of crimes must be something like 80x higher than ours, which is downright terrifying... \n \n \nI believe you. Trust me I never bought into all the hype that our media spewed to us. All the more reason to be armed. When you know that your gov't is deliberately lying to you not only to not only to start a war, but to infringe on your rights in the process under the guise of \"security\", this is when you know things are wrong. Better to be prepared. A brilliant man once said \"Those that trade liberty for security deserve neither\"\n\n \n \"He who would trade a little liberty to gain a little security, will deserve neither, and loose both\" is the actual quote, but fair enough. I'm not sure how being armed relates to your government lying to you. It is the nature of the media to exagerate (sp?), and it is the nature of politicians to lie. What does this have to do with guns?\n \n \nYeah as much zeal as your gov't allows you to have/display. If they felt threatened believe me you'd see jack boots. \n\n \n I find it quite amusing to think that our politicians would have the balls to try and deploy the army. They'd never do it, and if they tried, the army wouldn't obey. Anyway, have you considered the fact that we don't have guns might be the reason that there isn't a stronger government crack down on these things? Our politics, in fact our entire nation, isn't as zealous as yours. We're happy to protest, and we're happy to even use force, but it's not really necessary at the moment. If they tried to introduce Sharia, then you'd see what can be done. At the moment however there aren't any issues worth getting that fired up about.\n \n \nUh wishful thinking, do you live in the real world?\n\n \n Yes. Do you?\n \n \nI think they'd be a little more like \"never forget this son, we must prevent this from ever happening again.\" \n\n \n Yes they would. And what they saught to prevent was the tyranny of a minority of zealots being enforced over everybody. What does that have to do with guns? How does having a gun help prevent this? I'd argue that having guns everywhere makes it easier for a passionate minority to take over.\n \n \nI think the Israelis took words akin to these very seriously as they were the victims of this dreadful time in history. Every Israeli is armed! \n\n \n The Israeli's aren't armed because they think Hitler and his ilk are still after them. They're armed because thier country is continually at war, and they are surrounded by people who don't like them very much. It's also because they base thier society on militaristic Zionist principles, which requires them to fight to preserve thier conquest.\n \n \nWhich means they act as a clean up crew to pick up your entrails after you've been knifed to death! They really can't protect you much either. Unless once they have been able to identify that you're dead, and the killer decides to stay for coffee, then maybe a \"tactical team\" will be able to respond just in time to \"read him his rights\" Seems to me the criminal has more than the tax paying citizen.\n\n \n And this kinda proves that you haven't got a clue about the British Police. The police do protect people, but bearing in mind this epidemic of stabbing is based around the gangland culture of the council estates, there's rarely a policeman anywhere near the scene. They're good at catching people though (as a rule), and bearing in mind the police's main deterent is that they'll catch you and lock you up for ages that's what they are meant to do. \n \n \nYou said it, \"as of yet\"\n\n \n It's a bit like waiting for Armageddon. As of yet it hasn't happened, and there's not much reason to believe it will. When it starts then we'll deal with it. Our I don't think our day to day police have ever carried guns.... \n \n \n \nAnd.... So did Alexander the Great, so did the English in South Africa. Them owning slaves has nothing to do with their incredible foresight. \n\n \n They didn't have the foresight to see that slavery was wrong. Perhaps they also held some other wrong opinions....\n \n \nUh, we voted to have the war. Unfortunately people's minds here were swayed in that direction. 9/11 was pretty near, and dear to the majority of the country so when we saw the towers fall, of course we were mad. Not to mention that allegedly Osama had taken the blame so it gave us reason to go to war and of course the public blinded by patriotism, and outrage went to war. We ar egreting it now but I hope this answers your question.\n\n \n You voted for the war in Afghanistan, and that I can understand. However Iraq seems to never have been that popular. My point is that you're arguing that guns allow you (pl) to enforce your will on the government when it's not performing your will. Where's the popular action against the Iraq war?\n \n \nTo each his own. For me, better to be safe than sorry.\n\n \n Far enough...\n \n \nTell that to Mao Tse Tung. I believe he is quoted saying \"Political power grow from the barrel of a gun\" he couldn't be more right. I mean diplomatically speaking it isn't the preferred method, but in the end he's unfortunately right. \n\n \n Only if those who bear arms are prepared to use them to enforce political ends. Again I ask, are you?\n \n \nAny Gov't is capable of anything, the same way You are capable of monstrosities. If for whatever reason there was some sort of economic collapse, and order was lost YOU WOULD pick up a gun to hunt and feed your family, and if threatened YOU WOULD KILL to ensure your survival! Sure the scenario is dire, and most likely won't happen, but is it possible.... I think we all know the answer. Also have you ever heard of the New World Order? It may sound like some conspiracy theory, and much of it may be just theory, but everything that has to do with this term is absolutely negative! It truly brought to fruition it would be sold as a good thing, and many a sheeple would buy into it. The mere fact that an America president said so on national TV says a lot. I sure you'll discredit it though. Nope nothing to worry about.\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a9Syi12RJo\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5cqh26CC0\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvEqg_UlGaA&feature=related\n\n \n I'm convinced some people believe it. However I'm not sure what I'm meant to be scared of. I've seen lots of people going OMG! Secret Government! Evil Slavery Plans! We must resist! I saw the same thing on the X-files... If you're defending your right to bear arms on the basis of the Shadow Government plotting to take over then I suggest you see a psychiatrist. \n \n \nI'm sure you would be amused. It would be wonderful to see people clinging on to their last hopes for freedom only to have it all shot down as one by one they are annihilated because they were told to follow, and not resist. \n\n \n The point of the amusement is that you lot seem convinced that you're an elite bunch who'll swat the puny attempts of the Federal Government to disarm you. My amusement stems from your realisation that your gun isn't enough to keep you safe from a government that really wants to dictate to you. Do you seriously believe that your gun is your \"last hope[s] for freedom\"? Freedom is evidently a very shallow concept to you... \n \n \nThe mean while cowards such as yourself wait, and are happy that they don't have to die, that day anyways.\n \n \n I'm guessing you also liked \"The Patriot\" by Mel, huh....\n \n \nHave you ever seen \"Brave Heart\"? If not then you should. You might learn something from it.\n\n \n Yes. I also know the true story of William Wallace not that work of fiction that Mel 'I don't have a damn clue about history' Gibson put together. Here's a tip. If you want to understand these things, don't believe the movies, particularly to anything made by him....\n \n \n \nThere isn't as many Mujahadeen (correct term) as the media might have you think. \n\n \n Actually Mujahadeen is the term for a specific group of Jihadiis. A Jihadii is someone who is on a Jihad. I personally belive they exist, because I've heard thier propaganda, and seen thier work...\n \n \nHave you ever read the story of Alexander the Great? \n \n \n Yes. To which bit do you refer?\n \n \nWhat about the real accounts of the Battle of Thermopile?\n\n \n Thermopylae? Yes. Again, not sure what you're hoping to show through this...\n \n \nWhat about the Revolutionary War that happened in the USA?\n\n \n Again, yes. And again, I'm not sure what you're trying to show....\n \n \nWhat about the Vietnam War?\n\n \n Again yes. Is it a good point to say that I'm a military historian in my spare time? Again, your point? Would you like me to go through these and point out why none of them have any relevance to the modern situation?\n \n \nIf you say you can't, then you're right, you can't, If you say you can then the sky is the limit. \n \n \n Please demonstrate you can fly without any technological support....\n \n \nYou seem to have lost your human spirit, your refusal to submit. There are robots, and there are humans. Which one are you?\n\n \n I'm guessing you also loved the Terminator movies. As far as I'm concerned, I will resist, to the death if necessary, things that are worth resisting. I don't see how your determination to hold onto your guns falls into that category.\n \n As far as I can tell from this post, you're justifying holding onto your guns on the basis that you want to be ready to resist when the New World Order is formally unvieled.

And to say that you don't know black man that's favorite band is Pink Floyd doesn't mean D!@#. In fact just spewing this ignoramus nonsense would lead one to believe that you probably don't know a single black man period. And the credit isn't being directed to individual artist genius, it's being directed to a country, the culture within the country, and the cultural influence that the respective country brought to the world. It's been said many times that England gave the Beetles, Stones etc. to the world. We gave Stevie, Marvin, John, and Miles. If you don't understand the entirety of the post then you need to repeat your equivalent of elementary/middle school English comprehension.

On the special features page there&#8217;s a list of all the 60&#8217;s British Bands. It&#8217;s 7 pages long. Also even if you did produce more, you haven&#8217;t got close to the influence of those two I&#8217;ve already mentioned. America&#8217;s only produced one star on that level, and the Beatles were still more popular than Elvis\n \nAnd.... We abolished slavery as well.... \n\n 60 or so years later, as a mainly political move to prevent European intervention in a war that the North wasn&#8217;t certain it could win. We did it worldwide.\n \nUh we are still more armed. Do some research. And it's not 16, it's 18. \n\n I&#8217;m still waiting for someone to explain how being able to carry a gun makes you more free.\n \nAgain you miss the point. We know it came from oppression.

I am talking about real technology, not commercial kid stuff. \n\n So you&#8217;re saying America&#8217;s the world leader because you&#8217;re only counting American technology? Nice NTS argument. You&#8217;re bound to win! Whether you like it or not Japan is ahead in the fields of robotics and technology research.\n \nThat's why we have at least 702 bases (Pentagon estimates up to 1,000), in 130 countries, as well as 6,000 bases at home/home territories. The Pentagon claims that these bases contain 44,870 barracks, hangars, hospitals, and other buildings, which it owns, and that it leases 4,844 more. \n\n You&#8217;ve got a lot of influence. Congratulations...\n \nWe rule the world. I am not particularly proud of this, but you wanted to see it so there you go. \n No, you think you own the world. There&#8217;s the catch and the danger. I&#8217;ll admit that America&#8217;s been the only super-power for the last 15 years or so, but you have no direct authority (which you have to have to be considered rulers) and your time at the top is passing. Don&#8217;t worry, it happens to everybody in the end....\n \nActually you guys were the precursor to why English is spoken world wide. \n\n Wrong... English is spoken worldwide because it was the trade language in the 17 and 1800&#8217;s.\n \nWe hold that rightful claim seeing how we saved all of Europe from the Nazi's, as well as taking on Japan. You're welcome by the way! \n\n You really, really, don&#8217;t want to pull that &#8216;America uber alles&#8217; #### on me... Yes you helped, but you didn&#8217;t save Europe from the Nazi&#8217;s. You didn&#8217;t even save us. Read a history book not written by someone who thinks like Chuck Yeager. Hitler abandoned his invasion plans of the UK after the RAF (with 1 American squadron) defeated the Luftwaffe (15th September 1940). The Americans didn&#8217;t officially get involved until December 7th 1941. As regards Europe, US help was probably needed. We probably could have managed it calling on all our resources, but it&#8217;d have taken a lot longer. The likely scenario is that Stalin would have taken most of Europe. \n \n As far as Japan goes, that was your war! We were involved through our colonies, but their aggression was aimed at you. I&#8217;m not as worried (from a historical perspective) at the concept of Japan taking over as I was the Nazis.\n \nAs far as you being responsible for the creation of the US, well again you were a precursor. The undying human spirit that refuses to submit to aristocratic, elitist, pompous, self centered, and egocentric tyrants (such as England at the time) is what led to the creation of the US of A! \n\n No, the concept of taxes to fund our ongoing wars against France is what lead to the creation of the USA. That and the fact that we wouldn&#8217;t give you seats in Parliament.... I personally find it hilarious when you Americans claim to have an undying human spirit, whilst at the same time being the home of mass consumerism and mass media, two of the most soul-crushing inventions of man.\n \n You all don't hold claim to anything seeing how we kicked your asses. Not bad for farmers, and revolutionary militias. \n\n I never said you lot didn&#8217;t know how to fight...\n \nAnd please spare me your \"we abolished slavery...\" rhetoric. We finally abolished slavery in December 1865. You guys outlawed it in 1807, and finally abolished it in 1833. So much for your 100 years. \n\n So it was 60 years... Sue me....

(white and black slavery, wow). \n\n Contrary to popular belief we didn&#8217;t invent the concentration camp. That honour belongs to the Spanish. But yes, we had them. The Nazi&#8217;s even threw that in our faces when we started asking questions. They weren&#8217;t however slave camps. They were concentration camps, i.e. we used them to concentrate the Boer population, so we could stop them trying to shoot us. They were nasty and unsanitary, but the people in them weren&#8217;t slaves...\n \nFor those of you who don't know about England's dark little history over in S.Africa just check this out http://www.britannia.com/history/naremphist8.html, scroll past British India. Not bad for a \"yank\" huh. \n\n You speak like it&#8217;s a dirty secret. I knew about it. I&#8217;d have told you if you asked. I&#8217;m not defending the British Empire from its bad deeds, but I am highlighting its good deeds. I wasn&#8217;t aware that &#8216;Yank&#8217; had a negative connotation... \n \n Unfortunately this kind of history isn't taught in our public schools. I uncovered this while studying fascism on my own when I was in high school. I guess my interest in interest in militaria sparked the interest to learn about other countries conquest, pit falls etc. \n\n Sadly it&#8217;s not taught in ours either. It&#8217;s a pity as it&#8217;s vital to understand these things to understand the world as it is. It&#8217;s good to see that other people find military history as interesting as me, which is why I didn&#8217;t understand your references to various wars in #88.\n \nAnyways you were just owned, I hope you had fun. Check mate. emoticon_cool \n\n Pointing out that we had concentration camps? That&#8217;s hardly &#8216;owned&#8217;. When you make a point that I can&#8217;t answer, then you can call me owned. And yes, I am having fun thanks emoticon_xgood \n \nHonestly I haven't even seen it. It's already a few pages back, and I've been pretty active on this thread. I'll take a look at it and get back. \n\n Please do...\n \n I must admit that I&#8217;d like to move back to the original topic. I have the feeling that we&#8217;re hardly going to agree on the various cultural arguments (given that we both seem reasonably nationalistic), and this will just degenerate into a slanging match.

   "Maybe not, but given that your population is something like 4 times ours, your actual number of crimes must be something like 80x higher than ours, which is downright terrifying... \n\n \n 6 times larger, so your exaggerated \"80x\" higher is out the window. Also, like I aforementioned the highest crimes are in the most restrictive states. I won't reiterate this.\n \n \n \n\n \"He who would trade a little liberty to gain a little security, will deserve \n neither, and loose both\" is the actual quote, but fair enough. I'm not sure how being armed relates to your government lying to you. It is the nature of the media to exagerate (sp?), and it is the nature of politicians to lie. What does this have to do with guns?\n\n \n HA HA HA If I really need to explain this to you....\n \n \n \n \nI find it quite amusing to think that our politicians would have the balls to try and deploy the army. They'd never do it, and if they tried, the army wouldn't obey.\n \n \n Yeah because it's never happened right.... Governments aren't capable of these things emoticon_rolleyes First off never say never. Second don't say that the army wouldn't obey. Just because you think they wouldn't doesn't mean they wouldn't. Soldiers take orders. If there was a huge moral dilemma in the hearts and minds of young men (soldiers) then the majority of enlisted men (at least in the USA) wouldn't fight, but to your surprise we have a full blown war going on in the middle east with you guys, as well as other allied forces. By now the moral of troops is a bit stagnant. They are there because they have been ordered to be, not because they want to, or because they think they're doing a good thing (at least not anymore) otherwise there'd be huge amounts of court martialing being done. Remember Nazi's were patriotic, and very proud of their peoples right? Everything was being done for the greater good of Germany right.... How would such proud, nationalistic men be capable of such things, surely they had family and friends right? I am sure that many had Jewish neighbors as well....\n \n \n\n Anyway, have you considered the fact that we don't have guns might be the reason that there isn't a stronger government crack down on these things?\n\n \n LOL, did you enjoy your brain washing for the day? Don't you just love how much trust your Gov't has in you... I guess the law of your land is \"If the Gov't says we can\"\n \n \n \nOur politics, in fact our entire nation, isn't as zealous as yours.\n \n \n What can we say... You had your turn. \n \n \nWe're happy to protest, and we're happy to even use force, but it's not really necessary at the moment. If they tried to introduce Sharia, then you'd see what can be done. At the moment however there aren't any issues worth getting that fired up about.\n\n \n Yeah emoticon_rolleyes OK... Except that if true Sharia was evoked then they would have guns already. Remember Sharia is spread with a sword! Not with kind words like like the Buddha, or J.C.! You could always convert you know....\n \n \n \n \n \nYes. Do you?\n\n \n .....\n \n \n \n\n Yes they would. And what they saught to prevent was the tyranny of a minority of zealots being enforced over everybody. What does that have to do with guns? How does having a gun help prevent this? I'd argue that having guns everywhere makes it easier for a passionate minority to take over. \n \n \n How does having a gun help prevent this.... Lets see WWII happens and \"oh no all of Europe is disarmed, they'll never stop the German's\" Ten years later Sprechen ze English, haha good one Heinrich, or \"Proceedings of the Nuremberg trials are to begin.\" I think guns solved the impending issue of that time. Oh how about this one during WWII: \"We cannot invade the mainland US, there would be a rifle behind every blade of grass!\" -Admiral Yamamoto Nope, they did nothing at all besides preventing any axis power from stepping foot on our soil! And if what you were saying were true about guns everywhere making it easier for the impassioned minority to take over then then why hasn't it happened here yet? We did have an assault weapons ban during the Clinton years... Why didn't we act like the criminals anti gunners portray gun owners to be? \n \n \n \nThe Israeli's aren't armed because they think Hitler and his ilk are still after them.\n\n \n Well of course not, but to say that it hasn't taught them a lesson is to say the same as black people in the US don't have some type of chip on their shoulder, or are a bit weary because of the way they were treated. It just isn't true. The holocaust didn't happen that long ago.\n \n \n They're armed because thier country is continually at war, and they are surrounded by people who don't like them very much. It's also because they base thier society on militaristic Zionist principles, which requires them to fight to preserve thier conquest.\n\n \n This is true.\n \n \n \n \nAnd this kinda proves that you haven't got a clue about the British Police. The police do protect people, but bearing in mind this epidemic of stabbing is based around the gangland culture of the council estates, there's rarely a policeman anywhere near the scene.\n \n \n Which would indicate that the police aren't really there to serve and protect, unless you are of a higher \"class\". Oh and what's this a \"gangland\" culture, well I sure hope some decent hard working, tax paying family doesn't live too close to such undesirables people. WAIT!!! Not to worry, you guys don't have guns so you're going to be safe with those hard core bobby's that won't even patrol the bad areas. I'm sure that those no good gang members don't have guns either emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n They're good at catching people though (as a rule), and bearing in mind the police's main deterent is that they'll catch you and lock you up for ages that's what they are meant to do. \n\n \n I know, they sure caught that poor Brazilian guy with a bullet. He was just trying to run. They didn't have to kill him... Job well done I guess.... Maybe I shouldn't go to England, after all my skin is brown, and I look like.... (a foreigner, non-Caucasian.) This is between you and I Ok! (There's a XXXXX on this thread that thinks I am white) At least you were right about your cops though, they put his poor XXX away for \"life\". Although it would be stupid to blame the inanimate gun.... I blame the officer,and his judgment, as well as England's bogus gun laws. Maybe that officer didn't have proper training with a firearm seeing as he capped the poor guy almost instantly according to reports.\n \n \n \nIt's a bit like waiting for Armageddon. As of yet it hasn't happened, and there's not much reason to believe it will. When it starts then we'll deal with it. Our I don't think our day to day police have ever carried guns.... \n\n \n So there is something wrong with being prepared? Just because it might not ever happen doesn't mean it won't any again I a the type that would rather be safe than sorry.\n \n \n\n They didn't have the foresight to see that slavery was wrong. Perhaps they also held some other wrong opinions....\n\n \n Nice try emoticon_xhoho Although they proved why it was essential, and so have scores of other people throughout the history of our race.\n \n \n \n \nYou voted for the war in Afghanistan, and that I can understand. However Iraq seems to never have been that popular. My point is that you're arguing that guns allow you (pl) to enforce your will on the government when it's not performing your will. Where's the popular action against the Iraq war?\n\n \n Yes we voted for Afghanistan, but with America's patriotism, and Nationalism (there they go again) running a muck, it is easy to see how people jumped all over Iraq and the whole WMD garbage. Fear is a powerful tool. Honestly you must be able to see how your dumb average Joe (which is a lot in the states) can be easily manipulated to \"go with the flow\" especially if it happened to be the leader of your respective party. In the US it's pretty sad to say they for the most part if you are Republican, then everything a Democrat says is liberal hog wash, and vice versa. Soooo if you happened to vote for a Republican, and your leader wants war well.... most people supported it. It is very unfortunate. People had no reason to \"revolt\" because it wasn't directly affecting them. If gas was to continue going up to the point where people couldn't feed their families anymore then I am sure people wouldn't put up with it, and they would take to the streets. If not then I would gladly give up my guns seeing how I can't do anything alone. Then I'd leave the country.\n \n \n Far enough...\n \n \n\n \n Only if those who bear arms are prepared to use them to enforce political ends. Again I ask, are you?\n\n \n If the people of this country would stand up then you had better believe it! I am not afraid to die. I would just be afraid for my family, and friends.\n \n \n\n I'm convinced some people believe it. However I'm not sure what I'm meant to be scared of. I've seen lots of people going OMG! Secret Government! Evil Slavery Plans! We must resist! I saw the same thing on the X-files... If you're defending your right to bear arms on the basis of the Shadow Government plotting to take over then I suggest you see a psychiatrist. \n\n \n Hahaha. Of course that's not the only reason, although that was our founding father's reasoning. \n \n\n The point of the amusement is that you lot seem convinced that you're an elite bunch who'll swat the puny attempts of the Federal Government to disarm you. My amusement stems from your realisation that your gun isn't enough to keep you safe from a government that really wants to dictate to you. Do you seriously believe that your gun is your \"last hope[s] for freedom\"? Freedom is evidently a very shallow concept to you... \n\n \n Well if I was ever to use my gun in this context then I guess it would be my \"last hope\" now wouldn't it. How many protest have you seen in China, or Russia? Oh wait, Burma! How about them? That peaceful protest sure worked didn't it. Oh and having a gun doesn't mean I am free. It means that I have a means to preserve it if all else fails, and if the gun fails, at least I tried. I wouldn't be led off to a camp, or some other facility. I would die as a free man making my own choice to fight or run! This is what freedom mean my friend.\n \n \n\n I'm guessing you also liked \"The Patriot\" by Mel, huh....\n\n \n Yeah it was good, but Brave Heart was better.\n \n \n \n \nYes. I also know the true story of William Wallace not that work of fiction that Mel 'I don't have a damn clue about history' Gibson put together. Here's a tip. If you want to understand these things, don't believe the movies, particularly to anything made by him....\n\n \n Yeah I used the movie as a reference point because without it most people probably wouldn't know who he was. I have 3 books on him including one that focuses solely on his military campaigns. The movie was just to give a familiar example to most of what I am talking about.\n \n \n \n \n\n Actually Mujahadeen is the term for a specific group of Jihadiis. A Jihadii is someone who is on a Jihad. I personally belive they exist, because I've heard thier propaganda, and seen thier work...\n\n \n Not really. The term \"Jihadi\" reeks of westernization. It's Mujahadeen. This means holy warrior. Mujahadeen is all encompassing.\n \n \n \n \nAgain yes. Is it a good point to say that I'm a military historian in my spare time? Again, your point? Would you like me to go through these and point out why none of them have any relevance to the modern situation?\n\n \n The point was to show that a small number of people can over come overwhelming odds. And you don't have to go through anything. it wasn't a direct comparison, and an exact strategy. Every fight/war is different. This is why I posted examples from different countries/eras. The point is that there is always a chance.\n \n \n \n\n Please demonstrate you can fly without any technological support....\n\n \n It was figurative, and with this way of thinking it's amazing how we are even able to fly right now. I wonder how many times prospective aviators were rejected, and called crazy before they actually took to the skies.\n \n \n \n\n I'm guessing you also loved the Terminator movies. As far as I'm concerned, I will resist, to the death if necessary, things that are worth resisting. I don't see how your determination to hold onto your guns falls into that category.\n\n \n Are you sure you read military history? And as far as the terminator goes, again it was figurative. I was referring to \"the ghost in the machine\", your soul! \n \n \nAs far as I can tell from this post, you're justifying holding onto your guns on the basis that you want to be ready to resist when the New World Order is formally unvieled. Is that accurate?\n\n \n Not so much. I hold on to them because I can have them, so why not! I like to shoot, I train as often as I can, and like the old saying goes \"knowledge is power\". I would rather now how to operate one than not know anything at all, and become another statistic that can feed the anti-gun furnace. Seeing as how I have this knowledge now, I know to keep guns locked up separately from ammo. I know to always assume that the gun is loaded, therefore checking it instead of leaving it unattended, and not knowing if it's armed! I not how to take it apart, put it together, maintain it, and use it if I ever have to, fro any reason. Think about it this way. If you were at the park, and saw a couple of 13 year old boys gathered around a bush, and to your surprise a deserted semi-auto pistol lay there for God knows how long. You'll either (A) Hold on boys let me see if I can get someone to help, (B) Let me see that, BANG!!! oops, I didn't know it didn't have a safety...., or (C) I'll take care of this guys, (takes pistol with proper grip, drops the magazine, pulls back slide to extract potentially chambered round.\n \n I think you know which answer is the right one.",

   "6 times larger, so your exaggerated \"80x\" higher is out the window. Also, like I aforementioned the highest crimes are in the most restrictive states. I won't reiterate this.\n\n So if your population is 6 times higher, that means the actual number of crimes is even more than 80x higher.... I'm not arguing about where they occur, just the fact that the culture is pervasive.\n \nHA HA HA If I really need to explain this to you....\n\n Please do..... If you have so little faith in your political system then that would suggest you need an overhaul.\n \n Yeah because it's never happened right.... Governments aren't capable of these things emoticon_rolleyes \n\n Governments are. Anyone who has seen what happens in the world understands that. However people in the UK are actually reasonably good at keeping a check on things. For a start our politics are not based on money, which keeps people a bit more grounded.\n \n First off never say never. \n\n Our political system as it is now wouldn't countenance it. We're also pretty good at stopping excessive political change (see EU).\n \n Second don't say that the army wouldn't obey. Just because you think they wouldn't doesn't mean they wouldn't. Soldiers take orders. \n\n They do, but our tactical set up is more flexible than the rigidity of the US. We have more responsibility at the company level than most US battalions. More akin to the set up of the US Rangers. There's also the fact that the Forces are sworn to the sovereign, not parliament.\n \n If there was a huge moral dilemma in the hearts and minds of young men (soldiers) then the majority of enlisted men (at least in the USA) wouldn't fight, but to your surprise we have a full blown war going on in the middle east with you guys, as well as other allied forces. By now the moral of troops is a bit stagnant. They are there because they have been ordered to be, not because they want to, or because they think they're doing a good thing (at least not anymore) otherwise there'd be huge amounts of court martialing being done. \n\n True, but if most of the troops didn't want to fight; there'd be no way they could be compelled through sheer number of occurrences. Most soldiers I know believe they're there doing a good job, and their fighting to protect people at home and in Iraq/Afghanistan. \n \nRemember Nazi's were patriotic, and very proud of their peoples right? Everything was being done for the greater good of Germany right.... How would such proud, nationalistic men be capable of such things, surely they had family and friends right? I am sure that many had Jewish neighbors as well....\n\n I'm sure they did. In fact as often as not it was the neighbours who condemned people in order to prove their loyalty. No offence, but I'd say we're more familiar over here, on a national level, with the NAZI's rise to power. It's part of the GCSE history program. The circumstances of Hitler's rise to power are very specific, and as we have a much centred political consensus, it'd be easy to notice that sort of shift. Notice how the BNP are reviled.\n \nLOL, did you enjoy your brain washing for the day? Don't you just love how much trust your Gov't has in you... I guess the law of your land is \"If the Gov't says we can\"\n\n Isn't that the law of every democratic land? I'm guessing you either haven't considered it, or you don't believe it. Think about it this way. If people have guns, and are determined to resist (after a democratic process) then you have to crack down hard to enforce the law (tactical squads and such). If people don't have guns (in the same process) then a lighter hand can be used to enforce the law. Responsibility then devolves onto the people to ensure there is no abuse of this system. I suppose it boils down to trusting your compatriots, rather than the government.\n \nWhat can we say... You had your turn. \n\n So you think zeal is, by definition, a good thing? I imagine you can guess what I'd say to that.\n \nYeah emoticon_rolleyes OK... Except that if true Sharia was evoked then they would have guns already. Remember Sharia is spread with a sword! Not with kind words like like the Buddha, or J.C.! You could always convert you know....\n\n Read Matthew 10-34. Think not that I came to bring peace, but a sword.... Again, I know that Sharia is impossible to enact without support, and that support is easy to keep an eye on and control.\n \nHow does having a gun help prevent this.... Lets see WWII happens and \"oh no all of Europe is disarmed, they'll never stop the German's\" Ten years later Sprechen ze English, haha good one Heinrich, or \"Proceedings of the Nuremberg trials are to begin.\" I think guns solved the impending issue of that time. \n\n I'm a little disappointed that someone who's interested and studies history has ignored the fact that Europe was largely disarmed in the '30s. Also there's the fact that instances of civil resistance were put down ruthlessly, and achieved little. I can however accept that a gun would be a thing to have if you felt under threat from some foreign power. Do you?\n \n Oh how about this one during WWII: \"We cannot invade the mainland US, there would be a rifle behind every blade of grass!\" -Admiral Yamamoto. Nope, they did nothing at all besides preventing any axis power from stepping foot on our soil! And if what you were saying were true about guns everywhere making it easier for the impassioned minority to take over then then why hasn't it happened here yet? \n\n There's also the fact that the Japanese didn't have anywhere near the army to invade mainland US. That's why they tried to smash US power at Pearl Harbour. Oh, and as you insisted on bringing up concentration camps, did you also research what happened to Japanese-Americans during the war? Is this quote referring to domestic weapon possession or to the size of the forces America could field in event of invasion (the concept of the US home militias)? I always assumed the latter.\n \nWe did have an assault weapons ban during the Clinton years... Why didn't we act like the criminals anti gunners portray gun owners to be? \n\n Because the 'anti-gunners' are as capable of stereotyping as anyone else.\n \nWell of course not, but to say that it hasn't taught them a lesson is to say the same as black people in the US don't have some type of chip on their shoulder, or are a bit weary because of the way they were treated. It just isn't true. The holocaust didn't happen that long ago.\n\n Actually in terms of mistreatment, the Jews make African Americans look like noobs... That said I don't know that I've met many AA's who have a proper chip on their shoulder. You'd probably had more experience however. As I say, I think the Israeli's carry guns due to the environment they live in, as much as from history. If it was from the point of history, then why didn't the Jews arm themselves after they were evicted from most of Europe in the 13th/14th centuries?\n \nWhich would indicate that the police aren't really there to serve and protect, unless you are of a higher \"class\". Oh and what's this a \"gangland\" culture, well I sure hope some decent hard working, tax paying family doesn't live too close to such undesirables people. WAIT!!! Not to worry, you guys don't have guns so you're going to be safe with those hard core bobby's that won't even patrol the bad areas. I'm sure that those no good gang members don't have guns either emoticon_rolleyes \n\n That point was more about the fact that these stabbings are occurring in places where the police stretched thin dealing with other problems. The police do patrol those areas (or the perps would never be caught). Think about it this way, the main reason the knife rather the gun is the WOC is the fact that guns are expensive due to the need to avoid the law. If guns were cheap (say $80) then the gangland culture would be a warzone. \n \nI know, they sure caught that poor Brazilian guy with a bullet. He was just trying to run. They didn't have to kill him... Job well done I guess.... Maybe I shouldn't go to England, after all my skin is brown, and I look like.... (a foreigner, non-Caucasian.) This is between you and I Ok! (There's a XXXXX on this thread that thinks I am white) At least you were right about your cops though, they put his poor XXX away for \"life\". \n\n Please only sling insults at scenarios you fully understand. The case of Jean Charles de Menezes was a sad one. It was a case of mis-identification which ended tragically. I've never understood why he ran, because when someone points a gun at me I stand still. The cop was acting to protect the people around him, and was trying to save lives. He now has to live with the knowledge that he killed an innocent man. Also, you may be trying to make a joke, but the assessment that our cops shoot at anyone who's not white is quite frankly insuting...\n \nAlthough it would be stupid to blame the inanimate gun.... I blame the officer,and his judgment, as well as England's bogus gun laws. Maybe that officer didn't have proper training with a firearm seeing as he capped the poor guy almost instantly according to reports. \n\n Did I blame the gun? I suggest you make sure you know the facts before you pass judgement. De Menezes happened to live in the same block of flats as someone under police surveillance, and somehow the police got tasked onto him rather than the guy they were meant to. This gent then proceeded to the tube (Metro) and was marked going onto a train with a backpack. I think he'd already been challenged and was running (probably out of fear). The officers boarded the train and tried to arrest him. He moved, and because the officer thought he was going to activate an IED, the officer shot him repeatedly in the head to obliterate the brain stem. This of course was to prevent him moving even after a fatal single wound. It's a terrible tragedy, but it was an accident. And what on earth do Britain's gun laws have to do with it?\n \nSo there is something wrong with being prepared? Just because it might not ever happen doesn't mean it won't any again I a the type that would rather be safe than sorry. \n\n There's nothing wrong with preparedness. It's what you do to prepare that's under question.\n \nNice try emoticon_xhoho Although they proved why it was essential, and so have scores of other people throughout the history of our race. \n\n Sorry you lost me, they proved why what was essential? Slavery, gun ownership or government?\n \n Yes we voted for Afghanistan, but with America's patriotism, and Nationalism (there they go again) running a muck, it is easy to see how people jumped all over Iraq and the whole WMD garbage. Fear is a powerful tool. Honestly you must be able to see how your dumb average Joe (which is a lot in the states) can be easily manipulated to \"go with the flow\" especially if it happened to be the leader of your respective party. \n\n No argument there...\n \n In the US it's pretty sad to say they for the most part if you are Republican, then everything a Democrat says is liberal hog wash, and vice versa. Soooo if you happened to vote for a Republican, and your leader wants war well.... most people supported it. It is very unfortunate. \n \n Isn't that the truth...\n \nPeople had no reason to \"revolt\" because it wasn't directly affecting them. If gas was to continue going up to the point where people couldn't feed their families anymore then I am sure people wouldn't put up with it, and they would take to the streets. If not then I would gladly give up my guns seeing how I can't do anything alone. Then I'd leave the country. \n\n And there you have the exact same thing that would (and indeed will at the current rate of progress) happen here. So why do you need guns?\n \nIf the people of this country would stand up then you had better believe it! I am not afraid to die. I would just be afraid for my family, and friends. \n\n Then your gun is in part a symbol of potential political power? An ultimate authority?\n \nHahaha. Of course that's not the only reason, although that was our founding father's reasoning. \n\n Jefferson was afraid of the X-files? Wow, that guy was good!. Seriously though, guns are meant to be there as the ultimate symbol of the authority of the people?\n \nWell if I was ever to use my gun in this context then I guess it would be my \"last hope\" now wouldn't it. How many protest have you seen in China, or Russia? Oh wait, Burma! How about them? That peaceful protest sure worked didn't it. \n\n True. But if they'd been armed there is the likelihood that Burma would now be in a civil war, or in reprisals, leaving them in a worse state. I don't know enough about China or Russia to comment. I suppose it boils down to a question of maturity of a political system. A mature and developed democratic system needs only vigilance, an immature one needs vigilantes. \n \nOh and having a gun doesn't mean I am free. It means that I have a means to preserve it if all else fails, and if the gun fails, at least I tried. I wouldn't be led off to a camp, or some other facility. I would die as a free man making my own choice to fight or run! This is what freedom mean my friend. \n\n Very John Wayne. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, I personally believe in defending things to the death if need be. I just don't feel the need to be armed now! I'd personally say that freedom is the right to live as you choose (within reason), to be able to look forward to a future where you receive the results of your work, and where you can be certain that no-one has the right to interfere with you or yours without permission or reason.\n \nYeah it was good, but Brave Heart was better. \n\n Oh dear.... emoticon_rolleyes \n \nYeah I used the movie as a reference point because without it most people probably wouldn't know who he was. I have 3 books on him including one that focuses solely on his military campaigns. The movie was just to give a familiar example to most of what I am talking about. \n\n So what was your point? The mere mention of that film is enough to wreck a conversation as far as I'm concerned... emoticon_mad \n \nNot really. The term \"Jihadi\" reeks of westernization. It's Mujahadeen. This means holy warrior. Mujahadeen is all encompassing. \n\n The Imam's over here use Jihadi. That's what I was following, but fair enough.\n \nThe point was to show that a small number of people can over come overwhelming odds. And you don't have to go through anything. it wasn't a direct comparison, and an exact strategy. Every fight/war is different. This is why I posted examples from different countries/eras. The point is that there is always a chance. \n\n But the examples you used didn't really support your point. In every case there were extensive additional factors. From a tactical perspective it'd be interesting to see, but you haven't really got a chance... There's always hope I suppose, but remember the Spartans lost at Thermopylae.\n \nIt was figurative, and with this way of thinking it's amazing how we are even able to fly right now. I wonder how many times prospective aviators were rejected, and called crazy before they actually took to the skies. \n\n I'm not saying people shouldn't be inventive. It's actually by recognising our own limitations that we learn to exceed them. However assuming all things are possible is folly.\n \nAre you sure you read military history? And as far as the terminator goes, again it was figurative. I was referring to \"the ghost in the machine\", your soul! \n\n I'd list my library, but there's not enough room. I loved the terminator movies (well, one and two at least)! As far as robots and men go, I'd argue that anyone who is prepared to stand and debate a point of view openly, and is prepared to educate themselves epitomises the human spirit. I'll leave you to decide where you fit.emoticon_xangel \n \nNot so much. I hold on to them because I can have them, so why not! \n \n And in that is probably the most sensible argument proposed thus far. However it merely starts the cycle again! \n \nI like to shoot, I train as often as I can, and like the old saying goes \"knowledge is power\". I would rather now how to operate one than not know anything at all, and become another statistic that can feed the anti-gun furnace. \n\n Do you accept that the easy availability of guns in the US makes gun crime more likely? I know how to operate both rifles, shotguns and handguns, but I don't feel the need to have one at home. If I want to shoot the rifle club is just down the road.\n \n Seeing as how I have this knowledge now, I know to keep guns locked up separately from ammo. I know to always assume that the gun is loaded, therefore checking it instead of leaving it unattended, and not knowing if it's armed! I not how to take it apart, put it together, maintain it, and use it if I ever have to, fro any reason. \n\n Good. I hope that everyone who owns a gun does. Do you have to pass a proficiency test to own a gun? Or is it merely based on a background check?\n \nThink about it this way. If you were at the park, and saw a couple of 13 year old boys gathered around a bush, and to your surprise a deserted semi-auto pistol lay there for God knows how long. You'll either (A) Hold on boys let me see if I can get someone to help, (B) Let me see that, BANG!!! oops, I didn't know it didn't have a safety...., or (C) I'll take care of this guys, (takes pistol with proper grip, drops the magazine, pulls back slide to extract potentially chambered round. \n\n These days I'd call the police (Ain't mobile phones great!). I could do C if I wished, but I'd rather allow someone professional to do it. Not to mention a randomly disposed gun could well be related to a crime (over here anyway), so I'd not want to contaminate it. Thus I could ensure that everyone is safe, and still not risk there being a fault with the gun leading to accidental discharge.\n \nOh btw would Michael Jackson count? He was pretty big, although not a rock star, but I believe more people fainted at his sight then both British bands, and American? \n\n Did that have anything to do with his music? ;)",

I must admit that given the acts commited by real tyrants around the world it seems a petty definition of tyranny.

Only the nobles and knights and upper castes could own solid metal swords.\n \n In fact, most peasants were so poorly armed, that a Knight going through an army of peasants would be something similar to a tank going through infantry.\n\n That's not what you asked. Anyway what you say is inaccurate. I'd like to see a link though, as it's not something I've heard of before. Most peasants in European (though not British) armies tended to be given crossbows, because it allowed them to take out knights. The Pope tried to ban crossbows as unfair in the Middle Ages. Spears were also commonly given to the untrained peasants, as it's easy to fight with one, they're cheap to make, and again it makes it simple to defend yourself from cavalry. It doesn't make much sense to not equip your army to deal with one of the day's superweapons (think sending infantry out with no anti-tank rockets). Swords on the other hand require skill to use, and thus were normally not issued to unskilled peasants.\n \nStill, the lower castes got inferior weapons. So we should weild muskets while the rich people own full autos?\n\n You can seriously hurt someone with a musket you know! I'm getting the impression that this is a balance of power issue for many pro-gun people. I keep on hoping an anti-gun person turns up so I can see their stance.",
