The man did not appear to struggle in the taped portion of the clash with police.\n \n Riley cautioned against a rush to judgment however, saying that unseen factors may have been in play during the confrontation.\n \n The officers allegedly also clashed with the camera man who filmed the incident.\n \n As officers pounded the beating victim, a mounted police officer appears to maneuver his horse to block the camera shot.\n \n \n",

   "From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Cincinnati_Riots\n \n \nDowntown Cincinnati, Ohio experienced the worst rioting (often referred to as revolts or an uprising by supporters and sympathizers) from April 10, 2001 through April 12, 2001 since the 1960's. It was an unorganized and violent reaction to the fatal shooting of a 19-year-old black male, Timothy Thomas, by a white police officer, Stephen Roach, at 2:20 AM on April 7, 2001 during an on-foot pursuit by several officers.\n\n \n Also,\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/Midwest/12/01/died.in.custody/\n \n \nCINCINNATI, Ohio (CNN) -- 2003 A 350-pound [black] man who died after being beaten by [white] police when they tried to subdue him had an enlarged heart, and cocaine and PCP in his system, the Hamilton County coroner's office said Monday. \n There's a vid of this and it's pretty extreme. They are really beating on him and he's just laying on the ground with handcuffs on. Police should learn martial arts and the nonviolent ways of subduing people.\n \n If you want to feel racial tension, live in the Queen City for about two weeks. It is real, and it is everyone's fault.\n \n Anyways, while I condemn violence...what do people do to get their point across if they lack financial resources, politcal power, and organization?
