   "\" \n \n (AP) - In an astonishing discovery that could rewrite the history of human evolution, scientists said they have found the skeleton of a new human species, a dwarf, marooned for eons in a tropical Lost World while modern man rapidly colonized the rest of the planet. \n The finding on a remote Indonesian island has stunned anthropologists like no other in recent memory. It is a fundamentally new creature that bears more of a resemblance to fictional, barefooted hobbits than modern humans. \n \n Yet biologically speaking, it may have been closely related to us and perhaps even shared its caves with our ancestors. \n \n The three-foot-tall adult female skeleton found in a cave is believed to be 18,000 years old. It smashes the long-cherished scientific belief our species, Homo sapiens, systematically crowded out other upright-walking human cousins beginning 160,000 years ago and we've had Earth to ourselves for tens of thousands of years. \n Instead, it suggests recent evolution was more complex than previously thought. \n \n And it demonstrates Africa, the acknowledged cradle of humanity, does not hold all the answers to persistent questions of how - and where - we came to be. \n \n \"This finding really does rewrite our knowledge of human evolution,\" said Chris Stringer, who directs human origins studies at the Natural History Museum in London. \n \n Folklore experts have reported persistent legends of little people living on Flores and nearby islands. Islanders called the creature Ebu Gogo and say it was about three feet tall. \"\n \n Full article at:\n http://www.mytelus.com/news/article.do?pageID=world_home&articleID=1751010\n \n \n Pretty cool eh?",
