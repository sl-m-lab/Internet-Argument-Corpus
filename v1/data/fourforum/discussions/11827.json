   "What USA has actually given to Georgia? What has we gotten as a result of velvet revolution? The answer is clear: nothing! Not only that Saakashvili's advisers destroyed Georgian economy and president took in hand the main spheres of business but in addition to it Georgia was turned into one great military base! Washington gave birth to unprecedented corruption with all the donated from abroad money coming to boost Army! Nation's becoming poorer every day but Saakashvili is feeding us by promises only! And we have nothing except his promises! Look, over 75% of Georgia population is living bad life and is kept afloat only thanks to financial support of their relatives who have job in Russia! But in spite of it Saakashvili is preparing new war against autonomies! It's time to throw Saakashvili down otherwise we'll never survive this pending winter!",
