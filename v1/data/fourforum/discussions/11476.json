   "Most of your questions have subjective answers.\n And, often, no 2 Christians believe the same thing.\n \n In general, according to the bible, death is the penalty for mans (Adams) transgression in the Garden. He ate the fruit, against God's commands, and brought death into the world.\n \n All things that aren't good (of God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit) ARE Evil. Or, at the very least, allow evil to forment and blosom given enough time.\n And, while the bible does say 'all things are permissable' it also follows that with 'not all things are beneficial.'\n \n According to the more fundamentalist beliefs, the bible is THE guide to life. Accept no substitutes.\n \n As for homosexuality, the bible is against ALL forms of sexual immorality. It lists 'man lying with a man as he would a woman' as being forbidden.\n This is generally believed to be interepreted as God being against 'homosexuality'.\n \n \n As said, different people will cling to different passages of the bible and ignore others. Some will interpret and re-interpret the bible to mean pretty much anything they want.\n It's kinda cool that you can do that. \n \n In general, a more liberal interpretation believes there's a general theme of behavior that the bible talks about and that's what is important. Typically, they'll focus blindly on concepts of love and forgiveness and tolerance.\n Thinking 'meaning' is important.\n A fundamentalist will focus on what they bible actually says and what's the actual meaning of it's statements.\n \n \n I'm sure, someone with more time will give you specifics. \n \n I'm an atheist (but, IMO, know the bible fairly well). \n \n And, until you become a pest, no one will hate you.\n But, my advice is to run away and engage in chronic masturbation.\n It'll make you happier than dealing with this religious nonsense.",

Yes, there is good and evil in this world, but our war isn't between flesh and blood but between principalities and powers of darkness and light. Here's how the bible say's it. \"FOR WE WRESTLE NOT AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD, BUT AGAINST PRINCIPALITIES, POWERS, AGAINST THE RULERS OF THE DARKNESS OF THIS WORLD, AGAINST SPIRITUAL WICKEDNESS IN HIGH PLACES\" EPHESIANS 6:12 - KJV\n \n And NO, God does NOT hate homosexuals, but just as straight people commit sexual sins that the bible condemns, so does the bible condemn same gender sex which we currently define as homosexuality. But homosexuals are no different than straight people are according to the love that God has for all of us as His creation whom He created for fellowship.",

   "Whatever the bible says about anything will have its own interpretative spin put on it by its adherents.\n \n The other thing to remember is rationality and logic employed by the bible. Or rather lack of... e.g. the bible is the Word of God and written by men under inspiration. We know that because the bible says so. And we know the bible is correct because God wrote it. And we know God wrote it because the bible says so...\n \n Circular reasoning.\n \n Without doubt the bible is a fascinating chronicle of a people and their God's dealings with them. But if you read 1 Thess. 5:21 Make sure of all things; hold fast to what is fine, you can quickly turn the bible against itself and demonstrate that it is not a book of truth and salvation, because nothing in that regard stands up to any form of scrutiny.",

   "God created everything from grass to man. When everyone in the bible was killed or their life was taken, was that always a punishment or was it just meant to be?\n\n Death is God's punishmnent to man for sinning, well actually becaused adam sinned. Every living thing on the planet was originally designed to live forever, but since adam failed the one test that humanity was betting on to live eternally in bliss, God unleashed a curse upon his brand new creation that has never been matched throughout the rest of history. \n \n \nIs the bible supposed to be a true past and future way of life or is it more like a guideline?\n \n\n The bible was written to preserve the history of judaism. It is a collection of stories based on events that took place in those times and within the then known world. However, as was the custom back then, those stories were greatly embellished and exagerrated to add mysticism and intrigue to them. For example, you may be familiar with the story of David and Goliath. It probably was true the David was handy with the. Sling back then, which was a simple yet effective weapon if you had the skill. It might be true that David did take out a phillistine soldier with a single shot to the face. But it is not true that Goliath was 18 feet tall, and some of the other elements of the story were also most likely added to make David more splendid than he really was. Remember, David was king, and he needed his people to believe that God had his back, so the more dramatic he could make the story, the more loyal his subjects would be. Many other stories were similiarly embellished for similar purposes. \n \n \nNaturally most good people have an opposite evil. Like there's always an evil if there's good; batman and the joker. Well God is good and Satan is evil right? So if we refer to Jesus as good, would Beelzebub (the prince of hell) be the bad?\n \n\n Yes. Bear in mind that God and satan are not on par and rivals. In fact, God, jesus and the holy spirit are all equal, in fact they are the same single being. Satan was only a charasmatic angel who led a rebellion in heaven and got kicked out. God could snap his fingers and blink satan and all his demons out of existence, but he has chosen not to do so. The option God went with is to allow satan to stay on earth and keep corrupting humanity (the inhabitants of the planet he cursed in the first place), then have a grand final judgement to destroy satan and his angels. Unfortunately, by the time that happens satan will be taking billions of human souls to hell with him. \n \n \nI know everyone talks about god is against gays and what not. Don't go into detail, but does it really basically say he is against homosexuality?\n \n\n The bible says that homosexuality is an abomination to God. So is all forms of sexual perversions, such as masturbation and threesomes. So is a woman getting her hair cut, eating hotdogs and wearing combined-fabric clothes. The book of exodus and leviticus gives you an exhaustive list of what should and should not be done to please God. And breaking any of these commandment could be penalized offering up a blood sacrifce, all the way to death sentencing. \n \n \nAgain i'm not asking all this to get everyone upset or anything, but i really want to know is all. \n \n Don't hate me.\n\n Lol, no hate. Welcome to 4forums. Hope I can be helpful. If you have honest questions, I'll do my best to give honest answers.",
