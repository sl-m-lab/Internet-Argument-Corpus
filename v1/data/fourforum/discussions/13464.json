   "So much for marriage's \"religious origins.\"\nEarly Christian authorities rejected marriage, for the very reason that it was Goddess-oriented, and also on grounds of eschatology. Since they believed that the world was going to end at any moment, according to Jesus' promise, they saw no point in continuing another generation--for their savior specifically stated that the world would end in his own generation (Luke 9:27). However, as the decades wore on and the world did not end, fathers of the church turned even more firmly against marriage because they thought universal virginity was needed to bring about the promised kingdom of Christ. \n \n St. Jerome said the purpose of every godly man should be \"to cut down with the ax of Virginity the wood of Marriage.\" St. Ambrose called marriage a crime against God. Origen said, \"Matrimony is impure and unholy, a means of sexual passion.\" Tatian said marriage is \"a polluted and foul way of life,\" and Tertullian described it as an obscenity, a moral crime, \"more dreadful than any punishment or any death.\" St. Augustine flatly declared marriage a sin. Saturninus explained that God made only two kinds of people, good men and evil women, and marriage turned good men toward evil. Jesus himself said there could be no marriage in heaven (Matthew 22:30, Mark 12:25). St. Bernard wrote that it is easier for a man to bring the dead back to life than to live with a woman without endangering his own soul.\n \n For many centuries therefore, marriage remained outside the church, under the auspices of common law. It was grudgingly accepted by religious authorities only when new laws restricted a wife's rights of ownership and inheritance, taking the means of independence away from women and turning them over to men. \n \n Priests had abandoned the early church's rule of celibacy and had begun to take wives in the 5th and 6th centuries. But in the 11th century, the church decided to forbid clerical marriages, because they produced children to inherit property. When an unmarried priest died, all his property reverted to the church. Therefore, new papal decretals commended clergymen to turn their wives out on the street and sell their children as slaves. Some of the wives stayed on as concubines, though they were disinherited in the church's favor. By this means the church acquired a great new influx of wealth, although the women and children who were left destitute suffered terribly. \n \n Marriage continued under the common law up to the 13th century, having no endorsement by canon law. Historian F.C. Conybeare says, \"Nothing is more remarkable than the tardiness with which liturgical forms for the marriage ceremony were evolved by the church.\" The earliest approach to a Christian ceremony was a simple blessing of the newlyweds in facie ecclesiae--on the porch, outside the church door--to prevent the so-called \"pollution\" of God's house. Though this blessing technically violated canon law, in 1215 the fourth Lateran Council granted it legal status because it had become too popular to ignore. It was only in the 16th century that the church finally made the priestly blessing mandatory (and, of course lucrative), refusing to recognize common-law marriages any more. \nFreethought Today, November 2008",

   "Frankly, I don't see vast groups of gays ravaging countrysides with anti-straight Inquisitions, burning Christian \"witches\" at the stake, going on Crusades against non-homosexuals, throwing scientists into jail for discoveries their Gay Holy Book doesn't agree with, or spending vast amounts of money to deny Christians the right to marry--or worse, bashing them to death--all because some mythical Great Gay in the sky told them to. \n \n I do see some of them, however, creating some of our finest music and theater, writing some of our greatest literature, decrypting codes that helped end World War II, helping to bring down a jet hijacked by terrorists, giving a life while offering spiritual comfort to firemen dying in the rubble of the World Trade Center, and marching next to MLK Jr. as his right-hand-man in his fight for civil rights.\n \n Individual gays have occasionally done heinous things, of course, as individuals of any group have always done--but as a whole they've benefited society as much as any other as well.

What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half the world fools, and the other half hypocrites. To support roguery and error all over the earth.\"--Thomas Jefferson\n \n \"Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and tortuous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistant that we call it the word of a demon than the word of God.

   "Nope.\n Still coming to the same conclusion that, by your standards, you are more anti-gay than you are anti-Christian...\n \n\n No point arguing with a turnip, I guess.\n \n\n You are too eager to assume \"bashing\".\n Perhaps it's a problem with assuming your own intentions and motives onto others?\n \n Some issues simply need to be recognized as truth for other purposes.\n Some issues simply need to be corrected.\n As I tried to explain to you in the other thread, just because there is a problem doesn't mean the whole belief system should automatically be believed to be invalid.\n \n For some reason, you can't comprehend that.\n\n \n heaven forbid I should see your motives as anything other than driven by purity of thought. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n\n I have seen similar conversations attempted by others in the past.\n Like racists trying to argue whether blacks or whites have had better impacts upon society.\n \n\n \n When someone engages in a gays are better for society than religion thesis, I'm more than willing to burst their bubble for them. I consider it my civic duty.\n \n\n But like I said, I've already noted a couple of observations.\n You don't even try to deny them.\n \n\n \n \n You can try if you want.\n The \"average life expectancy\" junk has already been factually debunked.\n \"Monogamy\" is a problem for both homosexuals and heterosexuals. In fact, if anything I would say \"monogamy\" is more of a problem of the male than anything else.\n \n And I think you should be able to easily find that those threads ALREADY EXIST in this section.\n You aren't the first person who has come up with these ideas, you know... emoticon_rolleyes\n [/quote]\n \n They may exist, but I'm not the one starting inflammatory threads, YOU are. At least man up and admit it. :xcensored\n \n\n But for some reason, I don't recall you whining about it when the gays were getting \"bashed\", as you want to phrase it...\n\n \n Show me all of those threads that I started. We'll compare your inflammatory threads to mine and I'll guarantee you the win, particularly since I haven't started any anti-gay threads but you have started many anti-Christian threads.",
