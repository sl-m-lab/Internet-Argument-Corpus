   "No, liberals are the best. No conservitives are the ture leaders. The fact is both are needed to keep capitalism, law and foriegn policy just right. Too much liberal-government control and the western economy falls apart, too much conservitive-government control and the poorest workers revolt and the west becomes unstable. Law, too conservitive and people start to get a little rioty and angrey, too liberal and nothing gets done. That is the strength of the west, it doesn't lay in america's democracy, canada's neutrality, or North America's people. The real thing that makes us great (weither admited or not) is the fact we have both liberal and conservitive aspects of government and that is what let us beat the fasicists, communists and what will let us beat the fundementalists. Why preach total liberal philosphy, when both are needed to keep the world afloat? Total rule of either the right or left would destroy the delicit balance between what the society wants and what the individual wants. The firey debates, the impassioned speachs, the cut-throat nature of politics, these are all making us move more and more into our respected sides (either far right or left) and we are losing our integrity to stay together. Politics are irrelevant, the liberals will win one year, but the conservitives the year after that, the constant shift of power makes it illogical to fight so feircy for unifrom beliefs, espicially considering they are both critical to our survival. \n \n Purity is the one thing Hitler wanted, but in fact it is centralization and uncleanlyness that keeps us strong. \n \n Lay off the political bong for a while, its just going to ruin your vision of the real reason we have politics the way we do, and the ture intentions of our democracy.",
