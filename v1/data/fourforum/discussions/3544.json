   "I can't wait to hear the headlines for the CBS \"News\" Hour and their 60 Minute take on the \"news\".\n \n Dan Rather and the CBS group have lost viewership because of their sloppy reporting and bogus \"proof\".\n \n I used to watch \"60 Minutes\" regularly, but will now not even watch much of the CBS programming at all, including the non-political shows. CBS is at the bottom of the barrel.\n \n CBS (Clinton Broadcasting System) is a tabloid news source.\n \n \n http://insider.washingtontimes.com/articles/normal.php?StoryID=20041027-123351-4664r\n \n CBS News apparently had an October surprise of its own for President Bush. \n The network, already reeling from accusations of bias over anchorman Dan Rather's use of bogus memos to challenge Mr. Bush's Texas Air National Guard record, acknowledged yesterday in a statement that it had planned to air a story critical of the Bush administration's handling of Iraqi munitions Sunday on \"60 Minutes,\" two days before the presidential election. \n \n CBS opted to allow its \"reporting partner,\" the New York Times, to run the story Monday, citing concerns over competition, and ran it on its network news Monday night.\n \n \"This was a timely story that was developing quickly, and we wanted to air it as soon as possible on '60 Minutes,' \" spokesman Kevin Tedesco said. \"Then it became apparent the story was already breaking elsewhere, so we agreed to run it in the Times, and on our own evening news Monday night.\"\n \n Both news outlets reported that the Iraqi government has told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that 380 tons of plastic explosives, one pound of which can bring down a jet aircraft, went missing during postwar looting.\n \n The stories now are being challenged by the Pentagon and by an NBC News reporter embedded with the U.S. unit that first took control of the munitions dump.\n \n NBC News revealed Monday night that when one of its reporters embedded with the 101st Airborne Division arrived at the Al-Qaqaa site April 10, 2003, the Iraqi explosives were missing. \n \n The network added a slight nuance yesterday, adding that U.S. forces never undertook a thorough search. \n \n The Pentagon stands by its statements that U.S. forces found no IAEA-sealed explosives there and that the site already had been looted by April 10. \n \n \n Nevertheless, the tale emerged as an instant political weapon for Democratic presidential nominee Sen. John Kerry, who called it a Bush administration \"blunder\" and promptly based a campaign TV spot on the revelation.\n \n ...\n \"Kerry gins up his attack machine based on a flawed New York Times story,\" the Republican National Committee stated yesterday.\n \n American Conservative Union Executive Director Richard Lessner called the story \"a cheap, baseless and partisan hit-job on President Bush,\" adding that \"neither the Times nor CBS has much interest in reporting the facts.\"\n \n Exactly seven weeks have passed since Mr. Rather claimed on \"60 Minutes\" that he had documents proving that Mr. Bush had shirked his National Guard service three decades ago. The documents later proved to be falsified, CBS issued an apology and the affair was dubbed \"Rathergate\" in press accounts. \n \n Historically, news outlets avoid investigative pieces critical of candidates within days of an election to avoid appearing partisan. But last year the Los Angeles Times, which first reported CBS' plan to air the story days before the election, was criticized for publishing sexual-harassment accusations against Arnold Schwarzenegger days before a gubernatorial-recall vote.\n \n CBS would not address its initial plans to air the anti-Bush story two days before the presidential election, but pundits interpreted it as an \"October surprise,\" a late-breaking news event designed to tilt an election one way or the other.\n \n Some Democrats have accused Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign of conspiring with the regime in Iran to extend a hostage crisis that damaged President Carter's standing. The charges were investigated by a congressional committee, and Mr. Reagan's team was cleared. \n \n In 1992, Republicans cried foul when -- after six years of Iran-Contra investigations and on the Friday before Election Day -- Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh announced a new indictment of Caspar W. Weinberger, secretary of defense in the Reagan administration.\n \n Four years ago, just five days before Election Day, a Democratic operative in Maine alerted the press to a previously unreported 1976 drunken-driving citation for George W. Bush. \n \n \"Major media outlets have constructed this story to appear that the Bush administration is to blame, a week short of an election. It's become fodder for the campaign, and in a close race like this, the story easily could sway voters,\" said Clifford May, a syndicated columnist and president of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a District-based nonprofit group that analyzes global terrorist threats.\n \n Attempts to manipulate the U.S. election with strategically timed leaks goes beyond journalists, Mr. May said. \n \n \"What has to be investigated here is whether [IAEA Director-General] Mohamed ElBaradei has attempted to manipulate an American election, and whether certain components of the American media helped him by not exercising sufficient journalistic skepticism,\" he said. \n \n In an online column of the National Review yesterday, Mr. May wrote, \"The Iraqi explosives story is a fraud.\" \n \n \"The IAEA and its head, the anti-American Mohamed ElBaradei, leaked a false letter on this issue to the media to embarrass the Bush administration. The U.S. is trying to deny ElBaradei a second term, and we have been on his case for missing the Libyan nuclear-weapons program and for weakness on the Iranian nuclear-weapons program.\" \n \n Variations of the missing-explosives theme also appeared on CNN, CBS and ABC. \n \n The \" 'October surprise' missing-weapons story flops,\" noted the Media Research Center's Brent Baker, while the Drudge Report cast CBS as a habitual Republican basher, airing accounts critical of the party \"a few days before the vote\" in 1992 and 2000.",

   "http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/graham200411040834.asp\n \n November 04, 2004, 8:34 a.m.\n Amazing Loss\n The media threw everything, including the sink, at Bush.\n \n By Tim Graham \n If we projected the winner of a presidential race based on the assumption that voters reflexively followed every didactic anchorman lecture, every trumped-up anti-Bush investigative hit piece, and every gooey Kerry valentine, we would have expected George W. Bush to lose in a resounding defeat. The media's coverage &#8212; in terms of its intended political effect &#8212; was a landslide for John Kerry: a landslide that began in the summer of 2003 and continued for more than a year. \n Consider the second half of 2003, as the Democratic field circled around the artificial Howard Dean bubble. The morning shows on ABC, CBS, and NBC offered up four hours of face time to the Democratic contenders from July to December, almost twice as much time as the Republican contenders received in 1999.\n The morning hosts posed 319 questions to the Democratic candidates, nearly one-fifth of which (58) were designed to get them to reiterate or amplify their condemnations of President Bush. The morning hosts often asked the candidates to repeat charges they had leveled elsewhere. Four years before, only four out of 179 questions similarly invited the GOP candidates to differ with Bill Clinton or Al Gore. CBS's Rene Syler served up this softball to John Kerry last December 4: \"You called President Bush's foreign policy arrogant, inept, and reckless. Give us some specifics.\"\n As John Kerry emerged as the likely Democratic nominee, the media all followed Democratic Chairman Terry McAuliffe like Pavlov's dogs. McAuliffe rang the \"AWOL\" bell on President Bush's service in the Texas Air National Guard, and the networks followed, with 63 morning- and evening-news segments on the Big Three networks pounding Bush to prove he wasn't \"AWOL.\" (In 1992, they aired only ten evening-news segments on Bill Clinton's draft evasion in the first two weeks of that story.)\n Kerry's emergence was helped along further as reporters insisted that his liberal record wasn't a fact, but just a Republican insult. From mid-January to early March, reporters for the Big Three presented the \"Kerry is a liberal\" concept as a GOP charge 27 times, compared with just three occasions when reporters stated Kerry's ideology as a matter of fact. Republicans were always \"painting\" Kerry as a liberal, in a tone that suggested reporters wanted to say \"finger-painting.\"\n That pattern continued all year. \n Every anti-Bush angle, however, was explored with great ferocity. Almost every week of 2004 was a bad media week for Bush. There was Paul O'Neill Book Week. There was 9/11 Ads in Bad Taste Week. There was Richard Clarke Book Week. There was Bob Woodward Book Week. There were two weeks of Alabama National Guard Whereabouts Hunt. There were four weeks of Abu Ghraib hype (NBC dedicated ten times as many stories to prison abuse as they did to Saddam's mass graves). Every goofy liberal rumor &#8212; from kicking Dick Cheney off the ticket to replacing him with John McCain &#8212; was repeated with mischievous grins. Every liberal propagandist, from Michael Moore to Kitty Kelley to Al Franken's Air America, drew respectful promotion. The first good media week for Bush all year centered around an event the press could neither control nor ignore: the death of Ronald Reagan.\n From May to August, the networks studiously ignored Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. ABC's World News Tonight would not mention the group at all on the air until Kerry denounced them on August 19. The group's members were never granted a live interview on NBC, although the network gave Kitty Kelley three days in a row on Today. John O'Neill drew one debate on CBS's Early Show, and one appearance on This Week with George Stephanopoulos. O'Neill fought with Ted Koppel on the October 14 Nightline, after Koppel sent a crew to Vietnam to interview the Viet Cong for their account of how Kerry earned his medals. The Swift Vets received airplay on cable, and big play on talk radio, but the networks themselves were very stingy. When pundits say the Swift Vets \"dominated\" August coverage, they overlook what really dominated network coverage that month: the Olympics.\n Once again this year, the conventions were a matched set: a pajama party for Democrats in Boston, a four-day expos\u00e9 of Republicans in New York. Reporters virtually ignored any discussion over the fringe composition of the liberal delegates, the liberal platform (abortions should be subsidized by the federal government), or the liberal menu of speakers.\n The same network journalists felt in New York the pressing need to underline, in metaphorical red pen, the ridiculous sham before their eyes: \"Hard right\" social conservatives were being hidden behind Giuliani, Schwarzenegger, and John McCain. When Tom Brokaw began the week by calling it a \"con game\" at the end of his Sunday-night newscast, he was stating publicly what his colleagues insinuated all week long.\n The debates were obviously not as much of a sweep for John Kerry as the networks asserted. Once again, the Republicans mysteriously agreed to four debates with four liberal-media moderators, and whatever Charles Gibson provided in the second, surprisingly balanced, townhall-style debate, Bob Schieffer took back in a shockingly slanted performance in the final match-up. The late media hits &#8212; from al-Qaqaa to Halliburton whistleblowers &#8212; didn't work. \n But the biggest measure of bias in 2004 may be all the stories, large and small, that the media omitted in John Kerry's defense. What a list we could make of largely avoided topics: the 1971 Senate testimony, the 20-year U.S. Senate record, Teresa's tax returns, Teresa's foundation politics, Teresa's near-daily gaffes, internal Democratic infighting, U.N. corruption in the Oil-for-Food scandal, etc. \n Yet despite these efforts in behalf of Kerry, George W. Bush has amassed the highest vote total in American history. The media took their defeat graciously, if a little slowly; on these occasions, they put on statesman masks and pretended they didn't have a horse in the race. But they have been left only with the feeling that their power is sapped, their influence is waning, and their credibility is collapsing. \n There are two brakes on the arrogance of liberal media bias: One is declining ratings; the other is liberal politicians' losing and conservative politicians' winning. The message of popular resistance to the liberal media has been sent once again. We may be optimistic about the new makeup of Washington, but it makes no sense to be optimistic about the liberal media's recognizing their arrogance. We can only be optimistic that their meltdown continues.\n &#8212; Tim Graham is director of media analysis at the Media Research Center and an NRO contributor.",
