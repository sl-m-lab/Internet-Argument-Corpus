   "I know plenty of people who prefer to get each CD as it comes out, but for the most part 90% of the CD's I've come across only have 3-4 songs on it that are actually good (or rather that I actually like). For my most favorite artists who never seem to let me down, I will buy each album of theirs faithfully, but for the rest, I'll buy the compilation. Like the new Joe Cocker compilation CD \"Ultimate Collection\"..I would never consider myself to be a fan of Joe Cocker, but there is not one song on the album that I do not like. I've found a new respect for him as an artist. To me, compliation CD's are like a clip show. No new plots, no new stories or new characters, but just a wam-bam-thank-you-ma'am of the best moments of the life of the show...and Joe has been leading his \"show\" for more than 30 years, so you can bet that his new album is packed with brilliant songs. so you tell me...compilation CD or original CD's?",
