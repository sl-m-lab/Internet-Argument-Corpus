   "US State Department admitted its mistake in Uzbekistan and Kirghizia, recent negotiations after 11 month of silence came to nothing. But at the same time Americans hope to get control over Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Moreover Israel promised to help by its ties with Jewish oligarchs Mashkevich and Berezovsky to promote situation regulation in those countries. \n As I understand businessmen who have great ties in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan Americans hope to create necessary opposition against active 'intractable' power. \n Well, in answer to it Israel demands from USA to enlarge its contingent in Iraq and Afghanistan and quarter peacekeepers in Lebanon as much as possible. Israelis are aware that in case of stopping of state-of-the-art in Lebanon they will lose everything. They need to step further and next target will be Iran - powerful Muslims country in district. That's why Israel needs reliable home front which will be provided by USA.",
