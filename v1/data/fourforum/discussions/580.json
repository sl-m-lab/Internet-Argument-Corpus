   "First off let me address the fact that I'm a conservative for Affirmative Action. Second that I'm a first generation immigrant and I'm not white. \n \n Now first off they shouldn't call it affirmative action but affirmative consideration. It's in consideration that so many minorities have suffered in the past that they are trying to amend. Words have a strong power on people's emotions and I think that if we would use the right words then it would have a better effect.\n \n Something that people don't know and don't understand is how it feels to be a minority in the US. If you are a minority you are more familiar with the \"white culture\" then \"whites\" are of ours. The fact that you think social or economic class is the same for all races shows how much we need to diversify universities. The fact of the matter you will never know how much bias, discrimination, and racism exists in America today. It isn't even close to the levels that it was in the 60's but it still exists. The purpose to diversify is to help counteract some of that. If you don't believe there is any racism, bias, or prejudice in America then you are proof of the need for diversity.\n \n Another reason we need diversity is because the belief is how do we help correct social injustices of the past and not punishing those of the current system. Allowing a few people in because of their race would only eliminate approximately 5% of all applicants. Applicants on the borderline that would have been accepted if not for the diversity policies. The belief is that if the social injustices of the past had not happened that those students would have had better resources and lesser disadvantges and would merit acceptance. That if the past injustices had not happened they would have been that much farther ahead and then have \"merited\" acceptance and those students eliminated would have been eliminated anyways.\n \n Also standardized tests are racially, culturally, and genderally bias. Until recently most standardized test were made of entirely white males. That is why women in general don't do as well on standardized tests as men overall. If there was a group of people raised, educated, cultured, the same as me and we created a test, who do you think of all the test takers would do the best? Probably those that did have the same background as I did. How do you overcome differences like that?\n \n Why do Professors want participation from everyone in the class? Everyone has different points of view. If you admitted only a few merit based minorities then the campus wouldn't be very diverse. That means that class discussions would mostly be by people that are the same race, culture, color, and probably similar backgrounds. How much perspective would you gain then? When would they ever become educated about \"other cultures\" or people? Being a minority we bring something with us that whites would bring to a African, Asian, South American, and Pacific Island dominant setting. If you don't understand that, just skip the rest of my post.\n \n Now to address the success rates of minorities in universities. If you accept a more \"merit based\" pool of applicants into a school compared to a pool of people that were accepted less on the merits of course there is a huge disparity between minorities suceeding (a merit based process). It does not mean all accepted that do not make the \"merit\" requirements are not qualified. There are some that do get accepted that cannot handle the competitiveness and should not have been accepted. I concede that. The fact is that many that are accepted merit based drop out as well so numbers are not a good indicator. The fact of the matter many are accepted even though there scores didn't merit it. They do suceed and add to the school. Also statistically the pool is much smaller. So every drop out affects the statistics dramatically. It can be very misleading due to the size of the pool compared to the larger pool. Everyone knows the larrger the pool the more accurate the statistic. Also who do you think is more prepared for college the students that are second, third, fourth, fifth generation college student that have a family support group or the ones that come from a first generation college family? How do you think it feels to live away from home in a predominantly white area when you're not white? We have to learn a whole new culture and many times language. We have to learn to adapt to teachers mentality that may not be able to follow our mentatlity because they weren't raised the same as us. Unless you have lived in a different culture that isn't white you wouldn't understand further proving my point for the need of diversity.\n \n Also for so long minorities were discriminated against. So we in essence lost our place in line and pushed back at the end of the line. So now to finish you expect us to be competetive because someone else is ahead of us from before? We are still suffereing from psat discrimination. Trying telling teh blacks in South Africa that ended a partheid that things are now fair because they ended apartheid 25yrs after we did. Black ghettos are the result of the past. You can't explain a people to change their status overnight after hundreds of years of oppression. You think 25 yrs of equality makes minorities equal after hundreds of years of oppression? They ask is that studendts that didn't the best scores to go to another school to allow a student that has suffered seriously from the past to gain the prestige not afforded to him earlier.\n \n \n I won't go into the economic and disadvantaged backgrounds that many minorities face. I believe that those are pretty evident. There are my views I have many more but I'll give them after because I'm tired of typing. Oh yeah sorry for the typos but I'm not a perfectionist. You know what I mean and that is enough.",

   "Again you seem way over your head when it comes to linguistics. First off the differences is language testing is more in terms of things like the predicate subjunctive and other parts of speech. If tests were simple as that then everyone would get perfect scores. These test are difficult and even subtle differences in the verbal test can cost you points. That isn't the main point anyways. I jsut said that to show you that you didn't knwo what you are talking about english being universal. \n \n Use of the Present Perfect \n \n In British English the present perfect is used to express an action that has occurred in the recent past that has an effect on the present moment. For example: \n \n I've lost my key. Can you help me look for it? \n In American English the following is also possible: \n I lost my key. Can you help me look for it? \n \n In British English the above would be considered incorrect. However, both forms are generally accepted in standard American English. Other differences involving the use of the present perfect in British English and simple past in American English include already, just and yet. \n \n British English:\n \n I've just had lunch\n I've already seen that film\n Have you finished your homework yet?\n \n American English:\n \n I just had lunch OR I've just had lunch\n I've already seen that film OR I already saw that film.\n Have your finished your homework yet? OR Did you finish your homework yet?\n \n Now before you post agin research and learn about what you post so that we don't waste our time on wht you don't know.\n \n \n Okay now we deal with question gender bias. Here is what you don't understand.\n \n Many psychologists and other researchers have determined that the format of the test (multiple-choice, speed-based, encouraging of risk-taking) is also biased against females, who are socialized to solve problems differently than males. \n \n Also questions pertaining to subjects to which males are socialized to pay attention (politics, business, sports) are often dominantly present. \n \n Also the sports included might be baseball which the average baseball fan is white, 35yrs old compared to basketball where the average fan is 14yrs old. Also discussing subjects such as investing is more geared towards people that have had equa opportunity. Family life is also different becasue many cultures have extended families which change the scope of their perspective of families.\n \n Now to your argument facts are independent of perception. Here are questions for you to think about. Does Israel own the Gaza Strip or is it just occupying it? Is it pornography or is it art? Was it self defense or was it murder? Everyday people try to determine the facts? So what do you think fallacies are?\n \n Obviously you are attacking the validity of standardized tests. Look up on google standardized tests and validity and see what people have to say. You'll see there is a lot of support for the problems with standardized testing. \n \n Even if standardized testing was fair it still favors people that can afford prep courses and families that know the importance of it. It seems to disenfranchise those who have lost hope of real equality or single parent homes.",

Guys are more interested in math. All you gotta do is go to some college math and engineering classes and see. \n \n -I agree that speed is a major problem on the tests. People who read slowly or aren't clutch are screwed.\n -Multiple-choice, I dunno. If you turn the verbal questions in essays (as the SAT is doing) and the short math problems into long ones, then subjective grading starts creeping it. \n -Everyone knows ahead of time that being conservative on these tests is a poor strategy. \n \n \n Overall, I'd certainly agree to you that the tests have some problems. I'd also rather see more specialized tests that one can take while applying to an actual school in a college. More -and harder- math for people going into Engineering. More -including essays- verbal for people going into humanities.\n However, I think the difference in test results speaks more toward the education recieved by the testee than some overriding bias within the questions.",

   "Perhaps you misread me. Why am I and others like me being treated unfairly because we were born white. We can't exactly change our skin color or the past, and it's not like we approve of it.

Would you agree with it? Why should it be different if I put in different colors?\n \n One other problem with AA is that it's just not quite what you need to diversify. As I'm sure you are ready to point out, mana'ia, blacks are just as capable as whites, when given the same opportunities, and the idea of AA is to give disadvantaged blacks a chance for a higher education. The problem I have, though, is that middle class minorities who DO have just as many advantages as whites, are getting in simply because their skin color. That is what riles me. A much better solution would be to give economically disadvantaged kids, no matter race, preference over wealthier people. Yes, I do realize that that consists of mostly blacks. But those are the people who are being discriminated against and given a disadvantaged, and have to work ten times harder than a middle class white guy to get into college.

Maybe we should have left all those absetos workers jsut tough it out because we didn't think it was wrong at the time, oh well.

   "Morphos: argue the facts, not the person. You can oppose AA and not be racist. As a fellow liberal, I beg of you to make less ignorant statements.\n \n Mana'ia: I love your Disneyland example, and I agree entirely. However, it needs to be modified slightly.\n Once upon a time, a certain group of people weren't allowed into disneyland, whether they lived in Nevada, Illinois, or even right outside the door in Southern California. Just to be safe, the powers that be moved many of them far far away, so that even if they found a legal loophole to get in, they would still be too far away. Bwah ha ha!\n Sometime later, the group found a loophole, but lo and behold! having been exiled to Nevada (and Illinois), they found that even though they could legally go to Disneyland, it was too far away to be realistic. This is a problem that needs to be rectified. There were some people in this group that managed to remain in So. Cal, of course, and they had no trouble getting to Disneyland, now that legal equality had been achieved. But by and large, the past discrimination had taken its toll, and most of the group couldn't go at all.\n Now we have two options regarding who to give the bikes to.\n 1) All the people in Nevada (and farther). None of them can get to disneyland. Black or white, they all have the same problem.\n 2) All the people who had been discriminated against. This in spite of the fact that admittedly some of the people don't NEED a bike (they live outside the gates).\n Which solves the problem better?\n Solution 1) allows for 100% of people who otherwise couldn't get in to disneyland to get in. The discriminated people who still live in Nevada get a bike. The people who live in So. Cal don't get a bike, but they don't need one, they live there already.\n Solution 2) allows for much less. Non-discriminated (racially anyway) people living in Nevada still can't get there. But all the discrimianted folks can. The question I have is: why give the extra bikes to the people living in So. Cal? They don't need them. They can get to Disneyland without them. And there are people elsewhere who need them more\n \n As I said in the other debate, my solution provides for more solvency.

   "First off let me address the fact that I'm a conservative for Affirmative Action. Second that I'm a first generation immigrant and I'm not white. \n \n Now first off they shouldn't call it affirmative action but affirmative consideration. It's in consideration that so many minorities have suffered in the past that they are trying to amend. Words have a strong power on people's emotions and I think that if we would use the right words then it would have a better effect.\n \n I agree\n \n Something that people don't know and don't understand is how it feels to be a minority in the US. If you are a minority you are more familiar with the \"white culture\" then \"whites\" are of ours. The fact that you think social or economic class is the same for all races shows how much we need to diversify universities. The fact of the matter you will never know how much bias, discrimination, and racism exists in America today. It isn't even close to the levels that it was in the 60's but it still exists. The purpose to diversify is to help counteract some of that. If you don't believe there is any racism, bias, or prejudice in America then you are proof of the need for diversity.\n \n [b]This frustrates me a little. White people who travel to others' countries are extremely respectful and courteous to those cultures. We may not reflect that, here, in America, but that is because we are internally ignorant.\n \n There is most certainly bias and racism in America. We grew up a white culture. We had a perdicament involving black people that created a mess of prejiduce and reverse prejiduce. That is why it is more difficult for us to get along (then say Europe).\n \n Racism and prejiduce exists everywhere. You should expect that no matter what country you're in (save for Canada or Australia). But not all of it is prejiduce, some is just plain ignorance and disrespect.\n \n Another reason we need diversity is because the belief is how do we help correct social injustices of the past and not punishing those of the current system. Allowing a few people in because of their race would only eliminate approximately 5% of all applicants. Applicants on the borderline that would have been accepted if not for the diversity policies. The belief is that if the social injustices of the past had not happened that those students would have had better resources and lesser disadvantges and would merit acceptance. That if the past injustices had not happened they would have been that much farther ahead and then have \"merited\" acceptance and those students eliminated would have been eliminated anyways.\n \n are you talking about immigrant education or internal education?\n \n Also standardized tests are racially, culturally, and genderally bias. Until recently most standardized test were made of entirely white males. That is why women in general don't do as well on standardized tests as men overall. If there was a group of people raised, educated, cultured, the same as me and we created a test, who do you think of all the test takers would do the best? Probably those that did have the same background as I did. How do you overcome differences like that?\n \n No doubt about it. Those tests were developed by white males, the same kinds that founded our country... But I disagree with your assesment that our tests are biased or prejiduced in any way. I want proof of this. History and math aren't racist. There is nothing 'unfair' about our testing standards. Asking you who our first president was isn't going to kill you and is relevant to our culture.\n \n I have to agree that certain people require special education, such as immigrants, who may need more time to learn or special learning aids. This is not public educations problem though.\n \n Why do Professors want participation from everyone in the class? Everyone has different points of view. If you admitted only a few merit based minorities then the campus wouldn't be very diverse. That means that class discussions would mostly be by people that are the same race, culture, color, and probably similar backgrounds. How much perspective would you gain then? When would they ever become educated about \"other cultures\" or people? Being a minority we bring something with us that whites would bring to a African, Asian, South American, and Pacific Island dominant setting. If you don't understand that, just skip the rest of my post.\n \n We, Americans in general, don't care about your culture, just as you have so ignorantly informed us that you don't care about ours. This is a two way streetcar. I, personally, love to hear about 'certain cultures', and others I couldn't care less. \n \n I have worked, as a white male, in a company that was entirely owned and run by chinese people with a chinese female president. I can tell you right now that I wish I was still ignorant of them. You don't know fear until you've worked for a chinese woman.\n \n Now to address the success rates of minorities in universities. If you accept a more \"merit based\" pool of applicants into a school compared to a pool of people that were accepted less on the merits of course there is a huge disparity between minorities suceeding (a merit based process). It does not mean all accepted that do not make the \"merit\" requirements are not qualified. There are some that do get accepted that cannot handle the competitiveness and should not have been accepted. I concede that. The fact is that many that are accepted merit based drop out as well so numbers are not a good indicator. The fact of the matter many are accepted even though there scores didn't merit it. They do suceed and add to the school. Also statistically the pool is much smaller. So every drop out affects the statistics dramatically. It can be very misleading due to the size of the pool compared to the larger pool. Everyone knows the larrger the pool the more accurate the statistic. Also who do you think is more prepared for college the students that are second, third, fourth, fifth generation college student that have a family support group or the ones that come from a first generation college family? How do you think it feels to live away from home in a predominantly white area when you're not white? We have to learn a whole new culture and many times language. We have to learn to adapt to teachers mentality that may not be able to follow our mentatlity because they weren't raised the same as us. Unless you have lived in a different culture that isn't white you wouldn't understand further proving my point for the need of diversity.\n \n This is a generalization that can applied to any society. I really don't feel this is a fair statement. America is agressive. You won't make it here if you are not. This is an economical problem though. \n \n Further more, I would also like to believe, especially from the six different schools I have attended, that todays society of youths are very open to developing interracial relationships.\n \n I really hope you understand that white people are still the majority, so you are bound to see more of them hanging around together, but I have friends in every corner of the gene pool.\n \n I think minorites try to model themselves after the blacks, which is unfair because they are not black. Now we have two different cultures. We have black culture and white culture. If you hadn't noticed, blacks still don't like white culture, and white people are rapping now, but a white man can never be a 'brother' and it really kinda XXXXXX me off. ;\\\n \n I would like you to observe one thing. The blacks have figured it out. No other minority understands. This is AMERICA, LAND OF OPPOTUNITY. You have the opportunity to be great if you so desire. Blacks have learned to become competitive. They haven't seen the spotlight, yet, but they are getting there. They have businesses, they have radio stations, TV stations, etc.\n \n Very soon, we will have a culture unlike anything seen in Europe and I think it will be grand if we can blend the interracial aspect with our founding beliefs. Europe does not have the type of black power that America has. We really have something special if we could just embrace unity.\n \n What I have to say about hispanics, is if they could ever get off their asses, run to the library and research resumes, and then actually write one for a change.... They are AMAZING computer programmers and web authors. But they just won't do that. \n \n The resources are all there, you just have to open your eyes and not let fear control you. A lot of the problem is that the minorities are intimidated and afraid to ask for help.\n \n Also for so long minorities were discriminated against. So we in essence lost our place in line and pushed back at the end of the line. So now to finish you expect us to be competetive because someone else is ahead of us from before? We are still suffereing from psat discrimination. Trying telling teh blacks in South Africa that ended a partheid that things are now fair because they ended apartheid 25yrs after we did. Black ghettos are the result of the past. You can't explain a people to change their status overnight after hundreds of years of oppression. You think 25 yrs of equality makes minorities equal after hundreds of years of oppression? They ask is that studendts that didn't the best scores to go to another school to allow a student that has suffered seriously from the past to gain the prestige not afforded to him earlier.\n \n This is just excuses as to why you deserve extra money and sympathy. You owe it to yourself to be competitive, to rise to the top, be an inspiration to others of your culture. Mark my word, America is NOT going to slow down and let you catch up.\n \n You cannot run around telling us how to run our culture. That is the greatest ignorance (which incidently makes us really really ignorant regarding Iraq and Afghanistan). I would also like to point out that we were not the original 'enslavers' of the black people. Their fellow African tribesmen were. Black enslaving blacks!!! NEVER!!! Like as if they aren't still running around the Congo shootin each other up. Wait, they still do that in Chicago. \n \n \n I won't go into the economic and disadvantaged backgrounds that many minorities face. I believe that those are pretty evident. There are my views I have many more but I'll give them after because I'm tired of typing. Oh yeah sorry for the typos but I'm not a perfectionist. You know what I mean and that is enough.\n \n I agree, I think there should be FAR BETTER welfare/education funds for ALL people at who live in really poor income brackets. I am sorry that those people have to suffer. They can still acheive but I know that it is very difficult. I am sorry. Really.\n \n \n\n \n \n I think this is a very fair , albeit, stereotypical arguement. I would have to agree with it, but I have some fair statements of my own. I do not believe affirmitave anything is necessary. I think only creates more prejiduce. I think, in a perfect system, we can cater to everyone by need rather than by race.\n \n We were born a white culture (America). We were white people. This is our system. We don't expect you to go bending backwards or change your entire culture when we go to your country and the fact of the matter is, you didn't have to come here. You might have been happier in Australia.\n \n I mean no disrespect, but if I was going to visit someone elses' country, I would be courteous enough to learn as much as I could about their culture so as not to disrespect it. If you have come to my country without courtesy or respect for our ways or standards, in my opinion, you are not worthy to be here. Those who are respectful and courteous can live well here.\n \n I know you don't get to see it too often, but American's have really really big hearts. We are very passionate and proud people. You do have to take the first step to help yourself, but, if you ask for help, Someone will be there. I will be there. There are a lot of good people here. =)\n \n Leviathan\n Leviathan@Lightfirst.com",

A tax system based purely on a % of income is a means to redistribute wealth. 25% of $1Million costs that person $250k. 25% of an income of $10k is $250. Now, if all of that money goes into the Federal coffers and redistributed to those who are poor, you see that the net effect is NOT equivalent. \n As for your argument about government subsidies for the rich, the facts don't support your claim. \n \"Top 5% - 56.47% of all income taxes\n Top 10% - 67.33% of all income taxes\n Top 25% - 84.01% of all income taxes.\n Top 50% - 96.09% of all income taxes.\n The bottom 50%?

   "Sorry, I don't buy class warfare arguments when I know the facts about who pays the bulk of all taxes. A tax system based purely on a % of income is a means to redistribute wealth. 25% of $1Million costs that person $250k. 25% of an income of $10k is $250. Now, if all of that money goes into the Federal coffers and redistributed to those who are poor, you see that the net effect is NOT equivalent. \n As for your argument about government subsidies for the rich, the facts don't support your claim. \n \"Top 5% - 56.47% of all income taxes\n Top 10% - 67.33% of all income taxes\n Top 25% - 84.01% of all income taxes.\n Top 50% - 96.09% of all income taxes.\n The bottom 50%? They pay a paltry 3.91% of all income taxes.\" \n \n Those figures come right from the IRS. I'd say that if the rich are getting the special breaks that you spoke of, they weren't very smart about taking advantage of them. :)\n\n Obviously we aren't on the same page. You have no idea what governemnt subsidies are do you? YOu thought government subsidies were tax breaks and that's not what I referring to do you. Many businesses the government subsidizes them. Also most businesses do business with the government (fiscal policy). Stadiums, commercial and private airfields, and R&D grants for private companies are all examples of how many affluent people are benefitted from the government. It's not a redistribution of wealth.\n \n Here are some links to help you\n \n the purpose of welfare policy, which should be to help the poorest families earn enough to lift more children above the poverty line.\n \n http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0529-03.htm\n \n \"as a means to economic independence.\"\n \n http://www.jhu.edu/~ips/newsroom/preprint/long_term_effects.html\n \n Public assistance programs were developed to reduce poverty!\n \n http://www.juliannemalveaux.com/marriage_poverty.htm\n \n There is even condemnation that our society should have a system of redistribution of wealth\n \"Even Roman Catholic bishops recently condemned the American free enterprise system. They apparently prefer a government-enforced redistribution of wealth\"\n \n http://www.fee.org/vnews.php?nid=1564\n \n Progressives argued that \"the treatment of welfare benefits should be used as a form of redistribution of wealth\"\n \n http://www.cardozojcr.com/vol3no1/notes01.html\n \n Notice how they said it \"should be\". Why would they say it should be if it is?\n \n \n \n \n \n\n I don't really care about the policy behind a law if it is discriminatory. IMO, there is NO justification for singling out one group to be penalized solely because of their gender, race or religion. THAT is unconstitutional. \n\n \n Then we must eliminate the american with disabilities act. We should eliminate title IX Also they should house men and women together in prisons because there are inherent differences. \n \n \n \n \n\n Oh, I see. Discrimination is OK as long as the government's motives are pure? Give me a break!!!\n And the \"logic\" behind that particular example isn't what you think. The law was instituted as a means of preventing married men from buying a house for their mistresses. It is another example of \"nanny governmental intervention\" into our personal lives.\n \n You're not paying attention. I just gave you an example of a law that was purely discriminatory against married men. Regardless of your attempt to spin the purpose, it is clearly a discriminatory law. \n\n \n I know that women are considered agents of their husbands but men are not agents of women. That is what I thought. Anyways that law if challenged would be considered unconstitutional. I was overzealous in my attempts to prove my point.\n \n The government's laws are all based upon behavior. If we can't discriminate behavior then we must remove all laws on the books because they discriminate against polygamists, alcoholics, religious cults, etc.\n Laws can't discriminate (against gender, race, abilities, etc) but they can give preferential treatment.\n \n \n Are main contention is if it is discrimination or preferential treatment?",

In the tapes the Texaco, Inc. executives refer to black employees as \"black jelly beans.\" \n \n http://www.cmht.com/casewatch/cases/cwtexco3.htm\n \n The class-action lawsuit claimed Texaco had a racist corporate culture and discriminated against blacks in pay, promotions and workplace behavior. \n \n After word of the tapes surfaced, Texaco was hit with a civil-rights boycott and subjected to ridicule on late-night TV talk shows. \n \n http://www.cnn.com/US/9703/26/texaco.settle/\n \n In an attempt to appease outrage over a racial scandal, the Texaco oil company suspended two executives on November 6. The two participated in a meeting to plan how to destroy documents demanded in a discrimination lawsuit. The company also cut off some benefits for two other officials caught on an audiotape of the meeting using racial slurs to describe Black employees. According to a transcript of the tapes obtained by the New York Times, the officials referred to employees who are Black as \"black jelly beans\" and \"niggers\" and derided the African- American celebration of Kwanza.\n \n http://www.themilitant.com/1996/6042/6042_9.html\n \n Japan's Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. agreed to similar terms when it settled a lawsuit charging racial discrimination in loan practices. The finance arms of Ford Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and DaimlerChrysler AG have been targeted by similar lawsuits.\n \n When the GMAC lawsuit was filed in 1998, some black consumers were charged finance rates as high as 33 percent on car loans, Stewart said. The lawsuit charged that black car buyers collectively paid millions of dollars more for loans, even though they had the same credit-worthiness as white consumers.\n http://www.forbes.com/newswire/2004/01/30/rtr1236195.html\n \n The study showed even black and hispanic applicants with higher incomes were turned down more than whites with lower incomes... and mortgages in low income neighborhoods were turned down more often regardless of race. \n \n http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/news/101603_nw_acorn_study.html\n \n Eugene Pincham, an attorney for plaintiffs suing the Chrysler, said the remarks showed one of the largest automobile dealers and financial companies in the world \"engaging in blatant racism and discrimination against blacks and overtly asserting it and saying so to the employees. \n \n \"It's the culture of the company,\" he said. \n \n Madigan referred to the consumer federation's report which showed minority car buyers often are charged higher interest rates than whites to finance vehicles at dealerships and by other lenders, even if they had credit scores comparable to whites. \n \n http://www.daytondefender.com/Money.htm",

   "They give them a \"leg up\" because they feel minorities are disadvantaged. Do you oppose Americans with disabilities or social programs that favor the poor and disabled? Do you oppose women's sports?\n\n \n I'd like to answer those two questions. The first answer is \"yes\", with one cavaet. It is NOT the function of the Federal Government to be engaged in social programs. Since it appears that you are a law student, please cite me the authority that the Constitution gives, not some liberal judge's broad interpretation, for engaging is said practices. The states and local municipalities are free to do as they so desire, though, in accordance with their local laws.\n The answer to the second question is \"yes\". Until women stop trying to use discrimination as a means of entering men's sports, I feel that ALL sports should be unisex and the most qualified participants take place accordingly.\n IMO, if it is legitimate for a woman to force her way into a man's sport, then the converse is also legitimate.

   "\n Mana'ia, I take it that you are a minority, and that you consider yourself \"disadvantaged\". If not, you're what I would term a classic \"limousine liberal\". \n\n Yes i am a minority. However majority of Americans support affirmative action. It should be affirmative consideration.\n I'm not a liberla though.\n \n \n\n You say you're mostly through law school (I see they've honed your \"lawyer speak\" skills already), so exactly how are you disadvantaged? \n\n I'm at a disadvataged because I don't have the same background as my professors.

How do I compete with people that ski?\n \n Also when we issue spot and analyze the fact pattern I have a different perspective than my professor. I feel certain things are important and therefore see those issues as glaring while they consider them trivial. Also when I take standardized tests there are always \"white\" culture slangs that pole consider \"American\" because the \"white\" culture uses them. Terms sush as \"rose colored glasses\", \"knock on wood\", and nursey rhymes are not familiar to me. Most cultures in teh US don't use those terms and nursery rhymes are british. Many poeple feel since the \"white\" culture uses\n them that they are common and \"American\". \n These are just some of the ways I find myself disadvantaged.\n \n \n \n\n After graduation, would you want to get a job based solely on your race, or would you want to be hired because you are the best applicant? That's what I truly don't understand about AA, if I receive anything in life, I want it to be of my own merits. AA taints even those that do achieve success based solely on their own merits. \n\n Affirmative action is about assisting not providing. They won't hire someone that doesn't posses the minimum skills. Affirmative action is not required to be implemented. look at California. \n I will always be qualified for any job I apply for and it is subjective to who is the best. Why do you think they do interviews? There are so many factors to what makes the best candidate. Grades and scores reflect someone's ability.

Also never believe that someone has more abilites than another becasue they are \"more qualified\".\n \n \n\n As far as lawyers determining the direction this country is headed, and taking it upon themselves to determine not only what makes a person \"whole\", but to go about making them \"whole\" at a tidy profit, it infuriates me. I've never heard of one instance of a \"Rule 11\" violation, and I could list about a dozen high profile media cases (several of which JP already listed) that should have been rule 11'd. I don't blame/hate the lawyers like most people do, as far as I'm concerned, they're just doing their jobs. However, it's time the judges of this country started getting tough and put an end to the overly litigious nature of our jucicial system and the diminishing trend of personal responsibility that is crippling this country. \n\n I agree. I think punative damages should go to charities or the government to not incentivize lawyers.",

The majority of the poor in the US are WHITE, not minorities, yet there is no AA for them. \n \n http://www.census.gov/hhes/poverty/poverty02/table1.pdf\n \n Don't you think there is a basic flaw in the practice of AA, if its intent was solely to \"assist the disadvantaged\", but the largest disadvantaged group in the US is excluded from participation?\n Now, getting back to student #1. If he were to apply to one of my state's top institutions, the Univ. of Michigan, he would be given an automatic 20 points JUST for the color of his skin, no questions asked. (For comparison, you only get 1 additional point for \"aceing\" the SAT or ACT test.) \n http://aacaw.org/umpoints.pdf\n \n According to U of M itself, if a race-blind admission system was used minority admission would drop from 14% to 4% in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts.

Waxy if you understood the argument you'd have to compare my experience compared to your \"white culture group\".

If you really think about this question who do you think this favors? Minorities or whites? See how your anecdotal evidence doesn't bolster your argument but reflects on the lack of comprehension and serious thought?\n\n \n First off, let me clear a few things up, I have an MSc, and I excelled in university, so let's get past this little understanding/comprehension thing shall we? It's BS, you bring it on, I'll be fine. I'm fully aware of the point you're making, and quite frankly, you can go as \"deep\" as you want to, but IMHO, it's still inconsequential. We'll get to \"white culture group\" later.\n \n I don't even know where to start with this. Part of me wants to just dismiss you as being full of self-pity and just say boo hoo, suck it up, but the other part of me truly wants to understand how you can feel something as simple as skiing makes you disadvantaged.\n \n I know you want to use skiing as a metaphor for the great oppression of minorities, but I just don't buy it. According to you, that makes me naive/ignorant. I call it common sense, everyone has different backgrounds and exposures, regardless of race. \n \n This is the US, everyone can turn on their TV and watch Warren Miller, watch the Olympics, etc.. that's pretty much the extent of my skiing knowledge. American culture is all around you, no one has limited your exposure to it, or your ability to learn or immerse yourself in it. \n \n I've never travelled outside western Canada. What's your travel experience? I feel I've got a decent handle on what's going on in eastern Canada, the US, and even Europe to some extent, I make a point of doing so. Would I be somewhat behind and different culturally in any of those places? Of course, but the differences are easily overcome if you have the desire to do so. I simply will not accept anything other than that, everyone has that power if they choose to use it.\n \n Skiing (the great metaphor of life).\n \n My brother skis, my parents and soon to be parents in law have never set foot on a ski slope, nor have any of their friends or siblings. My younger brother has never skiied. Soundly vaguely familiar? I know quite a few people that ski, they're white, East Indian, Pakistani, Asian, etc... I currently live about an hour away from Fernie, and the 88 Winter Olympics were held in the city I live in.\n \n No idea on percentage of skiiers, but I'd guess it's fairly proportional to population sizes, albeit there is likely a larger percentage of white skiiers. The asians are giving \"us\" a run for our money these days though. I'd also suggest that skiing is a second generation phenomenon, and that minority participation will increase with every generation that is exposed to it from a young age.\n \n Skiing isn't cheap, so no doubt, skiing favours those with a higher income, contrary to your assertion, at least where I live, that does not form a direct correlation with minorites.\n \n Should we go through a list of every sport and determine its \"whiteness\"? I've never surfed, a sport invented by \"your people\", does that put me at a disadvantage? Or is surfing a minority sport? Would you say surfing as a \"job qualification\" or even as a larger metaphor, has more to do with the area of the country, type of job, and exact managers I'm applying to than my \"culture\"?\n \n Let's go beyond sports/passtimes, give me a few other examples of how you're disadvantage, help me \"comprehend\" your problem.\n \n \nSOrry I guess you didn't understand law school tests. Generally you need to see the same as the professor. Sometimes you do get points proving your point but they're trivial points. Many times professors in college grade papers lower if they don't agree with their perspective. This si because liek all professors they believe that they ahve laid out a foudnation for their perspective and if you don't see it then you really didn't understand the course.\n\n \n If it's all laid out for you by the professor, what's your excuse? Perhaps you don't understand it. Look, I have no doubt that cultural differences cause problems, I've experienced it myself in university, but rather than feel sorry for myself and ask the government to help me, I buckled down and worked through it. All I ask is that everyone else do the same.\n \n \nWhite culture is the general culture adopted by anglo europreans in America which has more to do with what they ahve learned form living in this country than what has been passed on to them from their heritage and ethnic ancestry.\n\n \n The world's vaguest definition, and IMHO, meaningless. Go to the thread entitled \"What exactly is white culture\", maybe you can give a more precise answer there.\n \n \nNo the argument is that a employer is free to choose who they want if they posess the minimun. The argument of this is because then they can hire the minority student because they want to bring in a different persective into the workplace and educational setting. \n \n \n So what's the race point here again? \n \n If all the candidates meet the minimum requirements, of what importance is race? \n \n Does one have to be a minority to have a different perspective? \n \n \nYeah they do have the right to hire someone regarldess. And if he decides to hire a minority he can. Affirmative consideration is based upon the ability to consider diversity as a factor. The law does not mandate that someone or any insitution do it. it simply allows it.\n\n \n Not always true, employers are often FORCED to hire minorities in order to fill AA quotas. Additionally, not hiring the minority is far more likely to end up in some form of a lawsuit than not hiring the white applicant. \n \n There are numerous examples of this out there. Try getting on with any police force in Canada unless you are a minority, nearly impossible, regardless of your qualifications. I consider that descrimination, not \"consideration\".\n \n I know you honestly feel that you're disadvantaged, but I honestly don't see it. I see someone struggling with the same issues that every student and new grad struggles with as they try to get their foot in the door. Plain and simple.\n \n Waxy",

   "Sorry everyone I do not have very much time to respond. I do appreciate everyone's feedback. It helps me to see what people think and I hope it's helping to expand everyone's perspective.\n \n \n \n So, since you agree that student #2 is disadvantaged with respect to student #1, then do you think AA should also apply to Student #2? After all, you stated that AA's intent is to assist the disadvantaged. Now, here's the point of my questioning. The majority of the poor in the US are WHITE, not minorities, yet there is no AA for them. \n \n http://www.census.gov/hhes/poverty/poverty02/table1.pdf\n\n Affirmative action isn't about poverty. It's about helping people that are disadvantaged due to their race by fault of the government.\n It jsut happens that many of these disadvantages have led minorities to be poor. There is help for the poor, it's called public assistance. Affirmative action helps the disadvantages casued by race not income. It jsut addresses the problems that race played in causing their poverty.\n \n Also since most of this country is white, I'd expect most of the poor to be white. The fact is that there is a higher level of poverty among minorities. Your link shows that. Anything you can attribute to poveryt among whites you can attribute to minorities. Minorities also have the fact that they have been severly disadvantaged by the governemnt by their actions and negligence on the part of all minorities.\n \n \n\n Don't you think there is a basic flaw in the practice of AA, if its intent was solely to \"assist the disadvantaged\", but the largest disadvantaged group in the US is excluded from participation?\n Now, getting back to student #1. If he were to apply to one of my state's top institutions, the Univ. of Michigan, he would be given an automatic 20 points JUST for the color of his skin, no questions asked. (For comparison, you only get 1 additional point for \"aceing\" the SAT or ACT test.) \n http://aacaw.org/umpoints.pdf\n\n Assist the disadvantaged by their race and/or culture. Not disadvantaged by other means even though there is a high correlation between race and poverty.\n \n Also you should have read about how they do give the same about of points to minorities as they do to socioeconomic disadvantaged and athletes. So they do help those that are poor so you're argument about their past admissions process is flawed. Also they give more points based on GPA than test scores because grades in schools are a better indicator of the grades someone will receive in school (but not their success in the workforce).\n \n \n \n\n According to U of M itself, if a race-blind admission system was used minority admission would drop from 14% to 4% in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts. So, in essence, they're saying that without purely racial preferences, 10% MORE of the student population would be whites that were more deserving to be there based on merit alone. IMO, that's sad. :( \n\n \n Let me give you some statistics taken from University of Michigan Law Review abotu Affirmative action.\n \n THere is no basis for your rasoning. Here are the statistics from michigan's own website.\n \n As Table 1 shows, eliminating racial preferences leaves the rate of\n admission for white applicants virtually unchanged at the high end of\n SAT scores (1300 and above), where the number of black applicants is\n especially small. Although the difference between the actual and hypothetical\n race-neutral admission rates for white applicants increases\n from roughly 3 to 5 percentage points as SAT scores decrease from\n 1300 to 1100, the advantage of race neutrality for white applicants remains\n small at precisely the SAT intervals where the advantage of race\n consciousness for black applicants is largest. The advantage of race\n neutrality appears to accrue primarily to white applicants at the low\n end of the SAT range (below 1100). There the difference between actual\n and hypothetical admission rates for whites approaches 7 percentage\n points, largely because the number of black applicants who would\n be denied admission under a race-neutral process is substantial relative\n to the total number of white applicants. However, since selective\n institutions admit so few applicants (black or white) in this low range,\n the advantage of race neutrality is more illusory than real. At SAT\n scores below 1000, for example, a white applicant who faced a 96.7%\n likelihood of rejection can hardly argue that race-consciousness cost\n her a letter of admission when she would have faced a 91.4% likelihood\n of rejection under a race-neutral process. For applicants facing\n such long odds, the marginal effect of affirmative action is just that -\n marginal.\n \n \n http://www.umich.edu/~urel/admissions/research/liu3.pdf",

Or for others to give them preferrences?\n [quote]\n Also you should have read about how they do give the same about of points to minorities as they do to socioeconomic disadvantaged and athletes.

Also they give more points based on GPA than test scores because grades in schools are a better indicator of the grades someone will receive in school (but not their success in the workforce).[quote]\n Not so. The point system is cummulative, so a poor black student gets more points than a poor white student by 20 points. A poor black athlete gets even more points.\n \n\n Let me give you some statistics taken from University of Michigan Law Review abotu Affirmative action.\n \n THere is no basis for your rasoning. Here are the statistics from michigan's own website.\n \n http://www.umich.edu/~urel/admissions/research/liu3.pdf\n\n \n From that same article, Vol100:1045, p1104,using data from a Mellon Foundation study involving 26,900 applicants, the author concluded:\n 11.4% of whites scored between 1200 - 1249 on SAT test\n 10.2% of blacks scored between 1200 - 1249 on SAT test\n Who was accepted? 60% of the blacks in that range and 19.3% of the whites. Does that sound like a small difference to you?\n I read your reference and it is loaded with pseudo-statistics to bolster a false claim that little harm is done. When it is advantageous to use %, they use %'s but when it's more advantageous to use raw numbers, they do that as well.\n As the saying goes: \"there are liars, there are damn liars and there are statisticians.\" Fortunately, I minored in statistics. \n ;)",

Survival of the fittest continues, it's just in many countries, less focused on actual killing.\n \n So giving a culture, race, individual, something that helps them succeed, hurts everyone else. To convince anyone, of any race or culture, that they should \"give someone else a boost\", and enforce it with law, is scary, unfair, and unnecessary to many.\n \n The American dream is, if you want it bad enough, you can achieve it here. And if you can't (say, become president because 95% of high level politicians are WASPs..not accurate, just example), then you have to either go to a country where you're the majority, or enact change that maybe in a few generations, will give someone of your background the opportunity.\n \n Life is filled with \"unfairness\", but you don't see short people asking for extra legislation to enforce equal wages/positions when compared to tall people, do you? Well, at least not today, but maybe one day right? How about not being Jewish and trying to break into Hollywood? See the stereotypes already start flying.\n \n In general, there is nothing \"in it\" for the majority with regards to affirmative action.

America has both and is diverse, what gives?\" Very scary isn't it.\n \n Again, not pro/con here, just trying to explain why it's so difficult a sell.\n \n -mach",

Thank you for your 22 years of service to our country. \n 2. Not all racial jokes are racist. My best friend out of college was a black technician that I shared a lab with. We traded ethnic jokes of all sorts all day long. We just found many of them plain old funny. Sometimes, we'd analyze the joke to get at the underlying stereotype and joke about that as well.\n 3. I agree that discrimination, when present, in the North is worse than in the South. Most people think of Southern Rednecks when you say racism, but Southern Rednecks aren't the ones making the bulk of the hiring decisions. They're typically on the low rungs of the employment ladder. Now, white liberal northeasterners are the worst because their racism is subtle and has a much greater impact on blacks because it is these people who are doing the hiring. \n I've found that the biggest advocates for minorities are pure capitalists. If they see a qualified black, they hire them because the only color that matters to them is green.",

   "Hello Chai,\n I am Black and I can tell you that there is still discrimination going on today I know first hand because I work in the IT field on anything from IP telephony/ Sat/Comms and VTC. I have White friends (who are ex mil) who work in places where there are no Blacks and they tell me the jokes that are told about Blacks around the watercooler and breakroom. Anyone in this forum in the IT field can vouch for this. There are some Blacks in this field but not that many and they are usually entry level jobs(like running cable/assembly line work).\n \n In my job I do a great deal of travaling to different companies and in my travels I can count the number of Blacks I have seen since 1999 (1999 was the year I retired from the Army) on 1 hand. Usually when I show up I can immediately tell that I was not what they expected. Being a mil brat and having served in the mil for 22 years I never picked up an accent and you would never know what I was by talking to me on the phone. I have even been looking for a house, found one I was interested in called made an appt to view only to arrive see the look on thier face and be told they had just rented the place out. Because of the field I work in the majority of my friends are White. If you happen to work around the mil you will find things are much better. But I think that is because we are forced to work together which forces us to get to know and understand the other. This is something the civ side is not forced to do.\n \n I think AA sucks, but without it what would be in its place. Do you really think people would do the right thing? I also think that if roles were reversed Blacks do the same things Whites did. I can remember in 1978 when I was in Redstone Arsenal Alabama going to school and was denied entry to restaurants(out with classmates for dinner). I was the only Black and I was dressed just as they were. I ran into the same thing in Andover Md last year only this time it was service so I just got up an left.\n Yes AA sucks, but what would you have in its place to keep from sliding back to the 50's/60's because that is what will happen. I am sure you have friends who would gladly go back to this if they could. By the way the North is much worse then the South, from crappy hotel rooms to service.\n \n Don't get me wrong things are not bad all over but there are still some trouble spots out there.

Given that the population is 88% white, shouldn't there be mostly whites on the team?\n Do you see how ridiculous it sounds when someone just quotes percentages of a race and doesn't stop to consider why the discrepancy might exist? What factors might account for the lack of representation at your company? Do you live in a predominantly white area? Is the field one that doesn't attract many minorities? Is it possible that blacks just don't apply to work where you do?\n Too many people ascribe sinister reasons for easily explained situations.

   "For those of you who don't consider people's personal experience as a feasible debate method, you might not want to read this post.\n \n I am a white female, both conservative and liberal (depends on the issue at hand), and have been on this earth quite awhile. I supported integration and affirmative action. Yes, I was around before the Civil Rights Movement. I have seen a lot of change in my lifetime, especially in the social arena. I agree with the two former military people who said that associating with others helps one get to know about different people, and helps one learn to accept and respect those who are different from you. I teach and have taught for many years at a public high school located near a military base, so our school is very diverse. We have students from or who have lived in 83 different countries, many with parents from those various countries. Overall, our students get along with one another very well (as always, there are exceptions, but generally speaking we have very few racial/ethnic/religious conflicts). For over 38% of our students, English is not their first language or the primary language spoken in the home. As a Sociology and World History teacher the diversity is a teaching dream. Having said all of the above, this is why I no longer support affirmative action.\n \n Affirmative action is a new type of discrimination in that it is not equally applied to all minorities. In the last 5 years, I have seen tensions rise to unbelievable levels over the issue of minority scholarships. I have seen friendships break-up over black students getting preferential treatment over hispanic students. I have witnessed fights over black females (counts as 2 quota points - 1 for black, 1 for female) getting preferential treatment over black males. Asian and white students want me to explain why it's fair that they have to compete with everyone for general scholarships, but others have scholarships for their specific groups, AND get to compete for the general scholarships. All the work of integration and its positive benefits is being lost when people believe that there is one set of rules for a group and a different set of rules for another group. In this I think we are being short-sighted. Doing one thing to help the people in society learn about one another (integration) and undoing the good by making people think they are being treated unfairly (inequity in scholarship distribution) seems to defeat the original purpose. \n \n The second reason I have changed my mind about AA is based on time. How long does one have to level the playing field for past sins? AA has been around for 30 plus years, mainly designed to \"compensate\" for the injustices done to blacks pre-civil rights. By my reckoning most blacks from this time period should have been done with college, gotten a job (also, through the mandates of AA), and moved themselves out of poverty, thus they should be able to now help their children themselves, and AA should be passed on to the newest minority groups moving into the country, giving those people their chance at moving into the mainstream. This of course presumes that AA was intended to help all minorities. \n \n On other issues stated in this thread:\n \n Someone (I think it was the thread starter, but I'm not positive) stated that everyone paid taxes. This is blatantly false. People under a certain income level pay no taxes. It was also stated that even college students paid taxes. Unless they have an unbelievably well-paid job, they get all those income taxes back after filing in April. It is true that all workers pay FICA taxes that they don't get back, but this is supposedly used for Social Security which again supposedly, they will get back when they retire. People who garner their income from \"social programs\" ie welfare pay no taxes of any kind (except sales tax on purchases made). If we really wanted to make our society more equitable, we would help the working poor, with child care and medical showing that we, as a society, support those who try to help themselves. We send the wrong message to youngsters when they learn that one can get something for nothing and that the society owes them something simply because they were born. I have many students who fall into this category, truly believing that the \"government\" should pay their way in life because the family has been living on welfare, excuse me \"social programs\" for generations. I use this example in class when the students talk about the government paying for everything. Question: \"Where do you think the government gets its money from?\" Answer: \"Taxpayers.\" Question: \"Who are the taxpayers?\" Answer: \"People who work.\" Question: \"Then what you are saying is that I should get up every day, come to work, and give you part of my paycheck because you don't choose to work?\" Gets them everytime! Answer: \"Well, no, you shouldn't have to give me part of your paycheck, that's not fair. I don't want to give someone money that I work for.\" Giving people something for nothing destroys their self-worth and their drive to do something about the situation they find themselves in.\n \n Next question is \"Have I ever been discriminated against, because if I haven't, I can't understand what minorities go through.\" Yes, I have been discriminated against on racial/ethnic/gender issues. When I lived out west in the US, I have been refused service because \"this establishment doesn't serve Indians\" (both of my great-grandmothers were Indians). Funny thing is, they would serve my sister (same parents, but she was blonde so the Indian was not as noticable). We used to get a big kick out of this since she was pulling one over on them. This was before civil rights legislation. When I go home to Florida, I am singled out because people think I am Hispanic. Last year when I went to buy a new car, the salesman wanted me to call my husband (I could just see him mentally patting me on the head) so he could explain everything to him. My husband knows as little about car engines as I do, and next to nothing about our finances since I take care of them. Had someone told me I was a minority, and therefore needed the help of the government to navigate my world, I would never have learned to fend for myself or to deal with bigots.\n \n Ultimately I guess my point is that everyone has something to overcome (some more that others) and learning how to do that gives a person a sense of one's abilities, self-worth, and empowerment. Having something given to you because of the way you were born tends to make one unsure of his/her abilities, self-worth, and ability to function in the world. In terms of life lessons the latter is devastating in the ability to move forward establishing a mind-set of hopelessness, whether we are speaking of a single person or a group of people.",

   "Statistics show more blacks are in prison than whites. More criminals to pull over? \n\n \n What If Whites Were Race Profiled?\n By Earl Ofari Hutchinson, AlterNet\n Posted on January 15, 2003, Printed on March 29, 2005\n http://www.alternet.org/story/14948/\n The recent Boston Globe story that revealed that blacks and Latinos are far more likely to be stopped and their cars searched during routine traffic stops is hardly news. The paper, which published its finding after analyzing nearly a million traffic tickets issued by police agencies throughout Massachusetts, merely confirmed what civil rights leaders have been saying for years.\n \n However, the real news buried in the story was that the whites police stopped were much more likely to possess drugs than blacks or Latinos. This is no aberration. A couple of years ago, San Diego police officials acknowledged that black and Latino motorists were three times more likely to be stopped by police than whites. Yet, police found no greater amounts of illegal contraband on blacks than whites, and far less on Latinos than on whites. Also, following a barrage of lawsuits, costly settlements, and the threat of Justice Department intervention, in April, 1999, then New Jersey Governor Christie Whitman publicly admitted that many New Jersey state troopers racially profiled black and Latino motorists. What got virtually no public mention was that the blacks stopped were less likely to carry drugs, weapons and illegal contraband than the relative handful of whites stopped and searched.\n \n This should not really surprise since the profile of a typical drug user in America is not a poor black, or Latino, but a young, middle-income white. The Justice Department?s 1998 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, for instance, found that white students were four to five times more likely to sell and use drugs than blacks. Other studies have confirmed that whites use drugs more frequently than blacks or Latinos.\n \n The entertainment magazines, scandal tabloids and TV talk shows are crammed with legions of articles and news features on and interviews with high-profile white stars, starlets and athletes who openly brag or cry about their drug escapades. They are not vilified or stereotyped. They are the object of public pity for their heroic battles against addiction. And Hollywood celebrities such as Robert Downey, Jr., continue their careers even after they have been convicted of drug offenses. The lopsided drug use by young whites has ignited no outcry for mass arrests, prosecutions and tough prison sentences for them. It would be political suicide for any public official to dare suggest that police profile white drug users as a tactic to win the drug war.\n \n But the Globe revelation about white drug arrests raises this intriguing question. What if whites were profiled as relentlessly as civil rights leaders repeatedly charge that blacks and Latinos are, and an analysis of data of traffic stops based on race that police agencies in the 20 other states that are now required to compile would probably confirm?\n \n It would radically change the complexion of the nearly two million prisoners that now jam America?s jails and prisons. At present, nearly half of them are black. And the overwhelming majority of them are there for petty crimes and drug offenses. They are more likely to get stiffer sentences in state and federal courts than whites. They were far less likely to strike plea bargains, get summary probation, have their juvenile records sealed, and get referrals to drug diversion programs than whites. If the Globe had gone one step further and analyzed the cases of the whites that were arrested for drug offenses following traffic stops and car searches, it would have been interesting to know what, if any, sentences they got as opposed to the blacks and Latinos police stopped and arrested.\n \n White profiling would also probably show that racial-profiling is a worthless police tool in preventing drug crimes. The drugs would still flow just as freely in the suburbs, on college campuses and in chic offices as it does in the ghettoes. It would, however, criminalize a generation of young whites, just as it has done with young blacks and Latinos, further obliterate civil liberties protections and create grotesque racial stereotypes about crime and criminals.\n \n But white profiling could accelerate the drive by drug reform groups, some lawmakers, and the courts to send people to drug treatment programs rather than prison. It could prod President Bush to back up the quickly forgotten pledge he made during the presidential campaign to take a fresh look at the nation?s drug laws with an eye toward reform. It could also force Congress to approve the recommendations made by the U.S. Sentencing Commission during former President Clinton?s second term to modify or eliminate the racial disparities in the mandatory federal drug sentencing laws.\n \n While the Globe presented no new news about who is racially profiled in America, it did explode the myth that blacks and Latinos are America?s inherent lawbreakers. That is certainly news.\n \n http://www.alternet.org/columnists/story/14948/\n \n \n That there is a pattern of differential treatment is clear. \n \n Statewide, when local police cited drivers for speeding 45 m.p.h. in a 30 m.p.h. zone, the most common offense, whites drove away with a ticket 31 percent of the time, while 49 percent of minorities received a ticket. The figures are based on an analysis of 166,000 tickets and warnings from every police department in the state in a two-month period, April and May of 2001. These were the only months for which the Registry of Motor Vehicles collected all warnings as part of a state-sponsored test for profiling. \n \n When factors of race and sex are considered together, the records reveal a tiered system of ticketing. Local police allow white women to drive faster without penalty, while reserving the harshest treatment for minority men. When drivers went 45 m.p.h. in a 30 m.p.h. zone, white women were ticketed 28 percent of the time in the two sample months; white men, 34 percent; minority women, 44 percent; and minority men, 52 percent. \n \n http://www.boston.com/globe/metro/packages/tickets/072003.shtml",

You are sent unqualified minorities by Personnel because they have a goal to find X number of minority candidates. In fact, it's one of their job accountabilities by which they're performance is rated.\n 2. They write annual reports on the effectiveness of their programs to decrease the \"under-representation\" of minorities in targeted job classifications thAt are presented to upper management. These reports give the CEO and Execs a \"warm and fuzzy\" feeling that their company is PC. That's a big deal in today's business world.\n 3. Personnel Managers haven't the slightest idea of what a qualified technical candidate is. All they see is demographics. A black woman with a spanish surname counts as 3 EEO points on their scoreboard. It doesn't matter to them one iota whether or not that person can actually perform the job they're being interviewed for.\n \n If the above sounds cynical, it is. I've been there, done that and have the battle scars as a result. I've also got a good record of hiring qualified minorities and rejecting poor candidates. In fact, one of my female hirees became my boss for a few years before going into marketing. Another black female that I hired went on to become our QA manager before leaving to work for a competitor.",

I have taken to lying when people ask the question (I tell them I am a consultant) and they seem fine with that.\n\n \n I wish that I was old enough to retire. Then I could devote all of my time to starting my own business. This part-time stuff sucks. I don't have the patience for a slow ramp-up. emoticon_mad",

Slow ramp up usually equates to slower capital investment. Ig you go nuts out the firt year and dump a hundred grand, then go teats up the second, you have lost a hundred grand. If you do a slower start up and only invest $20 grand the first year, you only loose that.\n \n Hopefully, you will be part of the 10% that makes it. If not, you will be glad you did a slow startup, not to mention glad that you still have the income from your job.\n \n BTW, age has nothing to do with retirement",

I have no intentions of becoming over-extended when rolling the dice.\n \n\n BTW, age has nothing to do with retirement\n\n \n Glad to hear it. I don't plan to wait until I'm too infirmed to work before I retire. I want to get out of the rat race while I still have good health so that I can do some serious traveling.",
