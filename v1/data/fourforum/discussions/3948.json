   "This current War was nothing more than a resumption of hostilities after Husseing Bluffed his way into oblivion. So you based your assumption that the current military is of \"Tepid intelligence\" simply because they are currently serving? This seems like you are back peddling doesn't it?\n\n \n Now that we have officially ended the search for WMD's and have found none, it would certainly seem that there were intelligence failures somewhere (or else we were simply lying...I am open to either possibility). \n \n As far as the current military goes, the pentagon has been complaining for quite a few years about the \"quality of recruit\". The average IQ in the military is 85. That should tell you something right there. IT isn't the same military us older guys remember and served in. While \"americas finest\" has never been anything more than a buzz phrase to glorify military service for potential enlistees, with this newest batch, it is downright fraud. Tehy are recruiting guys out of homeless shelters. Only about 20% of the \"money for college\" they push so hard is being collected. Partly this is due to the restictions placed on its use, but the primary reason is that according to pentagon estimates, less than 30% of current enlistees have the mental capability of comleting a year of college.

To say that a Middle Eastern man would prefer the \"Chains of servitude to the Animating contest of freedom\" reeks of racism. yet you try to convey a Nazi label on me for supporting those willing to die for your freedoms. \n \n \n 180 degrees from our belief system? Our system is based almost entirely on English common law. We were fighting not for new and revolutionary rights, but for our rights as free Englishmen. \n \n American style democracy is not popular in a lot of the world, and with good reason. People look at the great experiment that is American democracy and see what Americans refuse to, the absolute lack of accountability that our politicians enjoy. American politicians lying to their constituents is so comon it has become a cliche.

   "\n Yes, I would agree: but we have to remember that the special relationship that exists among servicemen - especially after being in harm's way - should not make us too sensitive about legitimate criticism from citizens who may not have had the exposure to danger that the military must sometimes face. It's not an insult to the serving men and women in Iraq to point out the probability that they've all been put there under false pretences. \n \n\n \n \n The key word is legitamate concerns. You want to discuss your views of false pretenses fine with me but I called George a gentleman of \"tepid intelligence\" I would bet I would get a warning from an admin. To call MOST people who join the military of \"tepid intelligence\" is elitism at best. Its rude and insulting. \n \n \n \nI'm not interested in arguing the patriotism of anyone on this board, I don't know anyone well enough to make that evaluation. In addition, I've never seen a single post that criticized the men and women serving in our armed forces. I honestly feel you took Georges comment out of context, as I have read many of his previous postings. The criticisms have all been leveled at the administration, and primarily for our involvement in Iraq. You're entitled to your views on our participation in reshaping the Middle East, just don't push them down everyone else's throat. If the military was the right path for you, that's great. Just remember, it was your choice.\n\n \n \n \n This has nothing to do with patriotism. I'm not pushing anything down anyones throat. George stated \"Few people with more than tepid intelligence levels...\" Not only is this critisizm its flat our insulting. I responded how am I pushing anything down anyones throat? What if George said that those firemen who ran into the WTC before it collapsed were of \"tepid intelligence\"? Would you then go after anyone defending firemen? \n \n \n \n\n While most fast food and Walmart jobs start at near minmum wage, I'll use $6/hr, or $12.5k per year, with no benefits and a dead end.

While undoubtedly millions of people would be happy to relocate to the US for a variety of reasons, economic gain being at the forefront if Mexico and S.

They were rapidly moving their money out of Mexico, but had no intent of a personal physical relocation.

Following Ruby ridge and Waco, how many governemtn officials and policymakers went to prison? Innocent people were intentionally killed by government agents in both cases. It would certainly seem that some jail time for somebody would have been in order, especially considering the number of folks killed at waco (we are not talking one or two accidental deaths here). Instead there was a big investigation, nobody was really punished, and the whole thing ended with a bunch of dead civilians and not 1 single government official taking any responsibility. \n \n Yes, occasionally a US politician will get so out of hand that we fire them, but not very often, and when we \"fire\" a congressman they still get a boatload of perks, including full salary for life. What a punishment.\n \n BTW, I didn't say that people didn't like the idea of democracy, I said they don't always like the idea of an American style democracy. There are other forms of democracy out there beyond our massive bureaucracy where nobody is accountable to anybody and the will of the people is almost entirely ignored by our politicians which breeds an environment of pathetic indiference where the majority of the population doesn't bother to learn what IS going on, much less form opinions about what SHOULD be going on.\n \n \nWhat you call \"American style democracy\" is, in principle, the best system yet devised for the government of a free people under the law.

All I am saying is that other folks in other places seem to have a different opinion, and that trying to force American style democracy in people is a poor policy decision that is almost certian to fail. Part of this is that there are folks out there that do not like our system. PArt of it is human nature. If I walked up to somebody on the street, held them against a wall and stuffed hundred dollar bills in their pockets, they would still fight like hell to make me stop. Not because they don't want money in general, but because they wouldn't like being forced to take them.\n \n \n \nGiven the chance, you can safely bet that millions of people would cheerfully emigrate to the United States and gladly endure its many imperfections (including the political liars).\n\n \n Possibly. Still, we are fighting a 70% negative perception of the US. This tells me that there are plenty of folks in the world (the majority, in fact) that do not like America or what america stands for or how we live or any combination of the above or maybe some things I haven't thought to list. \n \n This has always been the problem with trying to force ones values on others. There will always be some who do not want them, do not agree with them, and at the end of the day, no matter how good you think your values and your system is, if you put a gun to somebodies head and say \"agree with me\" all you are going to get is a grumbling agreement and a knife in the back when you turn away. \n \n I will admit it is difficult for westerners to understand such a mindset. It took a good frined a long time to explain it to me. Americans primarily value the acquisition of \"stuff\" we like toys, we like cars, we like gadgets. If acquiring a bunch of stuff and a pile of money (or, to be mroe realistic, a pile of debt), america is a great choice and our system seems to be really good. There are those who value other things, who are fairly uninterested in the scquisition of a new suburban to haul around their bigscreen. If what you value is a safe environment to raise your children (low crime, etc...) or a moralistic society, America is quite possibly the worst system you could copy. \n \n It ia all a matter of priorities.\n \n \n \nNow this is how you critisize something as sensative as this without being insulting. Though Daewoo I am curious as to links to your sources. I agree with you on the GI bill issues, and I WOULD like the pentagon link as I would be very interested in reading it. I would also like to see something on this homless mans enlistment.\n\n \n I will dig it up this weekend. I get the congressional register in bound editions (not online). I think that if I find the edition and page number you can look it up online, though. The enlistment of the homeless was covered on MSNBC. Apparently they currently make up nearly 20% of new enlistees for the regular army.\n \n Of course, as you pointed out, the military pay scale is not great, so we are going to be scraping the bottom of the bucket in any event. I personally have no problem with them recruiting homeless people to join the military. It gets them off the street and makes them productive. We just need to keep it in mind when we refer to the latest batch of recruits as \"americas finest\". God, they had better not be.\n \n \nDaewoo, Georged, how do we get better recruits? Lowering benefits or raising them?\n\n \n I don't think that either one is likely to make a difference. People are not going to choose military service unless they see few or no other options. \n \n From a practical standpoint, we are probably not going to see an increase in benifits. paying soldiers is like paying firefighters. Neither is ever going to make a lot of money because the majority of the time they are useless, a drain on the system.\n \n Besides, we can't afford to give them a pay raise. We are sporting record debt levels, record inflation, record deficits, revenue is down, and if you factor Iraq related spending out of our GDP you end up with negative growth of between 1.5 and 2%. If you factor in debt service as well, we have a negative growth of nearly 3%. Sorry, there iwll be no raises for the troops.",

   "Thats funny cause I am anything but Pro-Government if you remember for the Gun control section days. I own several rifles as the final check and balance to our governments power My closest thing to a hunting rifle is my M1a with a McMillan stock, and a Leoupold scope and a bipod and I do not see government as an answer to our problems. What I do see though in my own independant observations is that a free Iraq is better than a tyrannicle Iraq. That free and open markets HELP not hinder the world economy. I also see that we have been attacked on our soil by those enemies of freedom (people who do not believe in equal rights and religeous freedom and tolerance) and that this president (Who I only voted for once, btw) made the correct choice (he has made many incorrect choices too) by going into Iraq to draw these enemies of the west into a fight on thier soil, break up the biggest embezzlement scheme in world history (Oil for food programs), take the fear and question \"Does Hussein have WMD\" right off the table, Put our presence right smack in the middle of this snakes pit of intolerance to say \"Don't Tread on Me\". The more we ignore the fight these islamo-facists are bringing to us the more American civillians will die and I for one support using our war fighters to bring the fight to them.\n\n \n That's where we're sharply divided in our opinions. I know where you stand. I've been well armed since age 12. And always respect military professionals, lifers, because most of them made the commitment as warriors regardless of who happens to be commanding them. The remainder are second-string. I well understand their love of war, that's their purpose. My opinion of our involvement in Iraq has nothing to do with the people of Iraq, how they're governed, anymore that I care about how Poland, Costa Rica or any other third tier nation is doing or who's running that show. Iraq was purely a bad call. Even optimistic intelligence estimates place putting a source near Bin Laden will take years if not a decade to accomplish, so round one to Bin Laden. Not for 9/11, that was an attention getter, for the war on terror and Iraq. $250k for an economic loss to the US so immense calculations are ongoing. It's the money that bothers me. We simply can't afford to be at war in a quagmire with no economic gain. And Iraq has nothing to do with a war on terror other than providing political and bent moral gain, not tangible in a material society. There's no way deficit spending can be reduced when at war, our problem being that we have a service based industry which doesn't have the capability to recover ongoing public deficits created by what our leaders have erroneously, deceitfully defined as defense. The longer we pursue aggression on credit without ability to repay, the harder we're going to fall. I'm assuming you understand the financial ramifications to our treasury system created by loss of manufacturing superiority and our fiscal future based on being a debtor nation not yet stabilized.

I think the system as it was percieved is likely the best we have seen to date. The system as it is practiced today is an entirely different monster.\n \n As concieved, we had a congress that was elected from the population at large and was wholly responsible to a relatively small constitutency. That congress had very limited powers. For a lot of years, it was composed of fairly simple folk, not professional politicians, and the debating that took place on the floor of congress made it very difficult to get anything done. you really had to have a mandate from the people in order to get anything passed. Today, congress has claimed that everything from murder to vetrinary practices falls under the heading of \"interstate commerce\" the entire organisation has been taken over by professional politicians, and we now enjoy living under the crushing weight of over 300,000,000 laws and regulations, which is more than any other 3 nations on the planet combined. \n \n We had a judicial system which was devised to bring justice to the common man. It was a multi tiered system, with the supreme court sitting on high and everybody had the right to appeal the decision of a lower court right up tot he supreme court if needed. If you look at early american justice, it was not at all unusual for the supreme court to hear cases where one (or sometimes both) sides were arguing their case without benifit of legal council. \n \n This has devolved into a system that is so mired in obscure legal pretense and precedence that to appear in court without council is the mark of a fool, and you are still free to appeal any case, so long as you understand that it will likely cost you millions of dollars to get any real justice. Political commentators during the 19th century often claimed that America was the easiest nation in the world for the common man to get justice. I seriously doubt you can find 10 people who would suggest the same today.\n \n The presidency.....well, I don't think I probably even have to comment on this one. \n \n \n \nNobody in his senses would try to justify shoving the American system down the throats of people who are content with their tyrannies.\n\n \n I am not suggesting that people are content with a tyranny, simply that they see other approaches that they prefer to the American one. As you pointed out above, there are shortcomings to the system. There are those in this world to whom those shortcomings are a real problem and they would prefer to try something besides our system. Americans seem to have forgotten things like the \"right of self determination\" . These were important principals and worth rememebring. If Iraqis don't want to try it our way, so be it. We should not force them. What we essentially have done in so many nations though is supervised the drafting of their constitution, or the foundation for their government, and insisted that it be modeled on ours. I don't think this is right for a couple of reasons. First, I don't think any nation has the right to force a modeling of another nations political system. Second, while our system seems ideal in the western world, and for those with western ideals, it may not be a perfect fit for people with different ideals. What is important to a guy living in new york, or london, or even paris, means nothing to a beduin.\n \n One of the biggest obstacles is that our system relies heavily on a western understanding of land rights. You do not find western type land rights outside of the west. When you are talking abotu places like the ME, you have to realise that there are still nomadic people there, and they are not shunned as an abboration. So, when it comes time to vote, and 2000 beduin have just set up camp in the desert outside your town, do they get to vote? Since they are purely nomadic, do they ever get to vote?\n \n Arabs are pretty much used to moving with impunity thrught the Arab world. If you live in Jordan and want to see your relatives in syria, you just go. You don't need a passport. If there is any security at the border crossing at all, likely as not they are sitting in the shade palying cards and won't even look up as you drive by.\n \n The Arab nations that are considered by arabs to be very \n \"western\" are also some of the most tyrannical in the region (saudi arabia, kuwait, IRAQ). Most of the nations that we see as backward or (if you are looking for a political buzz line, \"evil\") are considered to be pretty decent places to live by the arabs who live there. Sure, the rulesrs of libya and syria are pretty bad by our standards, mostly because they are a thorn in our side, but they mostly leave their own people alone. They do not bury them in laws and regulations. Arabs see this as a good thing.",

The system as it is practiced today is an entirely different monster.\n \n As concieved, we had a congress that was elected from the population at large and was wholly responsible to a relatively small constitutency. That congress had very limited powers. For a lot of years, it was composed of fairly simple folk, not professional politicians, and the debating that took place on the floor of congress made it very difficult to get anything done. you really had to have a mandate from the people in order to get anything passed. Today, congress has claimed that everything from murder to vetrinary practices falls under the heading of \"interstate commerce\" the entire organisation has been taken over by professional politicians, and we now enjoy living under the crushing weight of over 300,000,000 laws and regulations, which is more than any other 3 nations on the planet combined. \n \n We had a judicial system which was devised to bring justice to the common man. It was a multi tiered system, with the supreme court sitting on high and everybody had the right to appeal the decision of a lower court right up tot he supreme court if needed. If you look at early american justice, it was not at all unusual for the supreme court to hear cases where one (or sometimes both) sides were arguing their case without benifit of legal council. \n .\n\n \n OK: Your 70% figure (concerning negative attitudes towards America) may not be just your personal opinion - but it's still only an opinion that may or may not be representative depending on how the sample from which it comes was selected etc. \n \n As for the over-regulation that American government indulges in - I believe that's commonplace throughout Western democracies. I sometimes wonder whether the ONLY purpose of the British government is to pass yet more laws and fine tune the thousands already in the statute book. But, you have to remember that in the US there's a countervailing force which I would describe as \"American individualism\". This is an important safeguard of your freedoms.\n \n Yes, the Supreme Court has become a remote institution too concerned perhaps with \"interpreting the penumbra\" of the constitution. But once again, I emphasise in principle, it has a far better rational grounding for its existence than say the judiciary of English common law. \n \n I entirely agree with your sentiments about exporting the \"American way\" to people who do not want it. However, in my view, it's their loss - but their choices should be respected.",

   "Here's an interesting discussion on American democracy that relates to this thread: \n \n http://www.dawn.com/2003/09/01/op.htm#1\n \n While I'm in agreement that America has the best system, Lincoln's early concerns of power moving from the people to government and Nixon's statement stressing the importance of ME oil display noted turning points in our youthful nation. At the time of Nixon's statement, the US was clearly still the dominant world industrial power. As global trade began to upsurp formerly exclusive US markets, US terminology regarding the ME began transformation from blatant importance of oil (Nixon's era) to our now public palatable humanitarian view of ideological conversion for purposes of control.\n \n Summing up why the Bush twins will never see Iraq is in the final two paragraphs and related to numerous forum threads here and on other boards, US public apathy towards democracy during the period of great prosperity following WW2 and how that apathy has developed greatly diminished individual responsibility in our governing system:\n \n ~The problem is that the number of Americans who participate in the elections or in other forms of political process seem to be disturbingly small. It is well known that the United States ranks 139th in the world in terms of average voter turnout in national elections since 1945. Similarly, it is well known that there has taken place so much gerrymandering of legislative districts that only four House of Representative incumbents were defeated by challengers in 2002. (\"The Fewest in History\") In addition, more than 40 per cent of state legislative races \"since 1996 have been uncontested by one of the two major parties.\" (Steven Hill and Rob Richie, \"Action Potential\", American Prospect). \n \n Based on this evidence, Hill and Richie concluded that \"most legislative districts have become one-party fiefdoms where the outcome is preordained, undermining accountability and the relationship between legislators and their constituents.\"~",

   "OK: Your 70% figure (concerning negative attitudes towards America) may not be just your personal opinion - but it's still only an opinion that may or may not be representative depending on how the sample from which it comes was selected etc. \n\n \n It was kind of an interesting read. I will see if I can dig up an archived copy and link it. What they did was a blind telephone poll and the results were broken down by nation. Waht surprised em was the high numbers of disaproval in Eurpoean nations. I rather expected to see VERY high numbers in the ME, and fairly low numbers in Europe. Britain was, I believe, around 18% (negative). Most european nations ran between 30% and 70%. Teh way the numbers worked out, negative feelings toawards america seemed to be directly related to teh size of the country. The only conclusion I can draw from this is that people in smaller nations have been made uncomforatbel by our recent eagerness to liberate pushover countries. The two real anomolies t this were France and Britian. Since the brits have pretty much thrown their lot in with us on our little crusade, I think that explains those numbers. I think the french numbers (which were really high) were probably rleated to the widescale anti french sentiment int eh US at tha time since they refused to join our little venture.\n \n \nAs for the over-regulation that American government indulges in - I believe that's commonplace throughout Western democracies. I sometimes wonder whether the ONLY purpose of the British government is to pass yet more laws and fine tune the thousands already in the statute book. But, you have to remember that in the US there's a countervailing force which I would describe as \"American individualism\". This is an important safeguard of your freedoms.\n\n \n American individualism? Is that a joke? Have you every seen a newer american subdivision? People live in what is fairly commonly refered to as \"cookie cuttter houses\". They are all the same. Generally a subdivision of 500 hosues will have only 5-10 avalable floorplans. They are all painted either beige or light blue (which in some parts of the country is a little different. Some places they paint them all light green, or a pleasant aqua color). Interior walls are all either beige or white with the occasional accent wall tossed in. \n \n American indivdualism has been beat to death and buried a LONG time ago. Sure, we have our share of geeks adn freaks, folks who rush to declare their individuality.....carefully though, and in such a manner that they are very nearly indistinguishable form all the other folks declaring their individuality.\n \n As far as politics go, we have basically 2 parties. People have become so attached to the labels that they haven't even noticed that the political ideaologies have become so close that they are idistiguisable even by an expert. To prove this to some associates of mine, during the last election I typed up and printed out word for word key policy considerations from both canidates web pages. I handed these pages to a political science professor from the local university who moves in some of the same social circles as I. I was unable to correctly sort the proposed policies. Nobody who tried it was able to. Yet, despite the fact that the differences between the two canidates was so slight, this was one of the most hotly contested elections in recent history. I am still trying to figure that one out.\n \n \nYes, the Supreme Court has become a remote institution too concerned perhaps with \"interpreting the penumbra\" of the constitution.

However, in my view, it's their loss - but their choices should be respected.\n\n \n In principal, I agree, we have the best system out there. In practice, we have managed to take that great system and turn it into an absolute mess. We have destroyed or perverted nearly everything good about it. NOTHING works the way it was originally intended, and we are slowly tearing ourselves apart as a result.",

In most cases, either side could have blocked it, but neither side did. BUT, the American sheeple ate it up without ever realising that this is exaclty what was happening. The re-districting was ensuring a two party system for the forseeable future.",

As US states rights are trampled, especially with religion and federal compliance taking precedence over individual civil rights, we drift even farther from our original course.

I misunderstood your post (I believed you were talking about social individualism). Political individualism still survives to some extent at the local level. When you get to the state or federal level, I think it all but disapears. This is not so much the result of a change in the publics attitude, but a change in perception. \n \n We have essentially legeslated a 2 party system. Redistricting, campaign finance reform (largely aimed at ensuring that another perot can't show up on the scene and break the monompoly), and general public apathy have largely led to this. As a result, the ideaologies fo the two parties have become so close that they are indiscernable. Tke our current president. Core values of the republican party are small government, fiscal responsibility and personal freedoms. Our current president has passed the largest social program in recent history, increased the size of governemnt more than any president since WWII, passed the patriot act, which was akin to ligting fire to the constitution, and fought inthe supreme court for the right/ability to hold people in prison secretly and without trial. thisis the guy tat those who value personal freedom and freedom from big governmetn voted for.\n \n You can see it right here on this forum. There are a lot of folks who seem to believe in those values, and to a man they are bush supporters, often rabid bush supporters. Regardless of the fact that he has not exibited belief in any of the core values of the republican party, he has labeled himself a \"republican\" and a \"conservative\" and therefore is worthy of our votes. \n \n \n \nThe convergence of political ideologies is also something has been noticed almost everywhere else in the Western world. The modern politician is almost by definition a person without principles who will dissemble and affect any policy that keeps him (her too ?) in power. If this means crossing party lines to get a favorable result - then so be it.\n\n \n That is exactly correct. For a lot years I think this was less of an issue in the US as we held our politicians and our government accountable for every decision they made while in office. This accountability has all but disappeared. Our public is driven entirely by political slogans and 5 second sound bites. Our poiticians have gone beyond crossing idealigical lines. They have erased them. \n \n \nOne other point: the US is more thoroughly democratic than any other place you could name - take for instance the fact that thousands of minor public officials are directly elected by the voter and not appointed by the federal or states governments: this happens nowhere else.\n\n \n The only advantage to having local politicians is that they are cheap to buy and easy to get rid of if they fail to perform the function you paid them for. \n \n Like george, I have spent a lot of my life working the system to my advantage, and when needed, changing the system by supporting (generally with either cash for campaign funds or sometimes logistical \"support\" in the form of brokering lucrative business contracts, etc....) local politicians who will gaurantee protection and dominance for my business interests regardless of what it means in regards to public good at large. \n \n For the majority of my life my political morals have been based entirely on personal gain. I learned from my father (who was a politician for a large part of his life) how to play the system and how to pay off politicians without ending up in prison. I am quite good at it.\n \n My political ideology changed when I started having children. I find that I am spending time worrying about what their world will be like with personal rights, and government and corporate responsibility all flying the coop. From a purely selfish standpoint, this is great. I could triple, or even quadruple my current earnings if thre were not those out there who are heavily armed and carry a rather high minded view of their rights. If we could do away with corporate and government all together, I could AT LEAST triple my earnings again overnight. \n \n This is why I find some of the current political apathy I am seeing in America so disconcerting, and those who advocate giving up basic freedoms/rights for a little bit of safety or for the \"greater good\" so horrifying. I KNOW that guys like me and george (sorry george, a wolf knows the smell of its own) will eat the \"american public\" (who without concrete and uninfringable rights may as well be refered to as the \"american slave labor pool\") alive when we finally reach the point where governement and corporate accountibility are gone and rights become optional. \n \n \n As I have said on this board before, I am fairly new to my current line of political thinking, and still do not have all the details worked out. There seem to be a lot more out there like me, guys who never realised that things would go this far, and that the game of \"blindfold the public while you rape them\" would degenerate into a situation where the public is nearly entirely out of the loop. \n \n The problem is that the big players don't want to quit. They want to keep right on with the current pattern. They are looking ahead to the future where they can make decisions without having to factor in public reaction at all. The problem is that they future is already here in this regard. When was the last time you heard of a widespred boycott of an American company in response to their corporate policies (using child labor, sweatshops int he garmet industry, etc....)? Public revelation of such things (which requires either a very slow news week, or such widespread knowledge that the advertising supported news networks have no choice but to report them) is seen as a storm to be ridden out. 2, maybe 3 months of public discourse (during which you can expect sales to drop a whopping 15%), then it is back to business as usual. Worst case scenairo is a congressional investigation that can keep you in the public spotlight for up to 6 minths, before congress ends up handing in a report that spreads responsibility so thinly that it is easily shrugged off.\n \n Most companies factor \"what if we get caught\" contingency plans into yearly budget projections.",

Vietnam taught the politicians they can pretty well do as they please with foreign policy as long as they observed the proviso of low casualties while maintaining an economic circumstance and media coverage presenting minimal disturbance to the average citizen. \n \n We pretty much followed that pattern, using Israel and 'our' various ME dictators including Saddam to keep the ME destabilized, with a minimum of bad publicity and negligible expense. Even the Gulf War was primarily paid for by other countries, with the US taking heed of Russia's failure to break the resolve of tiny, supposedly helpless Afghanistan and declining to occupy Iraq and remove Saddam. \n \n Then came this administration. In a few short years they've managed to alienate a majority of the international community, immersed the country in a quagmire war very similar to the frustration level of Vietnam, thoroughly trampled states and civil rights, displayed fiscal irresponsibility by using public money in a manner worthy of a banana republic dictator and used Christianity as a wedge between their followers and non-followers. With no end in sight. I can't remember another administration that divided the American public as sharply on foreign and domestic policy in such a brief period of time.",

I\\'d like to know why Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz aren\\'t on trial.\n\n \n Assinging blame to some poor schmuck gives us the illision of accountability without actually haveing to make anybody in power pay any kind of price. \n \n Since we now know that torturing prisoners was takin gplace not only at abu ghraib, but in Afghanistan, GITMO, and a half dozen other prisons in Iraq, it would certainly indicate that this was our official policy. Accountability essentially stopped at Abu Ghraib, though, and with those who were foolish enough to allow their picture to be taken. This suggests pretty heavily to me that the real crime here in the eyes of the Bush administration was not the torture, but in getting caught. \n \n A agree with you entielry that some upper level officials should probably be in prison right now for that. Good luck making it happen, though. Upper level government officials have operated for years in America without having to worry about ending up in the slammer, no matter how criminal thewir activities may be.\n \n \n \nWell, thanks for making me even more depressed.\n I don\\'t get my coffee for the afternoon and now this! \n \n \n Well, if I could think of anything cheerful to say about the accountability of the US government I would say it. Unfortunatly I can\\'ty think of a single thing.",

   "Bush twins in the military? When pigs fly. I read just today that National Guard members are being offered $1000 a month tax free to waive the 24 month deployment limitation, and that bonuses have been raised to as high as $15,000 for long term Army enlistments. The Guard is adding hundreds of new recruiters in an effort offset the Guard members that are not reenlisting. At what point does our military stop being \"all volunteer\" and start being mercenaries?\n Anyone watching the Condy Rice confirmation hearings? The woman has had dozens of questions re Iraq directed at her and has very skillfully avoided any real answers. She is a very smart lady, but I would not buy a used car from her .... or her boss.\n Dono",
