   "It's 'thou shalt not murder'.\n \n And if we take murder in a moral sense, it essentially means 'immoral killing', making it a rather circular point: if abortion is morally speaking murder then it's wrong, but we have to first ascertain if it's wrong...\n\n \n yes, you're right. murder. i used the wrong word. thanks. So, do you believe it is wrong to stop the life of a human being developing in the womb? I've pointed out earlier that the developing child has it's own unique DNA seperate from it's mother which mean's it is not part of the woman's body (not having the same DNA as her mother's). The child at the point of conception has it's own unique identity based on this scientific fact. I would say that this basic 'fingerprint' of life is reason enough to believe we are in essence murdering another person... taking their life.\n \n What do you think, Obvious Child? Is that enough to ascertain that it is wrong?\n \n -theo",

I'm talking about a conceived life by sperm and egg giving the life a complete set of DNA which makes a human being. If you are arguing that this is somehow less than that... I don't know... maybe you need some biology lessons or something.\n \n -theo",
