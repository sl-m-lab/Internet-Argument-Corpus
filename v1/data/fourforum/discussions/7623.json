Most scientists who are religious look for God in what science does understand and has explained. So the way in which my view is different from the creationists or intelligent design proponents is that I find knowledge a compelling reason to believe in God.

Genesis does not rule out the possiblilty of some forms of animal or plant life being created originally, and some evolving later, so it's possible for a Christian to consider different possiblilties about THAT form of evolution. But since Genesis clearly states that man was formed \"from the dust of the ground......and man became a living soul\" - it rules out the possibility for a Christian to consider the possibility of man evolving from a common ancestor of an animal.

Do you have a source for that?\n\n \n I realize you were addressing birdan, but I couldn't resist:\n \n \n Catholics:\nConcerning human evolution, the Church has a more definite teaching. It allows for the possibility that man's body developed from previous biological forms, under God's guidance, but it insists on the special creation of his soul. Pope Pius XII declared that \"the teaching authority of the Church does not forbid that, in conformity with the present state of human sciences and sacred theology, research and discussions . . . take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter-[but] the Catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by God\" (Pius XII, Humani Generis 36). So whether the human body was specially created or developed, we are required to hold as a matter of Catholic faith that the human soul is specially created; it did not evolve, and it is not inherited from our parents, as our bodies are.\n \n While the Church permits belief in either special creation or developmental creation on certain questions, it in no circumstances permits belief in atheistic evolution.\n\n http://www.catholic.com/library/Adam_Eve_and_Evolution.asp\n \n \n Anglicans:\nIt seems perfectly possible to reconcile the historicity of Adam with at least some (theistic) evolutionary theory. Many biblical Christians in fact do so, believing them to be not entirely incompatible. To assert the historicity of an original pair who sinned through disobedience is one thing; it is quite another to deny all evolution and to assert that separate and special creation of everything both subhuman creatures and Adams body. The suggestion (for it is no more than this) does not seem to be against Scripture and therefore impossible that when God made man in His own image, what He did was to stamp His own likeness on one of the many hominoids which appear to have been living at the time (John Stott, The Church of England Newspaper, June 7, 1968).\n\n http://www.blueletterbible.org/faq/nbi/619.html\n \n \n Episcopalians: \n\"Science can inspire theology to think new thoughts about the relationship between God and the creation, as Big Bang cosmology and evolution have done ... none of these scientific discoveries and the theories that explain them stands in conflict with our understanding of what the Bible reveals about the relationship of God to God's creation.\"\n\n http://www.stnews.org/Commentary-2631.htm\n \n \n Methodists:\nWe recognize science as a legitimate interpretation of God's natural world. We affirm the validity of the claims of science in describing the natural world, although we preclude science from making authoritative claims about theological issues. We recognize technology as a legitimate use of God's natural world when such use enhances human life and enables all of God's children to develop their God-given creative potential without violating our ethical convictions about the relationship of humanity to the natural world.\n\n http://www2.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&mid=1820\n \n \n Presbyterians:\nNeither Scripture, our Confession of Faith, nor our Catechisms, teach the Creation of man by the direct and immediate acts of God so as to exclude the possibility of evolution as a scientific theory. Scripture states that \"out of the ground\" the Lord God formed every beast, Genesis 2:19, and \"of the dust of the ground\" the Lord God formed man, Genesis 2:7. Genesis 1 teaches that according to the Word of God there came into being Light, Firmament (called Heaven), the Earth and the Seas. Then, God said: \"Let the waters bring forth\" and \"Let the earth bring forth.\" After the creation of Light, the Firmament and the Earth, after the Earth and the Waters brought forth plant, aquatic and animal life, then God said: \"Let us make man.\" This man, Adam, meaning both a man and man, is by nature both individual and corporate. The name Adam is simply a generic term for man brought forth from the Earth. Genesis 1 describes Creation as taking place in six days; however, it is not necessary to understand the Genesis account as a scientific description of Creation.\n\n http://www.pcusa.org/theologyandworship/science/evolution.htm\n \n These are the positions of most of the mainline churches in America.

   "My point is that one time, prehistoric events that were not observed are not really provable.\n\n Although I don't agree with your point, I'll focus on this: evolution has occurred, evolution is occurring (and we're observing it right now, including macroevolution), and evolution will occur in the future, but you don't accept it.\n \n \nThat your worldview distorts your definition of the word \"proof\"??\n\n Keeping in mind that secularism isn't the same as atheism, how does a secular worldview distort my definition of proof?\n \n \nLets see now, you use the phrase \"divinity of Jesus...\" - I address it - then you say it has \"nothing to do with the divinity of Jesus\"? I LOVE THIS PLACE!!:xbanghead\n\n In this context, \"divinity\" means being a god. Conceptually, Jesus could have been a god and not done any teaching about deities.\n \n \nAnd you are wholly unwilling to consider any viewpoint that you think contradicts atheism, regardless of atheisms validity or the validity of your interpretation of atheism. Because you have the a priori belief that \"there is no God\" which you refuse to allow to be questioned, there is absolutely no amount of mathmatical, historic, or new scientific evidence that will even reach you, let alone convince you.\n\n Not much of a creative response, and still wrong. If you'd like to present arguments for the existence of god, start a thread in the appropriate forum. If you can present an airtight, convincing argument for the existence of god that overwhelms the arguments against, I'll believe that a god exists.\n If you can present solid scientific evidence that creationism is true, such that the evidence for evolution is refuted or overwhelmed, I'll believe in creationism. As a friend of mine often says, \"I'll believe anything that is true.\"\n \n \nAgain, prehistoric one time events that were not observed cannot be proven.\n\n Quite simply, evidence left by events of the past can be studied to deduce information about those events.\n \n \nYes. The last sentence of pandions post #5 referred to \"polls\", and your post #11 gave details of some polls. Porschuster correctly pointed out that arguments from statistics can be logically flawed, but implied that ~I~ was the one who needed to learn it!! Again, I love this place!!\n\n No, I was not arguing that, because more educated people accept evolutionary theory, evolutionary theory must be true. I was showing the correlation between education and believe, including how people form their beliefs. The stats I presented also countered your claim that the far less-educated would also believe in evolution more than the merely somewhat less educated. How could I have possibly brought up statistics if I was responding to you?\n \n \nWe touched on it briefly, as I recall. You made this statement; (post#78 of the \"bye bye\" thread)\n\n We touched on it more than briefly. But I'll say it again: secularism is not the same as atheism. No matter what you say, you can't change this.\n \n \n \nTalkorigins claims to represent science / Richard Dawkins claims to represent science. They both regularly claim that the supernatural had nothing to do with earth or life. \n\n The scientific papers referenced on Talkorigins do not make any statements about whether or not God exists. Richard Dawkins is entitled to his opinion.\n More importantly, you have shifted the goalposts. My statement was not in regard to whether a deity had anything to do with Earth or life, it only concerned the existence of a deity. Once again, if you have the belief that a deity must have had something to do with Earth or life, that's just tough beans for you, not for science.\n \n \n\"Overwhelming evidences\" was not my phrase.\n\n \"Overwhelming evidence\" was, so I'll rephrase: How about you pick one or two examples of your \"overwhelming evidence,\" and I'll refute it/them with secular (not atheistic) evidence. Your position is easily falsifiable; your position is so easily falsifiable, it has already been falsified.\n \n \nA new thread about comparing secularism to atheism could be an interesting one. I'll look into starting one.\n\n That would be good. While you're at it, consider taking me up on my other suggestions of thread topics.\n \n \nIf you don't know how I did it, maybe you're confused whether or not I did it at all. Maybe you should read it again. The point is, Kenneth Miller does not speak for most Christians, becase he's far too cozy with atheists.\n\n I am quite capable of reading, and your statement is directly contradictory to what Miller said. I even explained why.\n Nobody said Miller speaks for all Christians. Actually, the point is that evolutionary theory is neither atheistic nor anti-Christian. If your version of Christianity doesn't conform to reality, that's not reality's problem.\n \n \nIt's a list of scientists who believe in the Biblical account of creation. It's in bold print at the top of the list.\n\n But the question posed was about taxonomy.\n \n \nTalk origins / Richard Dawkins always, always, always insist that there's no deity that has anything to do with earth and life. (always)\n\n Talkorigins does no such thing. Richard Dawkins is not denied the right to have an opinion because he's a scientist. Science makes no such claim, and your repeated insistence that it does simply won't make it true.\n \n \nIt's in the context of what we're talking about here - it's in the book.\n\n So is the introductory portion of that chapter of Origin of Species, but that doesn't mean that Darwin believed that the eye couldn't evolve. Likewise, Dawkins isn't claiming that life is designed. In fact, you quoted the exact wording:\n \nHe says \"Biology is the study of complicated things that give the appearance of being designed for a purpose.\"\n\n This is not the same as saying that life is designed; the book is entirely about this topic.\n \n \nI'm glad you have all the answers. You may want to brush up on what's been politically going on in science over the last 50 or 60 years.\n\n You've tried this line on me before, so apparently you don't remember my response: I don't have all the answers, but I have many, many more answers than you have. Considering you haven't shown any knowledge of any aspects of science, you are in no position to tell me anything about science. Perhaps you should brush up on science in general, and even if you believe your claptrap about a giant conspiracy, focus on stuff from earlier. I know of a good book originally published in 1859 that would be a good starting point...\n \n \nMany of today's school children would like them too. I don't remember what others have asked or what I've said about it, but the recent I.D. movement has come up with plenty of them in the last couple of decades.\n\n Present them. Go right ahead.

   "Originally Posted by johnhanks\n The discovery of DNA, RNA and the genetic code in fact made what you call the 'mathmatical odds of chance origins' far shorter than they had been earlier.\n\n \n \nThe more complex something is, the easier it is to randomly happen?\n\n \n You miss the point. The elucidation of DNA replication and its role in coding protein structure provided a far, far simpler model for the molecular origins of living systems than could have been envisaged a generation earlier.\n \n \nNotice how [Dawkins] completely forgets that science has proven that the universe had a sudden, immediate beginning? Or did I take that out of context?\n\n \n Very much so. In the passage you cite Dawkins is not in fact arguing that DNA might have 'always existed', but is making the familiar point that creationists, who insist that life or the universe or whatever are too complex to have arisen without a purposeful designer, invariably brush aside the question of that designer's origin. If we are to accept that the creator has always existed, or that its origin is incapable of explanation, why can we simply not transfer those attributes to the universe itself? The big bang may have brought this space-time continuum into existence; but that doesn't mean that this space-time continuum is all there is, or all there's ever been.\n \n \nMany of today's school children would like them too.

   "Ah yes, the fable of the great flood! \n \n One example of several myths related to it:\n \n \nMyth #42\n All living creatures not on the ark perished.\n \n The Myth: And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark. (Gen. 7:23)\n \n The Reality: A race of giants, called nephilim in the Bible, survived the flood.\n \n Before the flood, the Bible says that there was a race of giants (see Gen. 6:4). The Hebrew word translated as \"giant\" is nephilim. In Numbers 13:33, we learn that after the Exodus the Israelites \"saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come from the giants.\" Again, the word translated as \"giants\" is nephilim. So, we have a race of nephilim before the flood and a race of nephilim in the time of Moses.
