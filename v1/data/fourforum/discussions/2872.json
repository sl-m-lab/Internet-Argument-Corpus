   "Just read this article. It's old but it's the first I've heard of \"transfer tubes.\" Maybe I'm behind the times\n \n http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1067728207768&call_pageid=968332188854&col=968350060724\n \n Here are some clips that, for me, are just sick.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n But today's military doesn't even use the words \"body bags\" - a term in common usage during the Vietnam War, when 58,000 Americans died.\n \n During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the Pentagon began calling them \"human remains pouches\" and it now refers to them as \"transfer tubes.\"\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 'Human remains pouches' was worse than 'body bags', maybe they should have kept that one, it made the soldiers sound like dog food. (sarcasm btw, don't berate me)\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Simpson notes that photos of the dead returning to American soil have historically been part of the ceremony, part of the picture of conflict and part of the public closure for families - until now.\n \n The policy of banning cameras at Dover dates back to the 1991 Gulf War, under Bush's father, Pentagon officials say.\n \n Clinton met returning coffins from Kosovo and, in an elaborate ceremony, was on hand for the arrival of the bodies of his former commerce secretary Ronald Brown 32 others killed in a 1996 plane crash.\n \n Pictures were allowed of incoming caskets after the terrorist attack on the USS Cole in 2000 and President George H.W. Bush helped eulogize Americans killed in Panama and Lebanon.\n \n But last March, a directive came down reaffirming the banning of cameras, likely in anticipation of the sheer volume of casualties being repatriated.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n So the amount of casualties was anticipated?\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n If there are no pictures of caskets being delivered to U.S. airbases, citizens don't think of them, analysts say.\n \n Dawson says television pictures of the wounded at Walter Reed would be a jolt to Americans as they head out to dinner or are thinking of the week's NFL matchups.\n \n Right now, he says, they likely equate war casualties with highway accidents: They know both kill and don't need to see graphic photos.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Yup, they are both the result of recklessness.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n There is also an ongoing investigation into the condition of patients awaiting treatment at Fort Stewart, Ga., where hundreds of sick and wounded soldiers say they are languishing in dirty barracks waiting months for needed medical treatment.\n \n Only recently did the Senate successfully demand the White House stop charging wounded soldiers $8.10 per day for their hospital meals.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n You must be shytting me!\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Congress also had to step in to increase danger pay and separation pay for soldiers, as it appeared the Bush administration was set to let them expire on Sept. 30.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Well, it only appeared that way.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n When Congress formally approved funding for military operations and reconstruction in Iraq, it carved Bush's request for $87 billion by about $2 billion.\n \n Much of that money will instead be spent - over White House objections - on improved health-care benefits for those in the military reserve and National Guard who are serving in Iraq.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n But, they volunteered! They knew what they were getting into.\n -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n I don't think this article is motivated by politics. Do you?",
