   "New Hampshire Senate passes gay-marriage bill\n \n \nCONCORD, New Hampshire (Reuters) - New Hampshire's Senate passed a bill on Wednesday that would legalize same-sex marriage after an amendment was added that allows clergy to decline to marry gay couples.\n \n The bill, which passed in a 13-11 vote, needs to be signed by Governor John Lynch to make New Hampshire the fifth U.S. state where gay marriage is legal. The Democrat has not indicated whether he will sign or veto the bill, but has expressed opposition to the measure.\n \n The bill passed the state's House of Representatives on March 26 but looked set for near certain defeat in the Senate before the amendment, which appeared to mollify some critics in the Democratic-controlled chamber.\n \n The last-minute changes to the legislation would allow clergy to decline to marry homosexual couples and give couples the freedom to either keep the words \"bride\" and \"groom\" on marriage licenses, or use the word \"spouse\" instead.\n \n Because the Senate and House passed separate versions, they must resolve their differences before the bill can go to the governor, who in 2007 signed a law recognizing same-sex civil unions, making New Hampshire the fourth state to do so.\n \n Lynch has said the word marriage should be reserved for a traditional heterosexual relationship.\n \n The bill, which would take effect on January 1, also recognizes out-of-state gay marriages and civil unions. Couples who now have civil unions would automatically become married by January 1, 2011. The extra year allows time for a formal ceremony.\n \n Gay marriage made big inroads this month when, in a single week, Iowa and Vermont joined Massachusetts and Connecticut in allowing gay couples to legally wed. On Tuesday, a joint judiciary committee in neighboring Maine's legislature approved a bill to allow same-sex marriage. Maine's House and Senate could vote on the measure as early as next week.\n \n In California, gay marriage advocates are hoping to overturn Proposition 8, the 2008 constitutional amendment that banned gay marriage there, in the state's highest court.\n \n CULTURAL SHIFT\n \n New Hampshire in 1987 outlawed same-sex marriages. In 2004, after Massachusetts' top court allowed gay couples to marry, New Hampshire passed a law that would not recognize gay marriages from out of state.\n \n But elections in 2006 signaled big political and cultural changes, giving Democrats majorities in both chambers of the legislature for the first time since 1874 in a state that was long a stronghold of moderate Republicans.\n \n New Hampshire state Senator Lou D'Allesandro was the only Democrat to side with 10 Republicans against the legislation, which would redefine marriage to include same-sex couples. He cited his \"traditional family values.\"\n \n Democratic state Senator Deborah Reynolds, who opposed the bill at committee level, changed her vote after the amendment.\n \n \"This is a compromise that is respectful to both sides of this debate and meets our shared goal of equality under state law for all the people of New Hampshire,\" Reynolds said.\n \n Senate Republicans said discrimination remains in the bill, which Democrats said would ensure gay couples no longer received a \"separate but equal\" civil union distinction.\n \n \"Marriage for centuries has the traditional meaning of one man and one woman, and we believe that term should not be co-opted to be used for other purposes,\" said Republican Peter Bragdon, the Senate minority leader.\n",

   "There is a precidence for variation between states as to who can marry. Along with same sex differences there are other variables that have been different state to state for a long time. For instance, in some states 1st cousins can marry, in others they cannot, in others one person has to be incapable of having children. I'm not sure if 1st cousin marriages are \"recognized\" by all states. Some states recognize common law marriage while others do not, I believe the federal gov't does not (not positive about that). So implying that there is commonality between states or between states and the federal gov't regarding hetro marriage is a mistake.

   "Dems: Opportunity As Gay Marriage Acceptance Grows \nWASHINGTON - Gay marriage legalization in several states and the public's growing acceptance of same-sex unions have Democrats sensing political opportunity and some Republicans re-evaluating their party's hard-line opposition to an issue that long has rallied its base.\n \n In recent weeks, Vermont and Iowa have legalized same-sex marriage, while New York, Maine and New Hampshire have taken steps in that direction. Polls show younger Americans are far are more tolerant on the issue than are older generations. For now at least, the public is much more focused on the troubled economy and two wars than on social issues.\n \n In addition, over the past decade, public acceptance of gay marriage has changed dramatically.\n \n A Quinnipiac University poll released last week found that a majority of people questioned, by a 55-38 percent margin, oppose gay marriage. But it also found that people, by a 57-38 percent margin, support civil unions that would provide marriage-like rights for same-sex couples, indicating a shift toward more acceptance.\n \n With congressional elections next year, Republicans, Democrats and nonpartisan analysts say the changes benefit Democrats, whose bedrock liberals favor gay unions, and disadvantage Republicans, whose conservative base insists that marriage be solely between a man and a woman.\n \n \"This is not a sea change. This is a tide that is slowly rising in favor of gay marriage,\" creating a favorable political situation for Democrats and ever-more difficulty for Republicans, said David McCuan, a political scientist at Sonoma State University in California.\n \n Democrats have a broader base filled with more accepting younger voters, as well as flexibility on the issue. Hard-core liberals support gay marriage, while others, including President Barack Obama, take a more moderate position of civil unions and defer to states on gay marriage.\n \n Conversely, the GOP base is older, smaller and more conservative. Republicans have no place to shift on the issue but to the left, because the party has been identified largely with its rock-solid opposition to gay marriage and civil unions. Also, the GOP has no titular head setting the tone on this or other issues.\n \n In recent months, proponents have used state legislatures and court challenges to legalize gay marriage, mindful that the majority of the public still isn't supportive and successful ballot measures would be less likely.\n \n Because of high court rulings, gay marriage now is legal in Iowa, Massachusetts and Connecticut. A Vermont law allowing gay marriage will take effect in September. New Hampshire and New Jersey, where same-sex couples can enter into civil unions, are considering gay marriage legislation. So are Maine and New York.\n \n Political insiders no doubt will pay close attention to developments in Iowa and New Hampshire, early presidential voting states, to see how the issue plays out in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election.\n \n Despite the changes, gay-marriage opponents are buoyed by a voter initiative in California that blocked the state from allowing gay marriage, and by the 29 states where voters have approved state constitutional amendments banning gay marriage.\n \n For years, the GOP and its conservative base has used its opposition to gay marriage to drive Republican turnout in elections and marginalize party moderates. Measures defining marriage between a man and a woman that were on ballots in a slew of states in 2004 were widely credited with boosting the number of conservative voters, giving Republican George W. Bush an edge over Democrat John Kerry.\n \n But there's been conflicting evidence since then over just how much that contributed to Bush's victory.\n \n What's certain is that opposition to gay marriage for decades has been a potent tool for the GOP in rallying social conservatives. They are critical to the party's grass-roots organizing and small-dollar fundraising.\n \n But as more states accept gay and lesbian unions, there is a debate inside the party over how it should position itself on the issue. The dispute is just one part of a broader struggle within the out-of-power GOP over its identity and whether it should focus on rallying conservatives or attracting supporters from across the political spectrum.\n \n Some prominent Republicans are backing away from cut-and-dried opposition, and some party operatives say it's only a matter of time before others follow suit because the country is changing.\n \n Republican Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah, a Mormon who is a potential presidential candidate, backed a 2004 constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman. But he says he favors civil unions and extending some legal rights to gay couples.\n \n Last month, John McCain's chief campaign strategist, Steve Schmidt, told the Log Cabin Republicans: \"Even though a majority of Republicans remain opposed to it, we must respect dissent on the subject within the party and encourage debate over it, and should not reject out of hand and on specious grounds ... that the party might be in the wrong on the question.\"\n \n The shifting landscape is emboldening the gay-rights' movement, a pillar of the Democratic Party's left flank.\n \n \"We are at a tipping point moment,\" said Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, a leading advocate of gay rights. \"The lingering minority that continues to think that the way to win is to hold GLBT (gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender) people up as a wedge could not be more out of touch.\"\n",

   "Legislature Backs Equality -- Courant.com\nThe bill codifying a state Supreme Court ruling opening the door to same-gender marriage in Connecticut was passed in late April, and Gov. M. Jodi Rell has signed it. We take note of the big margins in favor of the legislation - 100-44 in the state House and 28-7 in the Senate - and tip our hat to elected leaders who kept uppermost the idea of equality before the law.\n \n Approval of the measure was consistent with Connecticut's tradition of tolerance and freedom from discrimination.\n \n The bill was not passed until language exempting religious organizations from having to participate in gay weddings if they do not accept homosexuality was unnecessarily added to a text that already protected religious liberties. \n \n More important, however, is that lawmakers rightly rejected amendments that would have exempted individuals and businesses such as florists and justices of the peace from requirements of the bill. Adding a \"conscientious objector\" clause to exempt people not associated with religious organizations but who nevertheless believe homosexuality is wrong would have written the right to discriminate into state law.\n \n The legislation does Connecticut proud. This state is one of the first to resolve this sensitive and contentious issue. State Rep. Michael Lawlor observed that \"this is probably the last time these issues will ever be discussed in the state legislature.\" We hope so. Let's move on. \n",

That's got nothing to do with the application of the choice of law doctrine to marriages. You are using a red herring fallacy.\n\n \n It has everything to do with it. The subject is can a state choose to ignore the laws and contracts of another state.

   "OK.\n \n In Wilkins v. Zelichowski, a New Jersey court use public policy grounds to annul a marriage performed in Indiana involving a female under the age of 18.\n In Catalano v. Catalano, a Connecticut court invalidated a marriage between an uncle and his niece declaring that &#25579;a] state has the authority to declare what marriages of its citizens shall be recognized as valid, regardless of the fact that the marriages may have been entered into in foreign jurisdictions where they were valid.&#65533;\n In Mortenson v. Mortenson, an Arizona court applied the public policy exception to void a marriage performed in New Mexico between two first cousins. \n \n source\n \n Even had I not been able to provide case history and examples, this would not change that the courts of the United States care about law and the interpretation of the law. The choice of law doctrine does allow us to settle differences, but not in the way you mention. COLD settles the difference by allowing a state with a DOMA (or anti-gay marriage law) statute to refuse recognition of a gay marriage. Your claim: \"There are differences among the states on the requirements for marriage, but once married, all are recognized as legal marriage in other states\" is false.\n\n \n I stand corrected. Thank you. I did not know that.\n \n In reality, I would suspect that those situations in which the legality of a marriage was challenged was due to something else that brought it to light. Not sure how the state of Arizona ever got around to knowing the couple was first cousins, unless somebody was bothered by something else. I would guess it doesn't get enforced much. (Of course I could be wrong about that as well.)\n \n That doesn't change the fact that the ability to enforce those laws exists and I was misinformed until you enlightened me. Thanks.",

   "So then if I understand you. Michigan could make a law that says that it will not recognize out of state drivers licenses, close off the borders and make everyone entering the state get a Michigan drivers license. Texas would be within its rights to make a law that says that all corporations doing business within the state must reincorporate within the state of Texas.\n\n \n Nice try, but on the other hand there certainly are differences on many issues between states. For instance the 2nd amendment is not consistently supported across states. The only way to avoid this sort of thing would be to make all state laws identical or make federal law for all issues, in order to supersede any state law. More importantly--regarding marriage--differences exist between some states already, so it's not like this is something unusual. For instance, Nebraska discriminates against 16 year olds by not letting them marry. California (as well as many other states) does not. States' rights versus federal has always been a sticky issue, for much of American history. For the most part however, issues of marriage law has certainly been a state-level issue.",

   "Foundit,\n There is precidence for marriages not being recognized state to state, outside of same sex marriage. For example, if heterosexual 1st cousins get married in Alaska (legal) then change their residency to New Hampshire, they are not married per New Hampshire law. Below is part of a Q&A with a Yale law professor, Lea Brilmayer, that illistrates this.\n \n \nHarrisburg, Pa.: A marriage in one state is recognized in all states, if I understand the law correctly. Is this a requirement under Federal law or Federal court decisions? There is legislation in Pennsylvania that Pennsylvania would not recognize a gay marriage license from another state. Would such language be legal or would it violate some Federal law?\n Lea Brilmayer: Sort of. It has never been completely true that marriages in one state were automatically recognized in others. For centuries we have had problems about whether first cousins can marry; how old people have to be to get married; whether polygamy is legal, etc. And these differences in state laws have always raised the question -- what if two people from State X go to State Y to get married, and then go home. Does their home-state have to recognize their \"marriage\" elsewhere? \n The answer has not always been \"yes\" and in particular the Constitution does not require an affirmative answer. \n You ask about the source of law. It is a blend of Article IV of the Constitution; federal statute (a 200-year old version of the current rules); and most importantly state legislation and state court practice. \n Of course, the US Constitution has the highest priority, in cases where it actually provides an answer. Federal law comes next, with state judicial decisions filling in the rest. \n The Pennsylvania law you mention is authorized by federal statute, but the constitutional questions about it have not yet been answered. \n \n\n \n On a federal level, before DOMA, I belive that a marriage was only recognized (for tax purposes and such) if it was legal in the state of residence. I may be wrong on this one, haven't had time to verify.\n \n The point being there is clear presidence for one state to not recognize a marriage contract from another state. The FFC does not require that a contract/ license administered by one state be recognized in another, examples of this abound.",

These were not issues of \"unconstitutionality\" at all, which IS WHAT WE WERE DISCUSSING.\n AFTER the legislation was created the constitution became applicable, because the ESTABLISHED right was made under the purview of the 14th amendment.\n \n \n \n[sarcasm]Are you serious? You don't know this? How could you not know something so OBVIOUS? [/sarcasm]\n\n Jyoshu, your dramatics and attempts to move the goal-posts were nothing more than an pointless side-track of the issue.\n If an action is unconstitutional, it IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.\n RIGHT THERE is the justification to FIX the issue.\n \n You don't need to pass NEW laws or NEW amendments to CHANGE an \"unconstitutional\" act to a \"constitutional\" friendly situation.\n \n \n \nYou see, judicial action is only ONE strategy toward dealing with inequality. Historically it has not been the only one.\n\n Yep! There goes the uprooting of the goal-posts and this time he does not even TRY to repeat \"constitutional\", but simply replaces it with \"inequality\".\n \n I have no doubt that \"inequality\" has been fixed by legislation.\n That wasn't the item of contention.\n \n \n \nNo, I'm saying I agree it SHOULD if the letter of the constitution is followed to the tee. But then the same also applies with 16 year-olds getting married, or if such a case somehow came along with siblings getting married, and so forth. Some, like yourself, would no doubt prefer the letter of the law over the spirit of the law if it's advantageous to your politics. :)\n\n Jyoshu, are you just not paying attention at all?\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Pedophilia is NOT \"advantageous to my politics\". I am firmly against it.\n But I ANSWERED your little \"2-year old marriage\" problem by saying I would STICK TO THE CONSTITUTION and I said that I would want the other 49 states (which had marriage) to stick to the FF&C clause.\n \n Quit with these snide insinuations and face facts.\n This isn't about \"advantageous to my politics\".\n \n Furthermore, regarding your previous example, I would think a federal action could be enjoined as the rights of the child could be said to be violated in such a situation. A 2-year old cannot intelligently consent to marriage. A legal argument, based on the constitution, could no doubt be waged to stop any such state from achieving legal insanity, if they had already reached the stage of population insanity.\n \n You tried a poisoning of the well example, and now when I stick to the principle of the constitution, you refuse to do the intellectually honest thing and ACKNOWLEDGING that???\n Yeah.

   "Sadly Matt, these people don't consider gay rights civil rights although the NAACP clearly states otherwise... Odd how they think different. I wonder why...\n\n \n Your comparison of homosexual equality to Black civil rights offends many in the black community, but that doesn't stop you from making the fallacious claim, does it. Read it and weep for being accurately defined for what your militant group truly represents. emoticon_xgood\n True Intentions of Gay Activists Now Revealed\n \n By Gwen Richardson\n \n For several years, I have observed the growing influence of gay activists, unsure of their true intentions. Their tactics initially piqued my interest about 15 years ago, when they began comparing their historical plight with that of African Americans. This comparison was absurd on its face and I wondered how they could have the temerity to make such a claim.\n \n After all, African Americans are the descendants of millions of Black Africans who were brought to these shores in chains, dehumanized and sold as chattel for 250 years with no rights whatsoever, then subjected to another hundred years of, at best, second class citizenship. Homosexuals have suffered no intergenerational discrimination, have never been denied the right to vote or own property, and can disguise their sexual preference for a lifetime, if necessary. Comparing the history of gays to that of African Americans is like comparing the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre to the Holocaust.\n \n Yet, the claims of gay lobbyists that their rights are somehow linked to the freedom struggle of African Americans have slowly taken root in many sectors. They have even adopted some of the language of the Movement, referring to their cause as a struggle for \"civil rights,\" and charging that those who oppose their crusade are either motivated by hate or are simply bigots.\n \n But, after years of close observation, I have now uncovered the true intentions of gay activists: To silence, demote or excommunicate any individual who dares to disagree with the unbridled promotion of homosexuality and gay marriage.\n \n The reason I use the term \"uncovered\" is that it is often difficult to determine gay activists' true intentions since, from the beginning, most have been less than honest about their goals or the facts. In addition to their co-opting the Civil Rights Movement as an extension of the gay cause, let us examine some of the other falsehoods they have advanced over the past decade.\n \n Ten years ago, gay activists claimed they had no interest in pursuing gay marriage. They asserted that all they wanted was equal protection under the law, hospital visitation rights and the right to transfer property in the event of a death -- all of which I support. It is now obvious that their goal all along was the advancement of gay marriage. How else can one explain the methodical way in which they have worked to change marriage laws in small, liberal states initially, and later in as many other states as possible.\n \n Gay activists also falsely claim that all homosexuals are born that way, with a so-called \"gay gene.\" Not only has there been no conclusive scientific evidence to support such a claim, but a number of openly gay writers have, in their memoirs, suggested that childhood sexual molestation might be the root cause of their resultant homosexuality.\n \n Roy Simmons, a former NFL player, wrote in his autobiography, Out of Bounds: Coming Out of Sexual Abuse, Addiction and My Life of Lies in the NFL Closet, that he was raped at age 10. New York Times bestselling author E. Lynn Harris was molested as an adolescent, as was Donnie McClurkin, an award-winning gospel artist. McClurkin has since renounced his homosexual lifestyle, has a wife and is a committed family man and minister.\n \n While letting these and other young men's sexual predators off the hook, gay activists refuse to even acknowledge that such victims exist because their existence is proof that the so-called \"gay gene\" theory is flawed. Child psychologists agree that children who are sexually molested, whether at the hands of someone of the same sex or the opposite sex, are almost certain to have sexual identity problems as adults.\n \n Then there is the element of experimentation with homosexuality. Actress Anne Heche, another victim of childhood molestation, dated men early in her adult life. In 1997, Heche publicly announced she was gay and that she was intimately involved with comedian Ellen DeGeneres. Three years later, she went back to dating men and, shortly thereafter, married Coley Laffoon, whom she divorced in 2007. Heche still dates men and recently gave birth to a baby boy fathered by actor James Tupper.\n \n Sexual experimentation among adolescents is commonplace and, even if it does occur with members of the same sex, it is more a function of childhood curiosity than sexual orientation. If teenagers are told that sexual experimentation with someone of the same gender is the equivalent of some sort of \"orientation,\" they may accept that verdict even though most would naturally adapt to a heterosexual existence once they matured.\n \n Another falsehood told by gay lobbyists is that the Bible does not address the issue of homosexuality. This cleverly-crafted claim often succeeds because gay activists realize that few people actually read the Bible in depth, even those who are regular churchgoers. It is true that the word \"homosexual\" does not appear in the Bible for obvious reasons (the word was not in use at the time that the Bible was written). However, both the Old and New Testaments discuss sexual acts between those of the same gender and, in every instance, these acts are described in negative terms; in other words, these are acts in which believers are admonished not to engage.\n \n One reason why gay lobbyists have been so successful in their quest to silence the public is that their amen corner, the mainstream media, has completely abdicated its role as an independent observer and has now become an ardent cheerleader for their cause. Watch any so-called debate on the topic of gay marriage on programs like MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews, CNN's Larry King Live or Anderson Cooper 360 and it is obvious there is a tag team with the host and the gay marriage advocate on one side, and the supporter of traditional marriage on the other. Many reporters and commentators automatically label anyone who is opposed to gay marriage as \"homophobic.\" Frank Rich of the New York Times wrote a recent column in which he described those against gay marriage as \"spreading the poisons of bigotry and fear.\"\n \n In fact, anyone who gets in gay advocates' way is subject to public ridicule, demotion or ostracism, and there have been a number of recent victims. Miss California, Carrie Prejean, was reportedly denied the Miss U.S.A. crown in this year's pageant because she honestly answered a direct question about gay marriage, indicating that she believed marriage should be between a man and a woman. Perez Hilton, one of the pageant's judges who is himself gay, called Prejean a \"dumb bitch\" for her support of traditional marriage, as if the nationwide legalization of gay marriage is a foregone conclusion. In fact, a recent CNN poll showed that 55 percent of Americans oppose gay marriage, so Prejean's stance is clearly within the mainstream of public opinion.\n \n Earlier this month, former NFL Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy withdrew his name from consideration for President Obama's advisory council on faith-based groups following pressure from gay activists. Dungy, it seems, had the audacity to endorse a ban on same-sex marriage in Indiana. And Pastor Rick Warren, who delivered the invocation at Obama's inauguration, has been hounded by gay groups ever since to the point that he now appears to be confused about his own stance regarding gay marriage.\n \n Our hypersexual culture has already led to an increase in teen and pre-teen sexual activity, sexually transmitted diseases, child pornography, child abandonment, pedophilia and the posting of nude images of themselves on the Internet by adolescents. The jury is still out on the long-term effects of popular culture's promotion of homosexuality on children and teens. I suspect that, unfortunately, the end result will be an increase in homosexual behavior. As with advertising, an individual who is repeatedly exposed to visual images is more likely to adopt the behavior he/she sees.\n \n Perez Hilton may have telegraphed gay lobbyists' next move when, during an April 21st interview on CNN's Larry King Live, he said that gay groups don't want to force churches to endorse or perform gay marriages. As I have learned over the years, one has to take gay lobbyists' pronouncements regarding actions they are not pursuing with a grain of salt. Translation: This is our next target.\n \n Be on the lookout in the near future for gay activists' challenges to churches' tax exempt status for refusing to denounce their religious beliefs. Any religious leaders who are tapped for high-profile government positions will be subjected to a gay rights litmus test. Remember that the true goal is not equal rights; the ultimate objective is to bully, intimidate, subdue and control all opposition.\n BlackNews.com - True Intentions of Gay Activists Now Revealed",

This comparison was absurd on its face and I wondered how they could have the temerity to make such a claim.\n\n emoticon_frazzled\n One thing that people ignore in this whole situation is that nobody is comparing the SUFFERING of blacks to the SUFFERING of gays.\n Gays were not enslaved. I whole-heartedly acknowledge that.\n \n But the thing some people fail to grasp is that the REASONS the black civil rights movement had validity had NOTHING TO DO with the fact that they were slaves.\n Denying voting rights IS WRONG.\n Discriminating against blacks IS WRONG.\n Those things are wrong REGARDLESS of whether or not they were enslaved.\n \n Furthermore, how many people who were IN the civil rights movement of the 1960's that were ACTUALLY slaves?\n Do people get civil rights cause their fathers or their father's father were wronged???\n No.\n \n The comparison is the CURRENT discrimination, and typically the LACK of logic that goes into that discrimination.\n THAT is what is being compared.\n \n \n \nAfter all, African Americans are the descendants of millions of Black Africans who were brought to these shores in chains, dehumanized and sold as chattel for 250 years with no rights whatsoever, then subjected to another hundred years of, at best, second class citizenship.

It is now obvious that their goal all along was the advancement of gay marriage. How else can one explain the methodical way in which they have worked to change marriage laws in small, liberal states initially, and later in as many other states as possible.\n\n Oh. This is hilarious.\n She talks about \"equal protection\", but then completely FAILS TO COMPREHEND the means by which straight couples ACHIEVE those benefits in the first place... emoticon_emb\n \n It's like saying \"I knew John wanted to travel from New York to London, but I had no idea he would want to take either a plane or a boat.\" \n \n \n \nGay activists also falsely claim that all homosexuals are born that way, with a so-called \"gay gene.\" Not only has there been no conclusive scientific evidence to support such a claim, but a number of openly gay writers have, in their memoirs, suggested that childhood sexual molestation might be the root cause of their resultant homosexuality.\n\n 1) There HAS BEEN A VARIETY of research articles demonstrating CLEAR evidence for the gay gene.\n To put this another way, there is MORE evidence for the gay gene than there is for Christianity. So for \"some people\" to insist on \"conclusive scientific evidence\" while THEY THEMSELVES make claims that they can't substantiate is an amazing demonstration of hypocrisy!\n \n 2) I call b.s. on the \"openly gay writers\" claim.\n I would LOVE for anybody to explain who those \"writers\" supposedly were.\n This author is showing herself to be clueless (gays didn't want gay marriage 10 years ago emoticon_ic ), and I think this is just another sign of that...\n \n \n \nRoy Simmons, a former NFL player, wrote in his autobiography, Out of Bounds: Coming Out of Sexual Abuse, Addiction and My Life of Lies in the NFL Closet, that he was raped at age 10. New York Times bestselling author E. Lynn Harris was molested as an adolescent, as was Donnie McClurkin, an award-winning gospel artist. McClurkin has since renounced his homosexual lifestyle, has a wife and is a committed family man and minister.\n\n :xbanghead\n :xbanghead\n What was just described was the fact that some people, including some homosexuals, ARE MOLESTED at a young age.\n There is no mention of a \"causal\" link here...\n Just cause a gay person was molested doesn't mean he grew up gay BECAUSE he was molested...\n \n \n \nWhile letting these and other young men's sexual predators off the hook, gay activists refuse to even acknowledge that such victims exist because their existence is proof that the so-called \"gay gene\" theory is flawed.\n\n Say WHAAA?????\n This woman is getting downright offensive!\n I have no problem admitting that sexual predators exist.\n I do NOT let any such pedophile off the hook.\n \n \n \nChild psychologists agree that children who are sexually molested, whether at the hands of someone of the same sex or the opposite sex, are almost certain to have sexual identity problems as adults.\n\n The author is being either purposely dishonest here with false insinuations, or just plain clueless.\n There is absolutely NO EVIDENCE to suggest that molestation causes people to be gay, which is what the author is insinuating.\n \n \n \nThen there is the element of experimentation with homosexuality.\n\n It is also true that \"then there is the element of experimentation with HETEROSEXUALITY\".\n Just cause SOME people experiment doesn't mean anything about people who are GENUINELY gay.\n Furthermore, the sexual orientation of women is often observed as more fluid. Women are more comfortable with the idea of gay / straight relationship transitions than men are.\n \n \n \nSexual experimentation among adolescents is commonplace and, even if it does occur with members of the same sex, it is more a function of childhood curiosity than sexual orientation. If teenagers are told that sexual experimentation with someone of the same gender is the equivalent of some sort of \"orientation,\" they may accept that verdict even though most would naturally adapt to a heterosexual existence once they matured.\n\n I can't help but chuckle at the phrase \"IF teenagers are told...\"\n The author doesn't even try to insinuate that IS what happens.\n If a person has questions about their sexual orientation, they sure as heck should NOT try to decide that based SOLELY on their sexual history.\n \n Quite frankly, I don't think this author gets the fact that I look at that paragraph, in my mind I change \"gay\" to \"straight\" and vice versa, and I see something I want to tell OTHER kids out there.\n In my experience, it is MORE prevalent for kids to think they have to be straight, they \"experiment\" with being straight by sleeping with the other gender, hoping that will MAKE them that sexual orientation.\n \n \n \nAnother falsehood told by gay lobbyists is that the Bible does not address the issue of homosexuality.\n\n Meh...\n I personally think the Bible is a collection of pointless fairy tales, and that it would have stern words for the fact that a woman is trying to chastise a man.\n 1 Timothy 2\n \"Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.\"\n \n If this woman wants to follow the bible, ... emoticon_emb\n \n \n \nOne reason why gay lobbyists have been so successful in their quest to silence the public ...\n\n ROFLMAO!\n See, this is where it gets REALLY stupid.\n (and considering the gems in the earlier part of the article, that's saying something...)\n \n Gays have NOT had any real quest to \"silence\" the public.\n In fact, that has been an ASSUMED statement throughout this whole article, but it's been plain absurd.\n The National Organization of Marriage has just come out with its SECOND ad, this one featuring Prejean.\n Does that look like we have \"silenced\" anybody???\n \n Take Prop 8 as another example.\n There were dozens of anti-gay marriage ads.\n Were THOSE silenced???\n \n It gets REALLY OLD how you have some on the anti-gay right who try to insist that they are being \"silenced\", when the TRUTH of the matter is that people are simply responding by explaining THEIR RESPONSE OPINION.\n That is NOT being silenced.\n \n \n \nWatch any so-called debate on the topic of gay marriage on programs like MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews, CNN's Larry King Live or Anderson Cooper 360 and it is obvious there is a tag team with the host and the gay marriage advocate on one side, and the supporter of traditional marriage on the other.\n\n And if you go to watch a Fox News channel, you'll see a tag team with the host and the ANTI-gay marriage advocate.\n These guys are PUNDITS who should not be confused with \"news\".\n \n \n \nIn fact, anyone who gets in gay advocates' way is subject to public ridicule, demotion or ostracism, and there have been a number of recent victims.

   "I do not see how choice of law doctrine is not trumped by the full faith and credit clause in cases of marriage contract since there is a current tradition of one state respecting other states marriage licenses when it comes to heteros.\n\n \n I am jumping into this late, but the courts have allowed significant exceptions to the full faith and credit clause. It's a weak basis for arguing, legally, for trying to strike down the state DOMA laws. I think the 14th amendment equal protection clause is a better legal basis for trying to strike down the state DOMA laws. \n \n As for someone else's question of why the Supreme Court has not struck down the state DOMA laws yet, a case has to come before the Supreme Court before they can strike down a law. The Supreme Court cannot simply act on its own to strike down laws. \n \n I think we have made extraordinary progress recently in getting same-sex marriage legalized state by state, slowly. This won't by itself bring equality in all or even in most states. But as states here and there legalize same-sex marriage, or agree to recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere, it shows people that the sky will not fall when same-sex marriages become legal. The process helps to change minds, and this will only help us in the long run. The more minds we change, the more progress toward equality we will make.",

   "Your comparison of homosexual equality to Black civil rights offends many in the black community, but that doesn't stop you from making the fallacious claim, does it. Read it and weep for being accurately defined for what your militant group truly represents. emoticon_xgood\n True Intentions of Gay Activists Now Revealed\n \n By Gwen Richardson\n \n For several years, I have observed the growing influence of gay activists, unsure of their true intentions. Their tactics initially piqued my interest about 15 years ago, when they began comparing their historical plight with that of African Americans. This comparison was absurd on its face and I wondered how they could have the temerity to make such a claim.\n \n After all, African Americans are the descendants of millions of Black Africans who were brought to these shores in chains, dehumanized and sold as chattel for 250 years with no rights whatsoever, then subjected to another hundred years of, at best, second class citizenship. Homosexuals have suffered no intergenerational discrimination, have never been denied the right to vote or own property, and can disguise their sexual preference for a lifetime, if necessary. Comparing the history of gays to that of African Americans is like comparing the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre to the Holocaust.\n \n Yet, the claims of gay lobbyists that their rights are somehow linked to the freedom struggle of African Americans have slowly taken root in many sectors. They have even adopted some of the language of the Movement, referring to their cause as a struggle for \"civil rights,\" and charging that those who oppose their crusade are either motivated by hate or are simply bigots.\n \n But, after years of close observation, I have now uncovered the true intentions of gay activists: To silence, demote or excommunicate any individual who dares to disagree with the unbridled promotion of homosexuality and gay marriage.\n \n The reason I use the term \"uncovered\" is that it is often difficult to determine gay activists' true intentions since, from the beginning, most have been less than honest about their goals or the facts. In addition to their co-opting the Civil Rights Movement as an extension of the gay cause, let us examine some of the other falsehoods they have advanced over the past decade.\n \n Ten years ago, gay activists claimed they had no interest in pursuing gay marriage. They asserted that all they wanted was equal protection under the law, hospital visitation rights and the right to transfer property in the event of a death -- all of which I support. It is now obvious that their goal all along was the advancement of gay marriage. How else can one explain the methodical way in which they have worked to change marriage laws in small, liberal states initially, and later in as many other states as possible.\n \n Gay activists also falsely claim that all homosexuals are born that way, with a so-called \"gay gene.\" Not only has there been no conclusive scientific evidence to support such a claim, but a number of openly gay writers have, in their memoirs, suggested that childhood sexual molestation might be the root cause of their resultant homosexuality.\n \n Roy Simmons, a former NFL player, wrote in his autobiography, Out of Bounds: Coming Out of Sexual Abuse, Addiction and My Life of Lies in the NFL Closet, that he was raped at age 10. New York Times bestselling author E. Lynn Harris was molested as an adolescent, as was Donnie McClurkin, an award-winning gospel artist. McClurkin has since renounced his homosexual lifestyle, has a wife and is a committed family man and minister.\n \n While letting these and other young men's sexual predators off the hook, gay activists refuse to even acknowledge that such victims exist because their existence is proof that the so-called \"gay gene\" theory is flawed. Child psychologists agree that children who are sexually molested, whether at the hands of someone of the same sex or the opposite sex, are almost certain to have sexual identity problems as adults.\n \n Then there is the element of experimentation with homosexuality. Actress Anne Heche, another victim of childhood molestation, dated men early in her adult life. In 1997, Heche publicly announced she was gay and that she was intimately involved with comedian Ellen DeGeneres. Three years later, she went back to dating men and, shortly thereafter, married Coley Laffoon, whom she divorced in 2007. Heche still dates men and recently gave birth to a baby boy fathered by actor James Tupper.\n \n Sexual experimentation among adolescents is commonplace and, even if it does occur with members of the same sex, it is more a function of childhood curiosity than sexual orientation. If teenagers are told that sexual experimentation with someone of the same gender is the equivalent of some sort of \"orientation,\" they may accept that verdict even though most would naturally adapt to a heterosexual existence once they matured.\n \n Another falsehood told by gay lobbyists is that the Bible does not address the issue of homosexuality. This cleverly-crafted claim often succeeds because gay activists realize that few people actually read the Bible in depth, even those who are regular churchgoers. It is true that the word \"homosexual\" does not appear in the Bible for obvious reasons (the word was not in use at the time that the Bible was written). However, both the Old and New Testaments discuss sexual acts between those of the same gender and, in every instance, these acts are described in negative terms; in other words, these are acts in which believers are admonished not to engage.\n \n One reason why gay lobbyists have been so successful in their quest to silence the public is that their amen corner, the mainstream media, has completely abdicated its role as an independent observer and has now become an ardent cheerleader for their cause. Watch any so-called debate on the topic of gay marriage on programs like MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews, CNN's Larry King Live or Anderson Cooper 360 and it is obvious there is a tag team with the host and the gay marriage advocate on one side, and the supporter of traditional marriage on the other. Many reporters and commentators automatically label anyone who is opposed to gay marriage as \"homophobic.\" Frank Rich of the New York Times wrote a recent column in which he described those against gay marriage as \"spreading the poisons of bigotry and fear.\"\n \n In fact, anyone who gets in gay advocates' way is subject to public ridicule, demotion or ostracism, and there have been a number of recent victims. Miss California, Carrie Prejean, was reportedly denied the Miss U.S.A. crown in this year's pageant because she honestly answered a direct question about gay marriage, indicating that she believed marriage should be between a man and a woman. Perez Hilton, one of the pageant's judges who is himself gay, called Prejean a \"dumb bitch\" for her support of traditional marriage, as if the nationwide legalization of gay marriage is a foregone conclusion. In fact, a recent CNN poll showed that 55 percent of Americans oppose gay marriage, so Prejean's stance is clearly within the mainstream of public opinion.\n \n Earlier this month, former NFL Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy withdrew his name from consideration for President Obama's advisory council on faith-based groups following pressure from gay activists. Dungy, it seems, had the audacity to endorse a ban on same-sex marriage in Indiana. And Pastor Rick Warren, who delivered the invocation at Obama's inauguration, has been hounded by gay groups ever since to the point that he now appears to be confused about his own stance regarding gay marriage.\n \n Our hypersexual culture has already led to an increase in teen and pre-teen sexual activity, sexually transmitted diseases, child pornography, child abandonment, pedophilia and the posting of nude images of themselves on the Internet by adolescents. The jury is still out on the long-term effects of popular culture's promotion of homosexuality on children and teens. I suspect that, unfortunately, the end result will be an increase in homosexual behavior. As with advertising, an individual who is repeatedly exposed to visual images is more likely to adopt the behavior he/she sees.\n \n Perez Hilton may have telegraphed gay lobbyists' next move when, during an April 21st interview on CNN's Larry King Live, he said that gay groups don't want to force churches to endorse or perform gay marriages. As I have learned over the years, one has to take gay lobbyists' pronouncements regarding actions they are not pursuing with a grain of salt. Translation: This is our next target.\n \n Be on the lookout in the near future for gay activists' challenges to churches' tax exempt status for refusing to denounce their religious beliefs. Any religious leaders who are tapped for high-profile government positions will be subjected to a gay rights litmus test. Remember that the true goal is not equal rights; the ultimate objective is to bully, intimidate, subdue and control all opposition.\n BlackNews.com - True Intentions of Gay Activists Now Revealed\n\n \n This is an accurate representation of gay rights in the black community... Not this propagandist dogma... Cheers.\n \n NAACP Chair Julian Bond: Gay Rights are Civil Rights - Towleroad, More than gay news. More gay men\n \n \n The Human Rights Campaign posted National NAACP Chairman Julian Bond's speech from their fundraising dinner in Los Angeles over the weekend. It's quite powerful.\n \n Said Bond: \"When someone asks me, 'are gay rights civil rights?' my answer is always, 'Of course, they are.' Civil rights are positive legal prerogatives: the right to equal treatment before the law. These are the rights shared by everyone. There is no one in the United States who does not, or should not, enjoy or share in enjoying these rights. Gay and lesbian rights are not special rights in any way. It isn't 'special' to be free from discrimination. It is an ordinary, universal entitlement of citizenship.\"\n \n You may recall that the NAACP sent out a statement in February in support of the California legislature's challenge to Proposition 8.\n \n \n \n The speech is on that link... I urge all forum members to listen to it.",

You know the old saying,,,,,,,,,\"Hell hath no fury, like an angry queen with a firearm!\"\n\n \n Too bad the Watts riots had nothing to do with equality in reality but was more an expression of a mob mentality. Also, it snowballed based on the lie that cops had beaten a pregnant woman. Here's an excerpt from the link:\n \n The Watts riot began when white police officers stopped an intoxicated black driver in South Central Los Angeles. He resisted arrest and was forcibly subdued. A rumor quickly spread that the officers had beaten a pregnant black woman, and a growing mob started throwing rocks and bottles at the cops. The incident snowballed into a five-day conflagration, with blacks destroying a thousand businesses. Thirty-four people died, more than 1,000 were hospitalized and nearly 4,000 were arrested.\n \n This was the first episode in a series of \"long hot summers\" in the late '60s, when blacks went on to riot and loot in one city after another. The Detroit rendition two years later was especially horrific, with 43 deaths, more than 7,200 arrests, and about 2,500 stores trashed.\n \n The conventional wisdom at the time was that blacks were rebelling against the conditions they were forced to live in. I was born two months after Watts, but growing up, this was the justification I heard time and again. The Watts rioters lived in an America where about one in three black families lived below the poverty line while just a little more than one in 10 white families did. Twice as many black as white men were unemployed. Redlining policies barring blacks from white neighborhoods were in force until the Fair Housing Act of 1968 -- and under the table, even afterward.\n \n But even so, there were a few too many things about the Watts riot and the later ones that did not quite make sense if they were to be seen as the outcome of injustice.\n \n For one thing, these were the first urban race riots driven by blacks instead of whites. Before this, race riots in American cities involved white bigots storming into black neighborhoods and terrorizing residents, often because of rumors that a black man had \"assaulted\" a white woman, as was the case when whites torched the prosperous black quarter of Tulsa in 1921. For struggling blacks, burning down their own neighborhoods only became a part of the protest vocabulary in the mid-'60s -- just as the Great Society was getting into gear. Moreover, black rioters in Watts ruined black-owned businesses as lustily as white ones, even when stores had \"Soul Brother\" signs in the window. How was this a rebellion against racism?\n \n Another strange thing: The worst riots happened in places where conditions for blacks were best. If one had to predict in August 1965 where black-led riots might be most likely, the obvious choice would have been the deep South. And yet, very few of the riots in the late '60s took place in the most bigoted region in America: There was no memorable race riot in Atlanta or Birmingham. As for Watts, just the year before the riots, the National Urban League had rated Los Angeles the best city in the nation for blacks to live in. Several studies have shown no correlation between the destructiveness of the black-led riots in a given city and conditions for blacks there.\n \n Some suppose that the Civil Rights Act had dangled before blacks a promise of improvement that seemed to bear no fruit. But the Watts riot happened just one year after the Civil Rights Act came into effect. It is an insult to say that blacks would burn their own neighborhoods down in fury because America was not a brand-new place just months after passage of this legislation, as if change ever occurs that fast. And there had been smaller black-led riots in a few places such as Harlem and Rochester in July of 1964 -- just after the Civil Rights Act was signed.Burned, Baby, Burned\n \n Just like the Rodney King riots in the early 90s, there was nothing rational or justified about the riots in the 60s. This was mob rule plain and simple and only served to destroy their own neighborhoods when all was said and done.",

I have 2 albums currently in mine so there's plenty of space for them. And why do you make blanket statements which are racist in and of themselves by saying It bears a striking similarity to the dillusional mentality of white people where black rights were concerned. Have you not heard of the underground railroad which whites manned in order to transfer slaves during the height of legalized slavery? Are you unaware that slaves felt the burden of oppression lift from their shoulders once they escaped to the North during the slavery years? Have you forgotten that the majority of the PEOPLE in America supported the abolition of slavery? Which is why so many brave whites fought for the Union from both the North and the South? You should know that sides weren't chosen based on where men were from but based on their personal ideologies. \n \n And where do you get off saying that Miss Richardson is a bigot plain and simple. Does everyone who disagrees with the tactics and ideology of the homosexual community have to be a homophobe or a bigot? Can't they just have a different perspective from an historical point of view? Why don't you break down her article point by point and show where she is historically incorrect from the black perspective, rather than attempting to rewrite the history for the 60s riots with your own political bent?\n \n The fact is that there is no comparison between what gays are seeking to accomplish and what blacks suffered through for so long. Homosexuals aren't slaves, they aren't hunted and oppressed. They aren't denied the same civil or human rights which straights enjoy. They simply want to redefine morality for the rest of us and that is what we traditionalists are resisting. So prove your claims against her and what she says if you can. Otherwise, your doing nothing more than unfairly attacking the opinion of someone you don't agree with.",

   "First of all, no one is saying gay people have the same history as black slaves. That's a strawman. We're saying discrimination and exclusion are the same, whether you are black or gay. One needs to experience these things to truly understand.\n \n The child molestation causes homosexuality argument is a ridiculous, bald-faced lie. It's used to try to make homosexuality itself look bad, by associating it with something bad, without cause for the cause. It takes a bigot to employ such tactics in a piece of hateful propaganda, like the article posted by Archangel.\n \n The rest of the arguments are just reflections of someon'e insecurity. The inference is that one will become gay if it's socially accepted, and this would be a bad thing of course because it's linked to nasties like child molestation or inferior things like experimentation which is in opposition to everyone's alleged \"natural\" heterosexuality. Then of course, people fear having their personal beliefs or personal morals interfered with, if society accepts homosexuality. They too will have no choice but to become gay, or to perform homosexual actions, given the weak, insecure state of their heterosexual identity. At least, they fear it will affect them, when it shouldn't if they are straight and happy with being straight. Straight people don't have to live by \"homosexual rules\". No one will recruit them. However, they should have no issues with letting those of us who are gay live our lives.",

I am talking about Lynwood where I lived. I recall the same old conversations in grocery stores, hardware stores, the banks, etc. That was the hot topic. The brazen overtures of colored folks and how they were going to destroy Lynwood if they were allowed in. Along with criticism of the impending \"Fair Housing Act.\" It was a frightening concept to most of these people that there new neighbor might very well be black.\n \n \n \n Archangel:\n  Have you not heard of the underground railroad which whites manned in order to transfer slaves during the height of legalized slavery?\n \n \n \n Anthony321\n Yes I have and the fascinating twist to that story is that the railroad was neither underground, nor did it travel on railroad tracks. It was just a code name for a secret operation. Once again my reference to white people was the white people in Lynwood. And I can't tell you the exact number of white people in that city that were against black equality, but I can tell you I do not recall anyone ever speaking up to defend the movement. That made you a \"n..... lover\" and it was an ugly label to be identified with.\n \n \n \n Archangel:\n Are you unaware that slaves felt the burden of oppression lift from their shoulders once they escaped to the North during the slavery years?

I believe they are referred to as bigots, racists, or predjudice,,,,,,,,,,,,I don't know you pick whatever term you would like.\n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n The fact is that there is no comparison between what gays are seeking to accomplish and what blacks suffered through for so long. Homosexuals aren't slaves, they aren't hunted and oppressed. \n \n \n \n Anthony321:\n Nobody is comparing, some point out similarities between the two. Yes we know that homosexuals are not slaves and neither were any of the black people involved in the Civil Rights Movement. They aren't hunted or oppressed, but they are targeted and harrassed. Let's play more more word games to cloud the issue. \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n They aren't denied the same civil or human rights which straights enjoy. \n \n \n \n Anthony321\n Can you marriage? Can you say adoption? Not everywhere of course, just most places.\n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n They simply want to redefine morality for the rest of us and that is what we traditionalists are resisting.\n \n \n \n Anthony321:\n What a crock! How giving homosexuals the same rights to marriage and whatever else they are asking for equates a redefining of morality for everyone else is beyond me. The real matter at hand is you and other traditionalists will no longer be able to force YOUR definition of morality on those who don't find it very moral at all.\n \n \n \n Archangel:\n So prove your claims against her and what she says if you can. Otherwise, your doing nothing more than unfairly attacking the opinion of someone you don't agree with.\n\n \n \n \n \n Anthony321:\n I repeat, how are all those who fought against black equality labled in the present day? Predjudiced, bigotted,,,,whatever. She can have any opinion that she wants to have. But her opinion is based on her dislike and/or dissapproval of homosexuals. That's what constitutes biggotry. The opinions of racists were based on an overall dislike of black people. That's what constitutes racism.",
