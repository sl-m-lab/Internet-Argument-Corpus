   "This is my Case for Debate and I would like to see how people outside of my school would refute or support this case... Please read at the bottom of the topic after the case....\n \n \n\n A Government out of Line \n A Prison for the Innocent\n \n Introduction: Resolved: that the United States Federal Government should substantially decrease its authority either to detain without charge or to search without probable cause. This is the topic to which the whole of today's debates are based on. The only thing I ask is that the judge listen with just and reasoned ears. Your decision today, in whatever small way, will affect our future. \n \n Observation #1: On October 26th 2001 The Patriot act was signed and approved giving the government full power to search and seize any information on you, in effect reliving the entire United states people of every shred of privacy and dignity.\n \n The patriot act has now enabled the government to tap any electronic device in your home, to search and acquire any physical evidence in or around your home, and even to search your library records.\n \n Observation #2: \" For the land of the free and the home of the brave\" a famous quote by Scott Keys during the war of 1812, also America's biggest fib.\n \n Observation #3: \"A total of 520 prisoners are detained at the US base on Cuba under differing levels of security, the base's location is outside US territorial waters so it means that all prisoners do not come under the jurisdiction of US federal law which has added to the legal uncertainty of the detainees.\" www.turks.us July 27 2005.\n \n Observation #4: \"In late 2003, the Pentagon quietly decided that 15 Chinese Muslims detained at the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, could be released. Five were people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time... The other 10 were deemed low-risk detainees whose enemy was China's communist government -- not the United States... More than 20 months later, the 15 still languish at Guantanamo Bay, imprisoned and sometimes shackled, with most of their families unaware whether they are even alive... They are men without a country. The Bush administration has chosen not to send them home for fear China will imprison, persecute or torture them, as the United States charges has happened to other members of China's Muslim minority.\" www.uruknet.info Post Staff Writer\n Wednesday, August 24, 2005\n \n Observation #5: \"The US is negotiating with Muslim countries to take custody of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay in an attempt to reduce the inmate population at the controversial detention facility in Cuba. \n \n The administration is close to reaching agreements with 10 Muslim countries to repatriate detainees, the Washington Post reported yesterday. The US has already reached a similar agreement with Afghanistan, and is also talking to authorities in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, whose nationals account for a significant share of the 510 detainees\" The NewStandard, NY august 2005\n \n Plan:\n \n There for by processing the information listed above the following plan has been devised to insure the rights of residents of Guantanamo bay and essentially the entire American body.\n \n Contention #1: The Patriot Act: That the United States Government will substantially revise The Patriot Act, and in turn send all revisions into a nation wide vote.\n \n Contention #2: Guantanamo Bay: That all uncharged prisoners of Camp Delta in Guantanamo bay be given a proper trial, by a jury of twelve, by the time of 2006 new year.\n \n Contention #3: Guantanamo Families: Any and all uncharged prisoners will be given the right to contact family at will while in Guantanamo bay.\n \n Contention #4: Men with out a country: That all men and their family released and deemed unfit to return to their home country be given full citizenship into the United States.\n \n Contention #5: Funding: Sufficient funds for this plan will be raised by a 1 cent sales tax per cigarette bought in the United States averaging $105 million per week all excess funds will be used to lower oil and gasoline prices in the United States\n \n Contention #6: Terms: The Affirmative reserves the right to define all terms \n \n Conclusion:\n \n In conclusion our government is out of line. They have created a prison for the innocent and now have the audacity to deny it, in hopes that we, the people, might over look the facts and detour straight into the fiction to which the government has planted. In spite of the government's efforts, the affirmative would like to reiterate it's disapproval by saying, Some one has noticed, that some one is us, we have the facts and we will not be bribed or beleaguered. With these words spoken, may they stay fresh in mind to all who are gathered here to day, I now open myself to inquiries and points of clarification! \n \n \n Please post in this format...\n ---------------------------------\n Evidence Tag:\n Name:\n Cite:\n Date:\n Attacking: Topicality - Solvency - Significance\n Position on Case:\n \n -Name-\n \n -Cite - Type of Source-\n \n -Date of Evidence-\n \n -Evidence-\n --Solvency\n --Topicality\n --Significance\n \n -Personall additions-\n --Opinions--\n \n -Position on Topic-\n \n --Questions\n Ex.\n 1) Blah Blah Blah?\n \n ------------------------------\n \n Thank you for your help...

   "Prisoners of war have never been subject to the civil legal system of the capturing country. The guests of Club Gitmo (\"tropical relief from the stress of jihad\") are not exactly prisoners of war, but they do not fit the profile of ordinary criminals either. In fact, this is an entirely new kind of conflict for which the rules of the Geneva Convention were not intended. Our civil system usually requires prosecution in the jurisdiction where the crime was committed, so that won't work either.\n \n Personally, I wouldn't have much of a problem treating them as prisoners of war under Geneva and executing them out of hand for being out of uniform, but it seems like a terrible waste of potential information that might save lives.",

   "They are not civilian criminals, and they are not prisoners of war under the definitions of the Geneva Conventions - so who tries them, by what set of laws, and by what legal procedures and standards?\n\n \n Under the geneva convention they are either prisoners of war or civilian criminals. The uniform of insignia requirement under the Geneva convention does not apply (since they are not signatories nor do they meet the requirements of forced compliance). If we do not want to treat them as POWs, they must be treated as civilian cirminals and tried by the afghan government. EVERYBODY gets a trial under the Geneva conventions, except for POWs, who need no trial, becuase they are released after the war is over. \n \n \nI'm with the Captain on this one - no mercy at all for these vermin. They are subhuman, and do not deserve to be treated as humans. If it helps your conscience, you can think of their cases as overdue abortions.\n\n \n All I can say is that, to the best of my knowledge, the GITMO detainees are all better people than you, to a man. Since all evidence of their incarceration is secret, and we already know that dozens have been released (after serving lengthy terms), the public has no choice but to assume they are innocent and being unjustly imprisoned. That is the basic tenant of our legal system. Everybody has a right to a speedy and PUBLIC trial, and until the result of that trial is in, they are INNOCENT. As far as I know, these are all just nice gus being unjustly acused for racial reasons.\n \n You, on the other hand, are apparently some kind of totalitarin nutjob who needs to be exteminated ebfore they can breed and further pollute our nation.\n \n \n You guys need to think REAL HARD about what it says about you personally, and the absolute contempt you are showing for the very basis of our legal system when you advocate condeming men to imprisonment without a public trial. The entire purpose behind the public trial portion of our justice system is to ensure that the governement can NEVER lock people away indiscriminatly.\n \n First we lock these guys up in Gitmo, and the public does not have nearly the reaction I thought they would. I assumed (foolish, I know) that the outrage would drive a policy change. Instead, there was some dissent, by the American people, being the lazy, ignorant cowards that they are, instead kind of shrugged and went \"they are bad guys anyway\". What did that get us? It got us the terrorist detainment portions of the patriot act. Now, all that is needed to arrest ANYBODY in the US, YOU included, is a memo from the justice department identifying you as a potential terrorist or terrorist collaborator. \n \n Has it been misused? WE DON'T KNOW, beacuse it is a felony, punishible by 20 years in prison, to reveal teh names or locations of anybody arrested under those provisions. For all we know, there are thousands of Americans secretly in prison right now (I doubt it).\n \n HEY, you COWARDLY XXXXXX, you threw away YOUR RIGHT to a speedy, fair, and public trial becasue you were so afraid of the big bad terrorists. You people who support such things make me sick. If you want to live in a nice, safe, totalitarian nation, why don't you move to one? You don't belong here. you would all be very happy in Saudi Arabia, where they routinely execute suspected terrorist with no evidence at all. They put an end to the terror attack in their country VERY quickly. \n \n Wars have been fought, governments overthrown, and hundreds of thousands have willingly given their lives to fight lesser tyranny than a government that procures for itself the power to secretly imprison people, and you XXXXXX are applauding the measure.\n \n Captain, I am a little surprised at your stance on this one. Bassman has been shown to be a fascist many times over, complete with documetary evidence. Diogenes99 likely belongs in the same club. I thought better of you.\n \n If you are not willing to fight to safeguard the liberties of others, even when you find it contemptable, you cannot expect to have any liberties of your own.    \n \n \n Throughout history that has proven to be true. Keep that in mind before you advocate tossing people in prison without trials. You might also ask yourself, which do you fear more, the idea of those guys in gitmo running around free, or the idea of raising your kids without rights. I cannot think of a better example in recent history of trading liberty fro security. First we traded their liberty for a little security, then we couldn't say anything when they took ours.",

Literally all it takes is a top secret (thus not open for review) memo from the justice department and they could be sharing a cell with one of those guys. \n \n Consider the Justice departments (and homeland security) record of using the patriot act.

Reckless drivers? People who fail to spay or neuter their pets? We don't know, and we have lost control over it. Everything related is now stamped top secret.

The idea of natural rights is key to our constitution, government, and way of life. Take that away, and there is no America. Every person in this country (and according to the supreme court...not that there should ever have been any question...every person we are in custoday of) is born with natural rights. They have those rights until it can be PROVEN, in PUBLIC that there is compelling reason that those rights should be suspended or revoked.

What surprises me is the cowardice of your stance. these guys really have you so scared that you ar willing to completely write off the foundation of American civil liberties? Do you really think that having those guys denied trials really makes you safer? Either they go to trial and are found guilty, in which case they are sent strraight back to Gitmo, or they og to trial and the courts find that there is no cause to hold them, which means they are innocent men, and they go free. Either way, the dangerous ones go back to prison. The only possible explanation for the Bush administrations refusal to grant these guys a trial is that they know they are holding innocent men. If they were convinced that all these guys were guilty, and could be held under Us law, they would just put them through the court system.",

Non-Afghan terrorists, on the other hand, will remain in custody until the war on terror is over or we are sure they are no longer capable of supporting terrorism in the future.\n \n \nIn order to execute them as war criminals, don`t you need to proove their guilt in a military tribunal first?\nNo. Not if they are caught in the act of firing on soldiers while out of uniform. There was a widely circulated picture of a South Vietnamese general summarily executing a North Vietnamese officer dressed in civilian clothes, with the picture taken just as the guy's brains were exiting the far side of his head; the picture caused the same kind of protest you are raising, but the execution was clearly admissible under the Geneva Conventions. (The NV thug had just executed the families of six police officers, which is why the general was so PO'd.)\n \n \nAre you saing that afghanistan is still at war with the US?\nThe Taliban, surely the most ignorant troop of baboons ever to declare war on the rest of the world, has never surrendered and is still killing people.\n \n \nBorders are irrelevant for many dangerous elements. But wars are territorial. You dopn`t declare war on a concept. That`s extreamly dangerous.\nAfter 9/11, it became extremely necessary. We intend to exterminate terrorists, and make the point that terrorism is not an acceptable political tactic.\n \n \nSurely at most of the times these people were captured, the US was an occupying power and hence the provision governing occupied countries in the Geneva conventions could apply?\nNo. The Taliban were never a legitimate government (they were recognized only by Pakistan) and the remnants still fighting are no better than the terrorists.",

Non-Afghan terrorists, on the other hand, will remain in custody until the war on terror is over or we are sure they are no longer capable of supporting terrorism in the future.\n\n \n But you don't know. You have no idea where any of the prisoners ar or what has or will hapopen to them, nor do you have any control, our civil liberties in the toilet in exchange for some percieved safety. Way to go. Whethe they were afghanis or ot has no bering on the issue. They were there at the invitation of the Afghna government (the taliban). you can claim all you want that the taliban was not recognised and therefore not legitimate, . We were giving the taliban aid for years. \n \n \nNo. Not if they are caught in the act of firing on soldiers while out of uniform.

(The NV thug had just executed the families of six police officers, which is why the general was so PO'd.)\n\n \n You are talking about the execution of Nguyen Van Lam, by the police chief of South Vietnam, Lt. Colonel Nguyen Ngoc Loan. No, the execution was not clearly permissibile under the Geneva convention. It ws not even aguably permissible under the Geneva conventions. Why do you keep trying to tell us what is and is not permissible under the Geneva conventions since your ignorance when it comes to them has been clearly exposed and documented? go back, read the Geneva conventions, then maybe you can form an opinion as to what is and is not permissible. EVERBODY gets a trial under the geneva conventions. Summary executions are NEVER allowed.\n \n \nThe Taliban, surely the most ignorant troop of baboons ever to declare war on the rest of the world, has never surrendered and is still killing people.\n\n \n And still controls roughly 40% of the country. lets think abotu this one REAL HARD. Surrender and end up sitting in GTIMO with no chance of release, or keep fighting the invaders and controlling your country, albeit a smaller part of your country. A coward who is willing to trade their personal liberty, adn the liberty of their fellow countrymen, for nothing but the possibility of a little safety woudl probably surrender. \n \n \n \nNo. The Taliban were never a legitimate government (they were recognized only by Pakistan) and the remnants still fighting are no better than the terrorists\n\n \n Pakisatna and the US, who was providing aid to the taliban in exchange for reducing heroin exports, and the british, sauds, australians, Indians, French, and Germans who all had diplomatic relations with the Taliban. We should robably also include all of asia, russia, and most of Easter Europe.\n \n At the end of the day, it does no matter whta internationsl agencies recognise you as the legitimate government. You run the country, you are the government. In this case it did not matter. The taliban was widely accepted by other coutnries as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.",

Or, are you actually stupid enough to base moral and fiscal insolvency on political promises?\n\n \n These are the two things that confuse me the most, and you touch on them both. First, exactly what security are we supposed to be getting by refusing these guys trials? Eitehr the courts wil decide they are a threat or guilty of a crime, in shich case they will be returned to custoday, or the courts will decide theya re not, in which case they will be set free. What do we loosede by setting innocent men free? We are certainly loosing a lot by keeping them locked up. Besdies the rather obvious civil rights implications, we are painting a terrible PR picture. \n \n Second, why is it that the middle class and lower lcass seem the most gung ho to support the war on terror? Bad news, folks, the middle class is shrinking at a pretty alarming rate. In 15 years, assuming that present trends hold, 80 percent of you that consider yourselves \"middle class\" will be lower class. Your kids will be lower class, and the middle class, once the largest segment of our population, will become the smallest. More bad news, the odds of moving from the middle to the upper have never been worse. Why would you be concerned with the status quo being upset? Without it being upset, you are screwed. Any change is better than what you have now, which is almost certain failure. At least with change you have a CHANCE, as opposed to now where you basically have none. Why fight so hard to maintain a system that is not working in your favor?\n \n Admittdly the upper class is more than happy to see you trash your rights. I do not know anybody in the upper class who does not see imminent financial doom for the middle class coming (lets face it folks, they are upper class because they know more about such things than the middle class). These things are great for them. IF you get tired of dumpster diving for your kids food and try to do something proactive about it, we can label you a terrorist and ship you off to GITMO to spend the rest of your life. Your right to keep and bear arms has already been curtailed to the point that effective resistance is an exercise in futility, so why not (luckily people with money can still afford machine guns, up to and including cannons, so there is little to fear from the common trash).",
