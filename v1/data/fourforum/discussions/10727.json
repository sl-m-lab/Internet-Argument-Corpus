   "While [recently] surfing the Internet, I came across a news story where Mariano Rivera, relief pitcher for the New York Yankees, had just finalized a deal to extend his contract with the team for three more years for a whopping $45 million.\n \n In light of the recent allegations of rampant steroid use by nearly 100 players in and around Major League baseball, I find it quite disturbing.\n \n First of all, does Mariano Rivera think he's so good that he really deserves $45 million? I, along with a lot of other good hard-working people, will never see a small fraction of that in a lifetime of work, and they don't even work 12 straight months a year. \n \n Secondly, steroid use is a form of cheating, an unfair advantage [over] those athletes who've never taken steroids. Hank Aaron hit 755 home runs without the benefit of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs, and 755 home runs was a Major League record that stood until Barry Bonds recently broke it.\n \n I say that Barry Bonds probably would not have been able to break Hank Aaron's home run record if he wasn't taking steroids, but worse than that, he lied under oath in a court of law about taking steroids.\n \n I was really disappointed to find out that Mac Maguire was on the infamous list, because I really thought he was a class act.\n \n Are we going to continue to patronize and glorify these losers? Let them take steroids or kill dogs in illegal dogfights, or let some millionairess bimbo try to get out of serving a DUI jail sentence?\n \n To glorify and find it acceptable to take the easy road?

Pele was an astounding soccer player and for a while was the highest paid athlete in the world. (I watched him score from midfield during a '60s game here in Atlanta.)\n \n Champions get respect and high pay regardless of their off camera activities. Their attitudes seem to gravitate toward \"I'm untouchable\", \"I'm special\", \"I'm bigger than the rule book\" or some similar undeserved pass regarding personal behavior.\n \n We brought the high salaries on ourselves. Their activities follow bell shaped curves...exagerated by the huge piles of money at their feet.\n \n I haven't paid for a baseball ticket since the strike that killed the WS. If the owners would get together and drop their salary caps to where all the players made good salaries with no instant millionaires created every season, we'd have more and better athletes...and the price of tickets might become reasonable to those who can't afford hundreds to take the family to a ball game.\n \n The price of superbowl TV ads tells how much we value our sports...too much!",

   "Hello! I hope that won't be a mistake if I suppose that recent presidential elections in Georgia is perhaps the hottest piece of news so far as it was a highly questionable event of the recent with a certain involvement of US politicians! \n I have just got to know that US Ambassador to Georgia John Tefft had a meeting with leaders of Georgian opposition who are currently on protest against highly dubious results of the elections that took place in Georgia on January 5. During this meeting, John Tefft tried to convince Georgian oppositionists of futility of their outcries while at the same time he offered them prospects of high ranks in the new government and even Saakashvili administration in case they lift up their protest action. It is clear that John Tefft was simply trying to buy them over! What a gross interference of the US, isn't it? Of course, the election campaign in Georgia was by far not that transparent and fair as it was declared by John Tefft and Saakashvuili himself! According to them, some 70 to 90 per cent of Georgian population had voted in favor of Saakashvili! Bang! That's where they slipped up! It so happens that I'm well in the know of the Georgians and I know pretty well that this nation cannot be so unanimous! There too many Georgians who see saakashvili as a dictator. The recent inhuman dispersal of opposition rallies in Tbilisi only added meat to their anger. \n The conclusion is - the election results were by far framed-up and there is pretty much evidence to it! You just need to read a report by Mission of Observers of the ICES to see that the whole election in Georgia is a fraud! \n elections-ices.org/english/publications/publication:126]REPORT OF The Mission of Observers of the International Expert Centre for Electoral Systems in the Presidential Elections in Georgia, 6th January 2008",
