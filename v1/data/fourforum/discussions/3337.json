   "Their website:\n http://www.iconoclast-texas.com/\n \n Don't forget your paperweight:\n http://www.iconoclast-texas.com/ICONe-ADS/crawpaperweight.htm\n \n Their Kerry endorsement:\n http://www.iconoclast-texas.com/Columns/Editorial/editorial39.htm\n \n\n The publishers of The Iconoclast endorsed Bush four years ago, based on the things he promised, not on this smoke-screened agenda.\n Today, we are endorsing his opponent, John Kerry, based not only on the things that Bush has delivered, but also on the vision of a return to normality that Kerry says our country needs.\n Four items trouble us the most about the Bush administration: his initiatives to disable the Social Security system, the deteriorating state of the American economy, a dangerous shift away from the basic freedoms established by our founding fathers, and his continuous mistakes regarding terrorism and Iraq.\n\n \n \nThe Iconoclast, the President's hometown newspaper, took Bush on his word and editorialized in favor of the invasion. The newspaper's publisher promoted Bush and the invasion of Iraq to Londoners in a BBC interview during the time that the administration was wooing the support of Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n Again, he let us down.\n We presumed the President had solid proof of the existence of these weapons, what and where they were, even as the search continued. Otherwise, our troops would be in much greater danger and the premise for a hurried-up invasion would be moot, allowing more time to solicit assistance from our allies.\n Instead we were duped into following yet another privileged agenda.\n Now he argues unconvincingly that Iraq was providing safe harbor to terrorists, his new key justification for the invasion. It is like arguing that America provided safe harbor to terrorists leading to 9/11.\n\n \n \nWhen examined based on all the facts, Kerry's voting record is enviable and echoes that of many Bush allies who are aghast at how the Bush administration has destroyed the American economy. Compared to Bush on economic issues, Kerry would be an arch-conservative, providing for Americans first. He has what it takes to right our wronged economy.\n\n \n \nThe re-election of George W. Bush would be a mandate to continue on our present course of chaos. We cannot afford to double the debt that we already have. We need to be moving in the opposite direction.\n John Kerry has 30 years of experience looking out for the American people and can navigate our country back to prosperity and re-instill in America the dignity she so craves and deserves. He has served us well as a highly decorated Vietnam veteran and has had a successful career as a district attorney, lieutenant governor, and senator.\n Kerry has a positive vision for America, plus the proven intelligence, good sense, and guts to make it happen.\n That's why The Iconoclast urges Texans not to rate the candidate by his hometown or even his political party, but instead by where he intends to take the country.\n The Iconoclast wholeheartedly endorses John Kerry.\n",

But the campaign has not focused particular attention on the endorsement.\n \n With his sprawling ranch near Crawford, Bush is the area's most famous resident. Tourists flood the Central Texas city's tiny downtown on weekends to purchase Bush memorabilia and eat the Presidential cheeseburger basket at the Coffee Station, the restaurant that Bush occasionally visits while on vacation.\n \n Campbell, a Democrat who has been mayor since 1999, said he's met Bush once but doesn't feel inclined to support the former Texas governor. He voted for Al Gore in 2000.\n \n \"I would say the city has a mix of Bush and Kerry supporters,\" he said. \"The Kerry supporters feel like Bush has not delivered on his promises.\"\n \n Some Texas Republicans took the endorsement in stride.\n \n \"You will find a few Kerry supporters in Texas,\" said Victor Carrillo, chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission. \"But the majority of Texans support President Bush.\"\n \n Campbell says he's not worried about a backlash among his constituents.\n \n \"I have the right to vote for who I want to be president,\" he said. \"If some people around here don't like it, they can vote for someone else for mayor.\"\n",

There was a time, not that long ago, when \"conservative\" was mentally connected with old fashioned right and wrong mom and dad taught values.

(1968 & newer) 70's and 80's cars have a tough time here. 80% to 90% of the people have 90's and newer cars, and find it no problem. That's the way it's set up. It was experimented with in one or two carefully selected areas of the U.S. years ago, and those residents reactions were measured, and used to project reactions in other areas. Most people feel a slight sense of pride that their car passes, just enough to make them shrug off the fee. \n \n It's a problem with small businesses that have older service vehicles that they wouldn't otherwise need to replace (plumbers, contractors etc.) It's a problem with older, retired people who keep an older car because they don't need it that often. Teenagers with their first car, trying to support it on an afterschool job - they're probably the ones who it affects most. It may make the difference if they can even have a car. In my area, there are no public announcements being made about it's effectiveness - no sign of before and after measurements being taken to show cleaner air. Probably because it's making no difference, other than to send millions of Ky. dollars to the California company doing the testing. \n \n The bottom line is, it's an intrusive big government program, endorsed by Democrats far more than Republicans.

They've simply improved it as much as possible with current technology. You see, I have faith in American ingenuity and American business. Further improvements can and will be made.

Just South of Buffalo is a city named Lackawanna. You may have heard of it in the news when a couple of terrorists were captured there. In my childhood and until the 70's I remember the sky over Lackawanna being red with pollution from the steel mills. I remember as a child driving through Akron on the way to Florida vacations and smelling the rubber plants for 50 miles before and after. I remember when the Cuyahoga River was on fire. I remember when car emissions were visible and made me choke at red lights. And I remember when the biggest deal was the new cars that used unleaded gasoline because unleaded gasoline cost 2 cents more. Nothing will make me wish for a return to those bad old days.

Your \"why object\" question leads me to believe that you feel government regulation simply doesn't have much cost. In reality it has plenty. It's hard to measure some of the cost in dollars, and it's impossible to measure the cost in discouragement of free people to work and excell.

In addition, a vehicle's condition can change dramatically in between the annual inspection, so there's no guarantee it's safe in the interim. Lastly, I guess our famous \"legal system\" is always available as a deterrent for those that want to push the lawsuit envelope. I license 4 heavy trucks in Missouri and we are always under the scrutiny of Missouri DOT.",

   "I own an old pickup truck. It's 33 years old and looks like new. You can almost see the jealous little wimps at the testing station elbow each other and smile when they see me coming. (this one fails haha) It takes me HOURS of running here and there and signing papers to get a waiver on it. I think vehicles like that automatically fail. You undoubtedly think that all the testers do is operate the machines - the machines do the testing. Again, you trust the government far, far more than I do.\n\n \n Don't you get a paper print out of the results? My sister owns a 1970 something Buick whatever. Burnt orange. And it doesn't look like new. Not visually pleasing. Hers passes every time.",

   "Sorry to horn in on this discussion, but I wanted to comment here. When your actions have the possibility of affecting others, you are subject to the rules that are designed to protect the innocent \"masses\". \n\n \n The \"possibility of affecting\"? How remote should the possiblilty be, when we give up constitutional freedom? \n \n \n \n The problem with someone establishing a \"garbage dump\" on private property is the danger to surrounding individuals due to hazardous materials being carelessly dumped. If your friend dumped chemicals that leached through the soil and found their way into the community water table he would be placing his neighbors at risk. People don't want to live near landfills when their run professionally, they certainly don't want to when they're not. As a landowner, you're entitled to enjoy your investment, as long as your enjoyment doesn't infringe on others.\n\n \n In the link in my \"road salt\" thread in the environmental forum, did you notice how the experts said that salt only affects the soil within 15 feet of the pavement? My friends dump was many hundreds of feet from his borders. There are double standards. It's all political.",
