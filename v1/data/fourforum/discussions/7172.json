   "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10594017/\n \n\n \n Updated: 4:16 a.m. ET Dec. 24, 2005\n BLUE SPRINGS, Mo. - A lovers&#8217; dispute over a cell phone ended suddenly when the woman swallowed the phone whole, police said.\n Police said they received a call at 4:52 a.m. Friday from a Blue Springs man who said his girlfriend was having trouble breathing. When they arrived at the house they found the 24-year-old woman had a cell phone lodged in her throat.\n &#8220;He wanted the phone and she wouldn&#8217;t give it to him, so she attempted to swallow it,&#8221; Detective Sgt. Steve Decker of the Blue Springs Police Department. &#8220;She just put the entire phone in her mouth so he couldn&#8217;t get it.\"\n \n \n \n Police said an ambulance transported the woman to St. Mary&#8217;s Medical Center in Blue Springs. A hospital spokeswoman said she couldn&#8217;t give details about the woman&#8217;s health since police have not released her identity. \n\n I not pushing this on you from a male chauvinist pig stance, but can you imagine the wrath of this woman would slay the largest dragon if turned toward effective argument techniques.\n \n I'm wondering who he was wanting to call...or was he just trying to bring the phone bill within budget?emoticon_xangel",
