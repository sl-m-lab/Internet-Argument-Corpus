He's probably in some sort of a rapturous state and thinks that he was actually making sense.\n \nNo one is going to respond to you unless you're a little more clear about what the subject of your debate is.\n\n I was under the impression that several people did respond. It's not our fault that what he posted was babble. That sort of religious claptrap is actually quite common and offers a good laugh. Just because his message is unintellegable doesn't mean I can't respond. I've always been more than happy to respond to religious insanity with gobblygook.\n \nThese people here are ready to pounce on you like a snarling lion if you don't play by the rules!!!hehe.\n\n The rules? Do you mean rules like, \"make sense\" or \"make sure your Babble quotes are actually relevant\" or \"quit acting like a Pharisee and show some humility.\" Oh, wait! That last one isn't right. Self-righteousness is a tenet of modern, fundamentalist christianity. Besides, it provides some comic relief.",
