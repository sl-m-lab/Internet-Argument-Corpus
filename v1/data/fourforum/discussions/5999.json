   "Went to see Willie last night. It's the first time I've seen him live.\n \n I've got mixed feelings.\n \n It was an amazing feeling to actually see him live, he's been one of my favourites since I was a little kid. In fact, I wouldn't have missed that chance for the world.\n \n The flip side is, Willie is no longer the Willie I know and love from his records. His voice is poor - I guess 40 years of abuse will do that - he often talks more than sings the songs. Nothing sounds like you remember it from the album, and though in most cases I like that, (I actually don't like going to a concert that just sounds exactly like listening to the album) in this case it wasn't necessarily a good different. His guitar playing was surprising good though, and I've always really liked his unique flamenco/classical style, so that was a treat. \n \n The whole concert had me wishing I would have seen him in his prime, and imagining what an experience that would have been.\n \n All in all though, it was a great experience, and I can cross one more of my musical heroes off my list of must sees.\n \n Waxy",

He was drunk, in his bus, screaming at some poor guy that didn't pack the right sleeveless shirt...\n \n After awhile of waiting for him to come out of the bus, me and a couple of friends decided to \"sneak\" in and pay him a visit. We couldn't get past the two bodyguards, but they were nice and let us stand there long enough to see Ol' Willie lean over from his couch and mumble, then take a drink and pass out again.\n \n The bodyguards saw to it that we got our money back.\n \n I like to hear Willie sing, but I'll think twice about going to another concert.\n \n Glad he showed up for you, though, Waxy.\n \n Congrats! emoticon_xgood",

I've gone full-cycle on concerts. At one point I couldn't resist the lure and remember scheduling business trips to cities where someone I wanted to hear was playing. Over the years I discovered I enjoyed the company of crowds less and less and prefer CDs with their superior sound quality. If you have any association with music, it becomes more of a listening pleasure having technology remove or enhance those bad notes and strengthen weak voices. \n \n Most musicians who perform professionally for many years succumb to the wear and tear of travel and emotional roller coaster lifes. Unless one is a superstar, being on the road is far from being an easy life and few have egos that allow admission of deterioration, especially if booze and dope are regular members of the band. \n \n A lot of it depends on how well their finances were managed, can they retire. Willie lost it all to the IRS not all that many years ago and it's probably questionable as to whether or not he can maintain his accustomed lifestyle while paying back friends that rescued his auctioned home without performing.",

Not only can he really wail, but his ability to harmonize with the band and Willie and to add perfectly timed \"emphasis\" notes is remarkable.\n \n I've got tons of Willie CDs, so I've probably got all of the songs on his Greatest Hits album.\n \n I've heard through the grapevine that his last couple albums, released in the last year or so, are really good. They're critically acclaimed anyway. He played a couple songs off of them and I thought they were quite good. (Except that \"beer for my horses\" song, it sucks, but I really don't like Toby Keith.) I'm going to try and find them and pick them up.\n \n I'll report back when I do. ;)\n \n Waxy",

   "Willie is a great songwriter, penning some of my favorite perennials such as Crazy and Night Life. \n \n But my admiration stops there. His singing and playing have always mildly grated on me, especially when accompanied by his harmonica player. The live album I had of him was particularly irritating: no band discipline, everyone doing their own thing, with the harmonica player trying to outplay everyone. In a word, it was noise. \n \n But I grudgingly admire him for being original, for having a heart of gold, and for convincing Waylon to become an outlaw.\n \n His lyric phrasing is close to genius, waiting sometimes almost to the point of being impossibly late. His guitar playing is quite simple, his battered guitar dull-sounding IMO, but he can find chords no one else ever considered. His voice is too reedy for my taste.\n \n As far as concerts, many road bands are now faking it. Garth Brooks band, for instance, does not actually play, but uses canned music. That's a disappointment to me.",
