   "http://www.darwincentral.org/blog/ \nDarwin Central is concerned with the theory of evolution as a scientific topic. We do not concern ourselves with either religious objections to the theory or with political objections based on the theory's alleged social consequences.We recognize that some denominations which follow a literal interpretation of scripture object to biological evolution because they feel it conflicts with their interpretation of scripture. There are other denominations that do not share this view. The NCSE's collection of Statements from Religious Organizations consists of a list of Christian and Jewish denominations, including the Roman Catholic Church, that accept (or at least do not dispute) evolution. There is also the recent statement opposing creationism by the Archbishop of Canterbury, leader of the 70-million-member Anglican Communion. We have no desire to participate in such inter-denominational disputes.\n \n Regarding the alleged social consequences of the theory of evolution, we recognize that it has, at various times, been blamed for virtually all of the ills of society, including communism, fascism, racism, and eugenics - notwithstanding that such evils existed long before Darwin, and notwithstanding Stalin's persecution of biologists who accepted evolution. It has also been said to be the basis for \"ruthless laissez-faire capitalism\". We regard all such allegations to be essentially baseless, and even if such claims were true, it would not affect the scientific validity of the theory.\n \n The authors of this blog, and its affiliated website, are conservatives (in the American sense of the term). We suspect that a great many in the scientific community are conservatives also, so they should feel especially welcome here. There is nothing socialistic, communistic, fascistic, or atheistic about science.\n \n One of the great un-exploded myths of the 20th century is that the political left is the natural home of intellectuals. While that may be true for a certain kind of intellectual, we do not believe it to be true of scientists.\n \n Science is one of the precious few examples of rationality in human experience. It appeals to the conservative mind for the same reasons that free enterprise does - it is reality-based, it focuses on what works, it rejects failed concepts, and it produces results. Like free enterprise, science will flourish where there is a minimum of governmental interference; it will wither and die in any kind of tyranny, including a theocracy.\n",

The neo-cons are becoming more and more anti-scientific and disconnected from the facts. \n It would seem they are in full agreement with you. \n \n From an entry on the site: \nA group disillusioned with a perceived liberal bias at Wikipedia have decided to create their own, \"conservative\" online encyclopedia: Conservapedia.\n \n Please note the quotes around \"conservative.\"\n \n There is nothing conservative about this project, unless one defines conservatism as a desire to force a particular set of ideological principles (including a decidedly anti-science attitude) onto the population as a whole. No mention of individual freedom or limited government, or any traditional conservative position graces that website. Instead the project espouses Christian principles from beginning to end.\n \n Not that there is anything wrong with that, but it isn't conservatism. \n \n Many self-proclaimed \"conservatives,\" such as those at Conservapedia equate conservatism in general with social conservatism and Christianity in particular, and espouse using the power of government to see their wants and desires enacted--acting literally no differently than the \"liberals\" they despise. Unfortunately, the population as a whole has also begun equating conservatism with these people, and Republicans with conservatism, which is one of the big reasons the Republicans were handed their hats in last November's elections.\n \n And this new \"conservative\" version of Wikipedia is not going to do anything to repudiate that belief, and will give the left even more ammunition to ensure true (small government, personal freedom) conservatives never hold office again.\n \n I wish they'd chosen a different name...\n http://www.darwincentral.org/blog/2007/03/01/what-would-jesus-wiki/#more-98",

Population genetics, aka, biometrics, is no more political than double-entry book-keeping. It's the elitism in the ideologies of darwinism, fascism, corporatism, and creationism that I'm talking about.\n \n Population genetics, considered solely in its own right, is nothing but an innocuous branch of ecological biology. It's useful stuff, but nobody gets emotional about book-keeping and census-taking.\n \n Genetics can get inflammatory, since it impinges on people's values, and that gets people emotionally involved in a hurry. When geneticists decided to impose atheistic mechanist values on biology, people got upset, because people don't believe it when genecists, molecular biologists, and such, tell them that they are, fundamentally, just a bunch of chemicals swirling around in space. Hence, of no more importance, value, and meaning than a rock lost in space. Rightly, albeit emotionally, they react to this politically.\n \n Darwinism is not about genes, directly. Darwinism is about organisms, including human beings, and darwinism is about justifying why some have so much while others have so little. They pretend that it's about 'fitness', and that 'fitness' is about differential offspring production, but every corporate jungle beast knows it's about selfishly collecting more good stuff for yourself--money, women, toys, and above all, political and financial power.\n \n \n\n Say - You don't happen to have Lysenko or Stalin in your linage do you?

And yes it is bean counting - though I would not hire an accountant to do the math if I were you. Social darwinism is NOT incorporated into NDS. To confuse social darwinism - a philosophical area unrelated to biological evolution - with evolutionary theory is absurd beyond belief.
