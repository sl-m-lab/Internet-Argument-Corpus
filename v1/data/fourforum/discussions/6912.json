From that day in September, 1939, until the present moment, there has been an over-increasing effort to force the United States into the conflict.\n \n That effort has been carried on by foreign interests, and by a small minority of our own people; but it has been so successful that, today, our country stands on the verge of war.\n \n Who is responsible for changing our national policy from one of neutrality and independence to one of entanglement in European affairs?\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=6902\n \n \n \n .",

   "From the collected speeches and writings of Charles A. Lindbergh:\n \n \"We are very anxious to avoid having this country pushed into a European war by British and (Zionist) Jewish propaganda, of which there is already too much.\"\n -- Statement to the U.S. Congress, June 30th, 1939\n \n \n \"Most of the Jewish interests in the country are behind war, and they control a huge part of our press, radio, and most of our motion pictures.\"\n -- May 1st, 1941, U.S. wire service interview.\n \n \n \"When I mentioned the three major groups agitating for war, the British, the Jews, and the Roosevelt administration, the entire audience seemed to stand up (in agreement) and cheer.\"\n -- Diary entry after his famous Des Moines, Iowa speech of September 11th, 1941\n \n \n \"It seems that almost anything can be discussed today in America except the Jewish problem. The very mention of the word Jew is cause for a storm.\"\n -- Diary entry, September 15th, 1941\n \n \n \"The war monger ranks include the American government, the British government, the Jews, and major portions of the press, radio, and motion pictures. The mass of the people do not want war, but the President can force us into war by actions and incidents which make it unavoidable. Roosevelt is in a position where he can force war upon us, whether we want it or not.\" -- Diary entry, October 4th, 1941, a bare two months before Roosevelt betrayed America at Pearl Harbor and forced the U.S. into World War II.\n \n \n \"The Jews' greatest danger to this country lies in their large influence and ownership of our motion pictures, and of the press.\"\n -- Nationwide radio address, November 1941\n \n http://www.rense.com/general69/cntro.htm\n \n http://www.boeing.com/companyoffices/aboutus/wonder_of_flight/images/Lindberg_250.jpg\n \n \n \n .",
