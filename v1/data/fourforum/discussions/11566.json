That's what debates over politics are for, to argue our viewpoints.\n\n \n True, but surely you can agree that the more lack of objectivity, the more danger there is of a lack of credibility.\n \n I think there's a difference between the issue of objectivity (or lack thereof) and being for a candidate. I think one can be for a candidate and still be objective, and objectivity doesn't latch hold of negative stories, like they are gospel, about the candidate we aren't for.

That's the sort of thing said when someone is a criminal, or a drunk, or some other major thing that would prevent them from doing the job. It's the sort of language the military uses to describe an officer who has exibited conduct unbecoming of an officer. Palin is not unfit. There's nothing we know of that would make any of them incapable of leading. You're balking at the idea that she's being treated unfairly, but frankly, you're taking an unfair approach here.

You write as though I am the one investigating it.\nNo. I'm writing as if anyone who reads the facts (and watches the video of the trooper verifying that he did taser the kid and he did illegally shoot the moose and he did threaten Palin's family with bodily harm) should immediately understand that the trooper indeed should be fired and not allowed to carry a gun and badge. He is a rogue cop, a drug-store cowboy, a beligerant adolescent...unworthy of being a state trooper...in any state. \n \n\n I have no interest in \"degrading\" Sarah Palin. I am sure she is a person with many fine qualities. However, when she tells untruths about Obama and tries to smear him in a speech, then we need to stand up for the truth about the candidate she is attacking. \nWhat untruth has she told...that he lacks experience?\n \n \n\n She is the one who likened herself to a pit bull. She is the one who went on the attack against Obama, not the other way around.\nLikening one's self to an animal is generally done to draw a comparison of similar traits.\n \n \"Blind as a bat\" is generally NOT used to call someone a bat but is used to say that the person cannot see well. All other bat-like traits are unsuggested. Her comment about pit bulls and hockey moms was not meant to equate the two groups...just to suggest fearlessness and toughness.\n \n She attacked Obama because he needs to be exposed. He is not experienced in making executive decisions. Being a \"Community Organizer\" is NOTHING compared to actually leading an organization. All it takes to be a community organizer is the ability to rev people up with speeches and pats on the back.\n \n Just look at how many times Obama voted \"Present\" in the Illinois government. He is a do-nothing, talk-smoothly, polished politician with absolutely no viable plan for the future of this country. His desire appears to be to place his family and friends among the ruling elite of a socialist society. His methodology appears to be that of promising redistribution of wealth to those voters who can be duped into thinking they will be better off under the umbrella of socialism...and that those filthy old rich people will be punished...along with those evil companies that control the work force. He appears to be willing to kill this country. His wife has only recently become proud to be an American. His racist mentor/spiritual leader, Jeremiah Wright has for YEARS been preaching hatred of America and white people. His friend and co-worker, Bill Ayers has been backing him and nuturing him and working with him in the Illinois state political machine. His list of friends and acquaintances seems replete with racists and radicals.\n \n Kudos to Sarah Palin for attacking like a pit bull. Hopefully, she's not done yet.",

I wouldn't invite that woman into my house, let alone help her get into office.\n\n \n Look jito, the ignorance you're spewing must be confronted. Have you ever been to the South side of Chi town? Because I have. It's a predominantly black, poor inner city area with a depressed economy. You notice how I said it is, rather than was? Because Obama had no long term positive effect on it at all.\n \n Also, if you want to be rational and realistic. Blacks make up around 12% of the American population, and no one will deny that Obama was a community activist in the black community. But a full 88% of the rest of America is either white, hispanic, or other races etc... \n \n So how can you say that by Sarah Palin governing a State with a population that reflects the National racial statistics, has less real world experience that Obama? Beside that, He never actually governed over anyone. He was a community worker at the street level. Nothing about that experience prepares a man for running the Mayors office even, much less a Governors office, and definitely not the Presidents office. \n \n So stop kidding yourself and understand why the powers that be in the Democratic party are now going apoplectic because they understand all too well that they have backed a true empty suit, and that Hillary would have been a better candidate, even with the extremely HEAVY baggage that would have followed her around like an anchor around her neck.",
