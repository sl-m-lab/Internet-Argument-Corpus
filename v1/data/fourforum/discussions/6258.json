That, I thought, was probably the most distasteful thing I had ever seen. Ever,\" Pannell, a member of the Army's First Cavalry Division, told Cybercast News Service. \n \n \"You know that 95 percent of the guys in the hospital bed lost guys whenever they got hurt and survivors' guilt is the worst thing you can deal with,\" Pannell said, adding that other veterans recovering from wounds at Walter Reed share his resentment for the anti-war protesters. \n \n \"We don't like them and we don't like the fact that they can hang their signs and stuff on the fence at Walter Reed,\" he said. \"[The wounded veterans] are there to recuperate. Once they get out in the real world, then they can start seeing that stuff (anti-war protests). I mean Walter Reed is a sheltered environment and it needs to stay that way.\"\n \n . . . . \"[The anti-war protesters] have no business here. If they want to protest policy, they should be at the Capitol, they should be at the White House,\" said Nina Burke. \"The only reason for being here is to talk to [the] wounded and [anti-war protests are] just completely inappropriate.\" \n \n Albion Wilde concurred, arguing that \"it's very easy to pick on the families of the wounded. They are very vulnerable ... I feel disgusted.\n \n \"[The anti-war protesters] are really showing an enormous lack of respect for just everything that America has always stood for. They lost the election and now they are really, really angry and so they are picking on the wrong people,\" Wilde added. ",
