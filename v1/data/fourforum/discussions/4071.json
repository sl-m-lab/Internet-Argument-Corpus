   "your expectations of our elected officials are unrealistic, ron. it is by no means their duty to diseminate truth to the public. it never happened in the past, it most likely never will\n \n \n you admit to being vague about your reasons for rejecting moore's view, even though you admit that it is the truth. i'll accept that. let me suggest what i think it is (of course its only my speculation on your motives, and i could be wrong). you do have a bias in support of the president. you automatically will reject anything that opposes him, even if it is the truth, even in the face of evidence. this may or may not be a side-effect of your religious background. as with many republicans, there is a strong loyalty to a cause, even though that cause is false. it is the reason why bush would maintain seige of iraq, even after overwhelming evidence that he was wrong. it is also why roughly half of america supports his iraqi invasion to this day.\n \n im sorry that facts are useless in helping you form your view. its common in this society, but i strongly disagree with it. i guess you might say i'm liberal. i dont care about political labels, just about whats right\n\n Unkerpaulie ----------- I GIVE! You hard-headed individual! :p",

   "Jim, your arguments here are all circular. You keep asking and answering your own questions. The same explanation for the movie winning holds for the election, and visa versa. I don't think anyone's arguing the how's and why's of either victory, they mean what they mean, the majority voted for them. Like I said earlier, the majority isn't necessarily right. Apply that to the movie and the election.\nThen this thread title should be nothing more than \"Farenheit 911-VOTED best movie\"\n \n It is meant to imply that F-911 is the best movie because the majority of voters said so. By that reasoning then, Bush is the best for President.\n \n We all know that in either case, this is nothing more than opinion.",
