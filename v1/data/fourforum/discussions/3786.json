   "The religious right in the United States have taken control of our federal government. A person?s spiritual religious beliefs and governments with large military armies do not go together well. The self-righteous person of faith has very little tolerance for people of different faith and customs. Issues dealing with morals and religion are very personal and the government?s policies are for the public at large. What is right for one person may not be right for another person and it is the government responsibility to protect the rights of the individual without impeding on the rights of others. A lack of balance and common sense has taken us the down the wrong path in so many ways. \n \n How does the religious right justifying being Pro Life, Pro Gun, and Pro War and so anti gay when two people of the same sex wanting to commit their love to one and another. An investigation into the eleven states that had referendums dealing with gay matrimonies will find that the religious right was the motivating force behind getting them on the ballet. The religious Wizards of TV preaching to their followers to vote the way of God and Jesus demonizing anyone who is outside the line. The religious fundamental extremists controlling the United States government today are almost as bad as the ones we are fighting. The religious extremists are in control of the governments on both sides of America?s War on Terrorists. \n \n By defending bad policies our actions are getting us deeper into a hole. Today we are confronted with a no win situation in Iraq while we are flaming the fire to going to War with Iran and Syria. The Middle East occupied by foreign empires for thousands of years. Today with the vast amount of oil reserves in the Middle East the fighting to who is going to control the region has intensified. The United States has gone to war not understanding who is the enemy and has escalated the tension around the world.",

   "I strongly doubt that all Republicans (including Bush) are \"religious right.\" The Republican Party, as I understand it, is a coalition of laissez-faire capitalists, theocrats, moderates and \"compassionate conservatives\" (i.e. authoritarians.) The Democratic Party is a coalition as well (democratic-socialists, libertarians, moderates and populists.) The third parties are much more ideologically homogenous.",
