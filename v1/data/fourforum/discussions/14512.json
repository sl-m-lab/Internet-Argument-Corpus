   "Don't get offended. It's funny emoticon_xagree.\n \n THINGS REPUBLICANS HATE | The Complete Guide to Conservative Hatred.\n \n \n\n Tofu\n Liberals love the idea of evolution. Their thirst for change and shape-shifting is always unquenched as they look for new ways to pussify themselves. This hatred for comfort and consistency is present in all realms of the liberal lifestyle. This is perfectly illustrated by the chameleon-like food known as &#8216;tofu&#8217;. Tofu is a tasteless, white cube made from tree bark and hemp leaves that conforms to any substance poured over it. For instance, let&#8217;s say that the American people are tofu and the substance is the Obama presidency. As the Obama presidency reigns over the American people, America becomes a Socialist state. This is especially appealing to Democrats who identify with tofu&#8217;s inability to stand up for itself.\n \n Tofu has become popular among vegetarians, vegans and college professors who feel they have a &#8216;connection&#8217; with animals. This connection, known as &#8216;Snow White syndrome&#8221;, is usually caused by excessive exposure to pretentious documentaries.\n \n Liberals will often order tofu dishes and defend themselves by discussing the film &#8216;Food Inc.&#8217; or raving about the pleasures of bestiality. The latter usually results in vomiting and the rapid decline of hot dog sales. Tofu is extremely popular among the lesbian community as meat substitutes are common in homes where men are not present. The FDA has resisted attempts to include tofu in the food guide pyramid under the category &#8216;Plausible Foods&#8217; since many Republicans deny its edibility.\n \n As Republicans are consummate carnivores, most meals consist of 80-90% meat-based dishes. The inclusion of vegetables in any meal will result in vast leftovers that may or may not require a to-go box. Some Republicans may not be aware of tofu&#8217;s existence. This could be dangerous to unknowing conservatives, but they usually ignore tofu because of its un-American name.\n",
