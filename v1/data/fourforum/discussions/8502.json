   "Not long ago I wrote about some provocations organized by Georgian and Moldavian officials against unrecognized autonomies South Ossetia and TransDniestrea. It's well-known that July 9, 2006 as a result of bomb explosion the secretary of South Ossetia Security Council Oleg Alborov was killed and July 6, 2006 the explosion of taxi in Tiraspol happened, 7 dead and over 35 wounded.\n And now provocations from Georgian side are continuing. Today the encroachment on Bala Bestaev happened in Tskhinvali. I think that Georgian side will declare that some terrorist gangs work in South Ossetia or local officials are trying to destroy opposition. It'll be lame excuses and attempt to draw international community's attention on the threshold of G8 Summit. Well, to tell the truth current events in Caucasian district and Saakshvlili's impudence when he reported about taking place accidents shows us that some one foreign supports Georgian side.\n I think that it's not a secret that Americans render not only financial assistance but political support to Saakshvlili's regime. I'm sure that Georgian president couldn't find such an idea or take fright at it. But now he has US' support and I think that these were was not the last acts of terrorism in South Ossetia.",

   "Russia still has defense forces in South Ossetia, does it not. I doubt Georgia will dare try to take an offensive move towards the semi autonomous state as long as Russian forces are in place. With Putin on a roll, and the worlds eyes turned elsewhere, Georgia is going to have to be carefull or face the measured moves of a former KGB boss.",
