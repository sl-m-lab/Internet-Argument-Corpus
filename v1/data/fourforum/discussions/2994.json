   "Jerry Falwell is opening his own law school:\n http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-falwell18.html\n \n \n'We want to infiltrate the culture with men and women of God who are skilled in the legal profession,'' Falwell said in a telephone interview Tuesday with the Associated Press. ''We'll be as far to the right as Harvard is to the left.''\n\n \n \nJoe Conn, a spokesman for Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said the law school is part of a crusade by Falwell to get the government to carry out his religious agenda.\n \n ''When Falwell talks about using the legal system to advance his personal religious beliefs, I get a whiff of the Taliban,'' Conn said. ''This is a very diverse country with many different religious beliefs, and when you set up a law school to try to get the government and legal system to conform to only one of them, you're leaving everybody else out.''\n\n \n Just a follow up to Pat Robertson's Law school:\n http://www.regent.edu/acad/schlaw/\n \n \nRegent University School of Law is distinctive among law schools approved by the American Bar Association because of the integration of Christian Principles into our curriculum. It is this balance of professional legal training and the affirmation of biblical principles that enables our graduates to provide excellent legal counsel to their clients.\n\n \n From the mission statement: http://www.regent.edu/acad/schlaw/welcome/mission.cfm\n \nThe nurture and encouragement of other law students, practicing lawyers, judges, legislators, government officials, educators and others to recognize and seek the biblical foundations of law, to recognize questions of righteousness in the operation of law; and to pursue true justice.\n\n \n What does Falwell mean when he says they'll be far to the right? Now, there's the \"right\" and there's the religious \"right.\" I wonder when we will have the first Regent-graduate supreme court justice! \n \n Am I the only one getting freaked out by this? How far do you think their graduates will get?",

   "Chances are, and hopefully, their graduates won't go anywhere, because no one will take a Jerry Falwell School of Law (or of anything else for that matter) seriously.\n \n And by \"right\" he means ultra-conservative christian.\n \n This freaks me out oo, but nothing will come of it.",
