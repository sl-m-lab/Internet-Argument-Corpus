   "In the debate over God, theists often attempt to show that their must be a God by questioning atheists about the origin of the universe. When the atheist replies that he is uncertain about the origin or offers a weak answer, the theist jumps at this.\n Mankind is not certain about the origin of life and so theists often use God to come to the rescure and fill in the missing links.\n \n This is a common argument many Christians use to prove their God exists.\n \n Are their any theists here who use this argument and would like to defend such a position?",

The big bang and evolution (Science via evidence/observation)\n \n is contradictory to the system with which you base belief in god.\n \n 2. Faith (without or contrary to evidence/observation)\n \n They are mutually exclusive. For a reasonable individual, holding contradictory positions is not a good thing. Any claim based on faith should be rejected by an ethical, rational individual. For instance, a car is speeding towards a friend of mine is unaware and in the car's path. I can:\n \n 1. Believe that the car will hit my friend and probably kill her, and act on that belief based on evidence (push her out of the way).\n 2. Believe contrary to all evidence and everything I claim I know about reality that the car will NOT hit my friend, after all, I believe \"god\" has not planned for her to die now (Despite all evidence to the contrary and my lack of evidence that there is a god, and that I somehow know what this ficticious entity has planned).\n \n Reality does not seem to mind if you choose to believe in things without justification....but you probably care. Why not care full-time and reject faith and the unethical paths it can lead to? I would push a friend out of the path of a car. You seem to be suggesting that you think it's OK for me to both know she will be hit (via evidence), and for me not to act (And let her get crushed) because faith is also useful in guiding beliefs. Ouch, some friends show their friendship in odd ways. Personally I think that's not the way we should share our time on this earth (believing in things without evidence or in spite of evidence).\n \n -Mach",

Simply a nice story-book for you to read from?\n \n If Genesis is simply a representative story from which we can interpret the actions of god to mean natural selection and evolution, what about the ten commandments?\n \n It always amazes me to hear people with positions like this insist that it is okay to play fast and loose with their interpretations of Genesis or the Arc, but God really does hate the homosexuals. It says so in Leveticus, right? So it must be word perfect truth...\n \n This bit about the origins of the earth? Oh, we just interpret that as god designing evolution.

   "\"I am no theologian, i dont know who or what god is\" - Lisa Simpson\n \n Knowledge is a very tricky thing. What do we know to know and what do we not know. There are very few things that we do know, and many things that we do not know. But we are learning, building better ideas than previous ideas. That is what man does, think, reinvent, create. The old ideal may have been explain everything according to some mystical, perfect God. Time change, better ideas come along. No one says our ideas are perfect, and they may be revised in the future, but to insist upon inferior ideas only hurts man kind.\n \n One can prove that God cannot be perfect, but in order for christians to believe in thier faith, they require a perfect god. Nothing makes sense without a perfect god for them. But he does not exist. An imperfect god might exist, but he does not show up all that often. Relax, give up you ideas of that which must be, be comoftable with an imperfect god, or at least realize that your vison of what god might be, may be wrong. Maybe there is no god. Why do we need to feel that there is something better out there, why cant we just accept that we dont know",
