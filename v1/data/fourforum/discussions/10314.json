The issues the Baathists have with AL Qeada was there long before we ever entered Iraq. \n \n I am sure you have heard of the conflicts the baathists had with AL Qeada even before the surge. Now that we are allowing the baathists to Mobilize, they are indeed attacking AL Qeada. Course they are. Its no wonderful moment, they have always wanted to attack them. We are simply allowing them to do it now.\n \n AL Qeada more than any other group in Iraq, needs the presence of U.S. troops keeping the Shia Militias from Mobilizing or they would be crushed in short order. AL Qeada makes its threats knowing that it will harden the U.S. and aid in keeping troops in Iraq so they can continue their infiltration. The American forces prevent any aggression from the Shia Militias and this gives AL Qeada the breathing space it needs to try and build enough force presence to deal with the far larger Shia Militia groups.\n \n If we leave Iraq its true there will be sectarian strife though its note worthy to include that this will mean AL Qeada would be taken out. Currently our stay is effectively aiding our direct enemy and every poll you will ever read makes it clear that the reasons we are staying will never come to being. \n \n If we could guard the borders to Saudi Arabia and Syria, and find a way to fix the differences between the Shia and the United States, then maybe we would have a slight chance of being afforded a long term base. If we could do this, then we could do this in Iran because it is a Shia state. Its clear to me; our chances of ever gaining any real allie in Iraq is very limited if not completely impossible.

   "kesseltron, have you asked yourself \"why did we go into iraq in the first place?\" if the answer is \"to fight terrorism\" then the follow up question is \"what started this war on terrorism?\" the answer to that is the 9/11 al qaeda attacks. so now, you need to answer \"why have we gone after saddam and ignored al qaeda?\"\n \n every premise bush used to justify his iraq invasion was based on lies. he said al qaeda had camps in iraq. lie. he said that al qaeda was supported by iraq. lie. he said that saddam had wmds and biological weapons. lie. he said that saddam was reconstructing illegal weapons and weapons plants. lie. the justification eventually was reduced to saddam is a really really mean guy, which is subjective and needs no evidence anyway\n \n our annual rate of iraq citizen killings has already surpassed saddam's. our rate of property destruction is higher than what occured during the war with iran. we're not doing iraq a favor by \"reconstructing\" their country, we're simply cleaning up the mess we made, which i hardly think is commendable, since the mess was extremely expensive to create and moreso to clean up. we could have simply left iraq as it was and saved nearly a trillion dollars.\n \n the best part is, osama bin laden and most of al qaeda are still out there. years after our iraqi invasion they were still attacking in europe, demostrating that they are just as viable and deadly as ever. yet bush completely refuses to even address hunting for bin laden.\n \n so what we have is a large portion of our protective forces unavailable to protect us since they are elsewhere pursuing extracurricular activies. we have the same enemies that attacked us on 9/11 still at large, and we are none the wiser to their plans. we have a multibillion dollar cleaning bill that you the taxpayer and your great grandchildren will work to repay. but if thats your view of what a better world to live in is, who am i to argue?",

Our survey was carried out throughout Iraq and looked at the incidence of civilian deaths since 2003 - together with Iraqi's views on the displacement of people. \n \n As with many other activities in Iraq polling has its own restraints and it is simply too dangerous for interviewers to operate in some areas. Meanwhile local authorities prevent interviewers from working in certain towns and districts. This means that we cannot gather opinion from the more volatile areas but, at the same time we have, so far, also limited coverage in rural districts. Both of these factors mean that any estimate of deaths will remain just that - an estimate. \n \n While, for obvious reasons, we cannot boost our representation of people living in Iraq's most violent areas we have decided - following feedback from readers of our poll - to conduct a more extensive survey of rural areas to see how this may impact on our estimate. We are in the process of conducting additional interviews in rural areas of Iraq. Once this data has been verified and merged with our current data set we will post it here on the ORB website. We aim to be in a position to release this data within ten days i.e. first week of October. \n\n \n Opinion Research Bussiness",
