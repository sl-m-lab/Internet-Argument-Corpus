Now FedEx challenges the world in logistics.\n \n What has your political/economic systems givens us of any relevance over the past 50 years?\n \n You and those who think like you are doing plenty of damage to our republic and you will probably emerge victorious. Simply because you espouse a system that that the lazy and uneducated gravitate towards. And with your successful takeover of the education system the uneducated are becoming the majority.\n \n Those who produce are already becoming outnumbered by those who consume. But the question for you is this. What are you going to consume when the producers refuse to do so for free?\n \n Because that is what your higher taxes and social/economic remedies will give us. \n \n Unfortunately when that happens, \"I told you so!\" sure will ring hollow.",

   "The origins of capitalism and free markets can be traced back to the Islamic Golden Age and Muslim Agricultural Revolution, where the first market economy and earliest forms of merchant capitalism took root between the 8th-12th centuries, which some refer to as \"Islamic capitalism\". A vigorous monetary economy was created by Muslims on the basis of the expanding levels of circulation of a stable high-value currency (the dinar) and the integration of monetary areas that were previously independent. Innovative new business techniques and forms of business organisation were introduced by economists, merchants and traders during this time. Such innovations included the earliest trading companies, big businesses, contracts, bills of exchange, long-distance international trade, the first forms of partnership (mufawada) such as limited partnerships (mudaraba), and the earliest forms of credit, debt, profit, loss, capital (al-mal), capital accumulation (nama al-mal), circulating capital, capital expenditure, revenue, cheques, promissory notes, trusts (see Waqf), startup companies, savings accounts, transactional accounts, pawning, loaning, exchange rates, bankers, money changers, ledgers, deposits, assignments, the double-entry bookkeeping system, and lawsuits.\n\n Capitalism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Praise be to Allah! I never knew!\n \n Stable high-value currency. The U.S. dollar once upon a time, before Bush and his cronies got their damned hands on it.",

   "And all those building societies that became banks have failed. Which was the better model? All societies resemble each other in that they require people to work together. Our current society normalises certain behaviour - competitiveness, greed etc. that need not be normalised. Marx's idea of the withering away of the state is based on this idea - that over time social taboos and expectations would make state controls unnecessary.\n\n \n Socialism failed , Building societies failed!\n Any society that does not require competiveness will wither and die or be dominated by a society that does.\n Marx was simply wrong. It would be nice if he were right, it would also be nice if everyone was nice to each other, men didnt fancy each others wives and get drunk and punch each other.\n Unless your are the one wife stealing or doing the punching..then life would be unnatural and boring!",
