   "Yankton Press & Dakotan < News < Nebraska: Senators OK Gun Ownership Measure\n \n \nLINCOLN, Neb. - Nebraska lawmakers advanced a measure Tuesday that would grant people with past mental health problems the chance to reclaim gun ownership rights.\n \n The bill would allow state mental health boards to lift gun possession bans that were imposed for mental health reasons. Mental health boards would have to review an applicant's mental health records, criminal history and reputation before lifting the ban.\n \n The measure was part of a broader proposal designed to improve communication between mental health boards and law enforcement, and align Nebraska with federal law. Congress strengthened the national criminal background system used for firearm sales in 2007, after a mentally ill student killed 32 people and wounded 15 others at Virginia Tech.\n \n The Nebraska bill would require court clerks to report all mental health commitments and discharges to the state Department of Health and Human Resources and the Nebraska State Patrol within 30 days. Both would receive similar notices when a mental health board reinstates gun ownership rights.\n \n Mental health commitment boards operate under Nebraska's court system, with at least one in every judicial district.\n \n The bill's sponsor, Imperial Sen. Mark Christensen, said the change \"affords an opportunity for persons to restore their Second Amendment rights\" if their mental health improves.\n \n he proposal would require mental boards to hold a hearing for anyone who requests it. Board members would then decide whether the applicant poses a public danger based on background checks, the circumstances that led to the mental health commitment, mental health improvements and witness statements.\n \n Nebraska has denied few requests in recent years. Gun certificate applications were rejected in only two cases out of the 1,012 requests filed between October 2009 and December 2010, Christensen said.\n \n Lawmakers advanced the bill through the first of three required votes. The bill would take effect on Jan. 1, 2012, if signed by Gov. Dave Heineman.\n \n The measure included an amendment by Omaha Sen. Scott Lautenbaugh that allows gun owners from other states to waive the 6-month waiting period for a concealed handgun permit, if they move to Nebraska and were recognized in their previous state.\n\n \n Sounds like a sane move to me. In fact it's so sane it boggles the mind why this wasn't done much earlier on.",
