   "This persons claims that the full page ad in The Metro (newspaper) is fear mongering then goes on to say \"And now, gay interest groups are taking another stab at the heart of the family... one that could prove to be fatal, further contributing to America's societal decadence in the long run.\" This is so laughable I had to share.\n \n http://www.hubpolitics.com/archives/000747.php\n \n \nThe Gay Marriage Fraud\n \n Friday, I got the Metro as I usually do during my morning commute to work, and was struck by the full-page ad on the back taken out by The Freedom To Marry Foundation. Featuring an enlarged photo of two wedding rings, the ad contains the slogan \"Speak now, or forever lose the right.\" in big letters, and boasts the following message:\n \n On July 12th, the Massachusetts Legislature will hold its 17th vote on marriage equality. Let's send a clear message that it's time to stand up for ALL families in the Commonwealth, defeat this constitutional amendment, and move on to other business. Call your legislators today to let them know you support equal marriage. Visit www.equalmarriage.org for legislative contact information, and to learn other ways you can help protect families in Massachusetts.\n \n There is not a word in the ad that accurately describes the real situation and it is deliberately misleading. While repeating words like equality, family and marriage, the ad intentionally avoids mentioning that the Constitutional amendment it warns about seeks to define marriage as being between a man and a woman. The ad intentionally avoids mentioning gay marriage. The ad intentionally avoids saying that the issue of gay marriage would be brought to the voters in 2008.\n \n The Freedom To Marry Foundation knew exactly what it was doing. They are avoiding the details of the issue, and claiming this is about civil rights. By equating their position with equality, they are implying that those who support the amendment are bigots. By making no reference to gay marriage, the ad implies that everyone's right to marry is somehow in jeopardy, as well as the ridiculous notion that the future of the family is in danger. They know very well that given the opportunity to vote on the issue, Massachusetts voters will reject gay marriage, but when you start talking about equality and civil right (without connecting it to gay marriage) its an easy sell... especially when you invoke fear that everyone's existing marriages are at stake if the constitutional amendment passes.\n \n This kind of fear mongering is irresponsible. The Freedom To Marry Foundation doesn't even have enough courage to actually explain what it is they are opposing. They don't want the readers of the ad to know that what they are really talking about is gay marriage, or that they are effectively advocating that the people of Massachusetts be denied the chance to declare what their values are, rather than have the unelected judges on the SJC tell them what they are.\n \n How can this group claim to be protecting families when they are the ones actively seeking to redefine marriage, the union between a man a woman that is the foundation of the family - solely to serve their radical agenda. \n \n The decay of our society has its roots in the decay of the family. Single-motherhood is now a badge of honor, not a stigma. Big bucks are offered for pictures of the first child of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, an unmarried couple. Television sitcoms feature nontraditional families and present fathers as bumbling XXXXXX. Fathers have virtually no rights in the courts compared to mothers. And now, gay interest groups are taking another stab at the heart of the family... one that could prove to be fatal, further contributing to America's societal decadence in the long run.\n",

The anti-gay marriage crowd have nothing to go on but lies and fear, and you can count on them using them for all they're worth. This is a pretty sad example, however. There's nothing in the ad that even vaguely resembles fear-mongering, and the idea that anyone reading the Metro wouldn't understand that gay marriage was the issue is beyond laughable. I can only hope that, over the next two years, the voters realize how insulting and inane these tactics are, and that truth and justice will win in the end.",
