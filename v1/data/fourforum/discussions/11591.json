   "My efforts were in vain on the other thread, but here, since it's the OP, nobody who responds will have an excuse for ignoring this.\n \n \n \n What happened to \"Ask not what you can do for your country and not vice versa\"? Obama claims he can fund his programs by lowering taxes for us and raising them for CEOs. This method of funding these programs is unlikely at best. Even if it is possible to fund things by raising CEO taxes, who will end up paying for this in the end? The answer is us; the middle class; those who Obama thinks he is helping, but is actually hurting.\n \n Covering the idiocy of these policies, you must regard minimum wage increases. They result in very large inflation, becuase CEOs just have to have that money. If you take it away, they'll raise prices, and in my mind that is justifiable. \n \n They are the ones who are investing money in our economy. They work twelve, sixteen, sometimes twenty hour shifts. If you worked sixteen hour shifts, wouldn't you want a little extra in your paycheck? They manage their business daily, they go through all that headache and paperwork, but their paycheck is a good incentive for all that hassle. If you take their incentive away, then there are only two outcomes. They see no point in getting less money despite the headache they go through and just give up, or as I stated above, they raise prices, and both of them will bring economic doom. Simple as that.\n \n And finally, I'll cover this greedy spirit. We're like kids making wish lists to Santa Claus. We say Dear Santa, I've been a good boy/girl. Now I want this!! I want that!!! Gimme this!!! Gimme that!! Gimme gimme GIMME GIMME GIMME!!!!!\", and frankly, the rest of the year, Santa and being good can go to hell. We want all this free stuff, and we don't even stop to think \"Who will be paying for this in the end?\" These programs sound nice, but in the end, we're better off leaving things as they are. No need to throw gasoline on the fire that is burning down our economy.",

   "Minimum wages are essential because no economy has free movement of labour, so poorly paid workers are not on an even footing to negotiate for higher wages. The claim that they cause unemployment is not supported by the evidence so far in the UK. We've had a minimum wage for 10 years now (at around twice the rate in the US) and those claims were made by the CBI and were shown to be without foundation. The fact of the matter is that those jobs paying minimum wage generally can't be got rid of, and even when they can the wages are a relatively small component of the cost of production that it's not efficient to shed jobs. This leads to my second point, that because wages are only a fraction of production costs, prices will not rise at the same rate as the minimum wage so they have a proportionally redistributive effect.\n \n Given the rate of increase in boardroom pay I am still flabbergasted that people have the gall to claim that those at the bottom need to tighten their belts to combat inflation.",

   "Ethmi, you're taking a very myopic approach to this issue. The objective of the taxes hike for businesses and business heads is to fund education programs that will further boost the lowest rung of the workforce, justifying their pay increase. If they raise minimum wage, for businesses this is a higher expense which will cut into profits. But its the profits that are going to be hit by the higher taxes anyway. So would you, as a business owner prefer more profits to pay more taxes, or more expenses to offset the tax burden a bit? Not only that, with the hike in minimum wage, we might expect to see stricter educational prerequisites for entry-level jobs. And that's why the educational programs that will be funded by these taxes will be so important. Ultimately, the net effect of the plan will be higher productivity for all involved. \n \n As for inflation, I would expect to see prices increase to compensate for higher cost of labor, but we have had a ridculous rate of inflation as it is, with no wage increases for the same middle class that you are championing here. They will be no worse off with Obama's plan than they will be with Bush's record debt-acceleration war strategy. And if more lower class citizens do benefit from the education thrust that Obama is promising, then it will actually benefit the middle class greatly.",
