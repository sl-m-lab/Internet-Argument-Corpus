I have been accused on here of having a \"cemented shut\" mind when debating religion because of my beliefs in Christianity. So, I am going to lift that cement off of my head to \"free\" up my thoughts , so they will not be quite so biased for a bit ....\n \n \n As I have stated before , there are a lot of posts on here that I agree with both for , and against religion. One can see why in todays high tech world, a world in which everything can be \"proven \" in a lab or at the very least , someone has a photo of , :). SO, the belief in a \"god\" or the doctrines of Christianity, could be viewed as highly \"questionable\" to most and they are to the logically or scientific minded. I will not start another debate on that fact, there are hundreds of thousands upon thousands of words of text, on this forum already debating that one.... \n \n I will just honestly ask one question that I have yet to find a solid answer to on this forum...\n \n What is it that happens to the person after they have received the \"spirit\" of the proclaimed Christian diety \"Jesus \" ???  This is not a loaded question , or one setting anyone up for humiliation from the master debators. No one likes to be slammed , and I am not writing this so anyone can to do that. We have all read or viewed \"testimonials\" from people that have had that ( born again, touched by the spirit, received Jesus, etc, ) experience in their life . I have had that experience , so this may not be a fair question for you, unless you have read my post about my experience on here. ...\n \n Keeping my cement lifted here, I recall spending spent MANY MANY hours in my life trying to rationalize that experience. I thought maybe it was just a self - induced \"trance\" that maybe my mind had secreted extra endorphins (sp?) for , just to help me though a low point in life. Yet, at that time of my Christ ( for lack of another description) experience and within a two year window I think, a friend I grew up with and 3 other classmates killed themselves. Where was that extra self induced endorphin to help them through the mental anguish they needed, just as they pulled the trigger? Why could they not \"self induce\" a \" \"spirit of Christ\" feeling , to at least get them past that feeling of wanting to self destruct ? Why couldnt the same \"spiriit of light\" that gave me my complete change in being, have helped my friends though their personal crisis , as it did mine ??? The ONLY known difference in what I was doing at that time, and what they were doing in their lives WAS, I was reading the Holy Bible KJV.... ( NOT testifying here, just stating a FACT) \n \n \n Sorry I know, not fair questions for someone that may or may not have , experienced what I did from the Spirit of Christ\" ( my interpretation, not a known and documented public event , except what was witnessed by my friends and family). I DO NOT feel any guilt about my frieinds suicides, they, as all do, had the right to do what they wanted to with their lives ( not a Christian veiwpoint of course) . So, I will continue to believe as I do about the Bible and Christ, and in the future I hope to refrain from imposing my beleifs on anyone else . But , one must admit, it certainly IS a interesting topic for discussion, good day to you :)",

   "\n What is it that happens to the person after they have received the \"spirit\" of the proclaimed Christian diety \"Jesus \" ???  \n\n \n You seem to be describing what is commonly referred to as a \"born-again experience\" in Christian parlance. \n \n I was a young man in my early twenties, brought up in the Lutheran tradition, but never very religious, when I came into contact with men my same age who were of Evangelical and Baptist faiths. Their openness and zeal in discussing religious issues dumbfounded me, coming as I did from my stoical upbringing. It was in truth very refreshing and I began attending some of their services and playing music at evening church get-togethers.\n \n One day one of my new-found friends asked me if I had invited Jesus into my life as he had done. He showed me some corresponding biblical verses, since forgotten, and explained how one needed to ask for forgiveness first, and then ask Jesus to come into your life.\n \n I sat on the information for a few days pondering the implications, then almost on a lark, while at work and by myself, I followed the directions carefully.\n \n I'll never forget the feeling that came over me, and exactly where I was and what I was doing. It was an actual physical experience, a flood washing over me. Christianity became a passion from then on. I knew, as I often said, that Jesus was real and no one could convince me--even with threat of death--otherwise. \n \n But the passion that existed in me was the same force that eventually led to my non-belief. I was simply driven to know as much as possible about Christianity and the Bible. Sorely lacking a solid education, I began to read history as well, so that a proper perspective of man's journey to God could be more fully understood. \n \n But when a historical fact didn't square with Biblical truth, a thorn would XXXXX my mind. Despite learning many of the modern apologetics, the festering continued. I won't bore you with the years of searching, wandering, and brain-racking that ensued. Well into my late forties, I threw it all away, only to snatch it back time and again in sheer fright and panic, and then finally to peacefully bury it. \n \n So what was this physical experience I had? How could I have been so wrong, when I was so absolutely sure? I believe it is a universal experience which can be described as a \"Eureka moment\". Buddha, you recall, had one under the tree, a similar \"aha!\" that wasn't about Jesus or Christianity. Science is replete with examples. These rare moments, IMO, are when thoughts you have spent considerable time pondering and weighing crystalize in your mind in one brief second, when you innately sense a great truth has been realized. \n \n I frequent these boards to test my hypothesis about religion. I've come to realize we never possess the ultimate truth. I don't want to be wrong about this issue, and so it continues to be a passion of mine. So far, Christians have not put forward any convincing arguments, but I continue to be all ears. It gladdens me to see your mind perhaps isn't as cemented as I was led to believe.",
