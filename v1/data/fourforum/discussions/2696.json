   "John Samples has written a piece on National Review Online which opines that Michael Moore's film Farenheit 9/11 may be in violation of McCain/Feingold campaign finance laws if the film is advertised and shown 60 days before the Republican National Convention or the general election. Whatever one thinks of the film (and I don't think much of it to say the least) this is an illustration of the absurdity of the law. I know many people have supported McCain/Feingold to get the money out of politics but it is having a chilling effect as it clearly violates the 1st Amendment. I think this is as good an oppurtunity as any to voice our displeasure at congress and the President for making this rediculous law.",

It is not factual. It is not a documentary. Were it factual, it would be fair to present at any time. However, it is political BS intended to bash Bush and help the libs win. I agree with its being banned until after the election, as long as it is presented as fact.",

Although some (if only a limited view) of the things portrayed in the movie are actually factual, most Americans (who are misinformed or underinformed about politics, government, etc.) believe all of what Michael Moore says just because it's a documentary. In reality, most of it isn't true and is propoganda, but they believe what they see. How about you and I come out with a documentary that just tells complete lies about Kerry and Edwards? If Michael Moore (by the way, he should get on the same Subway diet as Jared) can do it, why can't we. He is a fat, ugly, sick individual who has no life. Did anyone see Bowling for Columbine. Quite possibly the worst film ever.",

If I could make a movie, I wouldn't call it a documentary unless I could prove that all the information presented was factual.\n \n I would not waste my money or support Moore by paying to see his garbage. I form my opinions of his work after it is reviewed by trusted, intelligent people, such as Dave Kopel. However, I know what to expect from Moore...he has proven his untruthfulness before.",
