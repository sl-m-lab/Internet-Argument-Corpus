   "I'm collecting some information and I was wondering if some of you could help me out.\n \n I'm looking for other texts that have information similar to the seventy week prophecy that can be found in Daniel 9. The idea that unbelievers in the Judeo-Christian God do not believe in this kind of prophecy is irrelevant. The fact is the detailed prophecy is there for us to examine, and I'm wondering if the Bible is unique in this regard or not. I'm familiar with the quatrains of Nostradamus. Are there any other texts that you know of that are worthy of examination?\n \n To be specific, the features of the seventy week prophecy include the following:\n \n 1. the language is clearly prophetic (\"know and understand that from the going forth\" of event X to event Y, Z will happen)\n \n 2. specific numbers and timeframes (7,62,1 weeks)\n \n 3. specific players although identity unknown (messiah and people of the prince)\n \n 4. applies to specific place (Jerusalem)\n \n 5. the prophecy is at least 2000 years old and there are at least 100 people in the world who think it has been fulfilled (I used 100 to allow for lesser known texts to have a fair shake in this analysis)\n \n There are other features of this prophecy, but these alone should narrow the field.\n \n Any input?",

Some don't even involve Jerusalem at all. There is arbitrary start dates, arbitrary end dates, and enough vagueness that even people who think that it was trying to foretell Jesus disagree on how it was fulfilled.",
