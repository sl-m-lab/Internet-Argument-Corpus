He showed it to me. He said 'Eddie, get one of these,'\" said the friend, Edward Perkovic.\n \n Allegheny County Sheriff William Mullen could not be reached yesterday.\n \n Mr. Perkovic said Mr. Poplawski ordered the AK-47 assault-style rifle that police believe was used in Saturday's shooting from an Internet seller. By law, the Internet seller must deliver the weapon to a federally licensed dealer.\n \n He said Mr. Poplawski had the rifle delivered to Braverman Arms and purchased it there. He also bought two pistols and a shotgun from the store's inventory, over a span Mr. Perkovic estimated at one year to 18 months.\n \n \"Every gun purchase he ever made was legal,\" Mr. Perkovic said. \"How did he pass all those background checks? Who let him have these guns if technically, legally he wasn't allowed?\"\n \n Buddy Savage, owner of Braverman Arms, said agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were at the store yesterday seeking records of Mr. Poplawski's gun purchases.\n \n Mr. Savage confirmed that Mr. Poplawski had bought guns there, but said he could not provide specifics. He said, though, that he did not know of the claim that Mr. Poplawski obtained the AK-47 there.\n \n ATF spokesman John Hageman said the bureau \"is assisting the police department in the investigation in tracking down where the weapons came from and how they got into the hands of the shooter.\"\n \n Two aspects of Mr. Poplawski's past -- his discharge from the Marine Corps in 2005 and a protection-from-abuse order obtained by his girlfriend the same year -- would not necessarily preclude him for buying or possessing guns.\n\n Poplawski bought guns through shop in Wilkinsburg",

(Like Jones, Beck recently warned viewers that \"the Second Amendment is under fire.\") Concluding the interview, Fox News' Napolitano announced \"it's absolutely been a pleasure\" listening to Jones' insights. \n\n Media Matters - Glenn Beck and the rise of Fox News' militia media",

   "Even if what you claim is 100% accurate and factual, that's hardly an excuse. Using a single person as an example to judge the entire population is intellectually dishonest; such a practice was used in the United Kingdom after the Dunblane Massacre.\n \n You really don't want to start down this road of \"one person used as a measuring device to judge everyone else in the nation\" because you're gonna regret the outcome. Going by the same logic you support, one could look at the VT killer and come to the conclusion that absolutely every last asian in the world wants to kill people for no rhyme or reason; logic like that lead to the World War Two internment camps.\n \n Or we could look at how many crimes are committed by black people, or members of the mexican drug cartel, and use that as evidence that for our own safety we should become an all-white nation and kill absolutely everybody else of foreign descent.\n \n So...do you really wanna use that kind of logic? Do you wanna hold up one particular person of a whole group and use them as evidence for how the entire group should be wiped out? That kind of thinking lead to six million jews being slaughtered in the name of racial purity.",
