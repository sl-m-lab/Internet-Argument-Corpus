   "Have the decency to help bury us.\n \n The Health Insurance Industry Death Panels, of course:\n \nOctober 11, 2009\n Indigent Burials Are on the Rise\n By KATIE ZEZIMA\n Coroners and medical examiners across the country are reporting spikes in the number of unclaimed bodies and indigent burials, with states, counties and private funeral homes having to foot the bill when families cannot.\n \n The increase comes as governments short on cash are cutting other social service programs, with some municipalities dipping into emergency and reserve funds to help cover the costs of burials or cremations.\n \n Oregon, for example, has seen a 50 percent increase in the number of unclaimed bodies over the past few years, the majority left by families who say they cannot afford services. \"There are more people in our cooler for a longer period of time,\" said Dr. Karen Gunson, the state's medical examiner. \"It's not that we're not finding families, but that the families are having a harder time coming up with funds to cover burial or cremation costs.\"\n \n About a dozen states now subsidize the burial or cremation of unclaimed bodies, including Illinois, Massachusetts, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Most of the state programs provide disposition services to people on Medicaid, a cost that has grown along with Medicaid rolls. \n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/11/us/11burial.html\n \n Good golly! After all, this is America where the greed of the health insurance industry and the pharmaceutical industry cause about 45,000 Americans to die every year. Something like 122 Americans die every day because of their greed.\n \n The very least they could is help bury their victims.\n \n After all, the unaffordability of health care in America is what's causing millions of Americans to declare bankruptcy every year, to cause these Americans to end up on the rolls of the indigent.",
