I find it not in the least surprising the independants seem to be moving away from McCain.\n\n \n See the bolded? That's precisely what so many like about her. Why do you think so many have shown so much enthusiasm for her while showing none for Hitlery? It's because it isn't about just supporting any woman, but a rational, proven, common sense and qualified woman. NOBODY every enters the Whitehouse fully prepared to run a Nation of 300 million people, and the massive economy and military which this Country has become. But to deny that the people on the McCain Ticket have experience that far out weighs what Obama offers is simply to kid oneself and to be in stubborn denial of the facts.\n \n You say how's that? McCain spent 22 years in the Military, learning the principles of battle field tactics, teamwork, leadership skills as a Lieutenant Commander and military strategies, both in real time experience and as a graduate of the US Naval Academy. Now, add to that 20+ Years in the US Senate and he has a well rounded understanding of how to apply all of the real life experience he has acquired in his life. \n \n All Obama has is 3 years in the Senate in which time he has not passed even one Bill, and has 2 of those three years running for President. Prior to that he spent 7 years in local politics in Illinois being groomed by veteran politicians for larger things, but again, never standing for any issues or taking any stands on anything that would cause him to commit to either side of any issue. He voted present 130 times rather to commit even to Bills which his fellow Democrats supported overwhelmingly. Now, that's what I call planning for the future, huh?\n \n You see, that's what you get with a politician that is in it for higher office rather than a servants heart to actually serve the people he was elected to represent. Obama is a true poser who has never accomplished anything of consequence other than writing 2 biographies in order to create a false image of who he wishes he was. He has no moral principles to which he is dedicated other than the liberal principle that he wasn't even willing to commit to when he thought it would limit his political future. \n \n The same could be said for Joe Biden who has spent 35 years entrenched in the insider politics of the democratic party. Never ever having the guts to vote independent of the party elite who promised to take care of him as long as he sold them his soul and his vote on a daily basis. No more need be said about ole joe because everyone knows he's just an empty suit. Nice job looking forward, into the future of politics Barrack, by picking a dinosaur for a running mate. \n \n Now Sarah Palin on the other hand does have a true history of accomplishments going back to her days on the local PTA and town Council of her home town. You have all heard the old saying that the cream always rises to the top? Well, she defines that saying. At every level of public service she was pushed forward into higher office and no matter how badly your side wants to minimize her accomplishments at every level of Alaskan politics, you can't deny that for an 80% approval rating to exist that she has moved across party lines to be admired by a majority of Alaskan's that is unheard of in any other State in the Union. \n \n Every Alaskan just received a check for 1646.00 if my numbers are correct. This Natural Gas pipeline that is being built now has been attempted for decades and every other more experienced Governor has failed to make it happen. She has actually promoted and signed ethics legislation into law that the old boy democrats hated to see happen. I don't know that the word maverick truly describes John McCain as accurately as it could, but it definitely does describe Srah Palin to a T. \n \n And that is why the Obama camp and the ravenous LEFT is so afraid of her. Precisely because she is the real deal. Unlike Hitlery who is also a manufactured poster child of marxism/liberalism. She stands for nothing more than winning and attaining as much personal power as she can garner from the sheeple who worship at the feet of her idolatrous self engrandizement.

   "Here's the link to the Rasmussen Poll I told you about. It gives some good numbers which are just a glimpse of what public opinion was prior to the 5th of september. By tomorrow, we will have the official post convention numbers to see what kind of a true bump the McCain ticket receives. As it stands now, both Presidential candidates are about dead even. \n Palin Power: Fresh Face Now More Popular Than Obama, McCain\n Friday, September 05, 2008 Email to a Friend\n \n A week ago, most Americans had never heard of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. Now, following a Vice Presidential acceptance speech viewed live by more than 40 million people, Palin is viewed favorably by 58% of American voters. The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 37% hold an unfavorable view of the self-described hockey mom.\n The figures include 40% with a Very Favorable opinion of Palin and 18% with a Very Unfavorable view (full demographic crosstabs are available for Premium Members). Before her acceptance speech, Palin was viewed favorably by 52%. A week ago, 67% had never heard of her.\n The new data also shows significant increases in the number who say McCain made the right choice and the number who say Palin is ready to be President. Generally, John McCain's choice of Palin earns slightly better reviews than Barack Obama's choice of Joe Biden.\n Perhaps most stunning is the fact that Palin's favorable ratings are now a point higher than either man at the top of the Presidential tickets this year. As of Friday morning, Obama and McCain are each viewed favorably by 57% of voters. Biden is viewed favorably by 48%.\n There is a strong partisan gap when it comes to perceptions of Palin. Eighty-nine percent (89%) of Republicans give her favorable reviews along with 33% of Democrats and 59% of voters not affiliated with either major party.\n http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_20082/2008_presidential_election/palin_power_fresh_face_now_more_popular_than_obama_mccain",

   "This isn't a Poll result directly, but it is a result of viewer feedback. As for those who would argue that the News Media has been biased towards Obama and against McCain, here is the undeniable evidence. NBC has received so much criticism, and even from within their own house that they just removed Chris Mathews and Keith Olberman as commentators of their respective shows. Here's the link and an excerpt from the article: \n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/08/AR2008090800008_pf.htmlMSNBC Drops Olbermann, Matthews as News Anchors\n By Howard Kurtz\n Washington Post Staff Writer\n Monday, September 8, 2008; C01\n \n MSNBC is removing Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews as the anchors of live political events, bowing to growing criticism that they are too opinionated to be seen as neutral in the heat of the presidential campaign.\n \n David Gregory, the NBC newsman and White House correspondent who also hosts a program on MSNBC, will take over during such events as this fall's presidential and vice presidential debates and election night.\n \n The move, confirmed by spokesmen for both networks, follows increasingly loud complaints about Olbermann's anchor role at the Democratic and Republican conventions. Olbermann, who regularly assails President Bush and GOP nominee John McCain on his \"Countdown\" program, was effusive in praising the acceptance speech of Democratic nominee Barack Obama. He drew flak Thursday when the Republicans played a video that included a tribute to the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, saying that if the networks had done that, \"we would be rightly eviscerated at all quarters, perhaps by the Republican Party itself, for exploiting the memories of the dead, and perhaps even for trying to evoke that pain again. If you reacted to that videotape the way I did, I apologize.\"\n \n Matthews, who has criticized politicians in both parties, drew less criticism for his convention role but became a divisive figure during the primaries when he described how he was inspired by Obama's speeches and made disparaging remarks about Hillary Clinton, for which he later apologized.\n \n In May, MSNBC President Phil Griffin said in an interview that during live events Olbermann and Matthews \"put on different hats. I think the audience gets it. . . . I see zero problem.\"\n \n But NBC News journalists, who often appear on the cable channel, did see a problem, arguing behind the scenes that MSNBC's move to the left -- which includes a new show, debuting tonight, for Air America radio host Rachel Maddow -- was tarnishing their reputation for fairness. Tom Brokaw, the interim host of \"Meet the Press,\" said that at times Olbermann and Matthews went too far.",

After all, we know everything, right? emoticon_rolleyes One common generalization amongst political forums is that the people who post on them all the time, both left and right, assume they know absolutely everything about everything and everyone else is a dumbarse.\n \n But I got some truth for you. (As usual.) Open wide and say ahhhhhh.....\n \n It is groomed and marketed propaganda that formulates yours/ours opinions. The biggest trick is to make us believe we are thinking for ourselves when we are all victims of this orchestrated media delusion. My bet is that neither candidates even remotely resemble the image that has been created of them. You and I are simply the fodder of Strategists and Public Relations Firms. They will determine what you believe. And we will gobble up the propaganda, that we find to be the most palatable, to our particular tastes. \n But in the end, it's still just propaganda.\n \n Forum sites such as these are littered with posts and opines from various bloggers, disregarding the polls that do not agree with our prideful opinions and accepting of the polls that do agree with our beliefs/delusions. Then, as time passes, we will find ourselves often validating the same poll, that we dismissed in the past, as soon as that poll reports to us what we want to hear. \n \n Regardless who wins, nothing measurable will change, most likely. But the right to vote will quench the masses, giving us the false illusion that we actually have some say over the direction the rich and powerful will make us travel. \n \n Look at Iraq. The place has gone to, and will keep going to, hell in a handbasket. But that's ok. They got to cast their vote and got a purple thumb in return! Where I vote, they give us a \"I Voted\" smiley face sticker. (No purple thumbs.) We all go behind the curtain and pull the lever for our team. And then we all go home satisfied that we are living in a free society.\n \n Meanwhile, behind the curtain, the wizard is still pulling all levers that actually matter.",

I truly believe in a shadow government that reaches across National borders and manipulates events around the World. \n \n So you have outlined the problem well, but you have offered no solution at all. What are we to do as common men and voters? Should I stay home and allow a Socialist who is dedicated to disarming our Military Nuclear Arsenal and creating a larger Government which will be paid for by taxing the people through higher prices we will pay to the Corporations which he will punish for making a profit? This leftist doesn't even understand the economic principle that corporations raise prices to offset costs. So He doesn't get that by taxing corporations will raise prices for the consumers.\n \n So given the facts that you laid out, it changes nothing. The Right still opposes the principles of the Left, and those principles are very real and even valid, in spite of the unknown powers that be who manipulate the events and boundaries we must live within as the powerless citizens with nothing more than that single vote.",

   "Just 2 points in rebuttal. #1, it remains a statistical fact that blacks make up a pretty steady 12% of the National population.\n\n You are correct, but we were discussing Southern states, which have a higher percentage of African Americans than the national average, and when it comes to the electoral college, the demographic breakdown in individual states is more relevant than the nationwide numbers.\n \n \nSo if every black in America votes for Obama, they still don't represent a majority of the popular vote.\n\n Right, which is why I brought it up in the context of the region, not nationwide. If every black in Georgia voted for Obama (not saying it will happen, just playing off of your hypothetical), and a modest number of whites voted likewise, Obama would win that state handily.\n \n \nAnd #2, the results I posted are post convention poll numbers. That's post BOTH conventions. \n\n State polls tend to lag a bit behind national numbers. I'd be interested in seeing where those numbers are in about a week.",

   "You are correct, but we were discussing Southern states, which have a higher percentage of African Americans than the national average, and when it comes to the electoral college, the demographic breakdown in individual states is more relevant than the nationwide numbers.\n\n \n Can you show 1 southern state which has even a 40% margin of blacks? Or a 30% margin for that matter? But really, it doesn't matter at all, because the Democratic primaries proved my point perfectly. And that is that within the democratic party, when the race was between 2 people. The blacks voting for Obama along with the whites that voted for him, soundly defeated Hillary. Remember, that was only democrats voting. Republicans had nothing to do with those numbers. Yet now, with all the polls that are taking place, the republicans are ahead almost across the board. So the democrats voting for Barrack alone isn't enough to take him over the top.\n \n \nRight, which is why I brought it up in the context of the region, not nationwide. If every black in Georgia voted for Obama (not saying it will happen, just playing off of your hypothetical), and a modest number of whites voted likewise, Obama would win that state handily.\n\n \n I disagree with you fervently that under those circumstances he would win handily. Georgia, like most States has pockets of blacks in some of the large cities. But even there they don't outnumber whites across the board.\n \n \nState polls tend to lag a bit behind national numbers. I'd be interested in seeing where those numbers are in about a week.\n\n \n But we're on the second week past the second convention. The numbers have evened out and McCain is still ahead. But let's see what happens with next weeks numbers. I'll be shocked if we see Obama ahead again in this race.",
