   "Because a nameless person here doesn't understand erosion due to falling asleep in every science class since 3rd grade, here's a basic understanding of it via wikipedia. \n \n Erosion is displacement of solids (soil, mud, rock and other particles) by the agents of ocean currents, wind, water, or ice by downward or down-slope movement in response to gravity or by living organisms (in the case of bioerosion).\n \n Erosion is distinguished from weathering, which is the decomposition of rock and particles through processes where no movement is involved, although the two processes may be concurrent.\n \n Erosion is an intrinsic natural process but in many places it is increased by human land use. Poor land use practices include deforestation, overgrazing, unmanaged construction activity and road or trail building. However, improved land use practices can limit erosion, using techniques like terrace-building and tree planting.\n \n A certain amount of erosion is natural and, in fact, healthy for the ecosystem. For example, gravels continuously move downstream in watercourses. Excessive erosion, however, does cause problems, such as receiving water sedimentation, ecosystem damage (including dead fish) and outright loss of soil.\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion\n \n And for the even less educated and intelligent, Here's a KID'S SITE!\n \n BREAK IT DOWN\n Erosion is the process that breaks things down. As far as we're concerned, erosion is the breakdown of the continents and the land around you. The overall effect of breaking down and weathering the land is called denudation. Denudation is the process of erosion. In nature, large things are broken down into smaller things. Boulders become sand. Mountains are rained on and become hills. The pieces of the mountain become smaller pieces and go down the sides of hills. Weathering and erosion always happen in a downhill direction.\n \n Erosion is an easy idea to understand. If you see a rock, pull it out of a mountain. Then throw it down on the ground. You are now a part of the erosion of that mountain. You have taken a big object (a mountain) and started to make little objects out of it (a rock). When that rock hit the ground, it could have cracked and made some tiny pieces of rock (sand). Erosion is just that easy. When it rains, the same process happens. Rocks are washed down a mountain or down a stream. Soils are washed away. The ocean beats against a cliff and breaks it apart. They are all examples of denudation. \n \n Things don't just disappear. The masses of dirt and rock are moved to another form and place. Scientists call it mass wasting. The wasting is the loss of matter in one place.\n \n Mass wasting can happen two ways:\n 1) mechanical, similar to breaking a rock with a hammer; and\n 2) chemical, similar to pouring acid on a rock to dissolve it.\n \n A surefire way to tell what is happening is to check the color of the rock. If a boulder breaks because of frost, you won't see a color change. If you see rock that has been near the ocean, you may observe color changes because it is oxidizing. \n \n http://www.geography4kids.com/files/land_erosion.html",

   "And you're probably one of those kooks who thinks the colorado river carved the Grand Canyon over millions of years, right?\nHorseshoe Bend is not in the Grand Canyon. It is in Glen Canyon.\n \n Do you know what a meander is? Apparently not. Meanders are characteristic of slow flowing rivers over relatively flat land. This is a real problem for creationism, since they claim that the Grand Canyon was formed by the rapid runoff of water from Noah's FLUD. And yet, in Glen Canyon and the Grand Canyon there are many meanders.\n \n However, we do know what rapid runoff of vast amounts of water looks like. An excellent example are the channeled scablands of Washington state. That runoff doesn't resemble the Grand Canyon in the slightest.\n \n With only a little knowledge one will realize that the Grand Canyon could not have possibly been created in about 4,000 years. Really! Show me the huge wave ripples in the land scape. Show me the potholes caused by the Kolks. Show me the plunge pools from massive water falls. Show me the braided patterns of runoff caused by a vast runoff of water. Any of those features around the Grand Canyon? Not a single one.\n \n Also, please explain the presence of scorpion and lizard tracks that have been found in strata that are well down in the wall of the Grand Canyon. If the deposits of the Grand Canyon were created by FLUD deposits, how is it that desert aeolian deposits, complete with sand dunes, exists in the wall of the canyon.\n \n Please explain the presence of the several limestone deposits in the wall of the canyon. Limestone is never formed as the result of a flood (or a FLUD). Nor is aeolian sandstone, complete with wind ripples and tracks of desert animals.\n \n And that doesn't even begin to address the occurrence of limestone over shale over sandstone found in the Tonto group in the lower canyon. Of course, above that are various other layers of limestone, shale, and sandstone.\n \n It is moronic to assert that the Grand Canyon was deposited and eroded in only a matter of 4,000 years.",
