   "The Newsweek scandal regarding the Quran has reinforced my perception of that magazine's bias against the military and its civilian chiefs...A \"journalist\" was permitted to publish false statements regarding military personnel abusing the Quran and this made headlines around the world....\n \n As of this writing, 15 people are dead....Newsweek then delayed printing a retraction, and defended its position that this was a responsible article of unimpeachable integrity....When finally forthcoming was treated as a minor story.......Where is the public outrage against this behavior?\n \n Dan Rather learned the hard way to ensure the truth of his assertions.......Like Dan Rather the journalist at News weeek published his article without proof of the facts he quoted......He should receive the same treatment as Dan Rather, and the editors that passed this garbage on should be fired......\n \n Until the news media of all types, print or electronic, whether conservative or liberal, deal only in the truth they can't be trusted........Samuel Clmens was right, \"There a lies, damned lies, and statistics\".\n \n The American public, left or right, liberal or conservative, desserve hard facts, not editorial opinion in disguise........\n \n VOICE OF REASON E8\n US NAVY, RETIRED",

   "I think the liberal, lock-step anti-American press finally stepped over the line this time or as David Gergen pointed out last night on Hardball, the \"tipping point\" has been reached with the American people. The \"elite\" or \"mainstream media's\" credibility is at an all time low. Virtually no one believes what they have to say. So we turn to alternative sources and the internet to find out what is actually going on. I get news on the internet that won't show up in the establishment media for up to 48 hours and then it is regurgitated from the wire services; most of which are defacto allies of the terrorists.",

   "where is the outrage aganist the british, Russian and Middle Eastern sources that reported the same thing 11 months ago? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Vor, merely because you are too cowardly to deal with your previous asseration doesn't mean that because you make a new thread about the same thing it goes away. \n \n if Newsweeks has a liberal bias, why did they fail to report bad bush policies?",
