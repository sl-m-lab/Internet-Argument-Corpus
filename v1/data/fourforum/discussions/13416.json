   "Feminists for Choice alerts us to a new Oklahoma law (yes, law, not \"proposed legislation\" or \"some kind of sick joke\") set to go into effect Nov. 1 that would collect detailed data about each abortion performed -- and post it all on a public Web site.\n \n Whether or not the law survives a current lawsuit, experts say, anyone tracking antiabortion legal strategy nationwide needs to keep a watchful eye on Oklahoma.\n \n According to proponents of the law, this extensive abortion data -- which will include the reason the procedure was sought -- will help health officials prevent future abortions. Yeah, I can see that. Because the requirement itself would scare the **** out of me. \"They're really just trying to frighten women out of having abortions,\" Keri Parks, director of external affairs at Planned Parenthood of Central Oklahoma, told Broadsheet.\n \n The required questionnaire (see PDF of entire law), practically as long and elaborate as eHarmony's (and containing fishy questions such as \"Was there an infant born alive as a result of the abortion?\"), does not include the name, address or \"any information specifically identifying the patient.\" But opponents argue that the first eight questions alone would be enough to out any woman in a town of 200 or smaller.\n \n Also, doctors failing to provide this information would face criminal sanctions and loss of their medical license.\n\n The details of your abortion online? - Broadsheet - Salon.com\n http://ftpcontent.worldnow.com/griffin/NEWSon6/PDF/0909/hb1595.pdf\n \n Holy cow! :eek\n Talk about an invasion of privacy!",

If someone was identified than hire that person as a PI because that's pretty tough. \n \n \nYou don't get it.\n This isn't about getting the person's \"account information\", but rather getting an ID match off of the profile information.\n People are going to have MORE INFO on situations than JUST what PayPal gives them.\nI could get more information from the 4forums profile than what this website is giving.\n \n \nFirst of all, I did research it. You just insist on valuing the research of companies that are in bed with the company BEING researched.\nIf by research you mean federally required submitted data that would be fraudulent to post inaccurately then yes, I value that. \n \n \nAlso, I showed multiple times in that thread where you were not even reading my posts. Just tossing out that menial \"I don't understand your point\" junk like you playing dumb would somehow strengthen your position.\nAre you watching me with a camera or something?

   "We've already been over this.\n I quoted the section that specifies the info to be posted.\n I've been over THE INFO that they talk about, and how that info can EASILY be used to identify an abortion recipient if people are not comatose...\n\n \n If you're read it then you know that the info isn't available to the public in its raw form. \n \n\n Above and beyond that, you CONTINUE to ignore simple arguments (trying to pretend that me repeating MY OWN arguments are somehow a \"strawman\") while offering menial excuses which are easily refuted.\n \n\n \n You haven't refuted anything. You continue to claim that the info will be publically available just because it will be collected on a government server. That doesn't make it PUBLIC. There are lots of secure servers linked to the internet. I'm on one now.\n \n\n And you refuse to try to follow up...\n \n 1) This is PRIVATE DATA that the government has NO BUSINESS mandating be reported in the first place.\n They have NO GROUNDS for violating patient / doctor confidentiality and demanding such information regardless of how much they try to avoid \"not specifying\" who it was.\n \n\n \n I don't necessarily disagree with you on this point, but I'm not fluent enough in the goals of the program to give an informed opinion. In general, I don't favor big brother meddling into my personal affairs, but there are exceptions, particularly related to health concerns such as epidemics, warnings, etc., \n \n\n 2) Again, I reference back to the gun issue.\n You yourself REFUSED to post your data online, yet you insist abortion participants provide their information...\n Shows an INCREDIBLE double-standard on your part.\n \n\n \n See, this is where your red herrings are exposed. Me posting my gun info to a public server isn't the same as a doctor posting a patient's info to a secure server. \n \n\n 3) What is the legitimate state interest in violating doctor/patient confidentiality in the first place?\n Throughout this whole discussion NOT ONCE have I heard a REAL justification for this legislated invasion of privacy IN THE FIRST PLACE.\n \n\n Every time a doctor sends a bill to Medicare or Medicaid he's violating doctor/patient confidentiality in your opinion. But, you give the doctor permission to share that info with third parties when you sign your HIPPA(?) consent form.\n \n\n They can say \"we're hiding who it is\" all they want, but can you give me ANY reason for why they have ANY right to demand INDIVIDUAL MEDICAL information?\n If it were aggregate, we would be in a different ball-park. I do get that, although obviously not all of my concerns would be addressed.\n But demanding INDIVIDUAL data is reprehensible and without a point, other than some obvious ones already established in the article.\n\n \n Uncle Sam, in this case, Uncle Oklahoma, is requiring the raw data from doctors which in turn is being stored on a secure server with limited access, as outlined in the bill. The raw data will be used by the authorized Dept of Health personnel to generate public reports in which all of the identifying info has been removed...again according to the bill.\n \n The only issue that needs to be addressed is why. And like I said above, I don't know all of the bill's history and what problem they are trying to solve, but it sounds like there are several goals. Here's my speculation for the why:\n 1. To identify quack doctors\n 2. To provide a mechanism for addressing botched abortions through legal measures\n 3. To gauge the number, type and demographics of those receiving abortions\n 4. To determine if abortion is being used as contraception\n 5. To determine the cost of abortions to the state/insurer and patient\n Are these justification enough for their intrusive questionnaire, I don't know.",
