The general concept was that his parents taught him to be that hateful. At least these girls are able to put it to some kind of art form. I have heard that Hitler getting turned down from being an Artist is what made him really snap. Of course, I wasn't there. (I would think good thing too.) Now if anyone can prove this information wrong or a little bit false, let me know, but I have never really tried or cared to get inside the head of a mad-man.",
