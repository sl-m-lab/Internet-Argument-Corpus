   "Scott Wright was fixing the emergency brake on an old Cadillac in a parking lot near Willow Glen last year when the San Jose police rolled up. Within minutes, he had been shot with a Taser and beaten with batons, breaking his arm.\n \n The cause of the trouble? Wright reached into his van to wash his greasy hands.\n \n Police said they feared he was going for a weapon, but no weapon was found. Wright was charged with resisting arrest, but the district attorney dismissed the case before it got to trial.\n \n What happened to Wright is no isolated event. Hundreds of times a year interactions between San Jose police and residents where no serious crime has occurred escalate into violence.\n \n Many times the reason for the encounter is as innocuous as jaywalking, missing bike head lamps, or failing to signal a turn. But often, as the incidents develop, police determine the suspect is uncooperative and potentially violent and strike the first blow.\n \n While many of those incidents raise questions about whether the police response was excessive, the department almost always dismisses such complaints about its behavior and limits public scrutiny of the cases, moves that tend to heighten distrust of the department, particularly in minority communities.\n \n Last week, the Mercury News disclosed the existence of a cell phone video documenting one such confrontation between police wielding batons and a Taser and college student Phuong Ho, who police said was\n Advertisement\n Quantcast\n resisting their instructions. It is rare for such a video to come to light, but allegations of excessive force are far from uncommon.\n \n In recent months the Mercury News has reviewed 206 court cases in which the most serious charge against the defendant was a violation of California Penal Code section 148, the misdemeanor crime of resisting arrest or delaying or obstructing a police officer. Of those, 145 - 70 percent of the cases - involved the use of force by officers.\n \n The review was launched following the April disclosure by the newspaper that San Jose charges far more people with resisting arrest, compared with its population, than any other major California city, and that a disproportionate number of those charged are Latino residents. State and county statistics show San Jose police charge people with resisting arrest, as the primary charge, three times a day on average.\n \n Police chief Rob Davis and other officials defend the department practices and say their officers are trained to show restraint. They caution that comparisons with other communities can be misleading.\n\n Mercury News investigation: San Jose police often use force in resisting-arrest cases - San Jose Mercury News\n \n This isn't the first time I've come across this nonsense.\n Cases where \"Resisting Arrest\" is BOTH a charge, AND the supposed REASON for the arrest.\n It's logically nonsensical. You can't be guilty of resisting arrest, AND have the reason for arrest being the resisting arrest...\n :xbanghead",

   "\n If the police want to talk to me, do I have a responsibility to talk to them regardless of the situation.\n\n \n No, not regardless of the situation, for instance if talking to police would violate your fifth ammendment rights.\n \n \nThere is a difference between \"obstructing\" and refusing to cooperate when a person doesn't have to.\n\n \n Very true, unfortunatly the article you posted doesn't give near enough detail on the specific incident mentioned to determine which is the case.\n \n \nTake the story for example. Was there any crime going on?\n Is there any responsibility on a citizen's part to persuade a cop that he is not partaking in a crime, when there is no crime that the cop can see being violated (or had reported of being violated) in the first place?\n\n \n What you don't seem to understand is that whether or not a crime was being commited is entirly irrelevent. If a person is impeading a police officer in the commission of his duties he can be charged with \"resisting arrest\". Example: A police officer is sitting in his car at McDonalds eating a hamburger, if you park your car so that he can't pull out and then refuse to move it, you can be charged with \"resisting arrest\" even though no crime or violation was in progress untill you blocked his car. Even if the only thing the officer was going to do was go back to the station and punch-out, you are impeading him in his duties.\n Say a officer comes up to you and says \"Police, put you hands on top of your head\" if you don't do it you are in violation of 148. It matters not if you were commiting a crime. The police officer may have gotten a call that you were or in some other way had reason to believe you were.\n I'm not going to comment on the specifics of the incident with Scott Wright because there isn't remotely enough information in the article.\n \n \nIf there is no reason for the cop to be involved in the first place (no ticket / no arrest charge), then \"resisting arrest\" as a solitary charge is illogical.\n\n \n Simply untrue.\n \n \nAnd the charge \"obstructing justice\" would be applicable in conjunction with \"resisting arrest\" in other scenarios (as covered in your description).\n\n \n No, offense but this statment demonstrates you lack of understanding. Your using the terms \"obstruction of justice\" and \"resisting arrest\" and stating that they are seperate charges. They are not. These actions are all covered under CA penal code 148 and as such are the same charge. A person that runs away from a cop trying to arrest him is charged with the same violation as a person who lies to the cop about which way he went or a person who refuses to say which way he went. All of these actions are violation of 148. \"Resisting arrest\" is a small part of the law but most often the term used as a title for it.\n \n The point being: your statement that it is illogical for the only charge to be \"resisting arrest\" is simple not true.",
