I do believe, however, that the procreative potential of sex must be respected. I do believe that when a being comes about as the result of a sexual act then that being should be respected.\n\n There are many activities that people engage in which have a chance of resulting in unwanted consequences. For example, if you choose to walk in a bad neighborhood where you know you have a chance of getting mugged and indeed you do get mugged, does that mean you gave your consent for being mugged? \n \n There are various types of consequences - some which hurt only yourself and some which hurt others. I agree that, in most cases, if one willingly engages in an activity that has a chance of causing harm to others then one must face up to ones responsibilities. However, in the case of an accidental pregnancy, you are assuming that, right from the start of the pregnancy, there is an \"other\" involved - another person with rights. That is where most of us would disagree. What specific characteristics would you claim that newly fertilized egg has that are so critical that it should have so strong rights as to overcome a woman's right over her own body? The only characteristics I see that it has are:\n 1) It has a complete set of human DNA - i.e. it is a human cell\n 2) It is starting to grow and divide and eventually will become a human, if nature or humans do not interfere with that growth - i.e. it has the potential to become what we all see as a person.\n \n Neither of those characteristics are sufficient in my mind and apparently in mosts people's minds to view that as a person deserving of legal rights. This balance changes later in the pregnancy but here we are talking about the very start.\n \n So, I repeat my question to you: What SPECIFIC characteristics do you value so much in the newly fertilized egg?",

Deal with it - its how I feel.\n \n \nThere is nothing that devaluates women in asking them to take responsibility for their actions. I would ask nothing less of a man. I don't ask this of a woman because she is a woman. I ask this of her because she is part of the sisterhood/brotherhood/family of the human race.\n\n \n No - you devalue them by asking them to take responsibility even when it wasn't their actions, by making attempting to make decisions for them, by trivializing their circumstances, and by demonizing their choices.\n \n \nPlease explain and elaborate. They give consent to taking part in an act known to produce babies but they go not give consent to the possibility of becoming pregnant?\n\n \n This has been explained to you before Max. I may get mugged if I walk after dark in my neighborhood. Just because I do so does not mean I accept that I deserve or have to be mugged.\n \n \nWhat are you accusing me of?\n\n \n Misogyny; devaluing and trivializing the lives of women who can bear children.\n \n Not only are you pro-life to a fault - (even for rape victims, little girls, incest victims, the mentally ill, the learning disabled, the severely addicted, the poverty stricken who can't get to a doctor, the afraid, the sick and the alone), you spout taking responsibility - but don't even approve of that half the time. You do not approve of birth control, sterilization, or adoption. You and your stupid man pope value women by what comes out of their womb and little esle. In your would either we are mothers, nuns or expected to remain alone (for few men will commit to a celebate woman). You options for the woman that does not wish to mother are damned bleak and tell me you hold little regard for those who make that choice. \n .",

   "I have one question, and I'll admit first that I didn't read every post in this fiery topic, so if it's been asked plz forgive me/shout at me/curse me/whatever:\n Is it fair that a man can (and to me should) be held liable to support a child he may not want, when he helped create it, but is not allowed to have a say in whether that child is aborted or not, should he not want it to be?\n This topic is confusing for me. I'm personally opposed to abortion, but I don't really feel there should be laws prohibiting it either. Mainly I feel confused because I'm not a woman, so can't give birth, and sort of feel like no man should tell a woman that she must carry a baby through term.\n But, I also think that an honorable person would carry a baby through term, and give it up for adoption before aborting it.\n Throw in the variables of rape/incest and I have to leave the table, cuz I can't possibly say what I'd do or feel unless I were in that position. God help me and my wife/daughter/girlfriend/friend/whoever if I ever am. We'll need all the help we can get. One thing I'd despise, at that point, tho, would be any other person telling me what I could or couldn't do.\n\n \n \n Actually, many pro-choicers share your view. THEY DONT LIKE ABORTION, they just think that forcing a woman to do whatever with her body is wrong.",

   "You have spoken of the fetus a few times as if you believe it to be the property of the woman. Is this an accurate observance?\n \n \n \n Yes, why don't we abolish the death penalty? I have no problem with that. However, there is a striking distinction between most of those undergoing the death penalty and those being killed in the womb--one of them usually has committed a heinous crime.\n \n Why would we stop violence in the streets if we allow violence to take place in the MOST INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP ON THE PLANET???...THAT BETWEEN MOTHER AND CHILD IN THE WOMB...THAT BETWEEN MOTHER AND COMPLETELY VULNERABLE, COMPLETELY INNOCENT CHILD IN THE WOMB?? Why do people not value other's lives? There are many reasons. I can't help but think that one of them might be the lack of respect for life in the womb. But again, I have no problem with directing resources to the worthy endeavor of curbing street violence.\n \n If you capital punishment and street violence are wrong then lets work to end them. But don't justify another wrong--abortion--with these wrongs. Don't justify another violent act--abortion--with the prevalence of the violence of capital punishment and street violence.\n \n \n The politicians' views should reflect the peoples' views. I think there are a lot of pro-life people out there. I also think you neglect the role that laws would play in shaping the thinking of our nation and preventing the desire for abortion. I still don't buy your assertion of overpopulation.\n\n \n \n Now you're being a hypocryte. Listen to yourself, you speak of the fetus as a helpless little creature about to be murdered by its bearer. Thats completely wrong and innacurate, and you accuse me of speaking of the fetus as property.\n \n There are a lot of nazis out there too, there are a lot of white supremicists and skinheads out there, does that mean we should become a racist dictatorship, just because some of the people want it that way?\n \n Since you think of the fetus as a real human, im going to be talking about real humans. Most people on death row are sick people, and ill raised. You might've done the same in their position, or maybe not. You never know, but no matter how much of scumbags they are, we cannot kill them, or were scumbags also. Look how much you care about the fetus, no matter how unwanted it is. Why dont you have the same position for REAL, fully formed human beings being caged and slaughtered like dogs?\n \n \n The fetus is not really a human yet, its more like a frog with a tail and gills. Its will be a human soon, but nevertheless, it is not yet. When the human starts to take its form, in late term in the pregnancy, then its rights come into play, but before then it is not anything more than a body part of the woman's.\n \n If someone is in your house, and you are feeding them and giving them shelter, then they can kick you out if they want.

   "Yes. Perhaps I should have said, \"I give thanks that we agree with each other.\" That would have been more politically correct. I applaud you for your work and your motherhood.\n \n Ideas that are in direct opposition with tolerance...Do mothers that abort their babies \"tolerate\" them? Is violently killing a fetus and removing it from one's body \"tolerance?\"\n \n \n \n Of course consent is relevant in my stance on abortion. Consent to an activity which results in a living human being should have the thought process of responsibility for one's actions. We get into problems when we live only for the moment and don't think of the consequences of our actions. One giving consent to this very important act should also take responsibility for one's actions. Responsibility is often demanded of us in this life--pretty much in every aspect of life from childhood. Rape cases are a small number of abortion cases so the consent issue in consensual sex is important. Both arguments are valid--consent and respect for life. I do not have to isolate the two. \n \n There is nothing that devaluates women in asking them to take responsibility for their actions. I would ask nothing less of a man. I don't ask this of a woman because she is a woman. I ask this of her because she is part of the sisterhood/brotherhood/family of the human race.\n \n \n Please explain and elaborate.

Or you consented to being beaten because you annoyed someone. Heck, you talked to them, so that must mean that you consented to it. I'll be Im consenting to having a ceiling tile fall on my head in an earthquake, because I live in Southern California. Does that mean I consented to dying because I live in SoCal?",

In September 1945, Dr. Joseph Nathan-who represented the Hebrew Commission-stated \"Above all, we acknowledge the Supreme Pontiff and the religious men and women who, executing the directives of the Holy Father, recognized the persecuted as their brothers and, with great abnegation, hastened to help them, disregarding the terrible dangers to which they were exposed.\" In 1958, at the death of Pope Pius XII, Golda Meir sent an eloquent message: \"We share in the grief of humanity. ...When fearful martyrdom came to our people, the voice of the Pope was raised for its victims. The life of our times was enriched by a voice speaking out about great moral truths above the tumult of daily conflict. We mourn a great servant of peace.\" \n \n Note also the Catholic League's Ad in the New York Times on April 10, 2001. All it does is run quotes from the Times newspaper articles and editorials from the 1940s--and they are favorable descriptions of the Church's role.\n \n For a supreme example of the Church's work in WWII look into the life of Maximilian Kolbe--a Catholic priest martyr of Auschwitz who gave his life for another after he had been helping to hide Jews previously:\n \n http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/saintm01.htm\n \n And don't forget Edith Stein--a Jewish convert to Christianity who became Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross--another martyr to the Nazis. \n \n http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/saintt05.htm",

I think your pope - in particular this one (the last one was a little better) is great big DINK.\n \n \nYes. So do I.\n\n \n What are your first thoughts? Why do you suppose poor women might need to seek abortion more often? Come on - you seem bright - give it go. \n \n \nYou lack imagination if the killing of the child is the only \"conceivable way\" you can find of alleviating the problems a baby might bring. There are many other options for those going through abortion. And the consent issue is a very minute number of pregnancies again.\n\n \n I don't believe it is the only conceivable way of alleviating the problems. But you don't like most of my solutions.\n \n Help programs for women who are pregnant need to address more than their pregnancy needs - for women are more than a pregnancy. Affordable health care. More comprehensive FMLA. Ways to protect scholarships, education plans, etc. that may otherwise negatively impacted by pregnancy. Teens should be talking to poor parenst about the struggles of parenting. They should be talking to AIDS patients. They she should see up close and personal the impacts of sex. Thorough comprehensive sex education that stresses abstinence but provides information on all kinds of birth control. Accesible, privately obtained birth control for any female of child bearing age. Teach kids self respect. Stop teaching girls that men are the center of the universe. (Are you married yet? - why won't you get married again? - are questions I heard more than I ever heard - how is school going? - how about work?) As long as we measure the success of woman on whether she has a man - it will lead to sex. I also think it would help to push open adoption more. And rape and incest needs to be an exception. No child should have to endure pregnancy and no woman shoudl be forced to carry the responsibility of a pregnancy that she did not consent to. Health concerns besides immenent death also need to be measured. (i.e., not a good idea to take a serious schizophrenic off their meds if it will mean they try to fly off a bridge later....)\n \n Now, I know you don't like half of what I have suggested above, but you have to come to terms with the fact that you are not going to make the women of the world a bunch innocent Catholic girls who are either chaste, nuns, or are married and perpetually happy to potentially be a mother. You have to meet this in the middle if you REALLY want to do reduce abortion. Laws and the pipe dream that we will all share your faith isn't going to do a damned thing to help.",

   "I don't believe it is the only conceivable way of alleviating the problems. But you don't like most of my solutions.\n \n Help programs for women who are pregnant need to address more than their pregnancy needs - for women are more than a pregnancy. Affordable health care. More comprehensive FMLA. Ways to protect scholarships, education plans, etc. that may otherwise negatively impacted by pregnancy. Teens should be talking to poor parenst about the struggles of parenting. They should be talking to AIDS patients. They she should see up close and personal the impacts of sex. Thorough comprehensive sex education that stresses abstinence but provides information on all kinds of birth control. Accesible, privately obtained birth control for any female of child bearing age. Teach kids self respect. Stop teaching girls that men are the center of the universe. (Are you married yet? - why won't you get married again? - are questions I heard more than I ever heard - how is school going? - how about work?) As long as we measure the success of woman on whether she has a man - it will lead to sex. I also think it would help to push open adoption more. And rape and incest needs to be an exception. No child should have to endure pregnancy and no woman shoudl be forced to carry the responsibility of a pregnancy that she did not consent to. Health concerns besides immenent death also need to be measured. (i.e., not a good idea to take a serious schizophrenic off their meds if it will mean they try to fly off a bridge later....)\n \n Now, I know you don't like half of what I have suggested above, but you have to come to terms with the fact that you are not going to make the women of the world a bunch innocent Catholic girls who are either chaste, nuns, or are married and perpetually happy to potentially be a mother. You have to meet this in the middle if you REALLY want to do reduce abortion. Laws and the pipe dream that we will all share your faith isn't going to do a damned thing to help.\n\n You mean you believe in a program that \"stresses abstinence?\"\n \n But you have hit on THE KEY thing when you say that the woman's success should not be measured by if she has a man (though marriage and relationships between man and woman are noble endeavors). Women and men must know that they have some intrinsic worth!...a worth dependent on nothing besides the fact that they are a human being given a gift of life. And if this woman sees her own intrinsic value, maybe, just maybe, some of these pregnancies in bad situations can be avoided. If men see these women as having intrinsic personal worth then things will be even better--I strongly assert that the use of artificial contraception, condoms, and other forms of birth control severely undermine this premise. It allows the physical to cloud the personal worth of women and women are the victims. \n \n If we can get women to see their own intrinsic worth, men to see their own and that of women, then maybe, just maybe... we will all begin to realize the intrinsic worth of every human being brought into existence...even those in the womb...even those who result from rape and incest. Maybe then we will see all motherhood as a privilege and gift not a worry and a burden...even in the most dire circumstances...even in the most dire circumstances maybe joy can come from pain.\n \n I believe that you have some form of belief in God. I know that you have studied Christianity and perhaps some other religions. Do you believe that your God has a hand in creating you? If so, do you give him any proprietary rights over you and your body and the actions you take with it?",

Which was this - I believe there are many things that we can do to reduce abortion and I would like to see them happen. But - to quote myself;\n \n You have to come to terms with the fact that you are not going to make the women of the world a bunch innocent Catholic girls who are either chaste, nuns, or are married and perpetually happy to potentially be a mother. You have to meet this in the middle if you REALLY want to do reduce abortion. Laws and the pipe dream that we will all share your faith isn't going to do a damned thing to help.\n \n Wishing people into your moral code will not work. Forcing it will not work. People are not all going to have the same faith or values as you. There is no power on the universe that will make that happen. You HAVE TO meet us in the middle or this problem will continue.\n \n A few things about your \"worth\" argument.\n \n Of course I think abstinence should be stressed for KIDS. But I am not naive enough to believe that they will all be abstinent. That would be like me wishing that it won't snow in Mid-December (I live in MN) - to the point of not providing my son with a winter coat.\n \n I also don't believe in stressing abstinance for adults. Grown-ups can decide all by themselves whether or not to have sex and why. And nobody's worth is tied to whether or not they choose to have sex or why. Whether pregnancy/motherhood is a gift or a burden is damned irrelevant if you can't afford a doctor or food.\n \n As to your question - I am happily agnostic. I have no desire to define the devine - for when we do is when we start to get ugly. There is no place in my heart of life for scripture or dogma of any kind.",

   "Max - it's nice that you got SOME of what I said - however you missed the main point. Which was this - I believe there are many things that we can do to reduce abortion and I would like to see them happen. But - to quote myself;\n \n You have to come to terms with the fact that you are not going to make the women of the world a bunch innocent Catholic girls who are either chaste, nuns, or are married and perpetually happy to potentially be a mother. You have to meet this in the middle if you REALLY want to do reduce abortion. Laws and the pipe dream that we will all share your faith isn't going to do a damned thing to help.\n \n Wishing people into your moral code will not work. Forcing it will not work. People are not all going to have the same faith or values as you. There is no power on the universe that will make that happen. You HAVE TO meet us in the middle or this problem will continue.\n \n A few things about your \"worth\" argument.\n \n Of course I think abstinence should be stressed for KIDS. But I am not naive enough to believe that they will all be abstinent. That would be like me wishing that it won't snow in Mid-December (I live in MN) - to the point of not providing my son with a winter coat.\n \n I also don't believe in stressing abstinance for adults. Grown-ups can decide all by themselves whether or not to have sex and why. And nobody's worth is tied to whether or not they choose to have sex or why. Whether pregnancy/motherhood is a gift or a burden is damned irrelevant if you can't afford a doctor or food.\n\n Just tell me straight if I'm not going to win Miss Congeniality. I can take it like a man.\n \n You have exposed me. My secret agenda to take over the world is out in the open. I will NEVER REST until all women in the world are transformed into innocent Catholic girls who are either chaste, nuns, married and perpetually happy to be a mother. Can you say UTOPIA?\n \n When you provide your son with a winter coat do you try to find the warmest, highest quality coat? Or do you put a windbreaker on him for a Wisconsin winter? Do you hand him the coat and say, \"Here's your coat but I know you won't wear it.\"\n \n There is no contented middle when lives are being lost as they are in abortion--there is only middle in the sense of a point on a pathway to achieve a final destination. There is no middle when you have a view of sex as being an intimate, loving union with another human being, reflecting the intimate, loving union with mankind and God. There is no middle when you believe there is a Truth out there to be found. There is no middle when your kid's life is at stake with the risk of teenage pregnancy, STDs, cervical cancer, emotional turmoil, baggage for love in later life...abstinence can protect against all of these, contraception and condoms put up a smoke screen of protection that quickly dissipates.\n \n Abstinence applies to everyone-adults and kids. There is a reason the sexual act is called \"making\" love. It becomes the love of two people embodied. You make your love into something, into somebody. Love creates. This is one reason the sexual act is much more than a physical act and why it is so important to protect it as something more than physical. It is a reflection of God's great love for us-a love so great that he embodied it. He created us as a soul embodied. That's why homosexuals should not attempt to have children with surrogates and also why contraception shouldn't be used. They should not attempt to have children because having children is an act of love-a concrete sign of two persons' love-a sign to the world-a sign of God's fruitful love. A child is an embodiment of its parents love for one another. It is abstract love brought into the physical-just as Jesus was abstract God/Love brought into the physical. It is love with a face, a person of love, a personal love...Homosexuality and contraception deny this personal, fruitful love that takes part in the wonderful creation of God.\n \n Let me re-present what I wrote so it is not misrepresented any longer. Please read these words again Jito:\n \n \"Women and men must know that they have some intrinsic worth!...a worth dependent on nothing besides the fact that they are a human being given a gift of life. And if this woman sees her own intrinsic value, maybe, just maybe, some of these pregnancies in bad situations can be avoided. If men see these women as having intrinsic personal worth then things will be even better--I strongly assert that the use of artificial contraception, condoms, and other forms of birth control severely undermine this premise. It allows the physical to cloud the personal worth of women and women are the victims. \n \n If we can get women to see their own intrinsic worth, men to see their own and that of women, then maybe, just maybe... we will all begin to realize the intrinsic worth of every human being brought into existence...even those in the womb...even those who result from rape and incest. Maybe then we will see all motherhood as a privilege and gift not a worry and a burden...even in the most dire circumstances...even in the most dire circumstances maybe joy can come from pain.\"\n \n I am not wishing or forcing people into my moral code. I am presenting my moral code, founded upon objective truth, with practicality. I am debating to change minds and change the world. We can do that. We have free will. \n \n Do not confuse things and put words into my mouth or take away things as is so often done with what I write. I am not saying that the ideal is the only way. We can look at the world and see that that is obviously not the case. I am, however, unequivocally saying that there IS an ideal...and that it IS the BEST way...that there is a RIGHT and GOOD way, that there is a better way. I am not afraid to say it, though it may be reduced to condescension and patronizing. \n \n You seek to destroy the ideal even when its very practical implications can be seen in the upholding of the traditional family, abstinence, opposition of abortion, etc. You have told me of your family life with your father and of your life with your \"husband.\" Perhaps this broken love you have experienced pushes you into rebellion against the ideal. Don't destroy the ideal because you weren't able to experience it. Then again, none of us experience the ideal. There is only one way to experience the ideal--in Christianity--which is where we can see perfect love-not only did Jesus tell us how to love-but he showed us. We must try. We are to embrace the ideal and strive for it-\"be perfect as my father is perfect.\"\n \n \"There is only one really startling think to be done with the ideal, and that is to do it.\" G.K. Chesterton in What's Wrong With the World.\n \n If you believe abstinence is important and you instruct in the benefits of it...if you believe teenagers are able to grasp those concepts...but then you show them that you don't believe they can achieve it by giving them compromises like condoms and artificial birth control then you might as well not even talk about abstinence. \"Here's a great message guys but you can't handle it. You are not motivated or strong or intelligent enough to embrace the message I am giving you...You do not have enough self-respect, self-esteem, and maturity to protect yourself from men who want you only for pleasure...You do not have enough kindness and fortitude to respect a woman for more than her body and the pleasure she can give your body...Here's a great idea, a great way to live, but YOU WILL FAIL AT IT. So take this, it will keep you out of SOME of the physical trouble of pregnancy...well SOMETIMES it will, but many times it will fail even at that...most of the time it will protect you from STDs...we won't talk about the emotional, psychological, and love consequences outside of the physical realm that you might experience. Sex is only biology. Let your body be biological.\" Can you say, \"Self-fulfilling prophecy?\"\n \n The gift of pregnancy and motherhood is MOST relevant when one cannot afford a doctor or food. For it is at that time that a mother must fight and struggle for the gift because of its worth. It the gift is not recognized then it will be given or taken away unnoticed. It is at that very moment that she must realize it is a gift...one that has no price...a gift with rewards that will outweigh the physical, emotional, psychological, and financial stresses that she will endure to nurture it. She cannot give up if she believes in the intrinsic worth of each human being. \n \n \nAs to your question - I am happily agnostic. I have no desire to define the devine - for when we do is when we start to get ugly. There is no place in my heart of life for scripture or dogma of any kind.\n\n I thought at one point you told me you were reading the Christian Scriptures to investigate what was there. Maybe that was a long time ago in your history as my arch nemesis. (You tie with simone in that ranking, by the way).",

   "I don't believe all people who are pro-life are patronizing to women. I know, from my conversations with him, that Max is. Despite his kind demeaner fewer posters make me angrier than that man.\n\n I make you angry? Good, I am having an effect on you. If you were wallowing in apathy then I would be disappointed. Chesterton used to say something to the effect of \"I love to argue but I hate to quarrel.\" He meant that he loved to debate but meant no one ill will. After the debate everyone remained friends (or can we at least be acquaintances?) A quarrel, on the other hand was an event where one wished another harm and tried to inflict that harm. This is why G.K. Chesterton debated people like H.G. Wells and Bernard Shaw with ferocity, lack of mercy in destroying their position, lack of compromise, strong langueage, wit, and humor. But he considered both men to be good men, friends--they were good intentioned but misinformed. :) \n \n \nWell - he needs to revisit the law books and reality. If I did not have a choice about these things there would be no debate. But even if abortion were criminalized I would have a choice. It is my body after all. And Max not only opposes abortion - he opposes sex outside the Popes nosy freakin blessing, birth control, complete sex education, single women who aren't nuns and adoption. He would have all women tucked away in a patriarchal marriage happily pounding out a baby a year since that is our value in his eyes. \n\n The state is an extension of the people... \"of the people, by the people, for the people\"...so if the people believe a wrong is being committed then they can move the state to act against it.\n \n If you ever read Pope John Paul II's writings on sexuality then you will find that this celibate man knows more than the average sexually active person about sex and human relationships. Try any of Christopher West's stuff on the pope's Theology of the Body.\n \n \nIf my neighbor attaches his or her self to my body and sucks up my resources and potentially threatens my and my familie's well being without my consent and refuses to leave for the better part of a year - I will off him or her if need be as well.\n\n One of the dramatic pronouncements of Christianity, one of its most difficult challenges...\"Love your neighbor as yourself.\" I can think of no closer neighbor than the child in the womb.",

And just because one gives birth does not been they have contributed, for I have seen more than one woman give birth who is about as useless as tits on a bull. Being a good mother is a gift - giving birth is biology.\n\n You love your super cool amazing groovy talented smart son but don't believe the ability that allowed him to develop and you to nurture him and bring him into this world has anything to do with love? You don't believe it a gift? (Don't confuse this as me saying that pregnancy is all roses with no trials as many have done in the past).\n \n I do believe you when you speak of the hardships of your pregnancy. I don't believe you when you say it is insignificant, meaningless biology. Because I don't believe that you don't believe in love. It all comes down to love. Love in sex, love in pregnancy, love in marriage, love in every dealing every day with other persons. I don't believe you can't see the supernatural qualities of love (and I don't believe Simone can't either).\n \n I don't believe that you believe pregnancy and delivery to be only biology. I don't believe that you don't believe that a mother can pat her belly and be overwhelmed with love for the being inside of her. I don't believe that you think a mother wouldn't feel a kick and feel a connection at the same time. I don't believe that you believe a mother would complete a delivery as she completes a pee. I don't believe that you believe she would not be moved and touched by the sight and sound of her baby. I don't believe that you believe that the sacrifices of pregnancy wouldn't form an even closer bond between mother and child. I said that motherhood was a gift, motherhood occurs through the trial and joy of pregnancy. (Hey, maybe I can sell this to Hallmark).\n \n You wouldn't name your son, \"Just Another Pee\" or \"Birth #1\" or \"Biology 101.\" You give him a name and you know him by name. He is a unique personal being-he is not simply biology. So if the thing being birthed is a person, if the person giving birth is a person, if our interactions in life are personal, then I'm not sure why birthing that thing would be simple, impersonal biology. That's the beauty of the Christian God, he is a personal being. It's not just a rote, touchy-feely expression to say he knows us by name. It is a significant point. A point to determine how we deal with him and how we deal with all others...a point that should affect how we deal with sex and its power to create another person. \n \n You asked Steve:\n \n \nWhat is this romantic value that lifers place on being able to give birth?\n\n There is much in the romance of birth...foremost is something I already mentioned--to see your love for and with another being be formed into a being of love. JPII would say that the marital act is prophetic in this sense--the action of love foretells of the fruit of that love-- When two become one body/one flesh in the marital act then two become one body/one flesh in a child. The child is an embodiment of two people's love and that child carries on that love. \n \n To aggravate you again with Chesterton, he said that \"the supreme adventure is being born.\" He meant that life is a gift. Even the smallest trifles in life are joys--adventures--something to be thankful for. Second to being born, I would say that giving birth might be most adventurous. \n \n EVERY BREATH IS A GIFT, LIFE IS A GIFT, MOTHERHOOD IS A GIFT",

Despite any good done by the church, I am DONE - done with the homophobia and mysoginy - done with hearing from loving Christians who to love, how to love and that my family has never been up to par. I am sick of the bloodshed in the name of organized religion and your's has its share. I am through with it. Period. It utterly digusts me. \n \n \n Pope John Paul II: I think he was an interesting man. I appreciate that he was able to build bridges between different cultures and faiths (something the new pope seems to be screwing up royally). However, I don't care one iota what he thinks about sex, and I do not share his/your faith. (Thomas Kretchmann looked so cute playing him in that movie about his life tho - sigh - crush).\n \n \n Pregnancy: Hated it. \n \n Can I be clearer? I would have been deligted if someone had dropped my son on my lap upon his 9th month and I would not have shed one tear for those nine months.\n \n And to this:\n The gift of pregnancy and motherhood is MOST relevant when one cannot afford a doctor or food. For it is at that time that a mother must fight and struggle for the gift because of its worth. It the gift is not recognized then it will be given or taken away unnoticed. It is at that very moment that she must realize it is a gift...one that has no price...a gift with rewards that will outweigh the physical, emotional, psychological, and financial stresses that she will endure to nurture it. She cannot give up if she believes in the intrinsic worth of each human being.\n \n :xcensored Are bleedin serious? Just when I think you might have a brain you come up with this? A starving woman without access to medical care isn't going to realize \"the gift of motherhood\" - she and the fetus are likely to end up DEAD. \n \n Please do sell it to Hallmark - I sure as ain't buying.\n\n Jito,\n Do you believe in love? Shooter (and maybe simone) says she does not.\n \n Did you love your son while he was still in the womb or did your love begin at birth?\n \n What do you think of the romance of two people's love being so profound that it would motivate a life-long committment and an act that would embody that love in a new being?",

The way you wish to force YOUR individuality and opinion on everyone else just sounds absurd to me. Keep in mind that you may be wrong about lives being taken away, just keep that in mind.

   "\"The suffering of the poor is something very beautiful and the world is being very much helped by the nobility of this example of misery and suffering,\" said Mother Teresa. \n\n http://www.mukto-mona.com/Articles/mother_teresa/sanal_ed.htm\n \n \nHITCHENS: The care facilities are grotesquely simple: rudimentary, unscientific, miles behind any modern conception of what medical science is supposed to do. There have been a number of articles - I've collected some more since my book came out - about the failure and primitivism of her treatment of lepers and the dying, of her attitude towards medication and prophylaxis. Very rightly is it said that she tends to the dying, because if you were doing anything but dying she hasn't really got much to offer. \n \n This is interesting because, first, she only proclaims to be providing people with a Catholic death, and, second, because of the enormous amounts of money mainly donated to rather than raised by her Order. We've been unable to audit this - no one has ever demanded an accounting of how much money has flowed in her direction. With that money she could have built at least one absolutely spanking new, modern teaching hospital in Calcutta without noticing the cost. \n \n The facilities she runs are as primitive now as when she first became a celebrity. So that's obviously not where the money goes. \n \n FI: How much money do you reckon she receives? \n \n HITCHENS: Well, I have the testimony of a former very active member of her Order who worked for her for many years and ended up in the office Mother Teresa maintains in New York City. She was in charge of taking the money to the bank. She estimates that there must be $50 million in that bank account alone. She said that one of the things that began to raise doubts in her mind was that the Sisters always had to go around pretending that they were very poor and they couldn't use the money for anything in the neighborhood that required alleviation. Under the cloak of avowed poverty they were still soliciting donations, labor, food, and so on from local merchants. This she found as a matter of conscience to be offensive. \n \n Now if that is the case for one place in New York, and since we know what huge sums she has been given by institutions like the Nobel Peace committee, other religious institutions, secular prize-giving organizations, and so on, we can speculate that if this money was being used for the relief of suffering we would be able to see the effect.\n \n http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/hitchens_16_4.html",

If what you have done is not noble and is merely due to instincts then how is what the other humans doing \"twisted?\" \n \n Are they not merely acting on their instincts? \n \n Which are the true instincts--yours or theirs? How do we know?\n \n Do you have any control over your instincts? Is your nobility simply an automated action? Is their twisted action automated?\n \n If you decry and detest the judgment Christians make on morality and against certain actions then how do you dare to call others twisted? Are you not judging? Are you not tolerant? Are you better than they? \n \n Are you acting rich in instinct and action and calling them poor?\n \n What do you think on what I said about Jesus' love of the rich as well as the poor?",

Suffering in the Christian view has many different purposes. From suffering can come life and salvation--Jesus showed us this.\n \n Romans 8:16-18: The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs-heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.\n \n Colossians 1:24: Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I complete what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church...",

The Catholic Church teaches that man has dominion over all of the earth and all of the animals. But we must be good stewards because the earth and animals are also creations of God.\n \n The Catholic Church teaches that humans are inherently good-they must be since God created them--God creates good. However, due to our fallen state, when we severed our ties with God through disobedience, then sin and death entered the world. So we have a tendency toward sin/bad that we must fight--the best fight being, of course, through the means Jesus came to give us--the Church and the grace of her sacraments.\n \n So are you noble or normal? Are the others normal or twisted?\n \n Did Jesus love the rich as well as the poor? Why do you discriminate?\n \n What do you mean when human population is controlled? Controlled by whom? By what means?",
