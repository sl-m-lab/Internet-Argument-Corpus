   "Phil S:\n There is a subtle way that ID advocates try to frame the debate, by\n arguing almost exclusively against atheistic & reductionistic views\n of nature. By doing so, they can firstly show how bankrupt such a\n world view is, and then secondly introduce an outside agent to make\n up for this deficiency. In essence, they separate the Designer from\n the design. The tacit assumption here is that things cannot design\n themselves or participate in their own design. Having categorically\n eliminated this 3rd possibility, they can then set up the false\n dichotomy of design vs random chance. Some will even go so far as to\n assert that \"self design\" is a self contradictory term, making it\n easy to dismiss it without having to address it at all.\n \n But I am proposing this as an alternative to design by a Designer.\n You must rule out self design before you can assume that all design\n requires an independent Designer. Here are some examples of self\n design:\n 1) Language - There is no central master mind who designs a\n language. A nation of people design language among themselves in a\n way that makes it impossible to separate the words from the speaker.\n 2) Thoughts - I design my own thoughts, but these thoughts are part\n & parcel of me.\n 3) Ecology - The complex ecological relationships that exist between\n organisms in an ecosystem are best explained by the cooperative\n input of all organisms rather than by an outside agent who\n masterminds the whole thing with a specific purpose in mind.\n \n The crux of this self design is the relationship between all the\n participants, rather than the conscious intent of an outside agent.\n In each case there is an overall coherence that naturally evolves,\n without having any premeditated endpoint. Self design, such as this,\n is done in an ad hoc manner. It always has an evolutionary history\n as it occurs in steps, and it always shows signs of imperfect\n design. Languages always have grammatical quirks. Thoughts can\n always be improved upon. The ecology of nature is a hodge podge.\n This is the middle ground between the reductionistsic view of random\n chance and premeditated design by an outside agent.",
