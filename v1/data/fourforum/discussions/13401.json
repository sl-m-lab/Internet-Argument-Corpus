(wow, there must be something wrong here as I find you agreeable here.) I think the general's role is to obey the commands of the Commander-in-Chief, and advise HIM (not the whole world in a public venue.). If Obama makes bad decisions, then he makes bad decisions and it will come back on Obama, ultimately. If the general can't deal with that--even if it's for noble reasons (seeing his troops die due to to Obama's indecision and delay)--then he should resign. It seems to me his job is to take orders, lead his men, and advise the president.\n \n However, what is frustrating is that we all know good and well that if an involved general on the ground had publicly taken issue with BUSH in this way on the Iraq war, he would have been portrayed as a hero by the Democrats and anti-war movement. And even though McChrystal was wrong in the way he went about presenting his view, he is correct in that it is taking Obama ENTIRELY too long to make decisions on Afghanistan. \n I also wonder what nasty way liberal groups like Moveon.org will portray McChrystal.

   "General McChrystal and \"The Dark Side\":\n \nNo one would have mentioned his name at all if President George W. Bush hadn't singled him out in public. Lt. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, West Point '76, is not someone the Army likes to talk about. He isn't even listed in the directory at Fort Bragg, N.C., his home base. That's not because McChrystal has done anything wrong-quite the contrary, he's one of the Army's rising stars-but because he runs the most secretive force in the U.S. military. That is the Joint Special Operations Command, the snake-eating, slit-their-throats \"black ops\" guys who captured Saddam Hussein and targeted Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi.\n \n JSOC is part of what Vice President Dick Cheney was referring to when he said America would have to \"work the dark side\" after 9/11. To many critics, the veep's remark back in 2001 fostered his rep as the Darth Vader of the war on terror and presaged bad things to come, like the interrogation abuses at Abu Ghraib and Guant\u00e1namo Bay. But America also has its share of Jedi Knights who are fighting in what Cheney calls \"the shadows.\" And McChrystal, an affable but tough Army Ranger, and the Delta Force and other elite teams he commands are among them. ...\n\n The Raw Story Did newly announced top Afghan general run Cheney's assassination wing?\n \n In regard to Pat Tilman:\n \nWhen NFL player-turned-Army Ranger Pat Tillman died at the hands of US troops in a case of \"friendly fire,\" the spin machine at the Pentagon went into overdrive. Rumsfeld and company couldn't have their most high-profile soldier dying in such an inelegant fashion, especially with the release of those pesky photos from Abu Ghraib hitting the airwaves. So an obscene lie was told to Tillman's family, his friends and the American public. The chickenhawks in charge, whose only exposure to war was watching John Wayne movies, claimed that he died charging a hill and was cut down by the radical Islamic enemies of freedom. In the weeks preceding his death, Tillman was beginning to question what exactly he was fighting for, telling friends that he believed the war in Iraq was \" [expletive] illegal.\" He may not have known what he was fighting for, but it's now clear what he died for: public relations. Today, after five years, six investigations and two Congressional hearings, questions still linger about how Tillman died and why it was covered up. \n \n Now the man who greased the chain of command that orchestrated this great deception is prepared to assume total control of US operations in Afghanistan: Lt. Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It was McChrystal who approved Tillman's posthumous Silver Star, a medal given explicitly for combat, even though he later testified that he \"suspected\" friendly fire. \n\n McChrystal's Pat Tillman Connection\n \n Lies, cover-ups and knives in the back in the dead of night...\n \n Wonderful recommendations!",

   "This will gladden the heart of the righties! They love torture. And torturers...\n \n \nMcChrystal's Men: Hunters &#8212; and Torturers?\n In February 2006, the Army Times reported that Joint Special Operations Command, as an entire branch, was in effect being promoted &#8212; and with it its commander since 2003, then two-star general Stanley McChrystal. JSOC would gain greater autonomy from its parent organization, U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCom); McChrystal would gain a third star for himself, a two-star deputy for his operation, and a mandate for streamlining an elite unit that then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had come to believe was encumbered by the traditional military practices and bureaucracy of SOCom.\n \n It was already the case that after 9/11, JSOC had evolved from a hostage-rescue role to \"door-kicking\" &#8212; that is, hunting terrorists. But under McChrystal, the transformation had gone further and deeper than before. JSOC became a focused and highly active machine. Two JSOC task forces were stationed in Iraq after the invasion, and a third operated in Afghanistan. \"You train, you train, you train, then all of a sudden you get on a plane and you go somewhere, do a mission, it's over in 36 hours and you come back,\" a source told Army Times, speaking about the nature of the branch prior to McChrystal's arrival. After he came aboard, the source said, JSOC was deployed \"24/7.\"\n \n .... In 2006, \"Jeff,\" an elite Army interrogator, told Esquire that he had witnessed the physical and mental torture of prisoners at a veiled U.S. base in Iraq. Camp Nama &#8212; short for Nasty-XXX Military Area, the joke went &#8212; was one of the primary locations where the military and intelligence agencies brought detainees suspected of harboring knowledge about Al Qaeda and the Taliban. But when Jeff questioned the legality (as well as the usefulness) of the violent techniques employed in their interrogation, he was rebuffed:\n \n It was a point of pride that the Red Cross would never be allowed in the door, Jeff says. This is important because it defied the Geneva Conventions, which require that the Red Cross have access to military prisons. \"Once, somebody brought it up with the colonel. 'Will they ever be allowed in here?' And he said absolutely not. He had this directly from General McChrystal and the Pentagon that there's no way that the Red Cross could get in &#8212; they won't have access and they never will. This facility was completely closed off to anybody investigating, even Army investigators.\"\n \n .... In 2006, Human Rights Watch released a major report based on dozens of interviews with soldiers who had witnessed the interrogation of prisoners in Iraq. \"No Blood, No Foul\" revealed that the elite forces conducting the interrogations at Camp Nama and two other locations, known (among other names) as Task Force 121, committed systematic abuse of prisoners at other facilities across Iraq, leading to at least three deaths. Whether or not he was present during the actual abuse &#8212; and it seems unlikely that he would need or want to put himself in that exposed position &#8212; as commander of JSOC, Stanley McChrystal oversaw them.\n\n Read more: Stanley McChrystal's Torture History in Afghanistan and Iraq - Esquire\n \n Systematic abuse?
