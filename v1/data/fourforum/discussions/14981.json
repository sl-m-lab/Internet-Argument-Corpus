   "Interesting op ed piece contrasting Obama to some of the Bush family and Cheney, by LZ Granderson, a gay sportswriter.\n \n \n\"Now, I'm not so cynical as to believe Barbara Bush does not believe in the words she said in her PSA supporting marriage equality in New York.\n \n Maybe George W. Bush's daughter has always supported marriage equality and finally feels strong enough to say it; maybe she has gay friends; maybe she downloaded the first season of \"Modern Family\" and decided gay people are not as scary as she thought. Who knows? I'm just happy to see her use her platform to introduce civility and fairness.\n \n But I am also aware that her little revelation follows roughly 18 months of gay rights support coming from the mouths of some fairly surprising sources. People such as former Vice President Dick Cheney, former first lady Laura Bush and Cindy McCain, wife of Sen. John McCain. I also see that despite Obama doing more for the GLBT community than any other president in this country's history, it only took a 22-second PSA to suggest he is still somehow behind the eight ball when it comes to gay rights.\n \n After all, if Bush's daughter supports gay marriage, what's Obama's problem?\n \n If Cheney supports gay marriage, what's Obama's problem?\"\n\n \n More at Bush daughter adds to Obama's problems - CNN.com",
