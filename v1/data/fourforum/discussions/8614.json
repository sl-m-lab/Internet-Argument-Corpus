   "Do you believe Jesus was in left field? YES/NO\n\n \n I'll be honest and confess I have no idea what this means. I assume it's a baseball term. If so, I'll go analogous and admit I can easily imagine Jesus at silly point.\n \n \nDo you believe you should love your enemies? YES/NO\n Do you believe you should love those who despise you? YES/NO\n Do you believe you should turn the other cheek? YES/NO\n\n \n What struck me most as I read these questions was the extreme improbability that America's Jesus-loving president - or many of his Jesus-loving supporters - could answer any of them in the affirmative.\n \n How many of the RR can lay hand on heart and swear they love Osama bin Laden?\n \n Many liberals despise Dubya and his ilk. Are they loved in return?\n \n Did Dubya counsel Israel to turn the other cheek to Hizbollah? Should he have?\n \n Are my questions wearisomely rhetorical? Of course. But I submit that they do expose the hypocritical vacuity of the original.",
