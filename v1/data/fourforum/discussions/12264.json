   "A New York State appellate court today ruled that the valid marriages of lesbian and gay couples entered into outside of New York must be recognized in this state. This decision comes in the case Lewis v. Department of Civil Service and follows a landmark victory by the New York Civil Liberties Union in Martinez v. County of Monroe.\n \n \"We commend the court on its just and fair decision,\" said NYCLU Executive Director Donna Lieberman. \"But we know that lasting progress requires leadership from both the judicial and legislative branches. It's time for New York's political leaders to support the core American value of fairness. New Yorkers should not have to leave the state to protect their families.\" Another State Appeals Court Affirms Marriages of Lesbian and Gay New Yorkers | NYCLU\n emoticon_xagree",
