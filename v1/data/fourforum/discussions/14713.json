   "A heartbreaking video to watch on Veterans Day. \n \n Veterans denied healthcare on the basis of \"pre-existing conditions,\" and conditions that weren't even pre-existing, but agreements forced upon them, even using torture.\n \n The video states that tens of thousands of American veterans have been denied healthcare on the basis of having fabricated \"personality disorders,\" even in the face of blatantly war-caused injuries (such as deafness caused by proximity to explosion, as just one example).\n \n YouTube - The Torture Hearings\n \n It's one thing for people to believe in a war, it's another thing when they deliberately evade taking care of the veterans who have fought it for them.\n \n That is not supporting our troops.\n \n On this Veteran's Day, I salute our veterans, by sharing this grave injustice to them, with my fellow Americans.",
