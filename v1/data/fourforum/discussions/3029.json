The last time I checked, both gay marriage and murder were against the law of the land. \n \n Marriage is not illegal in Mass, and it's certainly part of the US. Only 49 more states to go! Yeah!\n \n Marriage is the union of one man and one woman in my mind, and in Scripture. Next the animal rights activists will want to marry their pets. Again, our congress has the duty and responsibility to make laws for themselves and their posterity; and our children are watching. Nobody is going to force them to draft legislation to forward this madness. \n \n You can keep your mind and your scripture...it's twisted and untrue. No, animal rights activists don't want to marry their pets, that's illogical. Yes, our children are watching...hoping their fathers can marry eachother in love or their mothers can marry eachother in love. Same sex marriage is not madness, except of course, in your mind.\n \n It is nobody's business what you do behind closed doors. \n \n I agree, but if you really feel that way, when you refer to homosexual marriage, all you talk about is abomination and sex.\n \n Common sense will eventually rule the day. Those kinds of unions are becoming null and void. Like here:\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/08/12/samesex.marriage.ap/ \n \n In some places, however, in Mass, they are alive and well.\n \n Your government? Haa! The government is \"We The People.\" You keep forgetting that fact. Let's line up the professing Christians on one side, and the homosexuals on the other side. Which side is in the majority? It is not that just my religion says homosexuality is an abomination, but Holy Scripture, and the foundation for every denomination of Christianity says so. \n \n Yours, mine, ours...symantics. What about professing Christians that are homosexuals? What about them? Why does it have to be divided up into lines. homosexuality is not an abomination in the bible, just because you say it is, doesn't mean that it is. I think your interpretation is fine for you, but please don't try and convince others that God would have us believe that who we are, as God created us as homosexuals, says we are abominations because it just isn't true. I believe with spreading around those falsehoods, you could probably do some real harm to someone who doesn't know any better. As you are a bible school teacher, how do you think a gay student would feel about you teaching them that? Do you think it would be likely that they would ever darken the doorstep of a church given the choice? I think not. You are a perfect example of why I am so greatful that I am not a Christian. \n \n Congress makes the laws and our judges had better apply them accordingly. On the other hand, you and I are out here on the forum debating the pros and cons of allowing gay marriage to become a reality. You already have equal access and the same rights as everyone else. Starting a hundred new threads will not change the facts. \n \n No, we don't have the same rights and equal access that you do, if you did some research on the topic, you would understand. If we did have the same rights, there wouldn't be a conflict now would there? And just who said anything about starting a hundred new threads?\n \n By definition, a Christian nation is one founded by a majority of Christians. The USA must be the most Christian oriented country on the planet. It is because this great nation was founded by Christians that everyone has equal right to the freedoms and liberties of expression we now enjoy. And, the words of our New Testament declare that some are 'worthy of death' (Romans 1:32). \n \n Just because a majority of Christians live in the US, doesn't mean that it is a Christian nation. We are a democracy. Perhaps you could read the constitution, you've got your holy scripture all twisted up just the way you want it.\n \n My view is that professing Christians are much to passive about this homosexual business. Therefore, it is my hope that the gay rights movement will gather steam and fully develop this 'in your face' attitude. Flaunt these abominable acts in the streets outside our churches. Bring your signs and banners demanding that everyone accept homosexual marriages as legal. That is what it will take for our religious leaders to gather the support they need to silence this nonsense once and for all. The majority will vote all signs of homosexuality out of office. Then common sense will have enough votes for amending the Constitution that will define marriage as between one man and one woman. \n \n Homosexuals will never be silenced. Hitler tried to round us up and kill us off, but we are still here, we will always be part of every civilization, in every country througout the world, we are proud and we are everywhere. A lot of our religious leaders accept same sex marriages, it's the political leaders that have a problem with it and will...until they see the proper amount of dollar signs. We will never be silenced and we will never go away no matter what you think the bible says. Defining the constitution to define marriage as between one man and one woman is descrimination, something we are working to overcome.\n \n Holy Molies . . . Your side of this debate appears to gain in desperation with each post. \n \n It's not desperate to me, it makes a lot of sense. Besides, what does this statement have to do with gay rights anyway? Low blow.\n \n The USA will become secular the day that a majority of our representatives in congress are non-Christian. And that will happen when a majority of \"We The People\" stand by and allow that to happen. And that is why those with common sense and reason should continue to come out here and raise their voices against these ridiculous ideas. Same sex marriages . . . indeed. \n \n I disagree, I think the US laws are secular, they were set up that way. Same sex marriages are not ridiculous, you just say they are, that doesn't mean we believe you. We have families just like you and your folks...they deserve to be part of a family too.\n \n At the top of this post, you wanted the freedom to homosexual activity with your girlfriend. Guess what? Nobody cares. You do not need our approval, and nobody is denying you of those things. \n \n Actually she was wanting to build a family with her life partner, you just seemed to have overlooked that and focused on the sex part only.  \n GL,\n \n Terral\n\n \n I have nothing against you as person, I just think that some of the things that are stated on here are pretty hateful and discriminatory.",

   " And, the words of our New Testament declare that some are 'worthy of death' (Romans 1:32). \n\n \n \nWhich came first, the New Testiment or the Ten Commandments? \n \"THOU SHALT NOT KILL\"\n \n\n \n This is amazing. \n \n Here is the quote in context:\n God's Wrath Against Mankind\n \n 18The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, 19since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. 20For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.\n 21For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.\n 24Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen.\n 26Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. 27In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\n 28Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. 29They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, 30slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 31they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 32Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.\n \n \n So first God \"gave them over\" to their sinful lusts, then he punished them for it? Wow. God is one evil bastard. When has God's will EVER been plain to ANYONE? Not only does this passage NOT say what God's righteous decree is, it assumes that anyone that doesn't know it should know it anyway. If they don't they deserve to die. Man, if there is any hateful passage in the Bible this is it. Not only is it hateful but it contradicts anything that it also says about love and forgiveness.",

   "From a slightly different approach to interpretation, Dr. Robin Scroggs states, \"The basic model in today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model attacked by the New Testament that the criterion of reasonable similarity of context is not met. The conclusion I have to draw seems inevitable: Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not relevant to today's debate.\"B-9 [Italics his]\n \n \n \n Dr. Gomes concludes his discussion of homosexuality and the Bible with these words:\n \n The Biblical writers never contemplated a form of homosexuality in which loving, monogamous, and faithful persons sought to live out the implications of the gospel with as much fidelity to it as any heterosexual believer. All they knew of homosexuality was prostitution, pederasty, lasciviousness, and exploitation. These vices, as we know, are not unknown among heterosexuals, and to define contemporary homosexuals only in these terms is a cultural slander of the highest order, reflecting not so much prejudice, which it surely does, but what the Roman Catholic Church calls \"invincible ignorance,\" which all of the Christian piety and charity in the world can do little to conceal. The \"problem,\" of course, is not the Bible, it is the Christians who read it.B-10\n \n www.godmademegay.com",

   "Romans 1:21, 26, 27\n \n Revised Standard Version\n \n 21 for although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him...\n \n 26 For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. Their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural, 27 and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men...\n \n \n \n The King James and New International versions say virtually the same thing.\n \n \n \n Romans 1:26 and 27 clearly speak of same-gender sex by both men and women, the only passage in the New Testament that does so. Rom. 1:18-32 speaks of Gentiles (heterosexuals) who could and should have known and served and given thanks to God but would not, so God gave them up and let them do whatever they wanted to do, and that resulted in degrading and shameful acts, including same-gender sex. It is almost a moot point, but Paul is not listing sins for which God will condemn anyone, he is listing sins that occur because people have forsaken Him. These are acts committed by those who have turned away from God and so become \"consumed with passion.\" All of us recognize that those who forsake God and give themselves over to lustful living--homosexual or heterosexual--stand condemned by the Bible. This passage is talking about people who chose to forsake God.\n \n Conservative theologian Richard Hays says, \"No direct appeal to Romans 1 as a source of rules about sexual conduct is possible.\"B-6\n \n \n \n www.godmademegay.com",

   "You really have to learn to stop using fallacies. \n \n You need to learn what one is before telling me not use one because I haven't.\n \n \n \nStraw Man (Fallacy Of Extension): \n attacking an exaggerated or caricatured version of your opponent's position. \n For example, the claim that \"evolution means a dog giving birth to a cat.\" \n \n Another example: \"Senator Jones says that we should not fund the attack submarine program. I disagree entirely. I can't understand why he wants to leave us defenseless like that.\" \n \n On the Internet, it is common to exaggerate the opponent's position so that a comparison can be made between the opponent and Hitler. \n \n \n In a straw man fallacy the opponents argument is distorted, misrepresented or simply made up. This makes the argument easier to defeat, and can also be used to make opponents look like ignorant extremists.\n \n http://info-pollution.com/straw.htm\n \n This is what you're doing stating that my claims are fallacies and changing what the argument is originally.\n \n  If you don't like gay marriage...\n \n DON'T HAVE ONE \n \n No one is forcing those who don't want gay marriage to become involved in a gay relationship, let alone to marry someone of the same gender.\n Really, it's ok, I don't mind if you are heterosexual and continue to engage in heterosexual sex acts. \n Just as long as your sexual activities don't interfere with my homosexual activities.\n \n \n Justine's argument was based on behavior that doesn't interfere with someone's personal life. That a behavior should be allowed if we aren't forced to participate.\n \n My argument was that prostitution, polygamy, and cannibalism also don't interfere or are forced upon us like gay marriages.\n \n So you make the aregument that my argument is that if we allow gay marriage it will lead to prostitution, polygamy, and cannibalism whcih was not my argument.\n \n \nSlippery Slope Fallacy (Camel's Nose) \n there is an old saying about how if you allow a camel to poke his nose into the tent, soon the whole camel will follow. \n \n The fallacy here is the assumption that something is wrong because it is right next to something that is wrong. Or, it is wrong because it could slide towards something that is wrong. \n \n For example, \"Allowing abortion in the first week of pregnancy would lead to allowing it in the ninth month.\" Or, \"If we legalize marijuana, then more people will try heroin.\" Or, \"If I make an exception for you then I'll have to make an exception for everyone.\" \n \n \n First off if that metaphor is correct then it implies that homosexuality is connected to the other behaviors.\n \n Second my arguemnt wasn't slippery slope it was applying Justine's rationale about interference and personal affects.\n \n Third according to how the law is applied when a criteria is laid out then it must be applied evenly. If for whatever reason behavior such as homosexuality sets a precedence then all behaviors that fit that precedence must be recognized as well. so it may be seen as slippery slope but it actually is opening up the flood gates.

That is what it will take for our religious leaders to gather the support they need to silence this nonsense once and for all.\n\n \n Hmmm...isn't that what \"religious leaders\" did to Jesus, just before nailing him to a cross? \n \n \n The majority will vote all signs of homosexuality out of office.\n\n \n Really? Then why did they vote them in in the first place? \n \n \n Then common sense will have enough votes for amending the Constitution that will define marriage as between one man and one woman. \n \n\n \n Nope, ain't gonna happen. You see, what you fail to realize is that your Amendment...IS DEAD! \n It died a miserable little death in the Senate. \n \n FMA \n R.I.P. \n July 14, 2004 \n \n \n \nHoly Molies . . . Your side of this debate appears to gain in desperation with each post. \n \n \n \n The USA will become secular the day that a majority of our representatives in congress are non-Christian. And that will happen when a majority of \"We The People\" stand by and allow that to happen.\n\n \n \n Hmmm...someone seems to be forgetting the First Amendment again.\n \n \n And that is why those with common sense and reason should continue to come out here and raise their voices against these ridiculous ideas. Same sex marriages . . . indeed.\n\n \n Indeed! \n Just as interracial marriage was allowed, just as equal division of property through divorce was allowed...\n Who's the desperate one now? \n \n \n \nAt the top of this post, you wanted the freedom to homosexual activity with your girlfriend. Guess what? Nobody cares. You do not need our approval, and nobody is denying you of those things.\n\n \n Honey if everybody waited for your approval to engage in sexual activities Adam and Eve would be very old, dried up and lonely.\n \n \n Sorry for the late additions, I must have been very tired when I posted this, I wasn't finished with it when I did.",

   "Where will she get the dna to build this family? Will the donor have rights to visitation; father the child? Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of the Gay agenda?Terral\n\n \n Her family has already been started with the birth of her son. Just because a family doesn't have a mom and a dad in it, doesn't mean it's not a family. There are all kinds of families.\n \n As far as the Gay agenda goes, I have no idea what you are referring too...perhaps I didn't get an invitation to the \"Gay Agenda Meeting\", perhaps you did, if so, why don't you share your notes about it.\n \n Bottom line is that although you seem to have a great knowledge of the bible, you seem to be sorely lacking in knowledge about people who are not heterosexual. None of that information can be found in the bible. The bible came before the concept that 2 people of the same gender could commit to one another in love for life as partners.",

   "Oh this poor poor abused bit of scripture. It is so often ripped right out of context by unthinking and hurtful people - who is use it in a way, that if the read it in it's entirety they would see is exactly what Paul is warning AGAINST.\n \n First there is this - which has been posted here aplenty...\n \n 18The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, 19since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. 20For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse. \n 21For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles. \n 24Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen. \n 26Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. 27In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. \n 28Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. 29They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, 30slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 31they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.  32Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.  \n \n The Terrl's of this world use this as condemnation of homosexuals, like they are on some magical other side of the coin. It is however not a finger pointed at some 'other' group, it is pointed at ALL OF US.\n \n Now not everyone believes in my faith, but let me at least try to make this a tad less ugly.\n \n From nearly day one man turned from God. We became sinners. So God turned un us, left us to our own devices. Look at this scripture again - and what I have bolded. We are all in some degree guilty of sin.\n \n And here is the fun part - the part the homophobes always leave out. See Paul continues...\n \n 1You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.  2Now we know that God's judgment against those who do such things is based on truth. 3So when you, a mere man, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God's judgment? 4Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, tolerance and patience, not realizing that God's kindness leads you toward repentance?  \n 5But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God's wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed. 6God \"will give to each person according to what he has done.\"[1] 7To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life. 8But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger. 9There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; 10but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile. 11For God does not show favoritism. \n 12All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law. 13For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous. 14(Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law, 15since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.) 16This will take place on the day when God will judge men's secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.  \n \n The point? Be careful. We all have good and evil in us. And it is not for us to judge each other.\n \n Be mindful of your own keep.\n \n I have said it before - use the Bible to justify your hate and intolerance, use it as a way to defend doing harm, use it as a tool of judgement when you are but a mortal sinner and have enough problems of your own - and you are way way WAY out of line.",
