   "It seems to me that if the founding fathers of this country were very bright, and I think that they were, then their intentions to form a \"Christian Nation\" would be clearly evident in our founding documents. I mean, aside from their private writings where no indication of such intent can be found, wouldn't such intent be clear in the very documents that declared and established this country?\n \n To that end, I have examined some of the early documents, written by these founding fathers, upon which this nation was founded. First, there is the Declaration of Independence. While the view of the founding fathers was that the Declaration did not found a new nation, but rather returned the power to govern to the source, i.e., the people, this document is often cited as evidence of a \"Christian Nation\" by advocates of a repressive theocracy. The Declaration of Independence left the 13 Colonies without a legislative body and without law. As the founding fathers expressed at the time, the people were returned to the state of nature.\n \n Second, I have examined the eleven constitutions, written concurrently with or immediately after the Declaration in 1776 and 1777, which reestablished governments in ten of the newly independent states, and also established the independent Republic of New Connecticut (now known as Vermont) from the disputed territories that were claimed by Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New York. Three colonies (Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut) didn't draft and adopt constitutions until later and instead reverted to a previous charter.\n \n Third, I examined the Articles of Confederation, the initial founding document of The United States of America, The Constitution itself, and the Bill of Rights.\n \n So here are some questions about these documents. Keep in mind that the intent of the founding fathers to form a \"Christian Nation\" should be quite clear in these documents, if that were their intent.\n \n 1. The Declaration shows the intention to form a \"Christian Nation\" in that it mentions Jesus Christ how many times? a. zero, b. one, c. three, d. five.\n \n Of course, everyone knows the answer. This initial document of the United States mentions Jesus exactly zero times. A bit peculiar upon the founding of a \"Christian Nation,\" don't you think?\n \n 2. The Declaration shows the intention to form a \"Christian Nation\" in that it mentions God how many times? a. zero, b. one, c. three, d. five.\n \n I'm sure you all got this right too. God is mentioned one time. Sadly for the \"Christian Nation\" crowd, \"Nature and Nature's God\" is an expression typical of deism, written by Thomas Jefferson, an undisputed deist. The deity was typically mentioned as the \"Creator,\" or \"Divine Providence\" (also in the Declaration). The idea was the nature was established by the deity who then had no further part in the course of events - thus, \"Nature's God.\"\n \n 3. How many times in the 11 state constitutions of 1776 & 1777 is Jesus mentioned?. a. zero, b. one, c. five, d. eleven.\n \n A hint. It's more than zero. It's true. Even at the state level, in founding Christian governments, the drafters of the state constitutions failed to mention Jesus Christ more than a single time, specified in the oath taken by the legislators in a single state, Delaware. While it may not have been a Christian Nation, at least in Delaware only Christians and liars could be members of the legislature.\n \n 4. How many times in the 11 state constitutions of 1776 & 1777 is the word \"Christian\" used? a. zero, b. three, c. six, d. nine\n \n Bet you thought you had this one too. The correct answer is six times in three of the 11 constitutions. But that isn't necessarily a good thing for the \"Christian Nation\" advocates. Let's consider New York first. Article XXXV of the Constitution of New York of April, 1777 states in part, \"That all such parts of...common law, and...statutes and acts...as may be construed to establish or maintain any particular denomination of Christians or their ministers, ...are repugnant to this constitution,...and they hereby are, abrogated and rejected.\"\n \n The Constitution of Virginia of June 1776 states in Sec 16 of the Bill of Rights, \"That religion, or the duty which we owe to our Creator...can be directed only by reason and conviction...and therefore all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience; and that it is the mutual duty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other.\" That isn't really establishing a \"Christian\" government but an encouragement to the people to respect the right of each person to practice religion as he sees fit.\n \n Finally, there is the Maryland Constitution of November, 1776. Christianity is mentioned twice in Article XXXIII where it states that every man has the right and duty to worship God any such a manner as seems most acceptable to him. It mentions Christians when it specifically extends the same right to those \"professing the Christian religion.\" In that same article, the legislature is authorized to levy taxes for the support of religion. However, control of where that money is to be spent is retained by the citizen rather than being given to the established state religion. Further on, in Articles XXXV and again in Article LV, a belief in the \"Christian Religion,\" along with requirements to reject the sovereignty of the King and to swear allegiance to the state, is specified as a requirement to hold elective or appointive office. It also states that no further religious test is required. It is interesting to note that the Supreme Court found a similar provision in the Maryland Constitution unconstitutional when a man appointed as a notary public was denied that commission by a court clerk because he refused to declare his belief in God. (Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488 (1961))\n \n At any rate, here in the Constitution of Maryland we do find intent to form a \"Christian Nation.\" However, I don't think that two of the 13 states that we have found so far are enough to ascribe that view to the founding fathers from all states.\n \n 5. How many times in the 11 state constitutions of 1776 & 1777 is there a reference to the \"Creator?\" a. zero, b. four, c. eight, d. twelve\n \n Did you take a lucky guess and say eight? Then you are wrong because it is four. In the Constitution of New York of April, 1777 the Declaration of Independence is quoted, all of it. Thus, just as the Declaration contains one reference to the Creator, so does the Constitution of New York.\n \n In the Constitution of Pennsylvania of September, 1776, the form of the oath to be taken by members of the state assembly contains the word \"Creator.\" \"I do believe in one God, the creator and governor of the universe, the rewarder of the good and the punisher of the wicked. And I do acknowledge the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be given by Divine inspiration.\" It goes on state that there should be no further religious test. Here was the perfect place to specify a \"Christian Nation\" (or at least a Christian State) and it misses the mark. It doesn't require a belief in Christianity and thus, even deists could be members of the state assembly. Thus, Benjamin Franklin was not only a member, but the President of the Executive Council.\n \n Since the Constitution of Vermont of July, 1777 was an almost verbatim copy of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, it contains one reference to a \"Creator\" in the oath sworn by members of the state legislature.\n \n The single mention of a \"Creator\" in the Constitution of Virginia has already been mentioned in question 4. Remember that it was in reference to the duty to practice religion and that every man is free to do so as he sees fit.\n \n Also remember that use of \"Creator\" for the deity was typical of deists, and apparently acceptable for Christians.",

   "6. How many times in the 11 state constitutions of 1776 & 1777 is there a reference to \"God?\" a. zero, b. eight, c. eighteen, d. twentyeight.\n \n Of course, the mention of God is not an indication that one is a Christian. Such a claim would be silly in the extreme. However, the 11 state constitutions mention God a total of twenty eight times. Delaware = 2 - both times in the profession of faith for legislators. Georgia = 4 - in all cases as \"so help me God\" in the form of the oaths for various offices. Maryland = 1 - in the previously mentioned (in question 4) statement of freedom of religion from Article XXXIII. New Jersey = 1 - in a rather forceful statement of religious freedom in Article XVIII. New York = 2 - the first being the previously mentioned quote of the entire Declaration of Independence and the second being in Article XXXIX, where it prohibits ministers of religion from holding any state office. Peculiar if the intent was to establish a \"Christian Nation.\" North Carolina = 2 - once in a weak statement of religious freedom, and once in Article XXXII, where denial of God or the Protestand faith prohibits service in any state office. (So that makes 3 \"Christian Nations.\") Pennsylvania = 3 - twice in Article II, a forceful statement of religious freedom, and once in Sect. 10, in the oath taken by legislators. South Carolina = 1 - in the oath taken by legislators. Vermont = 12 - 9 are in the form of various oaths, and 3 are in the statement of religious freedom.\n \n 7. In how many of the 13 original state plus the Republic of Vermont were members of the clergy allowed to sit in the legislature? a. fourteen, b. nine, c. five, d. three.\n \n I presume that the answer is five, since nine states expressly forbade members of the clergy from being elected to the legislature. Some were more strict than others and prohibited clergy members from holding any office in government or commission in the militia. The states were Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, New York, South Carolina, and New Hampshire.\n \n 8. How many total times did the Articles of Confederation mention God, Jesus, Christian, Creator, or religion? a. zero, b. three, c. five, d. seven\n \n You're getting the hang of this by now, aren't you? Yes, it's true. The initial founding document of the United States of America, the Articles of Confederation, contained references to any of the above zero times. Wouldn't it be more logical that if it were the intent of the men who wrote the Articles of Confederation to establish a \"Christian Nation\" there would be some mention of Jesus, God, or religion?\n \n 9. How many times does the Constitution of the United States mention God, Jesus, Creator, or Christian? a. zero, b. three, c. five, d. seven.\n \n I'm sure you got this one right too. Again, the answer is zero times. It's a peculiar state of affairs for a document that is purported to establish a \"Christian Nation.\"\n \n 10. How many times does the Constitution of the United States make any reference to religion? a. zero, b. one, c. two, d. three.\n \n I know that it seems strange for a \"Christian Nation,\" but the answer is once, in 3. of Article VI. \"but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.\"\n \n 11. How many times does the Bill of Rights mention God, Jesus, Creator, Christian, or make any reference to religion? a. zero, b. one, c. two, d. three.\n \n You all got this one too, right? The answer is, of course, one time in the First Amendment. \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;\" Again, strange if the purpose was the establishment of a \"Christian Nation.\"\n \n 12. How many of the 13 original colonies had an established religion at one time or another in their history? a. thirteen, b. twelve, c. eight, d. five.\n \n Every one of them with the exception of Rhode Island. One of the final works of James Madison before he left for the Continental Convention of 1787 was to defeat a bill that would have paid \"teachers of Christian religion\" from taxes, and then to reintroduce Jefferson's religious freedom bill that essentially disestablished the Anglican church in Virginia. The last state to have an established church was the Congregational church of Massechusetts. There is a letter from Thomas Jefferson to John Adams congratulating Adams on the occasion.\n \n 13. \"Christian Nation\" advocates claim that they are correct because most of the people of the 13 colonies were Christians. In reality, according to historians, what percentage of the people actually attended any church at around the time of the Revolution? a. 75-90%, b. 50-75%, c. 20-50%, d. 5-20%.\n \n Did you guess d? Right. For example, Lynn R. Buzzard, executive director of the Christian Legal Society states that not only were a good many of the revolutionary leaders deists, but that perhaps as little as 5% of the populace were church members. Other sources (I have 5 more) place the number as low as 4% up to 10-15%.\n \n 14. True or false. The Constitution of the United States does not mention the separation of church and state.\n \n A big talking point with the \"Christian Nation\" crowd, it is true. But our Constitution is based on the principle that any power not granted to the federal government by the Constitution is reserved to the people and the states. Thus, since no religious powers are granted, the federal government has no right to legislate in religious matters. At least this is what was argued at the time of the ratification of the Constitution. Nevertheless, the First Amendment formalized the restriction on the Congress. It was actually Thomas Jefferson who stated that the purpose of the First Amendment was to erect a \"wall of separation\" between church and state.\n \n And isn't it funny that \"Christian Nation\" advocates think that it is meaningful that the separation of church and state isn't specifically mentioned, and yet have no problem with the fact that God, Jesus, and Christian Nation aren't mentioned either?\n \n 15. How many of the first 7 Presidents of the United States were Christians? a. zero, b. two, c. four, d. six.\n \n According to the Reverend Bird Wilson, an Episcopal minister in Albany, \"among all our presidents from Washington downward, not one was a professor of religion.\" Rev. Wilson, in the same sermon in 1831 asserted that the founders of our nation were nearly all Infidels, and that of the presidents who had to that time been elected, not a one had professed a belief in Christianity. Those Presidents were Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, J.Q. Adams, and Jackson.\n \n It seems to me that if it was the intention to found a \"Christian Nation\" that their intent would be quite clear. The founding fathers of at least three states had no problem in making their intentions known. To participate in those governments a citizen had to be a Christian. In others, it seems that deism would also have been acceptable. But in our \"Christian Nation\" matters of religion are dealt with only in the form of restrictions on the part of the government to interfere with the free practice of any religion. To me the intent to form a secular nation is quite clear.",

   "Well, now. Nice presentation! \n \n That being said, there are a number of holes in it, which will be tackled as time goes on. And I don't think it's accurate to argue that America was not founded as a Christian nation, since even the Christians themselves didn't want a theoracy. A nation can be comprised of a majority of Christians and at the same time not be a federally sanctioned \"Christian\" nation / theocracy. \n \n Anyway, first, you asked: \"How many times does the Constitution of the United States mention God, Jesus, Creator, or Christian? a. zero, b. three, c. five, d. seven. I'm sure you got this one right too. Again, the answer is zero times.\"\n \n That's not entirely accurate. The document was signed \"In the....year of our Lord..\" \n \n Second, you identify Jefferson as a deist. Deism was not very wide spread in those days. And in that time, a true deist was one who believed God created the universe and then sat back and (1) did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations and, (2) did not give (divine) revelation to man. In this respect, Jefferson was no deist, since Jefferson (and Franklin and others) has a number of quotations on record that takes a different position. One of Jefferson's quotations is this: \n \n \"God who gave us life gave us liberty. And can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are a gift from God? That they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just, and that His justice cannot sleep forever.\" [Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781]\n \n Of course the question is, why should Jefferson tremble and fear God's wrath if God does not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations? So let's put Jefferson down as a Unitarian and not a deist or a Christian, even though he once said, \"I am a real Christian, that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus.\" [Letter to Benjamin Rush April 21, 1803]\n \n Now, can you identify the individuals among the Signers of the DOI and Constitution who were true deists? I've never been able to get past 3-5, and that's making considerable allowances.",

   "Now, who is \"Nature's God\"?\n \n To discover what the Founders meant by the phrase \"the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God,\" we need only look at what Sir William Blackstone wrote. Blackstone defined law, in general, as a rule of action established by a superior that an inferior must obey. By example, he noted that God had established certain natural laws, like gravity, which physical things, be they rocks, plants, or human bodies, must always obey. Blackstone passed over these unalterable physical laws to focus on the laws that govern human action, the laws by which man, \"a creature endowed with both reason and free-will, is commanded to make use of those faculties in the general regulation of his behavior.\"\n \n To explain how the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God applied to human conduct and government, Blackstone began with the fact that man is created by God. The Founders chose this same starting point in the opening sentence of the Declaration's second paragraph - the paragraph that explains how the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God gave us the right to throw off British rule. Blackstone then explained that because of man's state of total dependence on God, man is obliged to restrain his free-will and should, instead, \"in all points, conform to his Maker's will.\" \"This will of his Maker,\" Blackstone said, \"is called the law of nature,\" and is the \"eternal immutable laws of good and evil\" - the rules for what is right and wrong - to which God Himself conforms. So the first principle on which the Founder's staked American independence, and freedom for the American people - \"the Laws of Nature\" - are God's own rules of right and wrong!\n \n http://www.citizensoldier.org/decfour.html\n \n \"The Laws of Nature are the Laws of God, Whose authority can be superseded by no power on earth. A legislature must not obstruct our obedience to Him from whose punishment they cannot protect us. All human constitutions which contradict His laws, we are in conscience bound to disobey.\" George Mason, 1772\n \n What did America's Founding Fathers mean when they spoke of \"the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God?\" - John Locke (1632-1704) was a Christian philosopher who had a great influence in America. He said:\n \n \"The Law of Nature stands as an eternal rule to all men, legislators as well as others. The rules that they make for other men's actions must . . . be conformable to the Law of Nature, i.e., to the will of God. Laws human must be made according to the general laws of Nature, and without contradiction to any positive law of Scripture, otherwise they are ill made.\n Locke, Two Treatises on Government, Bk II sec 135. (quoting Hooker's Ecclesiastical Polity, 1.iii, \u00a7 9 )\n \n William Blackstone (1723-1780) was cited more frequently than Locke by America's Founding Fathers. In 1810 Thomas Jefferson wryly commented that American lawyers used Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England with the same dedication and reverence that Muslims used the Koran.\n \n Blackstone described the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God in a chapter in his Commentaries entitled, \"Of the Nature of Laws in General.\" Among the highlights:\n \n \"Man, considered as a creature, must necessarily be subject to the laws of his Creator, for he is entirely a dependent being. And consequently, as man depends absolutely upon his Maker for everything, it is necessary that he should, in all points, conform to his Maker's will. This will of his Maker is called the law of nature.\n This law of nature, being coeval [existing at the same time - ed.] with mankind, and dictated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe in all countries, and at all times: no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their force and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original. The doctrines thus delivered we call the revealed or divine law, and they are to be found only in the holy scriptures. These precepts, when revealed, are found upon comparison to be really a part of the original law of nature, as they tend in all their consequences to man's felicity [happiness].\n Upon these two foundations, the law of nature and the law of revelation, depend all human laws; that is to say, no human laws should be suffered to contradict these. \n \n James Wilson, Associate Justice on the first United States Supreme Court and signer of both the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution, said:\n \n \"Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divine .... Far from being rivals or enemies, religion and law are twin sisters, friends, and mutual assistants. Indeed, these two sciences run into each other.\"\n \n \"No sovereign ought to permit those who are under his Command to violate the precepts of the Law of Nature, which forbids all injuries.\" John Jay\n \n http://members.aol.com\n \n And who was Thomas Jefferson's God? That sometimes depended on what day it was. However, Jefferson must have certainly been referring to the God of the Old Testament when he said the following: \n \n \"I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who led our fathers, as Israel of old, from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessities and comforts of life.\" \n - Thomas Jefferson\n \n In short - the concept of the \"Laws of Nature and Nature's God\" go back to the Common Law of England, which had numerous Biblical influences.",

   "What are the moral foundations of America? And where does her great strength lie? Many of the founding fathers tell us that our nation was conceived on the principles of Christianity. Not on Hinduism, not on Humanism, not on Buddhism, or the writings of Confucius or Islam, or Deism, but founded on Christianity. \n \n A few years after the Constitution was ratified by the Continental Congress, a French statesman and historian by the name of Alexis deTocqueville traveled to America to see if he could discover the source of her tremendous spirit and strength. He remarked, \"Not until I went to the churches of America and heard her pulpits flame with righteousness did I come to understand the secret of her genius and power.\"\n \n The United States of America is not only one of the greatest nations in the history of the world, but it has also now endured as its longest ongoing constitutional republic. Here are the facts that you will seldom hear mentioned in the history and political science classes of America:\n \n The greatest single source of political inspiration for the founding fathers was the Bible, which was cited in 34% of their own quotations (Origins of the American Constitution, 1987). The first mention of God as the foundation of American society was made in the 'Mayflower Compact,' dated November 11, 1620:\n \n \"....Having undertaken for the Glory of God, and advancement of\n the Christian faith, and the honour of our king and country, a\n voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia;\n Do by these presents, solemnly and mutually in the presence of\n God and one another, covenant and combine ourselves together\n into a Civil Body....\" \n \n Many of the founding fathers recognized that the principles of civil law were inseparably linked to Biblical truths. James Wilson, one of the original Supreme Court Justices, and a signer of the Constitution, explained,\n \n \"Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divine.....Far from being rivals or enemies, religion and law are twin sisters, friends, and mutual assistants....\"\n \n Even the United States Supreme Court recognized America as a Christian nation. In the case \"Church of the Holy Trinity vs. the United States\" (Feb. 29, 1892, US457-458), Justice Josiah Brewer, following a lengthy and exhaustive search of early American historical literature, commented, \"We find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth....that we are a Christian nation....\"\n \n In another Supreme Court Case, \"Zorach vs. Clauson\" (1952, US306 307 313), Justice William O. Douglas categorically stated, \"We are a religious people and our institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.\" Finally, in \"United States vs. Macintosh\" (1931, 283 US 605, 625), Justice George Sutherland affirmed that, \"We are a Christian people....affording to one another the equal right of religious freedom, and acknowledge with reverence the duty of obedience to the will of God.\"\n \n Concerning the outcome of the American Revolution, John Quincy Adams noted, \"The highest glory won from the American Revolution was this: it connected, in one indissoluble bond, the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity.\" \n \n In a letter to Thomas Jefferson dated June 28, 1813, John Adams wrote: \"The general principles on which the (founding) fathers achieved independence were....the general principles of Christianity.\"\n \n Founding father Noah Webster proclaimed much the same message when he said, \"The religion which has introduced civil liberty is the religion of Christ and His Apostles....This is genuine Christianity and to this we owe our free constitutions of government\" (History of the United States, 1832). \n \n Time after time, the founding fathers declared the same beliefs. From the archives of Patrick Henry's personal notes (handwritten on the back of his copy of the \"Stamp Act Resolutions,\" made public after his death) we read:\n \n \"Whether this (new government) will prove a blessing or a curse \n will depend upon the use our people make of the blessings which\n a gracious God hath bestowed on us. If they are wise they will be\n great and happy. If they are of a contrary character, they will be\n miserable. Righteousness alone can exalt them as a nation.\" \n \n Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said: \n \n \"Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have \n removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the\n people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are\n not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my\n country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice\n cannot sleep forever.\" (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781)\n \n \"I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we\n are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their\n native land and planted them in a country flowing with all\n the necessities and comforts of life.\" (Monday, March 4,\n 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address)\n \n Speaking of the Bible, Jefferson stated:\n \n \"A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never\n seen; it is a document in proof that I am a real Christian,\n that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus.\"\n (Jan. 9, 1816 - In a letter to Charles Thomson)\n \n And what about George Washington, the \"Father of our Country?\" Did he believe in God? Absolutely. In his first inaugural address on April 30, 1789, Washington remarked:\n \n \"It would be improper to omit, in this first official act, my\n fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over\n the universe.\"\n \n On Saturday, October 3, 1789, President Washington said this in proclaiming a day of national thanksgiving:\n \n \"It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the Providence of\n Almighty God.\"\n \n \n Still another founding father, the Reverend John Witherspoon, declared that, \"...Civil liberty cannot long be preserved without virtue....\" And James Madison, known as the \"Chief Architect of U.S. Constitution,\" offered this up:\n \n \"Cursed be all that learning that is contrary to the Cross of Christ.\" \n \n Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was also known as the \"Father of Public Schools,\" once had this to offer: \"The only foundation for a republic is...religion. Without it there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty.\"\n \n Don't miss the force of that last statement, \"....without virtue there can be no liberty.\" The principle is clear - a lack of virtue engenders bondage. As one writer noted, \"Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings).\" The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their carnal obsessions.\n \n And lastly, for now, George Washington remarked, \"If you remove religious principles from the schools you are going to lose national morality.\" \n \n So I think this provides a general flavor for the pro-God and pro-Christian elements that supported the founding of America.",

   "Well, now. Nice presentation!\nThanks. \n \nThat being said, there are a number of holes in it, which will be tackled as time goes on. And I don't think it's accurate to argue that America was not founded as a Christian nation, since even the Christians themselves didn't want a theoracy. A nation can be comprised of a majority of Christians and at the same time not be a federally sanctioned \"Christian\" nation / theocracy.\nThat's not the point even if the population of the U.S. had been Christian at that time. The point often put forward by \"Christian Nation\" nuts is that somehow the founding fathers were motivated to found this country as a \"Christian Nation.\"\n \nAnyway, first, you asked: \"How many times does the Constitution of the United States mention God, Jesus, Creator, or Christian? a. zero, b. three, c. five, d. seven. I'm sure you got this one right too. Again, the answer is zero times.\"\n \n That's not entirely accurate. The document was signed \"In the....year of our Lord..\"\nI guess you didn't notice that I didn't mention the word \"Lord\" in that question. Besides, that isn't part of the text of the Constitution that establishes any form of the government of this country. That is a quite common, pro forma date. Nothing more. \n \nSecond, you identify Jefferson as a deist.\nIndeed he was.\n \nDeism was not very wide spread in those days.\nNow you make yourself look foolish. Deism was much more common than Christianity among the educated men of the time.\n \nAnd in that time, a true deist was one who believed God created the universe and then sat back and (1) did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations and, (2) did not give (divine) revelation to man. In this respect, Jefferson was no deist, since Jefferson (and Franklin and others) has a number of quotations on record that takes a different position. One of Jefferson's quotations is this: \n \n \"God who gave us life gave us liberty. And can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are a gift from God? That they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just, and that His justice cannot sleep forever.\" [Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781]\nBut he was not an atheist but a deist. The quote is pretty typical of some of the stuff by deists. Besides, neither Jefferson nor Franklin were Christians. In fact, the greatest opposition to Jefferson's election came from Christians. The clergy preached sermons in opposition and even distributed pamphlets.\n \nOf course the question is, why should Jefferson tremble and fear God's wrath if God does not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations?\nWell, you are right that the idea of God as a punisher to be feared rather than loved is more a Christian concept than one of the deists.\n \nSo let's put Jefferson down as a Unitarian and not a deist or a Christian, even though he once said, \"I am a real Christian, that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus.\" [Letter to Benjamin Rush April 21, 1803]\nJefferson didn't become a Unitarian until after his Presidency, probably because of the influence of John Adams. But I am glad that you have read Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia. You are no doubt familiar with Jefferson's other words, \"There is not one redeeming feature in our superstition of Christianity. It has made one half the world fools, and the other half hypocrites.\"\n \nNow, can you identify the individuals among the Signers of the DOI and Constitution who were true deists? I've never been able to get past 3-5, and that's making considerable allowances.\nI never tried. Can you identify the individuals who were Christian? I've never been able to get past 3-5.",

   "Now, who is \"Nature's God\"?\n \n To discover what the Founders meant by the phrase \"the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God,\" we need only look at what Sir William Blackstone wrote. Blackstone defined law, in general, as a rule of action established by a superior that an inferior must obey. By example, he noted that God had established certain natural laws, like gravity, which physical things, be they rocks, plants, or human bodies, must always obey. Blackstone passed over these unalterable physical laws to focus on the laws that govern human action, the laws by which man, \"a creature endowed with both reason and free-will, is commanded to make use of those faculties in the general regulation of his behavior.\"\n \n To explain how the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God applied to human conduct and government, Blackstone began with the fact that man is created by God. The Founders chose this same starting point in the opening sentence of the Declaration's second paragraph - the paragraph that explains how the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God gave us the right to throw off British rule. Blackstone then explained that because of man's state of total dependence on God, man is obliged to restrain his free-will and should, instead, \"in all points, conform to his Maker's will.\" \"This will of his Maker,\" Blackstone said, \"is called the law of nature,\" and is the \"eternal immutable laws of good and evil\" - the rules for what is right and wrong - to which God Himself conforms. So the first principle on which the Founder's staked American independence, and freedom for the American people - \"the Laws of Nature\" - are God's own rules of right and wrong!\n \n http://www.citizensoldier.org/decfour.html\n \n \"The Laws of Nature are the Laws of God, Whose authority can be superseded by no power on earth. A legislature must not obstruct our obedience to Him from whose punishment they cannot protect us. All human constitutions which contradict His laws, we are in conscience bound to disobey.\" George Mason, 1772\n \n What did America's Founding Fathers mean when they spoke of \"the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God?\" - John Locke (1632-1704) was a Christian philosopher who had a great influence in America. He said:\n \n \"The Law of Nature stands as an eternal rule to all men, legislators as well as others. The rules that they make for other men's actions must . . . be conformable to the Law of Nature, i.e., to the will of God. Laws human must be made according to the general laws of Nature, and without contradiction to any positive law of Scripture, otherwise they are ill made.\n Locke, Two Treatises on Government, Bk II sec 135. (quoting Hooker's Ecclesiastical Polity, 1.iii, \u00a7 9 )\n \n William Blackstone (1723-1780) was cited more frequently than Locke by America's Founding Fathers. In 1810 Thomas Jefferson wryly commented that American lawyers used Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England with the same dedication and reverence that Muslims used the Koran.\n \n Blackstone described the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God in a chapter in his Commentaries entitled, \"Of the Nature of Laws in General.\" Among the highlights:\n \n \"Man, considered as a creature, must necessarily be subject to the laws of his Creator, for he is entirely a dependent being. And consequently, as man depends absolutely upon his Maker for everything, it is necessary that he should, in all points, conform to his Maker's will. This will of his Maker is called the law of nature.\n This law of nature, being coeval [existing at the same time - ed.] with mankind, and dictated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe in all countries, and at all times: no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their force and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original. The doctrines thus delivered we call the revealed or divine law, and they are to be found only in the holy scriptures. These precepts, when revealed, are found upon comparison to be really a part of the original law of nature, as they tend in all their consequences to man's felicity [happiness].\n Upon these two foundations, the law of nature and the law of revelation, depend all human laws; that is to say, no human laws should be suffered to contradict these. \n \n James Wilson, Associate Justice on the first United States Supreme Court and signer of both the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution, said:\n \n \"Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divine .... Far from being rivals or enemies, religion and law are twin sisters, friends, and mutual assistants. Indeed, these two sciences run into each other.\"\n \n \"No sovereign ought to permit those who are under his Command to violate the precepts of the Law of Nature, which forbids all injuries.\" John Jay\n \n http://members.aol.com\n \n And who was Thomas Jefferson's God? That sometimes depended on what day it was. However, Jefferson must have certainly been referring to the God of the Old Testament when he said the following: \n \n \"I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who led our fathers, as Israel of old, from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessities and comforts of life.\" \n - Thomas Jefferson\n \n In short - the concept of the \"Laws of Nature and Nature's God\" go back to the Common Law of England, which had numerous Biblical influences.\nBut none of that has anything to do with Christianity. None of it argues against deism.\n \n You really should educate yourself from some real literature and history. You have to be completely ignorant of facts to call John Locke a \"Christian philosopher.\"",

But you told me that Jefferson was Unitarian. There seems to be some contradiction there.\n\n \n Nope, Jefferson morphed his beliefs over time.\n \n \n In the same way, Benjamin Franklin is listed as an Episcopalian (Deist). He was a deist.\n\n \n Again, a true deist was one who believed God created the universe and then sat back and (1) did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations and, (2) did not give (divine) revelation to man. Franklin did not fit this mold. For instance, Franklin said the following during the Constitutional Convention: \n \n \"I've lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing Proofs I see of this Truth -That God governs in the Affairs of Men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his Notice, is it probable that an Empire can rise without his Aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that except the Lord build the House they labor in vain who build it. I firmly believe this, -and I also believe that without his concurring Aid, we shall succeed in this political Building no better than the Builders of Babel: We shall be divided by our little partial local interests; our Projects will be confounded, and we ourselves shall become a Reproach and Bye word down to future Ages.\" \n Speech to the Constitutional Convention (June 28, 1787)\n \n It's pretty obvious that Franklin believed in a God who did involve himself in the affairs of men and nations, and Franklin also alludes to the Old and New Testaments as \"Sacred Writings\" which also reveal God's revelation to man. \n \n \nJames Madison was a deist - there is no doubt of that, but he was also from Virginia, as was George Washington.\n\n \n He (Washington) was an open promoter of Christianity. For example, in his speech on May 12, 1779, he claimed that what children needed to learn \"above all\" was the \"religion of Jesus Christ,\" and that to learn this would make them \"greater and happier than they already are\"; on May 2, 1778, he charged his soldiers at Valley Forge that \"To the distinguished character of patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian\"; and when he resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the military on June 8, 1783, he reminded the nation that \"without a humble imitation\" of \"the Divine Author of our blessed religion\" we \"can never hope to be a happy nation.\" Washington's own adopted daughter declared of Washington that you might as well question his patriotism as to question his Christianity.\n \n In addition, the inscription on Washington's tomb at Mount Vernon is this:\n \n WITHIN THIS ENCLOSURE REST THE REMAINS OF GENL. GEORGE WASHINGTON.\" Over the door of the inner tomb is inscribed: \"I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE.\"\n \n James Madison trained for ministry with the Rev. Dr. John Witherspoon, and Madison's writings are replete with declarations of his faith in God and in Christ. In fact, for proof of this, one only need read his letter to Attorney General Bradford wherein Madison laments that public officials are not bold enough about their Christian faith in public and that public officials should be \"fervent advocates in the cause of Christ.\" And while Madison did allude to a \"wall of separation,\" contemporary writers frequently refuse to allow Madison to provide his own definition of that \"wall.\" According to Madison, the purpose of that \"wall\" was only to prevent Congress from passing a national law to establish a national religion. \n \n There's more in the following link on all this:\n \n http://www.wallbuilders.com/resources/search/detail.php?ResourceID=29\n \n \n Your little deceptive list lists the established religion of the states from which them men had come. It has not too much to do with their religious beliefs.\n\n \n That's your theory.

   "EZ is scrambling and trying to divert the discussion from the point, that being that the founding documents of this country are not based on Christian principles and did not intend to found a Christian Nation. So he wants to argue about deism without, it seems, having actually educated himself. For example, I doubt if EZ has consulted Elihu Palmer, a former Baptist minister and one of the most vocal of the deist authors of the Revolutionary period. His definition of Deism can be found HERE. For that matter, he doesn't seem to have consulted later sources such as the main Wikipedia entry on Deism either. EZ tries to make it too limited and dogmatic, just like his own particular cult of christianity.\n \n EZ also seems to be unable to grasp simple points in discussion without making huge leaps into error. For example, I mentioned that many of the signers of the Declaration of Independence and the framers of the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution were deists. EZ responds with a quote that says, \"Deists in the United States never amounted to more than a small percentage of an evangelical population.\" The point isn't the percentage of the population that were deists, it is who they were. Even the article that EZ quotes EZ had to skip right over were it says that Deism had \"...gained a small but influential number of adherents in America in the late eighteenth century.\" Indeed. The Encyclopedia Britannica identifies more exactly who those influential adherents were, \"By the end of the 18th century, Deism had become a dominant religious attitude among intellectual and upper class Americans.\" Right. The ones who were elected to Congress and the Constitutional Convention.\n \n So what other fundy christian revisionism did EZ fall for from his fundy christian revisionist sites? Well, there are the cases of Gouverneur Morris from New York and George Washington, listed as Episcopalians because that was the established state religion of their states at the time. Jefferson wrote, \"I know that Gouverneur Morris, who claimed to be in his secrets, and believed him self to be so, has often told me that General Washington believed no more in that system (Christianity) than he did.\" I'll translate for EZ - Gouvernor Morris, who was a close friend of Washington's often said that Wathington was not a Christian, and neither was he (Morris).\n \n And then there was Benjamin Rush, friend of the Rev. Ashbel Green, signer of the Declaration of Independence and chaplain to Congress under Washington. Rush took great pleasure in relating to Jefferson how Green had told him about how Washington had avoided responding to questions by some clergy that would have required him to affirm or deny a belief in Christianity. The Rev. Green was a Christian. Benjamin Rush and Jefferson were not. Green went on to comment that Washington \"...had never, on any occasion, said a word to the public which showed a belief in the Christian religion,...\" It should also be noted that there does not exist a single verified instance of where Washington mentioned God or Jesus in his private writings. He did use some of the standard deist appellations for divinity, like, Divine Author, Divine Providence, Grand Architect of the Universe. However, you will be able to find some invented quotes attributed to Washington - they are never sourced. I believe that David Barton has admitted inventing some.\n \n And how profoundly disingenuous and revisionist one has to be to refer to pretend that Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, and Madison were christians. Just because someone refers to a deity does not make them Christian.\n \n So enough with the dodging the point by revision of the truth. If this country is founded on christian principles, or if the intent was to found a christian nation, then it would be evident in the founding documents. So far EZ has been unable to show any christian foundation in those documents and ducks the question by playing bait and switch.\n \n The question is this: Where are Christian principles evident in our founding documents? Further, if the intent had been to form a secular government, how would our Constitution be different?",

   "The Laws Of The Early Republic Declared War on Christianity by Requiring a Violation Of The Ten Commandments\nGood point.\n \n I also failed to point out that the opposition to the ratification of the Constitution in 1787 was led by Christians. That can be easily verified by reading any of the records of debate from any of the states. The clergy even took an active part in the opposition to the Constitution in sermons, which were often printed in various papers and pamphlets for distribution. A good example was Patrick Henry, who led the opposition to the Constitution In Virginia. Henry also opposed the ratification of the Bill of Rights.\n \n The Christian objection to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights was that they were \"Godless.\" Fortunately, Christianity was not so dominant in those days, Christians comprising probably less than 1 in 5 persons in the population.\n \n Further, in both elections Jefferson was opposed by Christians. Both times the clergy actively campaigned against him from the pulpit. He was called an atheist and an infidel and accused of heinous crimes and immorality. The famous quote found on the Jefferson monument that Christians today tout as evidence of Jefferson's christianity was from a letter to Benjamin Rush (discussed previously). In it, Jefferson complained about the personal character assassination against him by the christian clergy. He said, \"I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.\" Jefferson was referring to the tyranny of Christianity.\n \n Isn't it interesting that today, in an effort to justify the use of government to force their religion on everyone, many so called christians now think that the \"Godless\" constitution was based on christian principles, and that Jefferson was a christian?",

   "Educating Pandion\n \n Was George Washington a Christian?\n \n by David Barton\n \n This is a question often asked today, and it arises from the efforts of those who seek to impeach Washington's character by portraying him as irreligious. Interestingly, Washington's own contemporaries did not question his Christianity but were thoroughly convinced of his devout faith--a fact made evident in the first-ever compilation of the The Writings of George Washington, published in the 1830s.\n \n That compilation of Washington's writings was prepared and published by Jared Sparks (1789-1866), a noted writer and historian. Sparks' herculean historical productions included not only the writings of George Washington (12 volumes) but also Benjamin Franklin (10 volumes) and Constitution signer Gouverneur Morris (3 volumes). Additionally, Sparks compiled the Library of American Biography (25 volumes), The Diplomatic Correspondence of the American Revolution (12 volumes), and the Correspondence of the American Revolution (4 volumes). In all, Sparks was responsible for some 100 historical volumes. Additionally, Sparks was America's first professor of history--other than ecclesiastical history--to teach at the college level in the United States, and he was later chosen president of Harvard.\n \n Jared Sparks' decision to compile George Washington's works is described by The Dictionary of American Biography. It details that Sparks began . . . . . what was destined to be his greatest life work, the publication of the writings of George Washington. [Supreme Court] Justice Bushrod Washington, [the nephew of George Washington, the executor of the Washington estate, and] the owner of the Washington manuscripts, was won over by an offer to share the profits, through the friendly mediation of Chief Justice [of the Supreme Court, John] Marshall [who from 1804-1807 had written a popular five volume biography of George Washington], who also consented to take an equal share, twenty-five per cent, with the owner. In January 1827, Sparks found himself alone at Mount Vernon with the manuscripts. An examination of them extending over three months showed that years would be required for the undertaking; and with the owner's consent, Sparks carried off the entire collection, eight large boxes, picking up on the way to Boston a box of diplomatic correspondence from the Department of State, and the [General Horatio] Gates manuscripts from the New York Historical Society. Not content with these, he searched or caused to be searched public and private archives for material, questioned survivors of the Revolution, visited and mapped historic sites. In 1830, for instance, he followed [Benedict] Arnold's [1775] route to Quebec. The first of the twelve volumes of The Writings of George Washington to be published (vol. II) appeared in 1834 and the last (vol. I, containing the biography) in 1837.\n \n In Volume XII of these writings, Jared Sparks delved into the religious character of George Washington, and included numerous letters written by the friends, associates, and family of Washington which testified of his religious character. Based on that extensive evidence, Sparks concluded:\n \n To say that he [George Washington] was not a Christian would be to impeach his sincerity and honesty. Of all men in the world, Washington was certainly the last whom any one would charge with dissimulation or indirectness [hypocrisies and evasiveness]; and if he was so scrupulous in avoiding even a shadow of these faults in every known act of his life, [regardless of] however unimportant, is it likely, is it credible, that in a matter of the highest and most serious importance [his religious faith, that] he should practice through a long series of years a deliberate deception upon his friends and the public? It is neither credible nor possible.\n \n One of the letters Sparks used to arrive at his conclusion was from Nelly Custis-Lewis. While Nelly technically was the granddaughter of the Washingtons, in reality she was much more. When Martha [Custis] married George, she was a widow and brought two young children (John and Martha--also called Patsy) from her first marriage into her marriage with George. The two were carefully raised by George and Martha, later married, and each had children of their own. Unfortunately, tragedy struck, and both John and Patsy died early (by 1781). John left behind his widow and four young children ranging in age from infancy to six years old.\n \n Nelly was ten years old when Washington was called to the Presidency, and she grew to maturity during his two terms. During that time, she traveled with Washington and walked amidst the great foreign and domestic names of the day. On Washington's retirement, she returned with the family to Mount Vernon. Nelly was energetic, spry, and lively, and was the joy of George Washington's life. She served as a gracious hostess and entertained the frequent guests to Mount Vernon who visited the former President.\n \n On Washington's birthday in 1799, Nelly married Washington's private secretary, Lawrence Lewis. They spent several months on an extended honeymoon, visiting friends and family across the country. On their return to Mount Vernon, she was pregnant and late that year gave birth to a daughter. A short few weeks later, on December 14, General Washington was taken seriously ill and died. \n \n Clearly, Nelly was someone who knew the private and public life of her \"father\" very well. Therefore, Jared Sparks, in searching for information on Washington's religious habits, dispatched a letter to Nelly, asking if she knew for sure whether George Washington indeed was a Christian. Within a week, she had replied to Sparks, and Sparks included her letter in Volume XII of Washington's writings in the lengthy section on Washington's religious habits. Of that specific letter, Jared Sparks explained:\n \n I shall here insert a letter on this subject, written to me by a lady who lived twenty years in Washington's family and who was his adopted daughter, and the granddaughter of Mrs. Washington. The testimony it affords, and the hints it contains respecting the domestic habits of Washington, are interesting and valuable.\"\n Woodlawn, 26 February, 1833.\n \n Sir,\n \n I received your favor of the 20th instant last evening, and hasten to give you the information, which you desire.\n \n Truro [Episcopal] Parish is the one in which Mount Vernon, Pohick Church [the church where George Washington served as a vestryman], and Woodlawn [the home of Nelly and Lawrence Lewis] are situated. Fairfax Parish is now Alexandria. Before the Federal District was ceded to Congress, Alexandria was in Fairfax County. General Washington had a pew in Pohick Church, and one in Christ Church at Alexandria. He was very instrumental in establishing Pohick Church, and I believe subscribed [supported and contributed to] largely. His pew was near the pulpit. I have a perfect recollection of being there, before his election to the presidency, with him and my grandmother. It was a beautiful church, and had a large, respectable, and wealthy congregation, who were regular attendants.\n \n He attended the church at Alexandria when the weather and roads permitted a ride of ten miles [a one-way journey of 2-3 hours by horse or carriage]. In New York and Philadelphia he never omitted attendance at church in the morning, unless detained by indisposition [sickness]. The afternoon was spent in his own room at home; the evening with his family, and without company. Sometimes an old and intimate friend called to see us for an hour or two; but visiting and visitors were prohibited for that day [Sunday]. No one in church attended to the services with more reverential respect. My grandmother, who was eminently pious, never deviated from her early habits. She always knelt. The General, as was then the custom, stood during the devotional parts of the service. On communion Sundays, he left the church with me, after the blessing, and returned home, and we sent the carriage back for my grandmother.\n \n It was his custom to retire to his library at nine or ten o'clock where he remained an hour before he went to his chamber. He always rose before the sun and remained in his library until called to breakfast. I never witnessed his private devotions. I never inquired about them. I should have thought it the greatest heresy to doubt his firm belief in Christianity. His life, his writings, prove that he was a Christian. He was not one of those who act or pray, \"that they may be seen of men\" [Matthew 6:5]. He communed with his God in secret [Matthew 6:6]. \n \n My mother [Eleanor Calvert-Lewis] resided two years at Mount Vernon after her marriage [in 1774] with John Parke Custis, the only son of Mrs. Washington. I have heard her say that General Washington always received the sacrament with my grandmother before the revolution. When my aunt, Miss Custis [Martha's daughter] died suddenly at Mount Vernon, before they could realize the event [before they understood she was dead], he [General Washington] knelt by her and prayed most fervently, most affectingly, for her recovery. Of this I was assured by Judge [Bushrod] Washington's mother and other witnesses. \n \n He was a silent, thoughtful man. He spoke little generally; never of himself. I never heard him relate a single act of his life during the war. I have often seen him perfectly abstracted, his lips moving, but no sound was perceptible. I have sometimes made him laugh most heartily from sympathy with my joyous and extravagant spirits. I was, probably, one of the last persons on earth to whom he would have addressed serious conversation, particularly when he knew that I had the most perfect model of female excellence [Martha Washington] ever with me as my monitress, who acted the part of a tender and devoted parent, loving me as only a mother can love, and never extenuating [tolerating] or approving in me what she disapproved of others. She never omitted her private devotions, or her public duties; and she and her husband were so perfectly united and happy that he must have been a Christian. She had no doubts, no fears for him. After forty years of devoted affection and uninterrupted happiness, she resigned him without a murmur into the arms of his Savior and his God, with the assured hope of his eternal felicity [happiness in Heaven]. Is it necessary that any one should certify, \"General Washington avowed himself to me a believer in Christianity?\" As well may we question his patriotism, his heroic, disinterested devotion to his country. His mottos were, \"Deeds, not Words\"; and, \"For God and my Country.\"\n \n With sentiments of esteem,\n I am, Nelly Custis-Lewis\n \n George Washington's adopted daughter, having spent twenty years of her life in his presence, declared that one might as well question Washington's patriotism as question his Christianity. Certainly, no one questions his patriotism; so is it not rather ridiculous to question his Christianity? George Washington was a devout Episcopalian; and although as an Episcopalian he would not be classified as an outspoken and extrovert \"evangelical\" Founder as were Founding Fathers like Benjamin Rush, Roger Sherman, and Thomas McKean, nevertheless, being an Episcopalian makes George Washington no less of a Christian. Yet for the current revisionists who have made it their goal to assert that America was founded as a secular nation by secular individuals and that the only hope for America's longevity rests in her continued secularism, George Washington's faith must be sacrificed on the altar of their secularist agenda.\n \n http://www.wallbuilders.com/resources/search/detail.php?ResourceID=13\n \n Well, Pandion, I submit that Nelly Custis-Lewis knew George Washington one heck of a lot better than you think you do. A deist? That's laughable.",

   "Good point. I also failed to point out that the opposition to the ratification of the Constitution in 1787 was led by Christians. \n\n \n Those were not, in my humble view, Christians. Those were Counterfeit Christians to whom religious faith was just a tool to be used by the government.\n \n \n A good example was Patrick Henry, who led the opposition to the Constitution In Virginia. Henry also opposed the ratification of the Bill of Rights.\n\n \n Patrick Henry was not a genuine Christian. He is a charter member of the American Religious Liberty Hall of Shame.\n \n \n Isn't it interesting that today, in an effort to justify the use of government to force their religion on everyone, many so called christians now think that the \"Godless\" constitution was based on christian principles, and that Jefferson was a christian?\n\n \n In the 1860's the Presbyterians succeded in getting Congress to assume legislative authority over religon by arguing that the founders were heathens who disowed God. Now, they lie about the founders and argue that the founders were Counterfeit Christians like them who loved government autority over the duty which they owed to their Creator.\n \n ************************************************************\n \n The United State Was Founded As A Heathen Nation That Disowned God \n \n The evil men who led the satanic movement to have the motto IN GOD WE TRUST impressed on the United State's coins despised the noble men who established our system of government. They considered men like James Madison to be heathens who disowned God. They were successful largely because of the increase in Counterfeit Christian sentiment that existed during and after the Civil War. \n \n A Rev. M.R. Watkinson, who was part of a larger campaign waged by a coalition of eleven Counterfeit Christian denominations, disenchanted with the exemption of religion from the cognizance of government and hoping to make some changes, wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Treasury Samuel P. Chase in 1861. Secretary Chase was an advocate of government authority over religion and received other appeals from Counterfeit Christians throughout the country, urging that the United States recognize the Deity on United States coins. Rev. Watkinson's letter dated November 13, 1861 read:\n  Dear Sir: \n \n You are about to submit your annual report to the Congress respecting the affairs of the national finances. One fact touching our currency has hitherto been seriously overlooked. \n \n I mean the recognition of the Almighty God in some form on our coins.\n You are probably a Christian. What if our Republic were not shattered beyond reconstruction? Would not the antiquaries of succeeding centuries rightly reason from our past that we were a heathen nation? (Editorial Comment: Did he just accused the noble men who established our system of government of being heathens?) \n \n What I propose is that instead of the goddess of liberty we shall have next inside the 13 stars a ring inscribed with the words PERPETUAL UNION (Editorial Comment: The founders liked the goddess of liberty on the nation's coins); within the ring the allseeing eye, crowned with a halo; beneath this eye the American flag, bearing in its field stars equal to the number of the States united; in the folds of the bars the words GOD, LIBERTY, LAW.\n \n This would make a beautiful coin, to which no possible citizen could object. (Editorial Comment: The rights of conscience cannot be so successfully assailed as under the pretext of holiness)\n \n This would relieve us from the ignominy of heathenism. COLOR=\"Red\"](Editorial Comment: Did he just again charge the founding fathers of heathenism)[/COLOR] This would place us openly under the Divine protection we have personally claimed. From my hearth I have felt our national shame in disowning God (Editorial Comment: Separating civil authority from the duty that we are to render only to God, which the founders beleived they were directed to do by the Savior, is distorted by this pervert into a disowning of God) as not the least of our present national disasters.\n \n To you first I address a subject that must be agitated.\n The United States surrendered any right to claim it was a genuine Christian Nation when the American people did not take up the terrible swift sword and extirpate the stooges who passed the 1860's bill that authorized the government to declare the people's trust in God on the nation's coins. The American people might just as well have sworn allegiance to the Devil and joined in worship at the Temple of Satan.\n \n FVF",

   " EZ also seems to be unable to grasp simple points in discussion without making huge leaps into error. For example, I mentioned that many of the signers of the Declaration of Independence and the framers of the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution were deists. EZ responds with a quote that says, \"Deists in the United States never amounted to more than a small percentage of an evangelical population.\" The point isn't the percentage of the population that were deists, it is who they were. Even the article that EZ quotes EZ had to skip right over were it says that Deism had \"...gained a small but influential number of adherents in America in the late eighteenth century.\" Indeed. The Encyclopedia Britannica identifies more exactly who those influential adherents were, \"By the end of the 18th century, Deism had become a dominant religious attitude among intellectual and upper class Americans.\" Right. The ones who were elected to Congress and the Constitutional Convention.\n\n \n Well, you must have glossed over my previous posts that have demolished the so-called \"deists\" you've tried to come up with already: Jefferson, Franklin, Washington, and Madison. All have quotes on record that don't match up with the common deism of that day. I think you are also missing the general flavor of the Enlightenment and how that influenced thought among the so-called deists, most of whom were rational naturalists. The important ingredient of that as it related to God (when God was referenced) was that God was likened to a watch-maker, who wound the universe up and then no longer involved himself in the affairs of men and nations. Your so-called \"deists\" do not match up with this. And to date, you have yet to identify, and provide any credible evidence for, all these \"ones who were elected to Congress and the Constitutional Convention.\" You play the game of generalizing about your deists, without providing any credible evidence to back up your generalizations. Where's the beef?\n \n \n I'll translate for EZ - Gouvernor Morris, who was a close friend of Washington's often said that Wathington was not a Christian, and neither was he (Morris).\n\n \n I've already provided information in my previous post from a source in Washington's own family (obviously closer than Morris), who sings a different song. I think that since she lived with him all those years, she knew Washington much better than Morris. \n \n \n So enough with the dodging the point by revision of the truth. If this country is founded on christian principles, or if the intent was to found a christian nation, then it would be evident in the founding documents. So far EZ has been unable to show any christian foundation in those documents and ducks the question by playing bait and switch.\n\n \n Well let's not just limit that to Christian, but Biblical as well.\n \n Well, to start with, the DOI does contain the phrases \"Nature's God\" (see my previous post on this), and \"divine providence.\" Samuel Johnson's 1755 Dictionary of the English Language, as well as Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language, both reference a divine God as one who exercises that providence. And the predominate \"God\" of the Founding Fathers (see my post on religious affiliations) was the Biblical God and Jesus Christ. \n \n Now, the Constitution was written to secure those rights as mentioned in the Declaration of Independence, so it assumes the same divine God and providence as in the DOI. So right away, your contention that God is not mentioned in the Constitution may be literally correct, but it totally ignores the presumption of where our rights originate to begin with - from God. Thus, your contention is disingenuous. \n \n Nest - the division of Government - checks and balances. The delegates certainly had their qualms about the ability of men not to engage in ungodly conduct for their own benefit. John Eidsmoe (\"Christianity and the Constitution\") cites Romans 3:23 as undoubtedly being a passage known to the Fathers - \"For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.\" Madison, in Federalist # 51, stated: \"But what is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature.  If men were angels, no government would be necessary...You must first enable the government to control the governed, and in the next place, oblige it control itself.\" Here, Madison, who once studied for the priesthood, links angels vs. human nature to highlight one of the difficulties of human government.\n \n Next, the Scriptures state that at least two witnesses are necessary to decide critical matters of conviction (Deuteronomy 17:6; Numbers 35:30). Article III, Section 3, Paragraph 1 states: \"No person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open court.\" Again, a Biblical foundation clearly understood by Christian and Biblical framers.\n \n We also have the Lord's Day that is honored amongst Christians. Article I, Section 7, Paragraph 2 states, \"If any bill shall not be returned by the President within 10 days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him......\" This clause was an obvious accommodation to Christians in America. \n \n Many more examples are available in Eidsmoe's work if you care to read it. \n \n Now, a few more quotes for your edification: \n \n \"I have tender reliance on the mercy of the Almighty; through the merits of the Lord Jesus Christ. I am a sinner. I look to Him for mercy; pray for me.\"\n Alexander Hamilton Last dying words, 12 July 1804\n \n \"This is all the inheritance I give to my dear family. The religion of Christ will give them one which will make them rich indeed.\"\n Patrick Henry Last will and testament, November 20, 1798\n \n \"Suppose a nation in some distant region should take the Bible for their only Law Book, and every member should regulate his conduct by the precepts there exhibited... What a paradise would this region be!\"\n John Adams 1756 America's Second President\n \n \"It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge to Providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, to be grateful for His benefits, and to humbly implore His protection and favor.\"\n George Washington October 3, 1789 Proclaiming a National Day of Prayer and Thanksgiving\n \n \"Our laws and our institutions must necessarily be based upon the teachings of the Redeemer of Mankind. It is impossible that it should be otherwise; and in this sense and to this extent, our civilization and our institutions are emphatically Christian.\"\n U. S. Supreme Court 1892",

   " EZ is scrambling and trying to divert the discussion from the point, that being that the founding documents of this country are not based on Christian principles and did not intend to found a Christian Nation. So he wants to argue about deism without, it seems, having actually educated himself. For example, I doubt if EZ has consulted Elihu Palmer, a former Baptist minister and one of the most vocal of the deist authors of the Revolutionary period. His definition of Deism can be found HERE. For that matter, he doesn't seem to have consulted later sources such as the main [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism]Wikipedia[/i] entry on Deism either. EZ tries to make it too limited and dogmatic, just like his own particular cult of christianity.\n\n \n Tsk, tsk.... Elihu Palmer was about as influential amongst the founding fathers as Elmer Fudd, unless you have a list of quotes from the fathers googling over him and his monkey shines. Contrast that to fact that the most quoted reference amongst the Fathers was the Bible, in some 34% of their own quotations. How does Palmer compare to that? \n \n And here are some other definitions of deism for you:\n \n Deism means belief in God as a prime cause or creator of the world, after which God has no hand in its affairs. Like Pantheism, Deism is a form of belief in God which provides a basis for materialistic criticism of Religion. Deism is particularly associated with the philosophers of the Enlightenment who prepared the way for the French Revolution - Voltaire and Rousseau - and British philosophers such as Locke and Newton.\n \n http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/d/e.htm\n \n Historical and modern deism is defined by the view that reason, rather than revelation or tradition, should be the basis of belief in God. Deists reject both organized and revealed religion and maintain that reason is the essential element in all knowledge. \n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism\n \n The belief, based solely on reason, in a God who created the universe and then abandoned it, assuming no control over life, exerting no influence on natural phenomena, and giving no supernatural revelation. \n \n http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/deism",

Article 2 \"earnestly recommended to all officers and soldiers to attend divine services.\" Punishment was prescribed for those who behaved \"indecently or irreverently\" in churches, including courts-martial, fines and imprisonments. Chaplains who deserted their troops were to be court-martialed. \n \n Aitken's Bible Endorsed by Congress\n \n The war with Britain cut off the supply of Bibles to the United States with the result that on Sept. 11, 1777, Congress instructed its Committee of Commerce to import 20,000 Bibles from \"Scotland, Holland or elsewhere.\" On January 21, 1781, Philadelphia printer Robert Aitken (1734-1802) petitioned Congress to officially sanction a publication of the Old and New Testament which he was preparing at his own expense. Congress \"highly approve the pious and laudable undertaking of Mr. Aitken, as subservient to the interest of religion . . . in this country, and . . . they recommend this edition of the bible to the inhabitants of the United States.\" This resolution was a result of Aitken's successful accomplishment of his project.\n \n Christianizing the Delawares\n \n In this resolution, Congress makes public lands available to a group for religious purposes. Responding to a plea from Bishop John Ettwein (1721-1802), Congress voted that 10,000 acres on the Muskingum River in the present state of Ohio \"be set apart and the property thereof be vested in the Moravian Brethren . . . or a society of the said Brethren for civilizing the Indians and promoting Christianity.\" The Delaware Indians were the intended beneficiaries of this Congressional resolution.\n \n http://lcweb.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel04.html",

Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God.1\n \n [Note 1: 1 A copy of this report, in the writing of James Lovell, is in thePapers of the Continental Congress, No. 23, folio 143. The original idea was formed by Du Simiti\u00e8re, and his own account of it is in theJefferson Papers, Fifth Series, VIII, No. 3. It differs from the report printed above in some particulars:\n The Coat of Arms of the States of America.\n The Shield has six quarters, parti one, coup\u00e9 two; to the first it bears OR, a rose ennamelled Gules and argent, for England; to the Second, argent a thistle proper, for Scotland; to the third vert, a harp OR, for Ireland; to the fourth azure, a flower de luce OR, for France; to the fifth or the Imperial Eagle Sable, for Germany; and to the Sixth OR, the belgic Lyon Gules, for Holland.

E Pluribus Unum.\n Legend. round the whole atchievement. Seal of the [thirteen] united [and independent] States of America. MDCCLXXVI.\n In the Jefferson Manuscripts in the Library of Congress are two notes of suggestion on this seal. One in the writing of Franklin, and the other in that of Jefferson. Franklin's note reads:\n \"Moses [in the Dress of High Priest] standing on the Shore, and extending his Hand over the Sea, thereby causing the same to overwhelm Pharoah who is sitting in an open Chariot, a Crown on his Head and a Sword in his Hand. Rays from a Pillar of Fire in the Clouds reaching to Moses, [expressing] to express that he acts by [the] Command of the Deity.\n \"Motto, Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God.\"\n The note of Jefferson reads:\n \"Pharoah sitting in an open chariot, a crown on his head and a sword in his hand passing thro' the divided waters of the Red sea in pursuit of the Israelites: rays from a pillar of fire in the cloud, expressive of the divine presence, [reach] and command, reaching to Moses who stands on the shore and, extending his hand over the sea, causes it to over whelm Pharoah.\n \"Motto. Rebellion to tyrants is obedce to god.\"\n Words in brackets were stricken out by the pen.\n Jefferson merely noted a version of the Franklin suggestion. In theWritings of Jefferson (Ford), I, 420 is what purports to be a scheme of arms made in 1774, but the date assigned to it is doubtful. In a letter from John Adams to his wife, written August 14, 1776, he said:\n \"Doctor F. proposes a device for a seal. Moses lifting up his wand, and dividing the red sea, and Pharoah in his chariot over whelmed with the waters. This motto. 'Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God.'\n \"Mr. Jefferson proposed, The children of Israel in the wilderness, led by a cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night--and on the other side, Hengist and Horsa, the Saxon chiefs, from whom we claim the honor of being descended, and whose political principles and form of government we have assumed.\n \"I proposed, The choice of Hercules, as engraved by Gribelin, in some editions of Lord Shaftesbury's works. The hero resting on his club. Virtue pointing to her rugged mountain on one hand, and persuading him to ascend. Sloth, glancing at her flowery paths of pleasure, wantonly reclining on the ground, displaying the charms both of her eloquence and person, to seduce him into vice.

   "Those were not, in my humble view, Christians. Those were Counterfeit Christians to whom religious faith was just a tool to be used by the government.\n \n Patrick Henry was not a genuine Christian. He is a charter member of the American Religious Liberty Hall of Shame.\nI think that they were all christians of their time. Among the men of the Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention were no doubt honorable men of Christian faith. And true to christian belief of the time, they tried to impose their faith on others by law. For example, a representative from Maryland, Luther Martin, urged that some kind of recognition of Christianity be included in the Constitution because \"...it would be at least decent to hold out some distinction between the professors of Christianity and downright infidelity or paganism.\" That proposal was voted down. Even the motion by Benjamin Franklin (of all people) the the sessions of the Constitutional Convention should begin with a prayer was in effect, ignored. There was a bit of discussion and then a motion for recess. The matter was never introduced again, thus, not a single session of the Constitutional Convention began with a prayer. (I do not recall the exact date of Franklin's motion, but it was well into the convention. I can find it for anyone who wishes to check in the notes of James Madison or those of Robert Yates. Just ask.)\n \nIn the 1860's the Presbyterians succeded in getting Congress to assume legislative authority over religon by arguing that the founders were heathens who disowed God. Now, they lie about the founders and argue that the founders were Counterfeit Christians like them who loved government autority over the duty which they owed to their Creator.\nI have no idea what you are talking about.\n \n I think that mottos on our currency is but one example of a fungus like growth of fundamentalist christianity among the uneducated of our country. The intent is to impose their religion on everyone by force of law.

You guys are wearing out secular lawyers left and right trying to get 200+ years worth of Christian vestiges out of the government and public squares and then you focus just on pagan influences? Where's your balance?\n\n \n Hey, Easyrider, watch where you point that finger. I've never talked to any such \"secular lawyers,\" in fact my contact with lawyers is limited to being pretty much nonexistent. It's obvious you didn't read the link. Nobody is actually\n claiming the U.S. was founded on Pagan principles. Here's the quote from the website you didn't read thoroughly:\n \n \nThe astute reader will realize that I wrote this essay as satire against those Christians who go around claiming America as a Christian nation because of the few Judeo-Christian symbolic references found on various artifacts (\"God\" on coins, 10 Commandments in front of court houses, etc.). If we use mottoes, pledges, and pictures of coins as a means to determine our founding principles, then the Christians will lose by a large margin considering the numerous pagan references that far outstrip the number of Christian references.\n \n Although I have attempted to present an accurate history of pagan references above, I have purposely hidden the secular reasons for the founding principles of U.S. government. Our founding fathers never intended our country to reflect religious pagan or Christian principles. They formed a secular government (the first in the world) in order to separate religion from politics which includes the separation of pagan, and Judeo-Christian religions. Yes, indeed, American founders founded our government upon pagan ideas, but not on pagan religious ideas.\n \n The references to pagan deities do not violate separation of church and state because the religions of these deities no longer exist. Through force, Christianity and Islam virtually wiped out all the European and middle-east pagan religions from the 4th century onward by labeling them heretics, burning them at the stake, and destroying their sacred texts. Our founding fathers used pagan symbols to represent the ideas of liberty and freedom, not to promote pagan religions. The use of \"God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance and on currency, on the other hand, got put there precisely to promote Christianity. These uses of a monotheistic \"God\" points to an existing religion, and for this reason, violates separation of church and state.\n \n In this tongue-and-cheek historical lesson, I presented myself as pagan, but of course I don't really practice pagan worship any more than I do Christianity or Judaism. Nor did any of our most influential founding fathers. I find no offense in using dead pagan symbology, but the use of monotheistic Christian symbols certainly offends many freethinkers, atheists, or the polytheistic religious.\n",

   "1. The Declaration of Indepence [sic] shows the intention to form a \"Deist Nation\" in that it mentions Deism how many times? a. zero, b. one, c. three, d. five.\n \n This initial document of the United States mentions deism exactly zero times. A bit peculiar considering the argument is that so many founding fathers were allegedly deists.\nNow you have made yourself a liar. There is no argument that anyone wanted to found a deist nation. Given the violent record of christianity in guiding nations, the founding fathers tried to found a secular nation in which all citizens were free to worship according to the dictates of their conscience.\n \n Still, you fail to show the christian principles that you claim were there.\n \n2. How many times in the 11 state constitutions of 1776 & 1777 is deism mentioned?. a. zero, b. one, c. five, d. eleven.\n \n You guessed it: zero.\nExactly! There was no intent to form a deist nation so there was no need to mention it. For the same reason, Christ and Christianity are not mentioned except in those cases that I noted. Please show the intent to form a christian nation in the other 8.\n \n3. How many times in the 11 state constitutions of 1776 & 1777 did the so-called deist fathers identify God or a Creator as being deist in origin? a. zero, b. three, c. six, d. nine\n \n You guessed it: zero.\nMy point exactly. There was no intention to form a religious nation of any kind. Other than the obvious efforts to form christian states that I noted, please show where that was the intent in the others.\n \n4. How many total times did the Articles of Confederation mention deism? a. zero, b. three, c. five, d. seven\n \n You're getting the hang of this by now, aren't you? Zero. Wouldn't it be more logical that if all the so-called deists people say there were running the show at that time, that they would try to just mention deism once in the Articles?\nWhy? They made no claims of running any show and had no desire to impose their religion on others by force of government. Most states did that anyway, and since even christians couldn't agree on what christianity was, the Constitution didn't address religion. The First Amendment specifically states that Congress does not have the power to legislate in matters of religion.\n \n Please show where it is the clear intent of the Articles of Confederation to form a christian nation. That is your assertion. Please support it. I do not assert that anyone ever wanted to form a deist nation.\n \n5. How many times does the Constitution of the United States mention deism or deists? a. zero, b. three, c. five, d. seven.\n \n I'm sure you got this one right too. Again, the answer is zero times. It's a peculiar state of affairs for a document that is purported to be created by an alleged, influential deist majority.\nNo it's not, since there was no intent to impose deism on others. The intent was to allow everyone to worship as according to the dictates of their conscience. Your parody here makes it quite clear of the intentions of you \"Christian Nation\" nuts. Your intention is to impose your religion on everyone by law. Your whining is quite similar to that of the christians who opposed our Constitution and the Bill of Rights because they were godless. There is neither the christian god or that of the deists. You, however, claim that our nation is somehow \"christian.\" I am only asking that you show me where that intent is reflected in the documents.\n \n6. How many times does the Bill of Rights mention deism or deists? a. zero, b. one, c. two, d. three.\n \n You all got this one too, right? The answer is, of course, zero.\nBut of course. Again, since there was no intent to force deism on anyone, why would it be mentioned? And of course, since the intent was not to found a christian nation, christian superstition isn't mentioned either.\n \n7. How many of the 13 original colonies had an established, state-sponsored deist religion at one time or another in their history? a. thirteen, b. twelve, c. eight, d. five.\n \n You guessed it: zero.\nYou must be a christian since the answer isn't one of the choices. That's pretty typical of christianity. Even if someone tries to make an honest choice, the answer is wrong and they are damned.\n \n But of course, since deism isn't mentioned, there was no intent to found a deist government. Twelve clearly did found \"christian\" governments. That allowed the persecution, and sometimes the torture and execution, of anyone who did not agree. That was generally the concept of \"freedom of religion\" of the early colonists. \n \nDeists never amounted to more than a small percentage of evangelical Christians.\nAnd evangelical christians never amounted to more than a small percentage of the population at the time of the Revolution. Probably none of the evangelical christians were deists. However, when Britannica and World Book state that deism was professed by the educated intelligentsia of the time, it is probably common knowledge. As I mentioned before, I can cite 6 other sources from historians who specialize in Revolutionary American History who say the same. Thus, the founding fathers were more deist than christian. As is still true today (according to Gallup), fundamentalist christians are typically less educated than average.\n \n8. How many of the first 7 Presidents of the United States ever said, \"I am a deist\"? a. zero, b. two, c. four, d. six.\n \n Well, the deist crowd will need to come up with some legitimate quotations to support a self-identified deist claim for any of the first 7 Presidents, since I am unaware of any.\nOn the other hand, how many ever said that they were christians? Except for invented sources that have you duped, none. And the evidence that they weren't christians is from Christian clergy as well as their own verified words (which you could verify if you had the integrity to do so). Washington never professed a belief in christianity, Adams was Unitarian (i.e., no trinity and therefore no divine Jesus) because he said so, Jefferson was a sect unto himself (because he said so), Madison always opposed christian establishment, was Jefferson's friend and protegee (and never professed christianity), and so on.\n \nAnd, where is deism today?\n \n Lost in obscurity, most likely!\nHow is that relevant? Probably those who would have been deists are today either atheists or Unitarians. I'm not sure why that question is relevant to 1776 to 1789. How does that mean that there were no deists then? How is that evidence that the Constitution intends that everyone should be christian rather than free to worship as they choose?\n \n You just don't think things through, do you?\n \n It seems to me that your view is that our (christian) founding fathers were too stupid to actually make their intentions known. You seem to be claiming that although they intended to found a christian nation, somehow they were too stupid to actually express their intent. Instead, because of their stupidity, they founded nation based on a secular Constitution that favored no religion. But, after all, they were christians.\n \n On the other hand, my view is that the founding fathers, Christian and Deist alike, knowledgeable of the religious wars of christian Europe, intended to form a secular government that did not favor one religion over another. They formed a government that didn't address matters of religion. With the First Amendment, matters of religion were specifically removed from the province of government. Therefore, we are not a christian nation any more than we are a deist nation. We are a free nation (at least we have been in the past before the fungus of fundamentalist christianity began to strangle our freedoms).",

   "I am like Thomas Jefferson: A sect of one.\nAh! a cult.\n \nCongress established by law the duty of the American taxpayers to contribute to the finacial support of two Christian ministers when it passed the law in 1789 to pay the Chaplains from the national taxes.\nDon't be stupid. There is no such law. Pay attention, Fred. Congress can make their own rules for the conduct of business. Congress is probably the most exclusive club in the world. The chaplains of the House and Senate are paid from the budgets of those bodies. Of course, the House and Senate have the power to control their own funds, but the appointment of a chaplain does not establish a religion. It isn't law. You failed to show where \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion...\" was violated. Again, no law was passed. Congress may establish the rules for the conduct of business. Those rules do not apply outside of Congress. Therefore, Congressional chaplains do not establish religion.\n \n Considering that some Congressional chaplains have not been either protestant or christian, your point becomes mute.\n \nWe are debating the actions of the First U. S. Congress - not my views on religious liberty.\nNope. You made your views part of the debate. From what I can tell, you are believe that how you worship is a matter of legislation by Congress.\n \nThe same Congress that framed the First Amenmdment thought there was nothing wrong with telling the people what religion they must support. Go bitch at them - not at me.\nBut they didn't. I'm not sure why you think that rules that Congress adopts for the conduct of business have legal standing outside of Congress, but you are wrong.\n \nHow do you explain the obvious contradiction between the establishment clause (which appears to prohibit exactly what Congress did by establishing the Chaplainships for the National Legislature) and the official actions of the First Congress?\nExplained above. Appointment of chaplains is an internal matter that has no force of law outside of sessions of Congress. There is no contradiction since no law was passed.\n \nEstablishing the payment of the two mininsters from the national taxes was done by passing a law.\nPlease pay attention, Fred. I'm getting tired of explaining simple ideas to you. It wasn't and isn't a law.\n \nIf Congress can force the people to pay for one or two establishments of religion, why can't it do the same for a city, a county, an entire State, a region of several states or even on a nation-wide basis?\nI guess you didn't have the ganas to actually read what I said. I gave you a list of \"one or two\" religions that have furnished chaplains for both houses of Congress. Either you didn't read the list or you have a significant reading comprehension problem. Some Congressional chaplains have not been christian.\n \n Moreover, the Constitution does not prohibit prayer, whether it be in private, in voluntary groups in schools, or in closed legislative bodies that make their own rules. Please put some thought into what you say.",

Off hand, I would think that it is pure nonsense.\n \nI reject the view that the establishment of the Chaplains to Congress is legitimate legal precedent?\nThat's great. Who ever claimed that it was? The appointment of chaplains by the houses of Congress has to do with the fact that Congress can establish its own rules for the conduct of business. It has nothing to do with legality. The authority is in Article I, Section 5 (2). \"Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings,...\"\n \nReason one - The principles underlying the establishment of the Legislative Chaplains are obviously inconsistent with the type of religious liberty that prevailed during the formative years of the Republic.\nNice assertion. Too bad that you didn't support it. How is it inconsistent? Since there is no requirement that any Representative or Senator actually pay attention to any chaplain, I'm not sure how a legislative chaplain violates the First Amendment. It isn't law.\n \nReason two - Congress never attempted to apply or extend further the principles underlying the Chaplainships.\nI have no idea of what your point is. Of course Congress didn't.

When and where did you study Latin? If you don't actually understand the Latin, then what is the point in quoting it? Please cite your sources. It's nice that you can quote Madison, but where can I verify that you didn't make it up? Without a source, \"ita be crapus,\" which means \"if I can't verify it, then it's not worth a fart.\"\n \nI conclude that we should not quarrel with the establishment of the chaplains unless some one attempts to give it the effect of a legitimate precedent.\nBut you are to one who was quarreling.

   "DID THE U. S. CONGRESS, ON DECEMBER 4, 1800, APPROVE THE USE OF THE CAPITOL BUILDING AS A CHURCH BUILDING?\n \n \n In an essay titled \"Church in the U.S. Capitol\" David Barton claims that \"on December 4, 1800, Congress approved the use of the Capitol building as a church building.\" To support his claim Barton cites \"Debates and Proceedings in the Congress of the United States (Washington: Gales and Seaton, 1853), p. 797, Sixth Congress, December 4, 1800.\"\n \n The Congressional Records for December 4, 1800, show that the Speaker of the House advised the members of the House that the Congressional Chaplains proposed conducting a divine service, if agreeable with the House, every Sunday in the House Chamber. However, the Speaker did not order the proposal to lie on the clerk's desk in order that the House could consider it, nor did he order it assigned to a committee. \n \n None of the members expressed interest in the Chaplains proposal and the House proceeded to discuss the memorial of a newspaper owner regarding the issue of a lack of space in the Chamber for reporters who wanted to cover the House proceedings. \n \n It appears that the Chaplain's proposal was not agreeable to the House.

Please see here...\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=209472&postcount=70\n\n \n You're interested, alright.\n \n And I think your latest attack on sources is laughable considering you've supported the totally discredited (ahem) \"Bishop\" Spong and his nonsense.\n \n Spong the Greek \"scholar\"\n \n Spong boasts that he spends hours studying the Bible and professes an acquaintance with Koin\u00e8 Greek, the language the NT was first written in. Therefore it is not surprising that in RMR, where he denies Jesus' bodily resurrection, that he turns to an analysis of the Greek text to see what the Bible really means.\n \n In RMR p. 53-55, Spong draws our attention to Gal. 1:15-16a which says:\n \n 15 But when He who had set me apart, even from my mother's womb, called me through His grace, was pleased 16to reveal His son in me ...\n \n From v. 16, 'to reveal His son in me', Spong claims:\n \n This was not a physical body recalled from the grave. The word for 'reveal' in this text is ophthe, the same word used in the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures to describe the appearances of God (theophanies) or angels of God (angelophanies) ... . What was the nature of a theophany? Was it really 'physical'? What was the means of hearing God's voice speak? Was it audible to any ear? Was it capable of being recorded or objectified?\n \n At first, we were impressed by this depth. But on checking a computerised concordance,81 we found that \u00f2phth\u00e8 is sometimes used of ordinary physical 'seeing' (Acts 7:26, 1 Tim. 3:16) - not surprising that we derive the word 'ophthalmologist' from a related word, and such a doctor definitely deals with physical sight. A logician would also note that Spong commits the fallacy of false alternatives, because he overlooks the possibility that seeing could be both physical and supra-physical, rather that either/or. We thought that it was strange that Spong should ignore this point. However, we decided to check a Greek NT82 to see if Spong had at least analysed the word correctly in this passage. But we could not find \u00f2phth\u00e8 in the passage. To give Spong a second shot, we checked a NT Greek Interlinear. The word was not there either. Instead, the Greek word for 'reveal' in Gal. 1:16 is actually apokalupsai, not \u00f2phth\u00e8! Apokalupsai is often used in the NT in an objective sense.83 \n \n It is shocking to see that Spong was trying to attack traditional Christian belief by appealing to a mistranslation of a Greek word which is not even in the passage he is explaining. Prof. O'Collins is undoubtedly referring to this blunder when he wrote: 'What is said about a key verb St. Paul uses in Gal. 1:15f. shows that the bishop [Spong] has forgotten any Greek that he knew.'79 Spong should heed O'Collins' kindly 'advice for his next book [which] is to let some real experts check it before publication.'79 \n (answersingenesis.org)\n \n emoticon_xbouncer",

   "David Barton and Everson v. Board of Education\n \n \n David Barton claims that: In 1947, in the case Everson v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court declared, \"The First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state. \n \n This is an example of what founder T. T. Tucker referred to as \"tossing a tub to a whale.\" Barton ignores 100 years of judicial history before 1947 regarding the separation of church and state included that fact that the Supreme Court had previously, in the 1878 case of Reynolds v. U. S., found the separation between church and state in the First Amendment. Barton also ignores the fact that South Carolina Supreme Court read the First Amendment to prohibit a union of church and state in the 1848 case of City Council of Charleston v. Benjamin. \n \n Barton also ignores 150 years of legislative history including the 1811 dispute in the House of Representatives over the correct principle of the establishment clause. The contest was decided in overwhelming favor of James Madison's strict separation interpretation of the establishment clause and against the view that Congress was authorized to establish a religion for the ten square mile area of the federal district, to establish the rules governing the election and dismissal of the minister of a church and to establish rules regulating the funds of a religious society.",

   "You're interested, alright.\n \n And I think your latest attack on sources is laughable considering you've supported the totally discredited (ahem) \"Bishop\" Spong and his nonsense.\n \n Spong the Greek \"scholar\"\n \n Spong boasts that he spends hours studying the Bible and professes an acquaintance with Koin\u00e8 Greek, the language the NT was first written in. Therefore it is not surprising that in RMR, where he denies Jesus' bodily resurrection, that he turns to an analysis of the Greek text to see what the Bible really means.\n \n In RMR p. 53-55, Spong draws our attention to Gal. 1:15-16a which says:\n \n 15 But when He who had set me apart, even from my mother's womb, called me through His grace, was pleased 16to reveal His son in me ...\n \n From v. 16, 'to reveal His son in me', Spong claims:\n \n This was not a physical body recalled from the grave. The word for 'reveal' in this text is ophthe, the same word used in the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures to describe the appearances of God (theophanies) or angels of God (angelophanies) ... . What was the nature of a theophany? Was it really 'physical'? What was the means of hearing God's voice speak? Was it audible to any ear? Was it capable of being recorded or objectified?\n \n At first, we were impressed by this depth. But on checking a computerised concordance,81 we found that \u00f2phth\u00e8 is sometimes used of ordinary physical 'seeing' (Acts 7:26, 1 Tim. 3:16) - not surprising that we derive the word 'ophthalmologist' from a related word, and such a doctor definitely deals with physical sight. A logician would also note that Spong commits the fallacy of false alternatives, because he overlooks the possibility that seeing could be both physical and supra-physical, rather that either/or. We thought that it was strange that Spong should ignore this point. However, we decided to check a Greek NT82 to see if Spong had at least analysed the word correctly in this passage. But we could not find \u00f2phth\u00e8 in the passage. To give Spong a second shot, we checked a NT Greek Interlinear. The word was not there either. Instead, the Greek word for 'reveal' in Gal. 1:16 is actually apokalupsai, not \u00f2phth\u00e8! Apokalupsai is often used in the NT in an objective sense.83 \n \n It is shocking to see that Spong was trying to attack traditional Christian belief by appealing to a mistranslation of a Greek word which is not even in the passage he is explaining. Prof. O'Collins is undoubtedly referring to this blunder when he wrote: 'What is said about a key verb St. Paul uses in Gal. 1:15f. shows that the bishop [Spong] has forgotten any Greek that he knew.'79 Spong should heed O'Collins' kindly 'advice for his next book [which] is to let some real experts check it before publication.'79 \n (answersingenesis.org)\n \n emoticon_xbouncer\n\n \n \n Are you really going to argue for some week kneed bunch of christians , ..\n \n Christians that don't even have the balls to plainly write into our founding documents that god rules supreme, and gods law will be our law, and it will be soley based on the bible. \n \n If this country is founded on god ... I would suggest that this particular god may be a little dissapointed with the soft language written in these documents. \n \n This god and it's followers should have long ago made it completly, and without question, clear that there would be no seperation, but demanded strict adhearence to it's word, and not allowed this silly notion of seperation of church and state!!!",

   "What kind of XXXXXX found a nation based on god, and then write into the rules that the church ( that represents god ) and the state should be kept seperate?\n \n Is this thread a joke?\nNo.\n \n I made the same point in the OP. The founding fathers must have been profoundly stupid that they founded a nation on so called \"christian principles\" and were unable to include a single article in the Constitution that shows their intent. In fact, an examination of the Constitution demonstrates that the intent was not to found this country on religious principles. As mentioned before, Article VI, 3. specifies that there should be no religious test for \"...any office or public trust under the United States.\" So it seems that the only reference to some religious principle is to state that no religious principle is to be used.\n \n All in all, when we ask for articles that show the \"christian nation\" intent of the founders, we get unsourced quotes, invented letters, and historical comments that have no bearing on the question. We also observed the straw man argument several times. The response was a challenge to show an article that claimed that the Constitution was based on deist principles. It only takes half a mind to figure that out, but most \"christian nation\" advocates don't seem to be able to do it.\n \n It is especially telling that during the Constitutional Convention there were two motions related to religion. One was a proposal to include some sort of recognition of Christianity in the Constitution. That proposal was defeated. The second case was a motion to begin sessions with a prayer. The session was adjourned without a vote. The matter was never brought up again.\n \n There is also the invention of some letter by \"Washington's granddaughter.\" Don't know who that might be. Martha Washington had a granddaughter (Eleanor \"Nellie\" Parke Custis Lewis) but George didn't. She once said when questioned about Washington's devotions, \"I never witnessed his private devotions. I never inquired about them.\"\n \n There are other rather humorous points. For example, there was some discussion about Madison's authority to speak to the purpose of the First Amendment. Funny, Madison wrote the first draft and introduced it in Congress. Funny that he would be unaware to the intent.\n \n So all in all, no one has been able to show that the intent of the founding documents of this country was to establish a christian nation. Quite the opposite.",

   "MrWriterLA posted this in another thread, and it should probably be brought up here to refute the repeated claims...\n \n \n\"We have staked the whole future of American civilization, not upon the power of government, far from it. We have staked the future of all of our political institutions upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.\"\n \n So said James Madison, architect of the Constitution, defender of religious freedom and fourth president of the United States, according to the Religious Right.\n \n But to church-state separationists and historians of the post-colonial period, something about this Madison quote has never felt quite right. It seemed unlikely that the same Madison who advocated \"total separation of the church from the state\" and battled to disestablish the Anglican Church in Virginia would say it. The sentiment appeared to clash with his well-known advocacy of a healthy distance between religion and government.\n \n A few years ago, with the quote popping up increasingly in the mass media (including Rush Limbaugh's daily radio show), Robert S. Alley, professor emeritus at the University of Richmond and author of James Madison on Religious Liberty, undertook a dogged effort to track it down. Enlisting the help of the editors of The Papers of James Madison at the University of Virginia, Alley scoured reams of documents, books and writings. After coming up empty-handed, the Madison scholar concluded that the quote was probably fictional.\n \n Now the major purveyor of the quote, Texas-based Religious Right propagandist David Barton, has admitted it's bogus. Last year Barton's group, WallBuilders' issued a one-page document titled \"Questionable Quotes,\" a list of 12 statements allegedly uttered by Founding Fathers and other prominent historical figures, that are now considered to be suspect or outright false. Madison's alleged comment about the Ten Commandments is number four on the list and is flatly declared by Barton to be \"false.\" (See [below] for a full list of the bogus quotes.)\n \n Advocates of separation of church and state were left breathless over Barton's audacity. For nearly 10 years, the Texas propagandist has traveled the country, putting on programs about America's alleged \"Christian heritage\" at fundamentalist churches and other venues. During these events, Barton argued that the separation of church and state is a myth foisted on the country by the Supreme Court 50 years ago. The United States, he insisted, was founded by Christians and was intended to be a fundamentalist-style \"Christian nation.\"\n \n What was Barton's proof for these claims? Many of the quotations he now admits are groundless! At least nine of the 12 were included in Barton's 1989 book, The Myth of Separation, and appeared in the video version, \"America's Godly Heritage.\" Barton was so enamored of one quote supposedly uttered by Benjamin Franklin (\"Whosoever shall introduce into the public affairs the principles of primitive Christianity will change the face of the world.\") that it was included on a biographical sketch WallBuilders distributes about Barton, saying it \"fully sums up what David believes and teachers.\" Barton now admits the quote is \"questionable\" and recommends people don't use it.\n \n Alley finds Barton's reliance on phony history disturbing. \"It's one thing to get up and make a speech and allude to something that isn't there, but when you have somebody parading a document in a book and that turns out to be an outright lie, it's more dangerous,\" Alley told Church & State magazine. \"The danger is that people will find credibility in what he does largely because he represents himself in that mode. He's a double fraud.\"\n \n Continued Alley, \"For Barton to withdraw these quotes is fine, but that doesn't change the fact that they were wrong to begin with.\" \n http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/founding.htm\n \n\n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=209728#post209728",

You allow yourself to be a dupe rather than think for yourself and research these doubtful and unsupported assertions.\n \nWhat you have blinded your eyes to, however, is that the majority of Americans at that time were indeed of the Christian faith.\nI thought that at one time too, until I actually educated myself. You can find the facts in books like the following, the first one written by the executive director of the Christian Legal Society. What do you know - a christian with the integrity to actually educate himself. The rest are historians. All agree that the population was less than 1 in 5 attending any church.\n \n Buzzard, Lynn R. 1982. Schools Haven't Got a Prayer. David C. Cook Publishing. Elgin, Ill.\n \n Frankel, Marvin E. 1994.

You can reach that conclusion by reading the founding documents - just like I said. There is no clause in the Constitution, Articles of Confederation, Bill of Rights, or Declaration of Independence that reflects christian principles any more than humanistic principles.\n \nYou have also come woefully short of identifying your pet deists as the mainstream thinkers and influences behind the DOI and the Constitution. So far you've come up with what, 5 deists (most or all of which don't fit the true definition of a deist)? LOL!\nSo it becomes of contest of how many can be named? You weren't paying attention. I named more than 5. Sadly you come up with nonsense trying to show that Jefferson, Washington, Franklin, Madison (there's 4) were christians. How about Paine, Rush, Morris? (3 more). And of course, there were the two Adams (Unitarians). But of course, that isn't the point. It wouldn't matter if these men had been pastafarians. The point is not what their religions were, but that they intended to found, and did found, a secular government free from the interference of religious zealots. Sadly, you and the rest of the revisionist American Taliban won't be happy until you have forced your religion on everyone. We need your religious icons on government buildings and your prayers in public schools.\n \nWhere's the beef? Recommend you go back to the drawing board and come up with something better.\nHow can it get better? You were unable to offer anything that contradicts my point. Clearly, based on the actual documents that founded this nation, this is not a \"christian nation.\" Clearly, since the opposition to the ratification of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights was led by Chrisitians on the grounds that they are \"Godless\" documents, they are not founded on christian principles. Perhaps you should go back to school and actually learn about our country.",

   "What are the moral foundations of America? And where does her great strength lie? Many of the founding fathers tell us that our nation was conceived on the principles of Christianity. \n\n \n One of the principles of Christianity in the 1780's was found in Christ's claim that his Kingdom was not of this world and his instructions not to render unto Caesar what belonged to God; which was known as \"Soul Liberty\" and latter took the name \"Separation of Church and State.\" \n \n \n A few years after the Constitution was ratified by the Continental Congress, a French statesman and historian by the name of Alexis deTocqueville traveled to America to see if he could discover the source of her tremendous spirit and strength. He remarked, \"Not until I went to the churches of America and heard her pulpits flame with righteousness did I come to understand the secret of her genius and power.\"\n\n \n Do you really believe that it was the Continental Congress that ratified the U. S. Constsitution; and are you unaware that it was the Strict Separation of Church and State during the the formative years of the Republic that enabled genuine Christianity to thrive and flourish up until the start of the Civil War. \n \n During the Early Years of the Republic there was no \"In God We Trust\" on the nation's coin, no \"under God\" in the pledge, no Ten Commandments in courtrooms, no prayer in Congress, the mail was transported on Sunday even if it did violate one of the Ten Commandments because religion was exempt from the cognizance of the government, the national legislature ignored those who claimed that it had a legal duty to financially support the Gospel in the Northwestern Territory and Congress decided that passing joint resolutions asking the President to issue religious advice to the people was a violation of the establishment clause.\n \n ********************************************\n \n PRINCIPAL CAUSES WHICH RENDER RELIGION POWERFUL IN AMERICA.\n \n Care taken by the Americans to separate the church from the state--The laws, public opinion, and even the exertions of the clergy concur to promote this end--Influence of religion upon the mind in the United States attributable to this cause--Reason for this--What is the natural state of men with regard to religion at the present time--What are the peculiar and incidental causes which prevent men, in certain countries, from arriving at this state.\n \n THE philosophers of the eighteenth century explained in a very simple manner the gradual decay of religious faith. Religious zeal, said they, must necessarily fail the more generally liberty is established and knowledge diffused. Unfortunately, the facts by no means accord with their theory. There are certain populations in Europe whose unbelief is only equaled by their ignorance and debasement; while in America, one of the freest and most enlightened nations in the world, the people fulfill with fervor all the outward duties of religion.\n \n On my arrival in the United States the religious aspect of the country was the first thing that struck my attention; and the longer I stayed there, the more I perceived the great political consequences resulting from this new state of things. In France I had almost always seen the spirit of religion and the spirit of freedom marching in opposite directions. But in America I found they were intimately united and that they reigned in common over the same country. My desire to discover the causes of this phenomenon increased from day to day. In order to satisfy it I questioned the members of all the different sects; I sought especially the society of the clergy, who are the depositaries of the different creeds and are especially interested in their duration. As a member of the Roman Catholic Church, I was more particularly brought into contact with several of its priests, with whom I became intimately acquainted. To each of these men I expressed my astonishment and explained my doubts. I found that they differed upon matters of detail alone, and that they all attributed the peaceful dominion of religion in their country mainly to the separation of church and state. do not hesitate to affirm that during my stay in America I did not meet a single individual, of the clergy or the laity, who was not of the same opinion on this point.\n \n This led me to examine more attentively than I had hitherto done the station which the American clergy occupy in political society. I learned with surprise that they filled no public appointments; 4 I did not see one of them in the administration, and they are not even represented in the legislative assemblies. In several states 5 the law excludes them from political life; public opinion excludes them in all. And when I came to inquire into the prevailing spirit of the clergy, I found that most of its members seemed to retire of their own accord from the exercise of power, and that they made it the pride of their profession to abstain from politics.\n \n I heard them inveigh against ambition and deceit, under whatever political opinions these vices might chance to lurk; but I learned from their discourses that men are not guilty in the eye of God for any opinions concerning political government which they may profess with sincerity, any more than they are for their mistakes in building a house or in driving a furrow. I perceived that these ministers of the Gospel eschewed all parties, with the anxiety attendant upon personal interest. These facts convinced me that what I had been told was true; and it then became my object to investigate their causes and to inquire how it happened that the real authority of religion was increased by a state of things which diminished its apparent force. These causes did not long escape my researches.\n \n The short space of threescore years can never content the imagination of man; nor can the imperfect joys of this world satisfy his heart. Man alone, of all created beings, displays a natural contempt of existence, and yet a boundless desire to exist; he scorns life, but he dreads annihilation. These different feelings incessantly urge his soul to the contemplation of a future state, and religion directs his musings thither. Religion, then, is simply another form of hope, and it is no less natural to the human heart than hope itself. Men cannot abandon their religious faith without a kind of aberration of intellect and a sort of violent distortion of their true nature; they are invincibly brought back to more pious sentiments. Unbelief is an accident, and faith is the only permanent state of mankind. If we consider religious institutions merely in a human point of view, they may be said to derive an inexhaustible element of strength from man himself, since they belong to one of the constituent principles of human nature. \n \n Source of Information: Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America, Volume One, Chapter XVII Page 308 (1835) \n \n \n http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/DETOC/1_ch17.htm",

You allow yourself to be a dupe rather than think for yourself and research these doubtful and unsupported assertions.\n\n \n His lips are moving again....\n \n \nI thought that at one time too, until I actually educated myself.\n\n \n Is that why you think you've come up with 3-5 or so deists, because that's education? You were demolished. Where's the beef? \n \n \n \n Who really cares since this country was not founded on christian principles anyway.\n\n \n In a letter to Thomas Jefferson dated June 28, 1813, John Adams wrote: \"The general principles on which the (founding) fathers achieved independence were....the general principles of Christianity.\"\n \n So now it's you vs. John Adams.\n \n \nSo it becomes of contest of how many can be named? You weren't paying attention. I named more than 5. Sadly you come up with nonsense trying to show that Jefferson, Washington, Franklin, Madison (there's 4) were christians. How about Paine, Rush, Morris? (3 more). And of course, there were the two Adams (Unitarians).\n\n \n No, the nonsense is yours. I've already demolished your claims on Jefferson, Washington, and Franklin. Madison is neither here nor there. If anything he was a Unitarian. As for Paine, he wasn't even a signer of anything except his pathetic \"Age of Reason,\" which was summarily rebutted at the time. Benjamin Rush? You mean the same Benjamin Rush who during his final illness wrote to his wife, \"....blessed Jesus, wash away all my impurities, and receive me into Thy everlasting kingdom.\"? Oh yeah, what a deist he is!! LOL!! And Morris? Well, he spoke of God, but I haven't seen anything yet where he identified himself as a deist. And I've already responded on the Adams. \n \n So, you've got squat! Zero so far. But I will give you 3 just to massage your ego. I don't know who those 3 would be, though. I imagine you can invent some more for us overnight. \n \n \nSadly, you and the rest of the revisionist American Taliban won't be happy until you have forced your religion on everyone. \n\n \n As opposed to the heathen secularists imposing their ungodly subjective nonsense on people? I'll take God's way any day. \n \n When you get something you can sink your teeth into, come back and try again.",

Citizens of this profession being infinitely enlightened with respect to the various duties of life, and having the warmest zeal to fulfil them, must be perfectly sensible of the rights of natural defence. The more they believe themselves indebted to religion, the more they would think due to their country.

   "Why The U. S. Constitution Is Immoral\n \n The United States Constitution, does not recognise the revealed will of God. All moral government flows from God the Sovereign of the Universe, and must be regulated by his will, otherwise it cannot bind the conscience. In the original state of man, the moral law, which we written on his heart, included in it the will of God relative to this as we as all other moral duties. \n \n To meet the exigency of man's fallen condition, God has given a new revelation of his will, in the scriptures of the Old and New Testaments. All who enjoy this new, and now more perfect revelation of the will of God, are bound to regulate their civil and political relations by it, as well as those that immediately relate to the worship of God. \n \n To proceed on the ground that man may dispense with the instruction of scripture in the constitution and management civil government, is unquestionably to set aside the authority of God when He speaks to us in the holy scriptures. The universal depravity of human nature unfits men for performing either the personal or social duties of life, in a manner agreeable to the will of God. \n \n The scriptures contain instructions how all these duties are to be performed. \"To the law and to the testimony\" we are commanded to look. And no moral principle whatever can it be admitted, that men may form their constitutions of civil government according to the mere light nature, when the author of nature has given another and a more perfect rule by which they may be flamed. \n \n The authority which binds men to the light of nature, as far as it is applicable, binds them also to the scriptures, as the subsequent and more complete revelation of the will of God. \"Revelation contains the true standard of civil government. \n \n It prescribes the supreme criterion according to which those states which have ordained this superior light should act in forming their constitutions, choosing their officers, and determining their leading objects.\" In the Constitution of the United States, however, there is not the most distant allusion to the revealed will of God. \n \n The Bible, as containing the fundamental principles of political morality, is not even indirectly acknowledged. Here then is an evident violation of a moral duty.-Men are bound, as has been proved by the preceding observations, to make the Bible the basis of their political constitutions; but the United States of America have entirely excluded it from the charter which binds them together as a nation. \n \n Who wrote this?\n \n Fred",

   "Who wrote this?\nThe Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, North America in 1834. It reflects the arguments presented by most christian churches in 1788 during the debates about the ratification of the Constitution. Apparently, in 1834 the Presbyterians still considered the Constitution to be Godless. The last of your quote says, \nIn the Constitution of the United States, however, there is not the most distant allusion to the revealed will of God.

The growth of that fungus was especially augmented with the rise of creationism in the 60s as a backlash to the improved science curriculums in our high schools. Thus, christians now invent quotes, reassign religions to men long dead, distort the meaning of authors by taking quotes out of context, and so on. The purpose is to convince themselves that this is a christian nation so that fundamentalist christianity can be taught in our schools, so that children can be forced to recite fundamentalist prayers in school and at school events, and so that all citizens will have to acquiesce to fundamentalist religion as \"truth\" by it's very presence in our government buildings.",

   " It is clear that the philosophy behind the Declaration of Independence was deist, \"Nature and Nature's God,\" ... and blah, blah\n\n \n Nature's God\n \n To discover what the Founders meant by the phrase \"the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God,\" we need only look at what Sir William Blackstone wrote. Blackstone defined law, in general, as a rule of action established by a superior that an inferior must obey. By example, he noted that God had established certain natural laws, like gravity, which physical things, be they rocks, plants, or human bodies, must always obey. Blackstone passed over these unalterable physical laws to focus on the laws that govern human action, the laws by which man, \"a creature endowed with both reason and free-will, is commanded to make use of those faculties in the general regulation of his behavior.\"\n \n To explain how the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God applied to human conduct and government, Blackstone began with the fact that man is created by God. The Founders chose this same starting point in the opening sentence of the Declaration's second paragraph - the paragraph that explains how the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God gave us the right to throw off British rule. Blackstone then explained that because of man's state of total dependence on God, man is obliged to restrain his free-will and should, instead, \"in all points, conform to his Maker's will.\" \"This will of his Maker,\" Blackstone said, \"is called the law of nature,\" and is the \"eternal immutable laws of good and evil\" - the rules for what is right and wrong - to which God Himself conforms. So the first principle on which the Founder's staked American independence, and freedom for the American people - \"the Laws of Nature\" - are God's own rules of right and wrong!\n \n http://www.citizensoldier.org/decfour.html\n \n \"The Laws of Nature are the Laws of God, Whose authority can be superseded by no power on earth. A legislature must not obstruct our obedience to Him from whose punishment they cannot protect us. All human constitutions which contradict His laws, we are in conscience bound to disobey.\" George Mason, 1772\n \n What did America's Founding Fathers mean when they spoke of \"the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God?\"\n \n John Locke (1632-1704) was a Christian philosopher who had a great influence in America. He said:\n \n \"The Law of Nature stands as an eternal rule to all men, legislators as well as others. The rules that they make for other men's actions must . . . be conformable to the Law of Nature, i.e., to the will of God. Laws human must be made according to the general laws of Nature, and without contradiction to any positive law of Scripture, otherwise they are ill made.Locke, Two Treatises on Government, Bk II sec 135. (quoting Hooker's Ecclesiastical Polity, 1.iii, \u00a7 9 )\n \n William Blackstone (1723-1780) was cited more frequently than Locke by America's Founding Fathers. In 1810 Thomas Jefferson wryly commented that American lawyers used Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England with the same dedication and reverence that Muslims used the Koran.\n \n Blackstone described the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God in a chapter in his Commentaries entitled, \"Of the Nature of Laws in General.\" Among the highlights:\n \n \"Man, considered as a creature, must necessarily be subject to the laws of his Creator, for he is entirely a dependent being. And consequently, as man depends absolutely upon his Maker for everything, it is necessary that he should, in all points, conform to his Maker's will. This will of his Maker is called the law of nature.\n \n This law of nature, being coeval [existing at the same time - ed.] with mankind, and dictated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe in all countries, and at all times: no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their force and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original. The doctrines thus delivered we call the revealed or divine law, and they are to be found only in the holy scriptures. These precepts, when revealed, are found upon comparison to be really a part of the original law of nature, as they tend in all their consequences to man's felicity [happiness].\n \n Upon these two foundations, the law of nature and the law of revelation, depend all human laws; that is to say, no human laws should be suffered to contradict these. \n \n James Wilson, Associate Justice on the first United States Supreme Court and signer of both the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution, said:\n \n \"Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divine .... Far from being rivals or enemies, religion and law are twin sisters, friends, and mutual assistants. Indeed, these two sciences run into each other.\"\n \n \"No sovereign ought to permit those who are under his Command to violate the precepts of the Law of Nature, which forbids all injuries.\" John Jay\n \n http://members.aol.com/Craig4Congress/issues/religion/nature.htm\n \n And who was Thomas Jefferson's God? That sometimes depended on what day it was. However, Jefferson must have certainly been referring to the God of the Old Testament when he said the following: \n \n \"I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who led our fathers, as Israel of old, from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessities and comforts of life.\" \n - Thomas Jefferson\n \n The overwhelming God of the vast majority of the Founding Fathers was the God of the Bible, who created nature.\n \n You lose (and yes, you missed it).",

All human constitutions which contradict His laws, we are in conscience bound to disobey.\" George Mason, 1772 \n\n \n The Thomas Jefferson/James Madison type of Strict Separation of Church and state is all about preventing the legislature from obstructing our obligation to the Creator to render such homage and such homage only was dictated by one's conscience and convictions.\n \n \n John Locke (1632-1704) was a Christian philosopher who had a great influence in America. He said: \"The Law of Nature stands as an eternal rule to all men, legislators as well as others. The rules that they make for other men's actions must . . . be conformable to the Law of Nature, i.e., to the will of God. [B]Laws human must be made according to the general laws of Nature, and without contradiction to any positive law of Scripture..\n\n \n Now please show us were the men who wrote and ratified the Constitution and Bill of Rights ever said that the laws of the United State must be made without contradiction to any positive law of Scripture? \n \n \n William Blackstone (1723-1780) was cited more frequently than Locke by America's Founding Fathers. In 1810 Thomas Jefferson wryly commented that American lawyers used Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England with the same dedication and reverence that Muslims used the Koran.\n\n \n Show me where the men who wrote and ratified the Constitution and Bill of Rights ever cited Blackstone as an authority on relgious liberty. Are you familiar with Saint George Tucker's comments on Blackstone in Tucker's 1803 work titled \"View of the Constitution\" which was the first extended, systematic commentary on the United States Constitution after its ratification and later its amendment by the Bill of Rights. \n \n The work was originally part of Tucker's \"Americanized\" or \"republicanized\" edition of the multivolume Commentaries on the Laws of England by Sir William Blackstone. Generations of American law students, lawyers, judges, and statesmen learned their Blackstone - and also their understanding of the Constitution - through Saint George Tucker. \n \n FVF",

   " Blackstone described the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God in a chapter in his Commentaries entitled, \"Of the Nature of Laws in General.\" Among the highlights:\n \n \"Man, considered as a creature, must necessarily be subject to the laws of his Creator, for he is entirely a dependent being. And consequently, as man depends absolutely upon his Maker for everything, it is necessary that he should, in all points, conform to his Maker's will. This will of his Maker is called the law of nature.\n \n This law of nature, being coeval [existing at the same time - ed.] with mankind, and dictated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe in all countries, and at all times: no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their force and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original. The doctrines thus delivered we call the revealed or divine law, and they are to be found only in the holy scriptures. These precepts, when revealed, are found upon comparison to be really a part of the original law of nature, as they tend in all their consequences to man's felicity [happiness].\n \n Upon these two foundations, the law of nature and the law of revelation, depend all human laws; that is to say, no human laws should be suffered to contradict these. \n\n \n Show me where the men who wrote and ratified the Constitution and Bill of Rights ever cited those passages by Blackstone on an issue of Church and State or religious freedom.",

   "Nature's God\n \n To discover what the Founders meant by the phrase \"the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God,\" we need only look at what Sir William Blackstone wrote.\nActually, consulting an anglican anti-catholic who wrote on common law wouldn't be a very good source. It would be better to consult deists, since Blackstone didn't discuss what deists meant by their euphimisms, but what he thought the meaning of \"law\" was. Deists avoided mention of the christian god by expressions such as Nature and Nature's God, The Creator, Divine Providence, Providence, Supreme Being, and so forth.\n \n Your quote by George Mason is quite nice, but what does that have to do with christianity, or christian principles? I don't see the mention of Jesus in any of that - not even a mention of the Bible.\n \n John Locke a \"christian philosopher?\" Well, that explains why we can't find any trace of influence from the Bible in the early documents of this country. Locke rejected revelation as a source of knowledge and thought man should rely on experience and reflection on experience. I understand now. The christian principles that you are arguing aren't found in christian revelation.\n \n You post a lot of babble that mentions divine law and throws in the word god a time or two, but none of it has anything to do with christianity. Were these men so stupid that they couldn't actually link what they were discussing to Christ if they actually were? Why do you think that every mention of the word god is a reference to your petty little tyrant?\n \n And of all things, you're back to arguing that Jefferson was a christian. You can't even make up your mind about that.\n \n Perhaps you are so slow that you still haven't understood the point. The discussion is about \"christian principles\" in the founding documents of the United States. Your discussion fails to relate to the founding documents and fails to even verify that the men you quote were talking about christianity.\n \n You still can't meet the challenge. So far I've done a better job than you with Article I, secion 9, 1.",

   "THE STATE BECOMES THE CHURCH:\n JEFFERSON AND MADISON\n \n It is no exaggeration to say that on Sundays in Washington during the administrations of Thomas Jefferson (1801-1809) and of James Madison (1809-1817) the state became the church. Within a year of his inauguration, Jefferson began attending church services in the House of Representatives. Madison followed Jefferson's example, although unlike Jefferson, who rode on horseback to church in the Capitol, Madison came in a coach and four. Worship services in the House--a practice that continued until after the Civil War--were acceptable to Jefferson because they were nondiscriminatory and voluntary. Preachers of every Protestant denomination appeared. (Catholic priests began officiating in 1826.) As early as January 1806 a female evangelist, Dorothy Ripley, delivered a camp meeting-style exhortation in the House to Jefferson, Vice President Aaron Burr, and a \"crowded audience.\" Throughout his administration Jefferson permitted church services in executive branch buildings. The Gospel was also preached in the Supreme Court chambers. \n \n Jefferson's actions may seem surprising because his attitude toward the relation between religion and government is usually thought to have been embodied in his recommendation that there exist \"a wall of separation between church and state.\" In that statement, Jefferson was apparently declaring his opposition, as Madison had done in introducing the Bill of Rights, to a \"national\" religion. In attending church services on public property, Jefferson and Madison consciously and deliberately were offering symbolic support to religion as a prop for republican government.\n \n \"Wall of Separation\"?\n \n Thomas Jefferson's reply of January 1, 1802, to an address of congratulations from the Danbury (Connecticut) Baptist Association contains a phrase familiar in today's political and judicial circles: \"a wall of separation between church and state.\" Many in the United States, including the courts, have used this phrase to interpret the Founders' intentions regarding the relationship between government and religion, as set down by the First Amendment to the Constitution: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . . . .\" However, the meaning of this clause has been the subject of passionate dispute for the past fifty years. \n \n Presented here are both the handwritten, edited draft of the letter and an adjusted facsimile showing the original unedited draft. The draft of the letter reveals that, far from dashing it off as a \"short note of courtesy,\" as some have called it, Jefferson labored over its composition. Jefferson consulted Postmaster General Gideon Granger of Connecticut and Attorney General Levi Lincoln of Massachusetts while drafting the letter. That Jefferson consulted two New England politicians about his messages indicated that he regarded his reply to the Danbury Baptists as a political letter, not as a dispassionate theoretical pronouncement on the relations between government and religion. \n \n The Lord's Prayer in Jefferson's Hand\n \n Jefferson liked to experiment with and use cryptology. There are several different codes in his papers at the Library of Congress, including this one based on the Lord's Prayer, which Jefferson carefully wrote out as a block of consecutive letters. \n \n The Danbury Baptist Letter, as Originally Drafted\n \n The Library of Congress is grateful to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory for recovering the lines obliterated from the Danbury Baptist letter by Thomas Jefferson. He originally wrote \"a wall of eternal separation between church and state,\" later deleting the word \"eternal.\" He also deleted the phrase \"the duties of my station, which are merely temporal.\" Jefferson must have been unhappy with the uncompromising tone of both of these phrases, especially in view of the implications of his decision, two days later, to begin attending church services in the House of Representatives.\n \n Reserved Seats at Capitol Services\n \n Here is a description, by an early Washington \"insider,\" Margaret Bayard Smith (1778-1844), a writer and social critic and wife of Samuel Harrison Smith, publisher of the National Intelligencer, of Jefferson's attendance at church services in the House of Representatives: \"Jefferson during his whole administration was a most regular attendant. The seat he chose the first day sabbath, and the adjoining one, which his private secretary occupied, were ever afterwards by the courtesy of the congregation, left for him.\"\n \n The Old House of Representatives\n \n Church services were held in what is now called Statuary Hall from 1807 to 1857. The first services in the Capitol, held when the government moved to Washington in the fall of 1800, were conducted in the \"hall\" of the House in the north wing of the building. In 1801 the House moved to temporary quarters in the south wing, called the \"Oven,\" which it vacated in 1804, returning to the north wing for three years. Services were conducted in the House until after the Civil War. The Speaker's podium was used as the preacher's pulpit. \n \n A Millennialist Sermon Preached in Congress\n \n This sermon on the millennium was preached by the Baltimore Swedenborgian minister, John Hargrove (1750-1839) in the House of Representatives. One of the earliest millennialist sermons preached before Congress was offered on July 4, 1801, by the Reverend David Austin (1759-1831), who at the time considered himself \"struck in prophesy under the style of the Joshua of the American Temple.\" Having proclaimed to his Congressional audience the imminence of the Second Coming of Christ, Austin took up a collection on the floor of the House to support services at \"Lady Washington's Chapel\" in a nearby hotel where he was teaching that \"the seed of the Millennial estate is found in the backbone of the American Revolution.\"\n \n First Catholic Sermon in the House\n \n On January 8, 1826, Bishop John England (1786-1842) of Charleston, South Carolina, became the first Catholic clergyman to preach in the House of Representatives. The overflow audience included President John Quincy Adams, whose July 4, 1821, speech England rebutted in his sermon. \n \n Woman Preacher in the House (and call for revival!)\n \n In 1827, Harriet Livermore (1788-1868), the daughter and granddaughter of Congressmen, became the second woman to preach in the House of Representatives. The first woman to preach before the House (and probably the first woman to speak officially in Congress under any circumstances) was the English evangelist, Dorothy Ripley (1767-1832), who conducted a service on January 12, 1806. Jefferson and Vice President Aaron Burr were among those in a \"crowded audience.\" Sizing up the congregation, Ripley concluded that \"very few\" had been born again and broke into an urgent, camp meeting style exhortation, insisting that \"Christ's Body was the Bread of Life and His Blood the drink of the righteous.\"\n \n Communion Service in the Treasury Building\n \n Manasseh Cutler here describes a four-hour communion service in the Treasury Building, conducted by a Presbyterian minister, the Reverend James Laurie: \"Attended worship at the Treasury. Mr. Laurie alone. Sacrament. Full assembly. Three tables; service very solemn; nearly four hours.\" \n \n Adams's Description of a Church Service in the Supreme Court\n \n John Quincy Adams here describes the Reverend James Laurie, pastor of a Presbyterian Church that had settled into the Treasury Building, preaching to an overflow audience in the Supreme Court Chamber, which in 1806 was located on the ground floor of the Capitol. \n \n The Old Supreme Court Chamber\n \n Description of church services in the Supreme Court chamber by Manasseh Cutler (1804) and John Quincy Adams (1806) indicate that services were held in the Court soon after the government moved to Washington in 1800.\n \n Church Services in Congress after the Civil War\n \n Charles Boynton (1806-1883) was in 1867 chaplain of the House of Representatives and organizing pastor of the First Congregational Church in Washington, which was trying at that time to build its own sanctuary. In the meantime the church, as Boynton informed potential donors, was holding services \"at the Hall of Representatives\" where \"the audience is the largest in town. . . .nearly 2000 assembled every Sabbath\" for services, making the congregation in the House the \"largest Protestant Sabbath audience then in the United States.\" The First Congregational Church met in the House from 1865 to 1868. \n \n House of Representatives, After the Civil War\n \n The House moved to its current location on the south side of the Capitol in 1857. It contained the \"largest Protestant Sabbath audience\" in the United States when the First Congregational Church of Washington held services there from 1865 to 1868. \n \n Compliments: Library of Congress\n \n http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel06-2.html\n \n \"Separation of Church and State\"?

   "THE STATE BECOMES THE CHURCH:\n JEFFERSON AND MADISON\n The Old House of Representatives\n \n Church services were held in what is now called Statuary Hall from 1807 to 1857.

S. GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS FOR CHURCH SERVICES \n \n The following evidence from the official records of Congress convinces me that there were \"attempts\" to use the Oven for religious services.\n [*]In December 1801 the House appears to have declined a proposal by the two Chaplains to hold divine services in the \"Oven.\" The proposal was read by the Speaker but no one expressed any interest in the proposal and it never made it to the clerk\"s table. (I found no similar proposal to use the new magnificent Senate Chamber in the Senate Wing of the Capitol)\n [*]In January 1802 the Senate appears to have denied permission for the use a room in the Capitol as a place of worship on Sundays, during the winter. The letter request was read by the President of the Senate, no one expressed interest and it never made it to the clerk's table. http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj003232)): \n [*]In November, 1804 the House Doorkeeper twice requested rules regarding the performance of divine service in the Representatives' Chamber, when the House is not in session.\" The request was assigned to committee but never reported out. http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(hj0058)):\n [*]In December 1810 the Senate rejected a proposal \"that a chaplain shall perform divine service on the Sabbath day in the Representatives' Hall.\" http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?hlaw:5:./temp/~ammem_6O8j:\n It is most odd that I find no evidence of any official authorization by the House or Senate for religious services in the Capitol Building.\n \n FVf",

   "Presidential Religious Recommendations Not Legitimate Legal Precedent \n \n Those who reject the authority of Christ and foolishly advocate government authority over the duty which we owe to our Creator frequently cite - as legal precedent for government authority to issue religious advice including the recommendation that we obey the Ten Commandments - the joint resolution passed by Congress in 1789 requesting President George Washington to issue religious advice to the American people . However, a close examination of the historical evidence reveals that Congress believed the joint resolution was in conflict with the principle of no civil authority over religion and had no intent to establish a legal precedent or to assume advisory authority over the religon of the people. \n \n The proposal to pass the 1789 resolution was made in the House just a few days before the end of the first session of the First U. S. Congress. It was contested on legal grounds that it was a religious matter and as such was excluded from Congressional authority, and on moral grounds that it mimicked European customs that made a mockery of thanksgivings. Interestingly, the supporters of the proposal did not even argue that the new U. S. Constitution granted Congress the authority to pass such a resolution. Instead, they argued that the resolution was justified by the rejoicings and thanksgiving rendered upon the completion of Solomon's Temple in 956 B. C., and the practice of the Continental Congress. \n \n The most reasonable conclusion, based on the legislative history, is that Congress believed it had no power under the Constitution to pass the resolution; however, a trivial deviation from strict Constitutional principles was warranted by the extraordinary occasion of the peaceful establishment of a new system of national government. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the First U. S. Congress did not pass similar resolution the next year. The conclusion and its confirmation are further bolstered by the fact that Congress would not pass another joint resolution of a religious nature for twenty-four years. Congress clearly did believe that issuing religious recommendations to the people was consistent with the principles of the Constitution.\n \n President George Washington proved he was not a genuine Christian (one who acknowledges the exclusive authority of Christ over the duty which we owe to the Creator) when he abused his civil authority by the corruption of religion for political purposes. He issued a foolish recommendation, without even a joint resolution from Congress, on January 1, 1795 recommending that the people pray and give thanks for \"the suppression of the late insurrection\" in Pennsylvania. (The \"Whiskey Rebellion\") John Adams also proved to be a Counterfeit Christian by issuing two blatantly politically influenced religious recommendations, in four years, without a joint resolution from Congress.\n \n President Thomas Jefferson respected the authority of God and flatly refused to issue religious recommendations during his eight years in office. An experiment with religious proclamations during the War of 1812 by Congress and President Madison backfired when \"the language of scripture itself was employed by divines in their sermons, and by magistrates in their proclamations, to point political sarcasm and to rekindle political rage.\" \n \n Congress learned a lesson. It never passed another joint resolution asking the President to issue religious advice to the people. \n \n An attempt by Henry Clay in 1828 to pass a joint resolution asking President Andrew Jackson to issue a recommendation to fast passed in the Senate. It was the subject of a lively debate in the House but it died on the table with out a final vote. \n \n The proclamations... recommending fasting and prayer... were an assumption of power not warranted by the constitution, or rather prohibited, by the true spirit of the third article of amendments.  Some persons excused the act as amounting only to the advice of the president as an individual. Why then was it clothed with all the forms of authority, the seal of the United States, and the attestation of the secretary of state? See Saint George Tucker; Tucker's Blackstone; Volume 1 Appendix Note D Section 15 Executive Powers Footnote no. 303. Published in 1803. http://www.constitution.org/tb/t1d15000.htm\n \n The 1789 joint resolution of Congress for an executive recommendation of prayer and thanksgiving cannot be accepted as a legitimate legal precedent when there is no provision in the Constitution that grants such authority; The First U. S. Congress never claimed that the resolution was Constitutional; the proponents of the resolution never argued that it was Constitutional; The First Congress did not pass another religious resolution the next year; Congress did not pass another religious resolution for a almost a quarter of a century; only eight such resolutions were passed during the first twenty-four years of the Republic; no religious resolutions were passed for at least the next one hundred years; George Washington never claimed his religious proclamations were Constitutional; John Adams never claimed his religious proclamations were Constitutional; James Madison never claimed his were legal and wrote that religious proclamations made \"no part of the trust delegated to political rulers\"; and James Madison's view of religious freedom, and his interpretation of the First Amendment, eventually prevailed during the Early Years of the Republic.\n \n FVF",
