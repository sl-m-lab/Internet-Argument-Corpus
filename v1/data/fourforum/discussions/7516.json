He says the President made it clear that he had already decided to go to war, despite still pressing for a UN resolution.\n \n \"The US was thinking of flying U2 reconnaissance aircraft with fighter cover over Iraq, painted in UN colours. If Saddam fired on them, he would be in breach,\" the book reports Mr Bush telling Mr Blair at the meeting.\n \n If the U2 idea was a serious proposal, it would have made sense only if the spy plane was ordered to fly at an altitude within range of Iraqi missiles. Mr Bush's reference in the recorded conversation to the U2 being escorted by fighter aircraft indicates that that is what he had in mind.\n \n The U2, America's most sophisticated aerial reconnaissance aircraft, can operate at 90,000ft, taking high-resolution photographs of targets. At this altitude, the U2 would have been beyond the range of Iraqi surface-to-air missiles.\n \n U2s were made available to the UN weapons inspectors to help them in their search for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (WMD). But there has never been any suggestion until now that Mr Bush had thought about painting one of them in UN colours to deceive Saddam.\n \n Later in the same meeting the President said it was also possible that a defector could be brought out who would give a public presentation about Saddam's WMD, and there was a small possibility that Saddam would be assassinated.\n \n The book also claims that the President \"thought it unlikely that there would be internecine warfare between the different religious and ethnic groups\".\n \n President Bush also made clear, according to the book which was featured on Channel 4 News, that he would go to war irrespective of whether there was a second UN resolution.\n \n \"The US would put its full weight behind efforts to get another resolution and would 'twist arms' and 'even threaten'. But he had to say that if, ultimately, we failed, military action would follow anyway,\" the book said.\n \n The section of the book is based on a memo of the meeting. Mr Blair responded that he was \"solidly with the President and ready to do whatever it took to disarm Saddam\". But the Prime Minister said that a second Security Council resolution would provide an insurance policy against the unexpected, and international cover, including with the Arabs.\n \n Mr Sands' book says that the meeting focused on the need to identify evidence that Saddam had committed a material breach of his obligations under the existing UN Resolution 1441. There was concern that insufficient evidence had been unearthed by the UN inspection team, led by Dr Hans Blix.\n \n That was why other options, such as the aircraft in UN colours, were considered.\n \n Last night Sir Menzies Campbell, acting Liberal Democrat leader, said: \"If these allegations are accurate, the Prime Minister and President Bush were determined to go to war with or without a second UN resolution, and Britain was signed up to do so by the end of January 2003.\"\n \n He added: \"By then it was clear that there was no credible evidence of weapons of mass destruction, the stated justification for the moves against Saddam Hussein. The fact that consideration was apparently given to using American military aircraft in UN colours to provoke Saddam graphically illustrates the rush to war.\"\n\n \n \n How many more lies are going to have to be revealed before the war lovers can be convinced that the Iraq war was part of the neocon program of \"Full Spectrum Dominance\" and nothing to do with the noble aspirations constantly parroted by our war criminal leaders?",

Current US administration has refocused the US public to perceive any disagreement with any US policy as a threat, including pragmatic decisions to avoid USD as a reserve currency. Russia is already accepting Euros as an oil currency, Iran is on course to do the same and Saddam was just a little ahead of his time and Iraq too small to defend itself against the US when making that same decision. Who's to say all OPEC nations aren't already accepting Euros as oil currency? The Sauds ship only a small portion of their oil to the US and their finance people have been educated in the world's finest universities for generations. It would be difficult to believe they aren't hedging their wealth against USD decline.",

That is oil investros recognizing (and rightfully so) that sanctions against Iran would significantly decrease available oil and lead to massive spike in prices. \n \n As far as the Oil Bourse, that is just sound economic policy. every coutnry on the planet is trying to decrease the amount of USD they are holding in their reserves. Most coutnries are going to a basket of mixed currency, generally a very secretive basket. They are all tying to unload dollars without crashing the dollar, which would render the dollar reserves they do still have worthless. The Iranians are tired of taking oil payments in a currency that is in long term decline. Forcing the world to sel and buy oil in USD essentailly creates demand for the dollar, and we tax the whole world through inflation.

Where your logic is flawed is in the fact that it is not done out of malice, but rather from a sense of economic self preservation. \n \n At one time, oil payments in dollars made sense because we were the worlds largest exporter of damn near everything. Oil producing nations took their oil payments in dollars and spent those dollars on US goods. In addition to the benifit of buying and selling in the same currency, the oil producing nations could keep their reserves in a stable high value currency.\n \n Now, the US does doesn't export squat and we are uncompetitive ont he items we do export. Oil producing nations still sell their oil in dollars, but have to buy their equipment with Euros or Yuan. Since the dollar has been steadily dropping, that essentially means that they are getting less for their oil before. Additionally, with the erosion of our industiral infrastructure, and our massive deficits, the dollar is no longer especially stable, and the trend is downward, meaning that other countries reserves are also decreased because they are holding junk currency.\n \n With the situation being what it is, conversion to a non dollar currency is essential for both oil producing nations and nations holding dollar reserves. The conversion is certainly foing to hurt the US, but it no more an act of malice than firing an unproductive employee.",

The nuclear/uranium enrichment does not make any sense in light of the fact that Iran is running heavy water reactors that contantly spew plutonium. Plutonium is a much better material for nukes than enriched uranium (which is why the russians built so many breeder reactors). \n \n The question here is how long we can continue to attack anybody who accepts non dollar payments for oil. \n \n I think that even the petro Euro is little more than a stopgap between the dollar and the sensible currency for future oil payments...the yuan. Before we see the yuan being accepted though it needs to be fully convertible and China need sto do a little work on its internal stability. Of all the industrialized nations, China shows the most potential for solid, steady growth. Europe will fail as the US does (Europe had a chance of beting this fate but ###### it away with infightign and patriotism), leaving the chinese as THE world power.",
