To an extension mandatory storage requirements can no longer be enforced in any of the 50 states, all those local laws have to come down. Bans on \"assault weapons\" are going to fall next because those weapons you seek to demonize are very common in this country, making them in common use and subject to all constitutional protections. The same goes for detachable box magazines of any imaginable size and capacity. Public housing authorities have admitted defeat and are no longer preventing residents from being armed. And that's just the beginning.\n\n What percentage of gun laws do you predict will be invalidated? 1%? 0.1%? 0.01%? \"Common use\" is pretty vague. I wouldn't get your hopes up. How many assault weapons are owned by Americans compared to handguns?",

   "It may not have been challenged by the plaintiffs in the case, but the Supreme Court certainly did take the opportunity to address the constitutionality of laws restricting such weapons. I suspect you haven't read Heller.\n\n \n I've read Heller. Their little mention of restrictions on machine guns isn't sufficient to set any kind of precedence on the constitutionality of the rider that was attached to the 1986 Gun Owners Protection Act. All it did was help establish exactly what the Heller case was about, not what it wasn't about.\n \n \nI think you're missing the point. Even if the right is not limited to its civic purpose,\n\n \n A right isn't tied to fulfilling a specified purpose. If it were that would make it a government sanctioned privilege. Why is that so hard for you to understand?\n \n \nthat doesn't mean that some other unstated purpose should play a more important role in interpretation of the amendment than the purpose that is explicitly stated in the text.\n\n \n The militia wasn't the purpose of the Second Amendment. Never has been, never will be. And you can't change that fact.\n \n Explain exactly why the Bill of Rights, a restriction on the authorities of government and a protection of the people, would contain a provision to empower the government. Why would the government need a constitutional amendment to assemble a militia army? Why would they need that authority spelled out in the Constitution? Explain that to us. Explain what exactly was preventing the government from simply passing a law to assemble a militia in times of crisis?\n \n There's no such thing as a right to serve in the military and die for your country. And since the government used the draft to compel people to serve, rather than letting them make the decision themselves, that would make serve an obligation that carried serious penalties for failure to comply. That means it wasn't a right and had nothing to do with the Second Amendment.\n \n \nWhat percentage of gun laws do you predict will be invalidated? 1%? 0.1%? 0.01%?\n\n \n Depends on how many laws are of a redundant nature and shared by various states. If multiple states have their own variation of another state's laws, then the percentage to be invalidated could be huge. And that's only going after the laws easiest to target.\n \n \n\"Common use\" is pretty vague. I wouldn't get your hopes up. How many assault weapons are owned by Americans compared to handguns?\n\n \n Which definition of \"assault weapon\" do you want to use in this matter? Should we go by the old standards set by the now defunct 1994 law? Or maybe the stricter standards proposed under HR 1022, or currently in place in California? Or should we go with the proposed language of various bills that would turn a regular handgun into an \"assault weapon\" if it were fitted with a compensated barrel? In making the determination should we also extend the proposed terms of identification to historic firearms from the early 20th century?\n \n Let's be serious though. What defined a firearms as an \"assault weapon\" was nothing more than pure cosmetics. Take them away, the resulting weapon would still function exactly the same, but it would no longer be considered an \"assault weapon\". The definition is nothing more than a symbolic attempt to try and scare the people. Even the Violence Policy Center admitted this fact.\n \n The definition of what qualifies as an \"assault weapon\" is extremely vague; perhaps more vague than any other standard. But one thing if for certain; the AR-15 platform is one of the most successful, and most widespread type of firearm designs available in the country. It's being made by countless companies all over. Armalite, Colt, Bushmaster, Rock River, Stag Arms, Smith & Wesson, Ruger, DPMS, Olympic Arms, Remington, etc. It's been adapted into countless variations, from lightweight carbines that excel in urban defense roles, to long barreled short magnum versions that're perfectly legal for taking deer and other such game.",

   "Heller found a trigger lock requirement unconstitutional because it interfered with \"the core lawful purpose of self-defense\". Yet the court had no trouble with laws that banned, for example, \"M-16 rifles and the like\" although the court admitted such laws could interfere with the stated militia purpose of the amendment.\n\n \n They did not examine whether or not laws that banned M-16s were legal or not because they were not discussing the legality of machine guns. They were discussing the legality of handgun bans and trigger lock requirements, and whether or not the second amendment recognizes an individual right, which they found it unquestionably DOES. In fact, the \"collective right\" argument was barely presented because it was so unquestionably nonsensical. \n \n The portion of the opinion that you are referring to is dicta...pretty much an immaterial, non binding statement by the judge that has pretty much no impact other than to fill white space on the paper. \n \n \n You know that constitutional interpretation has taken a truly bizarre turn when more weight is given to a claimed, unstated purpose of a right than the purpose that is explicitly stated within the actual text of the amendment. \n\n \n Sprry, but it is your thinking here that is bizarre. You point out above a section of the Heller opinion which is dicta that you claims proves your point (When it does no such thing) but apparently failed to read the portion of the opinion which is NOT dicta, where they first defined the term \"milita\" in the second amendment to mean pretty much every american capable of carrying a rifle, as well as the portion where they decided that the militia clause did NOT limit the scope of the right to keep and bear arms. \n \n Frankly they came to the only conclusion that a reasonable, english speaking person could. \n \n \nWhat has emerged from Heller is a highly watered down form of the original right now focused on personal self defense against intruders which probably leaves the door open for most of the gun control laws that pro-gun control groups advocate. The court truly did strain at a gnat and swallow a camel.\n\n \n 100% WRONG. What emerged from heller is that the second amendment is a fundamental, individual right. That is right there in the ruling. They stopped short of stating what kind of scrutiny should be applied, but that is a delaying tactic more than anything else. If they had ruled in heller that the government had to meet the standard of strict scrutiny, virtually all of our gun laws would have been struck down by now. Instead they have to fight them through on a case by case basis.\n \n In Heller they were VERY specific about what laws were immediately permissible. That pretty much boiled down to laws against felons having weapons, laws against the mentally defective having weapons, and laws against carrying weapons in sensitive places. Do you really think that they came up with that list randomly? Felons and those who are mentally defective do not have the right to vote, either. They cannot be doctors or lawyers in most states. Precedent for denying felons and mentally defective people rights is as old as the country. Likewise the restriction of rights in sensitive places is also as old as the country. That is why you cannot go protest in the white house entryway. You cant load up 75 of your closest friends and go picket in a courthouse hallway. \n \n They literally picked a list of conditions where there is a long history of curtailing fundamental rights. \n \n Sorry, but the gun control crowd trying to turn Heller into some kind of victory is beyond ludicrous. FAR from being a ruling that turned the second amendment into a self defense issue, what they did is ruled that the militia clause in no way restricted the amendment and that a desire for self defense was a perfectly acceptable reason to own a weapon.\n \n The entire collective rights nonsense was based on the militia clause. Virtually every attempt for the last 200 years to rationalize away the second amendment was based on the militia clause. The Heller court ruled that we are pretty much all part of the militia (barring the very young), but that does not matter since being in or out of the militia has absolutely no bearing on our fundamental right to keep and bear arms. \n \n The also blow the gun control crowds \"miller\" interpretations out of the water by ruling very clearly that the miller court did NOT rule that the RKBA was related to the militia clause but rather that they were ruling on the TYPE of weapon in question.",

I suspect you haven't read Heller. \n\n \n That was in dicta, which is meaningless, unless you want to see the machine gun ban struck down, which is EXACTLY what he was telling the pro gunners how to do. \n \n Go back and read it again. He essentially set the stage for a challenge of the machine gun ban and set the standards under which it would pretty much have to be fought given the heller ruling. Pretty much the only defense of the law is the \"in common use\", and in order for somebody to successfully argue in favor of the machine gun ban under those circumstances they would literally have to argue that since the government restricted machine guns, thus making them relatively scarce, the government had the right to do so. \n \n Only an absolute fool would agree with that argument. Any attorney who tried to make it would likely be found in contempt for knowingly making a frivolous argument. \n \n \n \nI think you're missing the point. Even if the right is not limited to its civic purpose, that doesn't mean that some other unstated purpose should play a more important role in interpretation of the amendment than the purpose that is explicitly stated in the text. \n\n \n Except that IS the purpose that was stated in the text, you just misread the text. That amendment was written by people who had just used the militia to kill the soldiers sent by their lawful government to provide law enforcement. And you want to argue that is not what they meant??????\n \n \n \nWhat percentage of gun laws do you predict will be invalidated? 1%? 0.1%? 0.01%? \"Common use\" is pretty vague. I wouldn't get your hopes up. How many assault weapons are owned by Americans compared to handguns?\n\n \n Probably not very many. However, the ones that ARE struck down will lead to massive changes in the US. \n \n There is NO possibility that background checks would pass even an intermediate scrutiny test.\n \n MOST of the NFA is as good as dead. There is no possibility of a successful \"in common use\" defense of the NFA, and no possibility whatsoever that a tax on an individual right will pass constitutional muster. In fact, there is already case law on that (poll taxes). Sorry, cant tax the exercise of a right. \n \n There are provisions in the NFA that could likely stand, but none of the taxes or background checks prior to purchase will pass muster.\n \n Registration laws are probably fine. There is nothing whatsoever in the Constitution or in the history of the US that would suggest that requiring registration would be unconstitutional. In fact, early militias in the US were required to keep membership rolls as well as what weapons what members had so they could provide an accurate picture of their strength. \n \n Contrary to your assertions, even the courts focus on self defense in this case is a MAJOR blow to the gun control crowd because it opens the door to challenges to concealed carry restrictions. After all, if you have a fundamental right to have a gun, and that is not limited to milita service, and wanting a gun for self defense is a perfectly justifiable exercise of your rights, it is difficult to make an argument that the state or federal government can require that you obtain a permit to exercise a protected exercise of a fundamental right.\n \n The Heller court did not strike down DC licensing completely but stated VERY clearly that they did not do so because the plaintiff stated during the course of the case that he would be satisfied if he was provided with a permit. \n \n It is likely that it will not be too long before pretty much any law requiring a permit for ownership of a weapon will be struck down. You cannot require a permit to exercise a right. The fact it is a right means you can do it whether the government likes it or not. Having to get permission from the government first (which is what a permit is) negates the entire concept of a right. That is also why the background checks will fail. When you do your background check and it comes back clean, the government has issued a defacto permit for you to purchase a weapon.",

It's been explained by others here, and very well in fact, exactly why Heller doesn't state that a machine gun ban is constitutional in nature.\n \n You don't get to argue that the little mention of machine guns is right, while their finding about the right held within the Second Amendment, is wrong.

Statutory rape laws might say that 18 is the age of consent in one state but in another state its 16. In reality most guns today are probably very dangerous and unusual compared to when the BOR was written and certainly werent in common use at that time.\n\n \n Gun myths &#8211; The \"easy\" conversion to full auto\n Gun Myths\n \n Something that's been XXXXXXX me off lately, especially concerning the recent shootings in Oakland, is the old wives' tale that keeps being passed around like gospel that semi-automatics are easily converted to fully automatic. We hear the countless references to 'drop in conversion' kits you can buy right here on the Interweb Tubes (of course, sans an actual link that would show the kits and their availability). We're told that any yahoo with a Dremel and a #6 ball-peen hammer can take Granpa's bolt action 30.06 and turn it into a lead-belching, fully automatic machine of death.\n \n Sorry, that's XXXXXXXX.\n \n How easy would it be to convert a 5-speed stick shift into an automatic transmission? It can be done but it's not as easy as simply purchasing the new transmission and slapping it in. You have a different clutch system. The stick itself is completely different. Certain parts won't mate to the frame correctly and either require drilling or complex attachments to make them fit. Weaponry is the same.\n \n Now, to be perfectly clear, I am talking about converting a firearm to automatic fire so that while the trigger is depressed it continues to fire. The key point is that when you release the trigger, it stops firing. To be fully automatic, you need to be able to control the firing sequence. Many firearms can be modified so that sometimes you can get more than one round per trigger pull. Hell, slam-firing sometimes happens on semi-autos without any modification, but that is not full auto.\n \n In order for a firearm to repeatedly fire off rounds, there are all sorts of mechanical timings that have to happen for reliable feeding. Release the hammer too soon, it slides along the bolt as the bolt is closing and may not strike hard enough to cook off a round. Bolts or bolt carriers that aren't designed for that kind of stress may not function long enough to give you the results you want. Gas systems may not be able to bleed off fast enough. There's dozens of variables that need to be taken into consideration and simply replacing a pin isn't going to solve all of them.\n \n It takes a machine shop to turn a firearm auto, not just a set of tools from Craftsman and a kit you got from the web. UPDATE &#8211; Ry illustrates that you can indeed get a Craftsman drill press and a kit off the Interweb Tubes and go full auto. From what I've been able to read and discern, while there are lowers that accept the kits easily, many of them still require milling to get things to work properly. So, while it's a bit easier to do than I wrote, it does not detract from the information that follows &#8211; full auto is pretty much useless as a hand held firing mode.\n \n Yes, certain firearms can be made to fire repeatedly by filing down X, Y, and Z, but not with any regularity or safety. And a gun that shoots repeatedly when you only intend it to shoot once isn't something that's going to be accurate enough to hit the target before the muzzle decides to try to hit a cloud or the ceiling\n Full auto is a boogey man, used by the media and anti-rights bigots to 'scare the white people' into thinking that gangs are walking around carrying mini-guns, mowing down entire playgrounds like Rambo or the Terminator. You cannot convert a semi-automatic into a fully automatic any easier than you can switch a car from stick to auto transmission. It requires tools, skills, and quite a bit of work to do to make a machine that is reliable enough to do what you require.\n \n Those who rig their guns to shoot repeatedly from time to time are not causing the amount of mayhem that requires such onerous laws that forbid civilians from owning machine guns made past 86 (as if one made in 87 would cause more problems or something). It's a lie meant to create an artificial market so that the ownership of real full autos becomes financially infeasible for the populous and nothing to do with public safety.",

   "Justice Breyer did indeed think the majority was that stupid. He wrote in dissent about the \"in common use\" argument in Heller:\n \n \"On the majority's reasoning, if tomorrow someone invents a particularly useful, highly dangerous self defense weapon, Congress and the States had better ban it immediately, for once it becomes popular Congress will no longer possess the constitutional authority to do so. In essence, the majority determines what regulations are permissible by looking to see what existing regulations permit. There is no basis for believing that the Framers intended such circular reasoning.\"\n\n \n I actually agree with him on pretty much all counts here. That is a structural flaw in the Heller decision.\n \n Like I said, a lot of the heller decision was essentially a delaying tactic, this is part of that delaying tactic. \n \n It takes virtually no time at all to discover that when militia members were required to provide weapons that were in common use at the time, that was common MILITARY use. EVERY early American militia required that their members show up with weapons in a MILITARY caliber and with a bayonet. There is absolutely NO sporting purpose to a bayonet. This is especially true of bayonets of the time, most of which were not bladed, they were just big spikes designed to impale people. These guys were not allowed to muster with their hunting weapons. \n \n Beyond that, a ruling that allowed the government to essentially ban newly developed weapons on the basis that they are uncommon is illogical considering the history and scope of the second amendment. Taken to extremes, it would actually be a lot MORE logical to argue that the second amendment actually only protects muskets than it would be to attempt to ban a newly developed weapon based on the \"common use\" portion of the ruling.",

   "  The Second Amendment strikes back  \n Even some noted liberal professors admit the obvious. Harvard's Laurence Tribe says,  \"The Fourteenth Amendment, which makes parts of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, reflected a broad agreement that bearing arms was a 'privilege' of each citizen.\" Fellow Harvard liberal law professor Alan Dershowitz agrees, and scolds fellow liberals for twisting the words of the Second Amendment in a way that could come back to haunt them. \"Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming that it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a safety hazard,\" said Dershowitz, \"don't see the danger of the big picture.\" He added, \"They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.\" \n\n Alan Dershowitz IS talking about YOU!\n \n You know, I had sincere hopes that after Heller and then McDonald, you Anti-gun types would learn to respect our Rights. You were told what the 2nd Amendment means, and it has been defined by the Heller Court that the RIGHT is NOT contingent upon militia or military service! The 14th Amendment clearly shows that it is not! Galileo even said. \n \nWhat you're essentially claiming is that people should not have the power to make certain changes to the Constitution through their elected representatives because you wouldn't like those changes even though the text of the Constitution does not prohibit such changes. But you think you know better. You'd like to impose a restriction on the text of Constitution through unconstitutional means. You'd make a good tyrant.\n\n Yet you guys still persist on finding scams to take it away from us! Even if you were correct, which you are not, the 14th Amendment and Heller/McDonald have supplanted your arguments Galileo/Deawoo. \n \n Maybe our Founding Fathers intended for us to fight each other with guns from time to time from statements like \nThe tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. \n But I would have preferred making some rights Inalienable, that can never be taken away, like the quote here.\n  \n  The Bill Of Rights ~ The First Ten Amendments to the Constitution \n Alexander Hamilton 1775\n The Sacred Rights of Mankind are not to be rummaged for among old parchment,. or musty records. They are written with a sun beam in whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself, and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power. \n But then we are told that our Rights are not Inalienable! Nothing is imitable! Nothing! So there fights MUST exist! What other choice is there? \n \n Yet in Ohio's Constitution, JUST LIKE MANY OTHERS, we read    \u00a7 1.01 Inalienable Rights (1851) \n All men are, by nature, free and independent, and have certain inalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and seeking and obtaining happiness and safety. \n\n and   \u00a7 1.04 Bearing arms; standing armies; military powers (1851) \n The people have the right to bear arms for their defense and security; but standing armies, in time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, and shall not be kept up; and the military shall be in strict subordination to the civil power. \n And yet you seek to STEAL me my Rights away. You chose to stick you finger in my eye and call me names!\n \n It is totally clear that you guys are BENT on destroying what is clear majority opinion.\n*58 senators and 251 members of the House of Representatives have filed a joint brief in favor of McDonald arguing for &#8220;Fundamental Right&#8221; status and incorporation under both &#8220;due process&#8221; and &#8220;P&I&#8221;\n \n *38 states have filed a joint brief arguing for 2nd. Amendment &#8220;Fundamental Right&#8221; right status and incorporation against the states, but interestingly only through the &#8220;due process&#8221; clause of the 14th. Amendment.\n\n \n We Pro-gun people are totally happy with the Constitution and the incorporation of the 2nd through McDonald, and it is clear you are not! You have no intention what so ever to bow to the will of We the People, so maybe you Anti-gun types should just grab some rifles and try to reclaim the America YOU believe in, and make it into your own image! According to Sinjin's link, and Steve, you have that Right. And you also have the Right to even Abolish the Constitution if you wish! So if you are that unhappy, and if you have the numbers, (Which you clearly don't) have at it!",
