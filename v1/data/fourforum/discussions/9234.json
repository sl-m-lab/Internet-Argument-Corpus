Why are they inferior to the schools I attended in the 50s?\n \n 1. The classrooms of the 1950s were populated with students who came to learn.

   "The problem with the public scholl system's can be boiled down to a few simple to fix problems.\n \n probablly the biggest factor being what we pay a teacher as they start off teaching.' In the 50's teaching was a decent salary that a person could live on. Today most teachers start out at $22,000 a salary that is just slightly above the poverty level. And that with a college degree and student loans to pay. Then they are expected to go back and get thier masters degree .\n We are getting what we pay for in quality of teachers. Most move on to better jobs outside the teaching field ASAP.\n \n AT the fear of sounding bigoted to children with problems I will offer the following. Believe me I am not a bigot. It boils down to the fact that the welfare of many is being left behind in a attempt to accomodate a few children with problems. That is just wrong. We cannot save everybody , we can seperate them and give them every oppurtunity to thrive in thier own classroom situation.\n \n In the 50's as this poster says the schools were better places more fit for learning . But that was because of society . As a society we expected certain things of our children. They were to go to school to learn, and obey thier teachers for the most part . Now we have every sort of excuse for why a child shouldn't be made to learn. Children with ADD are still going to be expected to pay attention at work one day and do thier jobs well, yet we no longer teach them the skills they will need to function in adult life.\n \n This intergration of so called special ed students in with all the other students is a real problem. As teachers spend more than half their days handling dicipline problems instead of teaching.\n \n We need to put problem kids in segregated area's away from the rest of the kids so they can learn without all the distraction.\n \n And give the average kids the chance to learn undisturbed , by the child that just can't keep thier hands to themselves.",

However, I do not think that it is okay to just give up and say \"we cannot save everybody\". That is bullcrap. What exactly do you mean by \"save\" anyway? Most of the children in special ed classrooms are handicapped and or mentally retarded. They for the most part cannot be \"saved\" and will probably be that way for the rest of their lives. A teacher's job is not to save children but to teach and expand their minds and personalities in any way possible and to give them a safe and understanding learning environment.\n \n \nWe need to put problem kids in segregated area's away from the rest of the kids so they can learn without all the distraction.\n \n And give the average kids the chance to learn undisturbed , by the child that just can't keep thier hands to themselves.\n\n \n I think this goes along with your quote above and I think that you are confusing special ed children with unruly or misbehaved children. Special ed children are children who have either physical or mental handicaps and cannot learn at the same pace or level of a physically/mentally healthy child. A child with ADD or who misbehaves should in no way be \"segregated\" from the \"average\" children.

Is that not a discriminating function?

A(as in one, a small group, and not everyone of them) non-white, thinks that all whites are racist, thus making themselves racist. You may live in a sheltered life, but I know plenty of people like this. \n \n \nDid you ever think that maybe groups like that are necessary because still to this day minorities are discriminated against and might need a helping hand.\n\n \n So discriminating against non-minorities is going to help any possible discrimination against minorities?\n \n \nThat maybe in this country with the history we have of buying and forcing blacks to work our fields so that white men could sit in their plantation houses and get fat off the sweat and blood of others might cause blacks to be a little behind us?\n\n \n This sounds like someone who thinks blacks should be given preferable treatment over others. As I may have already said, this is like having your father commit a murder and be sentenced to life in prision(130 years give or take, if I remember correctly). He dies after 30 years in prision. The athorities then put you in prision to finish out his jail term.",

   "Humn? I noticed no body else picked up on this...\n \n1. The classrooms of the 1950s were populated with students who came to learn. They were well mannered, and if they weren't, they were quickly dealt with. A spanking was not out of the question, and my father warned me, that if I ever got a spanking at school, that I would get another one when I got home. The fact is that the parents who arranged this situation were White. You may discount this fact but you cannot deny it.\n\n \n No body else seemed to pick up on this...but it seems that the real truth of the matter is that Siegfriedson simply has fond memories of getting those spankings.:p And apparently, he wants to continue that tradition of spanking.",
