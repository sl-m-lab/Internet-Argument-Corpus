I can't help but rememebr that there were some very logical arguments laid out here, many by yourself, against the invasion based on probable scenarios for the new Iraq.

It was not that long ago that somebody right here on this very forum was trying to convince us that the Dawa party was NOT a puppet of tehran. \n \n Too many Americans waving a flag, and not nearly enough practicing critical thinking. \n \n I think that this is our lowest point to date in Iraq. We have serious sectarian violence, and we cannot really support any of the players. The Shia want to turn Iraq into little Iran, the Sunnis just want to kill Americans, and we dare not support the Kurds in any kind of real takeover bid because the rest of the arab world (not to mention the Turks) would skin us alive if we even considered it. Our concept of what the Iraqi governement should be has been soundly rejected by all sides. We have spent roughly half a trillion invading and occupying, rebuilding costs will run at least that, and in the end it seems we will end up with a government in Iraq that is closely alinged with Iran.\n \n Way to go, guys.

   "I agree that there probably is no good way to solve the iraq problem and that the invasion was akin to kicking a wasp's nest but surely we simply say 'let em kill each other and have god sort 'em out' (which isn't what you said) we ought at least to try and work something out surely?\n The thing is, your probably right, there will be a civil war etc, but that does not mean we shouldn't try to find a way to stop it.\n Once again I cannot say what that way is, it's not my place to say it, however we should try to find it.\n\n \n \n Why? If we pull out, we loose face and there is a lot of killing. If we stay ind try to force peace, we potentially destabilize the entire region, drag out the killing for years, maybe decades, and the Iraqis have no peace or chance for it for years. Let them figth their civil war. It will be over ina few years and they can move on. We give a couple trillion dollars to the winner (or divide it among the winners) in liu of our rebuilding responsibility and call the whole thing good.",

As I said your are correct that the war is probably a certainty, however we ought at least to find a solution to stop it or lessen it.\n\n \n I don't believe there is one. If the occupation had been handled differently (for example not bombing the country's infrastructure into oblivion; not disbanding the Iraqi army; not having a US proxy electoral candidate; making sure oil revenue went through the roof for the Iraqis; not putting Ba'ath officials back in power in places like Basra) then action could have been taken in the first few months to ensure something like this did not happen.\n Even so, given the divisions along cultural, religious and geographical grounds already in place in Iraq, it is hard to see how violence could have been avoided once the ruthless dictator was ousted.\n \n I fully agree with Daewoo that war now seems inevitable, and I think the lesser of two evils would be to let them have it out. If we continue our intervention the war will just be longer and more bloody than otherwise.\n Look at Europe. Apart from North America (which consists of just 3 huge countries) and Australia, it is the only area of the world experiencing real stability (excepting the Balkans). The reason is WWII. Prior to that Europe's history was one of continuous conflict and bloodshed, only brought to and end by Europe being brought to its knees by a conflict which changed the world. \n \n With Western Europe as the victors, with Eastern Europe now free of Soviet tyranny, with Germany forgiven and rebuilt from devastation, with borders permanently demarcated, with economic co-operation between the survivors, and with a visceral fear of intra-European conflict, Europe has finally come to the most stable point in its history to date. \n \n The middle east, with its arbitrarily defined borders, divided populations, popular religious fundamentalism, and a history of colonial/government repression and age-old tribal grudges is nowhere near approaching a stable situation. It is impossible for us to magically transform the area into such a state, it can only come about by releasing all that historical tension, unfortunately only resolvable by conflict.",
