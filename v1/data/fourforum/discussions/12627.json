   "As far as sweet old Virginia is concerned, I meant that it's understandable, to me, not laughable, people frightened. Whereever they are. Life experience hopefully provides people humility in the face of others' experiences. Not facho ignorance and arrogance.\n \n I can't comment on your factual assertions regarding history. Based on just general psychology, it's conceivable that people mobilize a certain set of inner resources when attack and stress is extraordinarily high -- the environment is so constantly under assault, they adapt, the conditions they face having a measure of predictability -- (though in Leningrad, they were starving -- physiologically, you would be in an entirely different state due to hunger) -- when it's diffused to some extent, however, when there's an unknown, where it MAY happen, but it's less predictable, maybe it WON'T, people experience a lower grade sort of constant fear or anxiety that affects their behavior (which includes thinking processes) differently. And lends to a higher probability of panic. This is also an art in Hollywood, is it not? Keeping you on the edge of your seat.\n \n Dresden was meant, in part, to defeat German morale. That worked. What you are describing doesn't defeat morale, but can whoop people up about a boogie man. They can be, as you mention, more willing to relinquish rights and liberties. And of course, there's money in it. Going gloriously to war, that is.\n \n \nNow, if you want to talk about Leningrad, London during the blitz, or Dresden, those were real threats, and, in each case, there was little to no panic.\n \n Are we of weaker stock than the Russians, British, or the Germans, or were the fear and paranoia deliberately created to keep the American people off balance?\n\n \n There are obvious threats to airport security and the safety of passengers riding. Just because it isn't the same as the bombing of Dresden doesn't mean that there isn't any danger. I wouldn't panic about it, but neither would I make decisions about airport security based on the equivalent to a challenge of a game of chicken (do you know that game? What \"greasers\" played in cars?). In this case, \"hey, aren't you brave enough to go forth without anyone being security checked?\" Well, no ....\n \n There's a street I cross regularly at a time when there USUALLY isn't any traffic. Does that mean I don't look both ways, and each time? On occasion, there's a car speeding madly along without any regard for my life.\n \n Now I have a child by the hand, and I'm crossing the same road at the same time.

   "Backing up for a moment, on this lost thread, to where airport security was discussed, take a gander at what the government wants to look at the next time you're in line at the airport for that Thanksgiving meal, business trip or beach vacation. \n \n (2 CNN photograph examples at CNN link below).\n \n Would it be okay for you, personally, if security sees you naked, keeping a record of you posed, i.e. \u00e0 la carte, as long as the photo doesn't include your face?\n \n ----------\n \n ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Privacy advocates plan to call on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to suspend use of \"whole-body imaging,\" the airport security technology that critics say performs \"a virtual strip search\" and produces \"naked\" pictures of passengers, CNN has learned.\n The national campaign, which will gather signatures from organizations and relevant professionals, is set to launch this week with the hope that it will go \"viral,\" said Lillie Coney, associate director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which plans to lead the charge.\n \n \"People need to know what's happening, with no sugar-coating and no spinning,\" said Coney, who is also coordinator of the Privacy Coalition, a conglomerate of 42 member organizations. She expects other groups to sign on in the push for the technology's suspension until privacy safeguards are in place.\n \n Right now, without regulations on what the Transportation Security Administration does with this technology, she said, \"We don't have the policy to hold them to what they say. They're writing their own rule book at this point.\"\n \n The machines \"detect both metallic and nonmetallic threat items to keep passengers safe,\" said Kristin Lee, spokeswoman for TSA, in a written statement. \"It is proven technology, and we are highly confident in its detection capability.\" Watch a video of the body-imaging scans >>\n Late last month, freshman Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, introduced legislation to ban these machines. Of concern to him, Coney and others is not just what TSA officials say, it's also what they see. iReport: Tell us what you think about these scanners\n \n The sci-fi-looking whole-body imaging machine -- think \"Beam me up, Scotty\" -- was first introduced at an airport in Phoenix, Arizona, in November 2007. There are now 40 machines, which cost $170,000 each, being tested and used in 19 airports, said TSA's Lee.\n \n Six of these airports are testing the machines as a primary security check option, instead of metal detectors followed by a pat-down, she said. The rest present them as a voluntary secondary security option in lieu of a pat-down, which is protocol for those who've repeatedly set off the metal detector or have been randomly selected for additional screening.\n \n So far, the testing phase has been promising, said Lee. When given the choice, \"over 99 percent of passengers choose this technology over other screening options,\" she said.\n \n A big advantage of the technology is the speed, said Jon Allen, another TSA spokesperson, who's based in Atlanta, Georgia. A body scan takes between 15 and 30 seconds, while a full pat-down can take from two to four minutes. And for those who cringe at the idea of being touched by a security official, or are forever assigned to a pat-down because they had hip replacements, for example, the machine is a quick and easy way to avoid that contact and hassle, he said.\n \n Using millimeter wave technology, which the TSA says emits 10,000 times less radio frequency than a cell phone, the machine scans a traveler and a robotic image is generated that allows security personnel to detect potential threats -- and, some fear, more -- beneath a person's clothes.\n \n TSA officials say privacy concerns are addressed in a number of ways.\n \n The system uses a pair of security officers. The one working the machine never sees the image, which appears on a computer screen behind closed doors elsewhere; and the remotely located officer who sees the image never sees the passenger.\n \n As further protection, a passenger's face is blurred and the image as a whole \"resembles a fuzzy negative,\" said TSA's Lee. The officers monitoring images aren't allowed to bring cameras, cell phones or any recording device into the room, and the computers have been programmed so they have \"zero storage capability\" and images are \"automatically deleted,\" she added.\n But this is of little comfort to Coney, the privacy advocate with EPIC, a public interest research group in Washington. She said she's seen whole-body images captured by similar technology dating back to 2004 that were much clearer than what's represented by the airport machines.\n \n \"What they're showing you now is a dumbed-down version of what this technology is capable of doing,\" she said. \"Having blurry images shouldn't blur the issue.\"\n \n Lee of TSA emphasized that the images Coney refers to do not represent millimeter wave technology but rather \"backscatter\" technology, which she said TSA is not using at this time.\n \n Coney said she and other privacy advocates want more oversight, full disclosure for air travelers, and legal language to protect passengers and keep TSA from changing policy down the road.\n \n For example, she wants to know what's to stop TSA from using clearer images or different technology later. The computers can't store images now, but what if that changes?\n \"TSA will always be committed to respecting passenger privacy, regardless of whether a regulation is in place or not,\" Lee said.\n \n She added that the long-term goal is not to see more of people, but rather to advance the technology so that the human image is like a stick-figure and any anomalies are auto-detected and highlighted.\n \n But Coney knows only about what's out there now, and she worries that as the equipment gets cheaper, it will become more pervasive and harder to regulate. Already it is used in a handful of U.S. courthouses and in airports in the United Kingdom, Spain, Japan, Australia, Mexico, Thailand and the Netherlands. She wonders whether the machines will someday show up in malls.\n \n The option of walking through a whole-body scanner or taking a pat-down shouldn't be the final answer, said Chris Calabrese, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union.\n \n \"A choice between being groped and being stripped, I don't think we should pretend those are the only choices,\" he said. \"People shouldn't be humiliated by their government\" in the name of security, nor should they trust that the images will always be kept private.\n \n \"Screeners at LAX [Los Angeles International Airport],\" he speculated, \"could make a fortune off naked virtual images of celebrities.\"\n \n Bruce Schneier, an internationally recognized security technologist, said whole-body imaging technology \"works pretty well,\" privacy rights aside. But he thinks the financial investment was a mistake. In a post-9/11 world, he said, he knows his position isn't \"politically tenable,\" but he believes money would be better spent on intelligence-gathering and investigations.\n \n \"It's stupid to spend money so terrorists can change plans,\" he said by phone from Poland, where he was speaking at a conference. If terrorists are swayed from going through airports, they'll just target other locations, such as a hotel in Mumbai, India, he said.\n \n \"We'd be much better off going after bad guys ... and back to pre-9/11 levels of airport security,\" he said. \"There's a huge 'cover your XXX' factor in politics, but unfortunately, it doesn't make us safer.\"\n \n Meantime, TSA's Lee says the whole-body imaging machines remain in the pilot phase. Given what the organization has gleaned so far, she said additional deployments are anticipated. \n \n Airport security bares all, or does it? - CNN.com\n \n -------------------",

I'm not worth 300K...but you know who is...someone with 300K. \n\n \n I don't see a human life as valued according to how much money a person has.\n \n \nBut that's not how I understood the article. You can choose to fly and choose NOT to go through the 'scanner' line. \n\n \n I think the article was suggesting that *for now* that's the case. Though even with choice, people going through did not have full disclosure of the full disclosure ...\n \n \nAgain, I'm not all about govt. intrusion....but they have to keep bad stuff off the planes.\n\n \n I agree. But I think they can do that without these machines.\n \n \nHopefully they'll come up with a better way.\n\n \n Yeah, if they can develop the technology, it might better protect privacy, better ensure that people aren't unfairly targeted for searches, and better guarantee plane security.\n \n Though, until the day arrives, I'd keep it out of the airport security altogether. I don't think this kind of \"choice\" is appropriate, or really much of a \"choice\" at all.",

   "Btw, Cu, also on\n \n \nI'm not worth 300K...but you know who is...someone with 300K.\n\n \n see this excerpt from 2/19/09 press,\n \n America's Poor Are Its Most Generous Givers\n \n Washington - When Jody Richards saw a homeless man begging outside a downtown McDonald's recently, he bought the man a cheeseburger. There's nothing unusual about that, except that Richards is homeless, too, and the 99-cent cheeseburger was an outsized chunk of the $9.50 he'd earned that day from panhandling.\n \n The generosity of poor people isn't so much rare as rarely noticed, however. In fact, America's poor donate more, in percentage terms, than higher-income groups do, surveys of charitable giving show. What's more, their generosity declines less in hard times than the generosity of richer givers does.\n \n \"The lowest-income fifth (of the population) always give at more than their capacity,\" said Virginia Hodgkinson, former vice president for research at Independent Sector, a Washington-based association of major nonprofit agencies. \"The next two-fifths give at capacity, and those above that are capable of giving two or three times more than they give.\"\n \n t r u t h o u t | America&#039;s Poor Are Its Most Generous Givers",
