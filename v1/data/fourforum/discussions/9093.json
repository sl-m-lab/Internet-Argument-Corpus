   "Apparently I'm not the only one who thinks Dems are using the Foley thing for political gain ...\n \"This was a story that needed to be told for, you know, like two days. Mark Foley was never on the radar of anyone outside the small circle of news junkies. So his fall and banishment from Washington were nothing but a drip in the torrential flood of current geopolitical problems. The way the Democratic leadership was in clear collusion with the major media to push this story in the month before the midterm election seems to me to have been a big fat gift to Ann Coulter and the other conservative commentators who say the mainstream media are simply the lapdogs of the Democrats. Every time I turned on the news it was \"Foley, Foley, Foley!\" -- and in suspiciously similar language and repetitive talking points.\n \n After three or four days of it, as soon as I heard Foley's name, I turned the sound off or switched channels. It was gargantuan overkill, and I felt the Democrats were shooting themselves in the foot. I was especially repulsed by the manipulative use of a gay issue for political purposes by my own party. I think it was not only poor judgment but positively evil. Whatever short-term political gain there is, it can only have a negative impact on gay men. When a moralistic, buttoned-up Republican like Foley is revealed to have a secret, seamy gay life, it simply casts all gay men under a shadow and makes people distrust them. Why don't the Democratic strategists see this? These tactics are extremely foolish. Gay men through history have always been more vulnerable to public hysteria than are lesbians, who -- unless they're out there parading around in all-leather bull-XXXX drag -- simply fit more easily into the cultural landscape than do gay men, who generally lead a more adventurous, pickup-oriented sex life.\n \n Not only has the public image of gay men been tarnished by the over-promotion of the Foley scandal, but they have actually been put into physical danger. It's already starting with news items about teenage boys using online sites to lure gay men on dates to attack and rob them. What in the world are the Democrats thinking? We saw the beginning of this in that grotesque moment in the last presidential debates when John Kerry came out with that clearly prefab line identifying Mary Cheney as a lesbian. Since when does the Democratic Party use any gay issue in this coldblooded way as a token on the chessboard? You'd expect this stuff from right-wing ideologues, not progressives.\"\n I've argued this very matter in a different thread only to have people either not address it or disagree. Maybe hearing someone else--a left-leaning feminist Democrat--will make a difference.\n \n http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/10/27/paglia/",

   "Sixty-four days after it promised to find out who knew about Representative Mark Foley's wildly inappropriate, sexually predatory behavior with teenage House pages, and why they failed to stop it, the bipartisan committee produced a report yesterday that was a 91-page exercise in cowardice. \n \n The report's authors were clearly more concerned about protecting the members of the House than the young men and women under their charge in the page program. And they made absolutely no effort to define the high standard of behavior that should be required of all members of Congress and their staffs.\n \n The report concludes that evidence of Mr. Foley's \"creepy\" interest in young male pages dated back to 1999. One woman who worked with the pages took to shadowing Mr. Foley when he was around them. The report makes clear that Mr. Foley's misconduct became known to an ever-widening circle of his colleagues and their aides, including Speaker Dennis Hastert. But no one made any serious attempt to stop Mr. Foley or reveal his misdeeds. A few urged him to cut it out, for political reasons, but did not follow up.\n \n The committee concluded that other people preferred to remain willfully ignorant - to protect Mr. Foley's secret homosexuality, to avoid partisan embarrassment or for other political reasons. \n \n But even after all that, the report said that none of this amounted to the sort of behavior that might discredit the House of Representatives and thus violate ethics rules. The committee, which never heard from Mr. Foley, did not call for disciplinary action against current members of the House or their staffs. The committee said those who have already left, like Mr. Foley, were no longer its problem.\n \n The panel's justification for inaction is a breathtaking exercise in sophistry: \"the requirement that House members and staff act at all times in a manner that reflects creditably on the House does not mean that every error in judgment or failure to exercise greater oversight or diligence\" is a violation.\n \n No, not every error or failure should be a violation, but certainly the ones that lead to an elected official's sexually stalking teenage boys while his colleagues turn a blind eye or cover it up should be. We'd set the bar at least there. Apparently, it's too high for the House. \n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/09/opinion/09sat1.html?_r=2&hp&oref=slogin&oref=slogin",

   "Since the Mark Foley page story first broke, there have been many articles discussing the double standard in which Republican and Democrat sex scandals are handled by Congress and the media. No finer example of such hypocrisy has been demonstrated than by the Associated Press on Saturday, October 14, which had nothing but high praise for the now deceased former Rep. Gerry Studds while it continued to heap scorn on Foley.\n \n \n For example, an article entitled \"Studds, first openly gay person elected to Congress, dead at 69,\" spoke glowingly of the former Congressman who, unlike Foley, actually had a sexual encounter with a seventeen-year-old male page in 1983. In fact, the AP suggested that this was an important moment in history for gay rights:\n \n Quote:\n \"Gerry often said it was the fight for gay and lesbian equality that was the last great civil rights chapter in modern American history. He did not live to see its final sentences written, but all of us will forever be indebted to him for leading the way with compassion and wisdom,\" said his husband, Dean T. Hara, 49, in a statement. \n \n The article included some glowing praise from a current member of Congress:\n \n U.S. Rep. Barney Frank (D-Newton), who announced he was gay four years after Studds' disclosure, said yesterday his colleague didn't let the scandal get in his way.\n \n \n Quote:\n \"It was very important to see, for young people in particular, somebody as capable and talented as he be openly gay,\" said Frank, \"That gave a lot people the courage to say, 'I can survive this business in being honest about who I am.'\" \n \n In another AP article with a similar title, the AP downplayed the significance of the age of the \"young man\" Studds had sex with: \n \n Quote:\n Hara said Studds was never ashamed of the relationship with the page.\n \n \"This young man knew what he was doing,\" Hara said. \"He was at (Studds') side.\" \n \n \n Fascinating. So, 23 years ago, the Studds matter was an important moment in history, and a seventeen-year-old was a \"young man\" old enough to make sexual decisions for himself. Yet, on the same day, the AP was not anywhere near as nostalgic or kind concerning Foley's behavior two decades later, and not anywhere near as supportive of a seventeen-year-old's right to consent. In an article entitled \"Speaker, majority leader have yet to testify about Foley scandal,\" the AP painted an entirely different picture of this issue, including a depiction of Foley as \"disgraced\":\n \n Quote:\n Staff aide to disgraced former Rep. Mark Foley who said he alerted top House aides years ago about inappropriate behavior by Foley toward pages. It also heard from the chairman of the board that oversees the House page program, who conceded Friday that Republicans have mishandled the matter. \n \n \n What a difference a \"D\" makes!\n \n p.s. Foley resigned. Studds didn't.\n \n (forums.somd.com)\n \n Oh, the Democratic hypocrisy!!",

   "Because your focus is so one-sided.\n\n I have already commented on the issue you are fixating on. I don't see any real conflict there.\n \n On the flip side, the issue I am talking about was hotly contested and attempted refutation was offered by the Republicans.\n \n \n \nThen I take it you disagree with the article in terms of \"hoping that a scandal would emerge\".\n\n I would \"take issue\" with the phrasing.\n Foley's actions were scandalous. Do you disagree?\n \n The real problem with the statement is in WHY the scandal had to \"emerge\" in the first place. Primarily because Republicans tried to hide it...\n \n \n \nDoes it really matter which is worse when they are both wrong?\n\n Interpretation: Jyoshu doesn't want to admit the obvious.\n \n And \"both wrong\"?\n Yes. They are \"both wrong\". But we're talking about the difference between a \"wrong\" that BOTH parties are guilty of (with the democrats using it as an issue), and a \"wrong\" that just the Republicans are guilty of (the cover-up of Foley's actions).\n \n \n \nCan we not simply agree that neither should have happened?\n\n Quite frankly, to a significant degree I still think that the Democrats raised some valid points. The Republicans claim to be \"pro-family\" and \"pro-security\", but then they proved that they obviously have areas they put their own self-interest above those of the nation.\n Quite frankly, that SHOULD happen. The Republicans SHOULD be forced to question their actions and not allowed to weasel out of their complacency and/or cover-up.\n \n \n \nAnd I've focused on the Democrats' use of it for political gain because there's been so little said about it--plenty is being said here about the Republicans.\n\n Oh yes. Focusing on \"the democrats\".\n Like your accusations (with no substantiation) that they withheld info about this issue until before the election for political gain?\n You focus on the democrats for an action that BOTH parties would be 'guilty' of. So it's kind of hard to complain that Jim got caught with his hand in the cookie jar when John would have done the same thing...",
