   "Then let that demand be satisfied - don't make your choices the entire country's choices.\n\n \n Why should I allow the country to make a the choice to refuse to treat someone in need of treatment, any more than I should allow them to commit murder or assault?\n \n \nNo - the more discriminatory society is, the more profitable it is to be non-discriminatory. Naturally, businesses tend to try to distinguish themselves from their competitors, so it is unlikely that there will ever be a society where all (or even most) hospitals are discriminatory. Remember, fundamentalists are a minority.\n\n \n This isn't true. The more discriminatory a society is, the less profitable they will be by failing to conform to the discriminations of the majority. Fundamentalists are a minority overall, but they are not a minority in certain small towns, certain countrysides, or everywhere in the US. I find it likely that there are some places where there will be no hospitals that allow gay people. Furthermore, we are using gay people as a relevant example of a problem that could any person.\n \n \nBut this \"nearly free market\" will quash choices. What should be done if a fundamentalist does not want to go to a hospital that has been \"profaned\" by gays? Should we force hospitals to provide services for this minority?\n\n \n The fundamentalist is denied nothing. The medical treatment is available to him, as it is available to anyone. Hospitals should provide services to everyone, and if one person does not want to use those services for whatever reason, they should be free to refuse them. You have turned the issue from \"I am not allowed to get treatment\" to \"I don't want to be near gays\". Frankly, I don't care if someone doesn't want to be near gays, but I do care if someone isn't allowed to get treatment.\n \n \nThat's because few, if any, doctors are fundamentalist discriminatory doctors.\n\n \n True, but also because refusing to treat homosexuals isn't as important to most doctors as treating heterosexuals. If we allow doctors to refuse homosexuals, people will say, \"Hmm, my religion doesn't like homosexuality, I shouldn't treat them\". And they won't give the harm they cause a second thought. But if we don't give them that choice, they won't worry about it. Also, in an area where the people are fundamentalist, it would be beneficial for the hospital to be fundamentalist as well; but forcing all hospitals to accept everyone isn't going to make those people stop being doctors.\n \n \nThis reasoning assumes that fundamentalist doctors displace non-fundamentalist doctors, which is false. If a group of fundamentalist doctors decide to establish a new hospital, the capacity of the medicine industry is increased. Even discriminatory nut-jobs can contribute to society, and to quash their contributions amounts to nothing short of the politics of envy.\n\n \n This assumes first that non-fundamentalist doctors already exist in a location. That may be a false assumption. It further assumes that the fundamentalist doctors are unable to put the non-fundamentalists out of buisness. That again may be a false assumption. In the market, businesses collapse and appear based on demand. If there is not demand, the business will not remain, and minorities are unable to produce sufficient demand. We cannot allow businesses essential to minority groups be controlled by nothing but supply and demand.",

   "Why should I allow the country to make a the choice to refuse to treat someone in need of treatment, any more than I should allow them to commit murder or assault?\n\n \n Because inaction is not a crime.\n \n \n \nThis isn't true. The more discriminatory a society is, the less profitable they will be by failing to conform to the discriminations of the majority. \n \n \n Conformity is not necessarily a valuable trait of businesses in the market.\n \n \n \nFundamentalists are a minority overall, but they are not a minority in certain small towns, certain countrysides, or everywhere in the US. I find it likely that there are some places where there will be no hospitals that allow gay people. Furthermore, we are using gay people as a relevant example of a problem that could any person.\n\n \n If these fundamentalists do not want gays in their community, they have a right to use peaceful means to discourage them from living there. The freedom to be gay doesn't mean the freedom to enslave all who do not wish to associate with gays.\n \n \nTrue, but also because refusing to treat homosexuals isn't as important to most doctors as treating heterosexuals. If we allow doctors to refuse homosexuals, people will say, \"Hmm, my religion doesn't like homosexuality, I shouldn't treat them\". And they won't give the harm they cause a second thought. But if we don't give them that choice, they won't worry about it. \n\n \n The choice already exists - it cannot be \"given.\" What you're condoning is sending in bands of thugs to coerce these doctors if they make the \"wrong\" choice.\n \n \nThis assumes first that non-fundamentalist doctors already exist in a location. That may be a false assumption. It further assumes that the fundamentalist doctors are unable to put the non-fundamentalists out of buisness. That again may be a false assumption. In the market, businesses collapse and appear based on demand. If there is not demand, the business will not remain, and minorities are unable to produce sufficient demand. We cannot allow businesses essential to minority groups be controlled by nothing but supply and demand.\n\n \n Minorities can produce sufficient demand for businesses to survive. Left-handers did it for left-handed scissors. Cripples did it for wheelchairs. What about atheist bumper stickers? The market is no majority dictatorship.\n \n What minorities can't produce, however, is enough votes to get a socialist state to give them what they want.",

   "WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES HEALTH INSURANCE MAKE?\n Health insurance affects access to health care as well as the financial well-being of families. Over 40% of nonelderly uninsured adults have no regular source of health care, and coupled with a fear of high medical bills, many delay or forgo needed care. In 2003, nearly half of uninsured adults postponed seeking medical care, and over a third say they needed but did not get care in the past year (Figure 6).\n \n Lack of insurance can have a substantial financial impact: over a third of the uninsured have a serious problem paying medical bills, and nearly a quarter are contacted by collection agencies for medical bills\n Delaying or not receiving treatment can lead to more serious illness and avoidable health problems. The uninsured are less likely to receive preventive care than those with insurance and more likely to be hospitalized for conditions that could have been avoided. For example, people with insurance are significantly more likely to have had recent mammograms, and other types of cancer screenings than the uninsured. Consequently, uninsured cancer patients are diagnosed later and die earlier than those with insurance.\n Researchers estimate that a reduction in mortality of 5% to 15% could be achieved if the uninsured were to gain continuous health coverage. The Institute of Medicine in its analysis of the consequences of lack of insurance estimates that at least 18,000 Americans die prematurely each year solely because they lack health coverage.\n Charitable physicians and the safety net of community clinics and public hospitals do not fully substitute for health insurance. Lack of health coverage matters for millions of uninsured Americans - affecting their access to care, health status, job decisions, and financial security, as well as exacting an indirect toll on society in terms of more disability, lower productivity, and increased burden on the health care system.\n For additional free copies of this fact sheet (#1420-06) and additional information on the uninsured, visit www.kff.org.\n http://www.kff.org/uninsured/upload/The-Uninsured-and-Their-Access-to-Health-Care-November-2004-Fact-Sheet.pdf\n \n \n The analysis reveals that differences across states in some measures of care access for uninsured adults are consistent with differences in the levels of safety-net vulnerability. More striking, however, is the finding that substantial gaps in service use and care access between the uninsured and the insured are evident in all states and that the vulnerability of a state's safety net does not affect these gaps. Uninsured adults' access to care appears to be no worse where the safety net is more threatened and no better where it is under less pressure.\n http://www.urban.org/Template.cfm?NavMenuID=24&template=/TaggedContent/ViewPublication.cfm&PublicationID=7521\n \n Defining and Measuring Access to Care\n Monitoring access to care is not an easy task. Access is a broad and often vaguely defined concept that incorporates various dimensions of health care, including the supply and availability of health care providers, health insurance coverage and problems that individuals encounter in getting care.  \n \n There is no gold standard to measure access, and new approaches are constantly being developed to reflect the changes in the delivery of services and an increasing interest in outcome-based measures of access. \n \n http://hschange.org/CONTENT/73/?topic=topic02#defining\n ________________________\n The whole deal here is \"who has access to care\" \n What are the obstacles of getting access to services?\n The insured vs. the insured \n \n \n WOuld you like the people who wrote this stuff flogged?",

Obviously a doctor is ethically obligated to give healthcare when needed. (I'd argue however that fertility treatment, which is really what the court case is about, is not really healthcare, in the sense of treating health problems, but that's another debate.) But it seems to me that forcing a doctor to act against his will is not necessarily a good idea.\n \n Doctors are not pawns or employees of the state. They are not public officials like our elected leaders so while they are ethically obligated by oath, they are not necessarily legally obligated to provide services. And there are cases where a doctor may have a legitimate reason to deny healthcare so it sets a bad precedent to MAKE the doctor do it under some circumstances. (There may be cases for instance, where a patient insists on healthcare he doesn't need.) There is nothing in law that says a patient has the power to make a doctor do anything he or she doesn't want to do. And a doctor needs full leeway to decide whether a patient needs treatment or not. Allowing doctors to have that leeway at the risk of them turning down treatment for personal reasons is a necessary risk.\n \n Besides, regarding you gay people, do you really want treatment from a doctor who is against treating you because you are gay?

   "I'm not in favor of government grants of monopoly privilege. If the government limits competition in the medical field, that is the problem.\n\n \n Yet it may also be that discrimination and prejudice in a community limit competition, that one medical center, by playing off that discrimination and prejudice, is able to put any non-discriminatory medical center out of business.\n \n \nDo you support the employee's right to quit at any time for any reason?\n\n \n Yes.\n \n \nReally? Do you hear any commercials that say, \"Choose us, because we're exactly the same as our competitors!\" Businesses only copy their competitors when their competitors have an advantage - and in the case of hospitals, a non-discriminatory hospital would have an advantage over a discriminatory one.\n\n \n Am I to listen to advertisements to determine how similar one business is to another? If the differences between two products were readily apparent to anyone, they would not need to point out those differences in a commercial. Those commercials advertise products that are largely the same as their competitors.\n \n Though more importantly, a medical center which discriminates would have an advantage in a society that discriminates.\n \n \nWhat is it then? Violent? I don't think so. Inaction is not violence.\n\n \n War, perhaps? Inaction may not be violence, but it is not necessarily peaceful either.\n \n \n...nor is inaction harm. If doctors harm people by not treating them, then doctors do more harm than good - for individual doctors do-not-treat more sick people than they treat. If only one doctor treats a sick person, does that mean all the other doctors harmed that sick person?\n\n \n Admittedly a sick individual does not require treatment in every case. But it is not those cases that concern me.\n \n \nAnd who decides who is a threat to them? The owners themselves, or you?\n\n \n Our criminal justice system determines that, I suppose. If a patient is acting in a fashion that causes him to become a hazard to employees or other patients, it may be proper to force him to leave. Though our criminal justice system would determine whether that action was appropriate.\n \n \nNo business requires him to associate with gays without government force. But as I understand it, the left seeks to outlaw ALL discrimination against gays in ALL businesses. Is that your position, or do you advocate \"capitalist bigotry\" with respect to these businesses?\n\n \n Well, that's a good question. I'm not certain on this one. Biccat asked me about my position on this earlier in the thread, and he said he might make a new thread to discuss it, but I guess he never got around to it.\n \n \nIt is relevant, though. If you concede that hospitals can be regulated by the \"people,\" then what should stop a fundamentalist majority from imposing mandatory discrimination for all hospitals? Your plan for a \"nearly free market\" will either backfire or be meaningless. If the fundies are a minority, discrimination will not be a serious problem - if the fundies are a majority, they will impose their will on all hospitals via the ballot.\n\n \n Nothing is stopping a fundamentalist majority from imposing mandatory discrimination for all hospitals. Creating a free market won't stop that, certainly. I suppose if I had my way, the laws would be less likely to be changed to the opposite. A fundamentalist majority isn't likely to be able to pass such a law because of the layout of our government, but it could certainly happen.\n \n Anyhow, I say none of this is relevant, for I do not concede that hospitals should be regulated by the people. I concede hospitals should be disallowed from refusing a patient under the terms previously listed, using whatever methods to create that law are appropriate.\n \n Our current government may not pass every good law, but I believe it capable of passing and preserving more good laws than if we used a different form of government.",

   "So people can't boycott businesses now?\n\n \n What do you mean? People can and will boycott. If they couldn't, then what I said would not be true. Because people can and will boycott, they can certainly put non-discriminatory medical centers out of business. If people weren't allowed to choose their own medical center, then none of what I've said would have made sense.\n \n \nThen what should be done if a doctor quits his job as soon as a gay guy walks in?\n\n \n And what should be done if a doctor quits his job as soon as soon as the first patient walks in? A new doctor should be hired, that's what. It is the responsibility of the employer to find and hire people who aren't going to quit at the drop of a dime, and realistically, if a doctor didn't want to treat gay people, he shouldn't be a doctor.\n \n Furthermore, I originally stated that businesses should be allowed to choose whether or not they allow their doctors to choose not to treat a gay person, but that business should be responsible for making someone at the center treats him. But the law shouldn't force businesses to make those provisions if those businesses don't want to. If the business did want to, however, it would be perfectly capable of accomodating a few doctors who don't want to treat gay people.\n \n \nThey're only competitors because their products are similar. The less similar two businesses' products or services are, the less they compete with each other.\n\n \n Not at all. Walk into two different fast food restaurants and look around. Same layout, same line structure, same menus displayed in the same places, same table positioning, both have drive-throughs, etc. Look at two doctor's offices. Look at two bottles of detergent. Look at two stores. They're all basically the same thing. Conformity makes sure the customer knows what to expect. Businesses will tout the specific things that make them different, but they are largely the same.\n \n \nLies. It isn't very easy to distinguish gays from straights, and likewise, it isn't very easy for society to tell which hospitals are treating gays. The profit from the extra customers will outweigh the risk of boycott.\n\n \n A hospital is very able to advertise the fact that it does not treat gays, and word spreads. It isn't observation of gays that makes the difference. I know which businesses are gay-friendly, and I encourage my friends to shop at them, and I tell them not to shop at businesses which are not. In the same fashion, a city with a deeply entrenched disapproval of gays would easily be able to figure out which hospitals do or do not treat gays.\n \n Furthermore, there may simply not be enough people in an area to sustain a large number of medical centers, and perhaps the owner of the one that survives happens to not want to treat gays out of his own beliefs. Businesses do not always operate in terms of what is best for the market; sometimes the owner chooses to discriminate based on his own beliefs.\n \n And finally, this debate does not rage only for only homosexuality; there may very well be discrimination against some easily-distinguishable group besides gays.\n \n \nNonviolent = peaceful.\n\n \n If that is the definition, then peaceful is not good enough.\n \n \nA free market, by definition, means that no one can impose anything on businesses. It seems that your position has a great deal of basis in defying definitions.\n\n \n You misunderstand what I said. I said, \"We should force medical centers to treat anyone.\" You said, \"We should create a completely free market.\" You said, \"Well, what's to stop people from voting to stop all hospitals from treating gays if we use your laws?\" I said, \"Nothing, but nothing is stopping them from doing that if we use your laws either\".\n \n I am not saying that the people should be allowed to regulate businesses. Neither one of us is saying that we should let the majority decide this. You're saying medical centers should decide who to treat, and I'm saying that no one should be allowed to decide that someone cannot recieve medical treatment. Realistically, those with political power (the majority) have the ability to pass whatever laws they want, but that doesn't mean I'd agree with it.",
