In what cases is there any evidence of this, and why has it not been drawn to the attention of the Supreme Court?\n\n \n We are allowed to discriminate. In the broadest sense, it is perfectly legal to \"discriminate\" among job applicants between the qualified and the non-qualified. We are not allowed to discrimate for non-job related characteristics such as religion, gender, age, race, country of origin, marital status, etc. These categories are known as \"protected classes\" and sexual orientation is not one of them. A court of law can and indeed, has \"discriminated\" on the basis of sexual orientation. The glaring example I remember was Cracker Barrel restaurants (a national chain), which had a policy specifically excluding gays because it harmed the family atmosphere or something. Persons fired specifically because they were gay took Cracker Barrel to court and lost. \n \n Many Americans misunderstand what rights gays and lesbians now have. They assume incorrectly that the LGBT community is already protected by the Constitution or some other law. That's not the case. No federal law protects gays and lesbians from discrimination based on their sexual orientation. \n \n Here is a link I found that looks like it is objective. I am not a lawyer, but it seems to be accurate, at least by my limited understanding. I just found it by googling.

I don't see a problem with redefining something that has allready been redefined since it was instituted. Marriage, when it was instituted as a legal contract, was about property.

When marriage contracts came into being as legal documents marriage was about property, the transfer of wealth, and the merging of rich and powerful families. Is this still true today? Is marriage today about love and personal choice or property? If you answer love and personal choice then you are trying to defend something that has allready been redefined. If it has been redefined once it can be redefined again. If marriage is about love how can you defend keeping two people, regardless of sex, who love each other from joining in marriage?

Protection, therefore, against the tyranny of the magistrate is not enough; there needs protection also against the tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling, against the tendency of society to impose, by other means than civil penalties, its own ideas and practices as rules of conduct on those who dissent from them; to fetter the development and, if possible, prevent the formation of any individuality not in harmony with its ways, and compel all characters to fashion themselves upon the model of its own.\"",

I just thought I'd sign up to join you guys. \n \n Reading the whole 8 pages has been interesting.\n \n First off- I don't think this family-setup in sick in anyway at all.

It's too back to nature if the \"bigger\" guys always wins (might over right), and yep, we traded that \"Nature right\" when we took civil rights. That's why (example... so don't get me wrong) Christainity is not the religion of America, we may base our nation on it and that majority follows it, but we don't force anyone here to be part of it. Freedom of religion right?

Sodomy is considered a sin. But if that the case I know MANY heterosexuals that commit this sin (not to say many other sins... but whatever).\n \n However if you are talking about homosexuality in general as a sin, I would love to see those words.

It is hypothesised that in humans, in common with all other mammals studied, hormones significantly influence this dimorphic development although, at present, the exact mechanism is incompletely understood. It is also postulated that these hormonal effects occur at several critical periods of development of the sexual differentiation of the brain during which gender identity is established, initially during the fetal period, then around the time of birth; and also post-natally. Factors which may contribute to an altered hormone environment in the brain at the critical moments in its early development might include genetic influences (Landen, 1999; Coolidge et al, 2002) and/or medication, environmental influences (Diamond et al., 1996; Whitten et al., 2002), stress or trauma to the mother during pregnancy (Ward et al., 2002; Swaab et al., 2002).\"\n \n http://www.100megs13.com/~triflux/transwarrior/articles.htm\n \n University of Arizona:\n \n There is a critical level during which the fetus is especially sensitive to levels of sex hormones. \n &#61623; prenatal hormonal imbalances during this period could contribute to homosexuality \n \n http://www.u.arizona.edu/~tommyb/Orientations.html\n \n p.s.

   "And just which translation of Genesis doesn't have God smoting Sodom for abominations of nature?emoticon_confused\n\n \n I don't intend to debate the bible nor do I care to. My only point is that there are different interpretations. In the end, regardless of anyones interpretation, this can not be used to put laws into place to restrict an individuals rights. Here is one interpretation of a passage, this is only to prove my point. Who is to say your interpretation is the right one? \n \n PASSAGE 2\n GENESIS 19:1-14\n THE STORY OF SODOM\n \n Now let's consider the second biblical text used by some people to condemn God's gay children. You remember the ancient story of Sodom. First, what does the story of Sodom in Genesis 19 say about God?\n \n This story is not primarily about sex. It is primarily about God. Some people say the city of Sodom was destroyed because it was overrun by sexually obsessed homosexuals. In fact, the city of Sodom had been doomed to destruction long before. So what is this passage really about?\n \n Jesus and five Old Testament prophets all speak of the sins that led to the destruction of Sodom -- and not one of them mentions homosexuality. Even Billy Graham doesn't mention homosexuality when he preaches on Sodom.\n \n Listen to what Ezekiel 16:48-49 tell us: \"This is the sin of Sodom; she and her suburbs had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not help or encourage the poor and needy. They were arrogant and this was abominable in God's eyes.\"\n \n Today, heterosexuals and homosexuals alike do well to remember that we break God's heart when we spend all we earn on ourselves, when we forget the poor and hungry, when we refuse to do justice or show mercy, when we leave strangers at the gate.\n \n I admit, there are a lot of gay folk who are Sodomites (and a lot of straight folk as well). Sodomites are rich and don't share what they have with the poor. Sodomites have plenty and want more. While millions are hungry, homeless, and sick, Sodomites rush to build bigger homes, buy bigger cars, and own more property -- putting their trust in safer stock portfolios and more secure retirement accounts.\n \n Whatever teaching about sexuality you might get out of this passage, be sure to hear this central, primary truth about God as well. God has called us do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with our Creator. Sodom was destroyed because its people didn't take God seriously about caring for the poor, the hungry, the homeless, or the outcast.\n \n But what does the story of Sodom say about homosexual orientation as we understand it today? Nothing.\n It was common for soldiers, thieves, and bullies to rape a fallen enemy, asserting their victory by dehumanizing and demeaning the vanquished. This act of raping an enemy is about power and revenge, not about homosexuality or homosexual orientation. And it is still happening.\n \n The sexual act that occurs in the story of Sodom is a gang rape -- and homosexuals oppose gang rape as much as anyone. That's why I believe the story of Sodom says a lot about God's will for each of us, but nothing about homosexuality as we understand it today.",
