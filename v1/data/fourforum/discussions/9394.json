And a foetus before the mental development is no more a being than my uterus. \n\n Love and sex may not mean that you always want a baby. But love means that you must always be willing to accept a baby as a product of love if one comes about. To do otherwise is an affront to love and is a false and hedonistic love, not a self-sacrificing love and love is self-sacrificing.\n \n Abortion is a contradiction of love, a denial of love, a betrayal of love, a destruction of love in the most profound sense. It destroys a unique, once in a lifetime, personal human being that was the embodiment of the love of two individuals for one another. Abortion is never compatible with love. \n \n 1. I pledge my self to you in love, I give you my heart, mind, and soul. \n \n 2.I give you my body and become united with you in love, one flesh, one body. \n \n 3.I destroy the body that comes forth from our love, that is a profession of our love, that is a creation of our love, that is a constant reminder of our love, that is a sign of our love that will continue living. I destroy a part of each of us that has come together to make a new person. I destroy our love. \n \n Number 3 does not fit. It creates a rift in the progression of love.\n \n Your uterus is not comparable to a fetus. It develop as a human being.

The first and foremost reason is that we love each other deeply and want to express our love for each other through the act of having sex. We're attracted and commited to each other, so we just do what is natural. Finally (also a very good reason) is that it just feels good!\n (emphasis mine)\n \n I was simply trying to point out that abortion is not natural at all. It is not natural or good or right thing to rip a living human being out of the womb--a being that is the product of your physical union out of love. Your assertion was that sex was a natural extension of love and therefore something to be done simply because it was natural. So if you are to do what is natural and what is natural is good then you should not have aborted.\n \n Love is not all that is needed to have sex. Marriage is needed. Because only there is love secured by committment--lifelong committment. True love...in sickness and in health, for richer or poorer, until death do us part, lovingly accepting children. Marriage and its lifelong committment is also needed for sex because it protects the natural product of love and sex--children. A lifelong committment is the only sound protection for children that must be raised. We all know the detriment and deleterious effects of divorce and lack of mom and dad to raise children.\n \n Furthermore you consider yourself a Christian. But Christian morality prohibits abortion. \n \n I ask you to consider the teaching of Father Frank Pavone on the matter. He illustrates a remarkable contrast in thought on abortion between abortion supporters and Christ. \n \n Abortion supporters say, \"This is my body, I can do with it what I want. I can destroy others to preserve my life. I can destroy others so that I may live as I want. Do not interfere with me.\"\n \n Whereas, Christ says, \"This is my body, which is given up for you.\" \n \n \"This is my body\"--same words but much different in intent, in action, in charity, in love, in faith, in hope... Jesus gives his body away so that others live. Abortion proponents cling to their own bodies so that others die. \n \n There is a profound difference. Christian abortion supporters should think about this most basic and fundamental foundation of Christianity.\n \n Abortion will never solve the problems that people attempt to solve with it. It is an act of violence. Abandonment of a father, fear of scandal and shame, loneliness and depression of a pregnant woman, violence of rape, violence and perversion of incest, preservation of lifestyle, lack of readiness to be a mother, the void of a family or support system...abandonment, fear, shame, loneliness, violence, perversion cannot be solved by adding the violence of and perversion of abortion. Only love can solve these problems. Abortion cannot be distorted to appear as something that could be good. It will never be a solution.",

To do otherwise is an affront to love and is a false and hedonistic love, not a self-sacrificing love and love is self-sacrificing.\n \n Abortion is a contradiction of love, a denial of love, a betrayal of love, a destruction of love in the most profound sense. It destroys a unique, once in a lifetime, personal human being that was the embodiment of the love of two individuals for one another. Abortion is never compatible with love. \n \n 1.

What gives you the right to define our love? You are one of the most insulting posters I've run into. Oh, by the way, the abortion did nothing to create a rift, in fact, it brought us even closer together.\n \n \n \n\n \n You must hate yourself then. I did not bring the \"natural\" argument into play. I was only responding to your statement that sex is a natural development of love:\n \n (emphasis mine)\n \n I was simply trying to point out that abortion is not natural at all. It is not natural or good or right thing to rip a living human being out of the womb--a being that is the product of your physical union out of love.

A lifelong committment is the only sound protection for children that must be raised. We all know the detriment and deleterious effects of divorce and lack of mom and dad to raise children.\n\n First of all, nothing but attraction (and not even that, money, etc.) is really neeed to have sex. Sex can be an expression of love, bt it doesn't have to be. Marriage is not the be-all end-all of love: I know several people who have not been married, and yet have lived together and loved each other for over thirty years.\n \n \n\n Furthermore you consider yourself a Christian.

Christian abortion supporters should think about this most basic and fundamental foundation of Christianity.\n\n \n Sorry, but it is mainly the catholics that are against abortion. Many christians are pro-choicers, notably my own church. It really depends on when you think the soul actually enters into the equation. Many people beleive that it is when mental existance begins, which is my personal beleif: Just as death is determined by the ceasing of mental existence, which signifies the soul leaving the body, so life begins with mental existence where the soul enters the body.\n \n \nAbortion will never solve the problems that people attempt to solve with it. It is an act of violence.

If you would support forcing a girl who was raped or her family members forced her to have sex with them to carry out a pregnancy, then I think that is repulsive, and you immediately lose any credibility in my eyes.

   "Max, I am breathlessly awaiting JPII's proclamations on orgasm. I think, perchance, we all are.\n\n Dr. Ruth, eat your heart out. Simone you will soon be ready to pledge your undying affection and devotion to the pope. Here follows the pope's statements on orgasm that I mentioned previously. Continue breathlessly.\n \n From Love and Responsibility , written by Karol Wojtyla (John Paul II's pre-papal name) way back in 1960..\n \n The basic premise of the book is the Personalistic norm:-the person is the kind of good which does not admit of being used and cannot be treated as an object of use and as such the means to an end. In its positive form the norm confirms this: the person is a good towards which the only proper and adequate attitude is love. (i.e. love your neighbor as yourself)\n \n JP II extends this personalistic principle to the sexual act in the following excerpt pg. 272-275:\n \n \"Sexual ethics, the ethics of marriage, must examine closely certain facts on which clinical sexology can provide precise information. We have defined love as an ambition to ensure the true good of another person, and consequently as the antithesis of egoism. Since in marriage a man and a woman are associated sexually as well as in other respects the good must be sought in this area too. From the point of view of another person, from the altruistic standpoint, it is necessary to insist that intercourse must not serve merely as a means of allowing sexual excitement to reach its climax in one of the partners, i.e. the man alone, but that climax must be reached in harmony, not at the expense of one partner, but with both partners fully involved. This is implicit in the principle which we have already so thoroughly analysed, and which excludes exploitation of the person, and insists on love. In the present case love demands that the reactions of the other person, the sexual 'partner' be fully taken into account.\n \n Sexologists state that the curve of arousal in woman is different from that in man-it rises more slowly and falls more slowly. Anatomically, arousal occurs in the same way in women and in men (the locus of excitement is in the cerebro-spinal system at S2-S3). The female organism, as was mentioned above, reacts more easily to excitation in various parts of the body, which to some extent compensates for the fact that the woman's excitement grows more slowly than that of the man. The man must take this difference into account, not for hedonistic, but for altruistic reasons. There exists a rhythm dictated by nature itself which both spouses must discover so that climax may be reached both by the man and by the woman, and as far as possible occur in both simultaneously. The subjective happiness which they then share has the clear characteristic of the enjoyment which we have called 'frui', of the joy which flows from harmony between one's own actions and the objective order of nature. Egoism on the other hand-and in this context it is obviously more likely to be egoism on the part of the man-is inseparable from the 'uti' in which one party seeks only his own pleasure at the expense of the other. Evidently, the elementary teachings of sexology cannot be applied without reference to ethics.\n \n Non-observance of these teachings of sexology in the marital relationship is contrary to the good of the other partner to the marriage and the durability and cohesion of the marriage itself. It must be taken into account that it is naturally difficult for the woman to adapt herself to the man in the sexual relationship, that there is a natural unevenness of physical and psychological rhythms, so that there is a need for harmonization, which is impossible without good will, especially on the part of the man, who must carefully observe the reactions of the woman. If a woman does not obtain natural gratification from the sexual act there is a danger that her experience of it will be qualitatively inferior, will not involve her fully as a person. This sort of experience makes nervous reactions only too likely, and may for instance cause secondary sexual frigidity. Frigidity is sometimes the result of an inhibition on the part of the woman herself, or of a lack of involvement which may even at times be her own fault. But it is usually the result of egoism in the man, who failing to recognize the subjective desires of the woman in intercourse, and the objective laws of the sexual process taking place in her, seeks merely his own satisfaction, sometimes quite brutally. \n \n In the woman this produces an aversion to intercourse, and a disgust with sex which is just as difficult or even more difficult to control than the sexual urge. It can also cause neuroses and sometimes organic disorders (which come from the fact that the engorgement of the genital organs at the time of sexual arousal results in inflammation in the region of the so-called little pelvis, if sexual arousal is not terminated by detumescence, which in the woman is closely connected with orgasm). Pyschologically, such a situation causes not just indifference but outright hostility. A woman finds it very difficult to forgive a man if she derives no satisfaction from intercourse. It becomes difficult for her to endure this, and as the years go her resentment may grow out of all proportion to its cause. This may lead to the collapse of the marriage. It can be prevented by sexual education-and by this I mean more than merely instruction in sexual matters. For it must be emphasized yet again that physical disgust does not exist in marriage as a primary phenomenon, but is as a rule, a secondary reaction: in women it is the response to egoism and brutality, in men to frigidity and indifference. But the woman's frigidity and indifference is often the fault of the man, when he seeks his own satisfaction while leaving the woman unsatisfied, something which masculine pride should in any case forbid. But in some particularly difficult situations natural pride may not be enough in the long run-everyone knows that egoism may either blind a man and rob him of his pride or, on the contrary, result in a morbid hypertrophy of pride, which causes him to lose sight of the other human being. Similarly, the natural kindness of a woman, who (so the sexologists tell us) sometimes 'shams orgasm' to satisfy a man's pride, may also be unhelpful in the long run. These are mere palliatives, and cannot in the end give satisfactory solutions to the difficulties experienced in intercourse. There is here a real need for sexual education, and it must be a continuous process. The main objective of this education is to create the conviction that 'the other person is more important than I'. Such conviction will not arise suddenly and from nothing, merely on the basis of physical intercourse. It can only be, must be, the result of an integral education in love. Sexual intercourse itself does not teach love, but love, if it is a genuine virtue, will show itself to be so in sexual relations between married people as elsewhere. Only then can 'sexual instruction' bestow its full benefits: without education in our sense it may even do harm.\n \n This is where the 'culture of marital relations' comes in and what it means. Not the 'technique' but the 'culture'. Sexologists often put the main emphasis on technique, whereas this should rather be thought of as something secondary, and often perhaps even inimical to the purpose which it is supposed to serve. The urge is so strong that it creates in the normal man and woman a sort of instinctive knowledge 'how to make love' whereas artificial analysis (and the concept of 'technique' implies this) is more likely to spoil the whole thing, for what is wanted here is a certain spontaneity and naturalness (subordinated of course to morality). This instinctive knowledge must subsequently mature into a 'culture of marital relations'. I must refer here to the analysis of 'tenderness' to be found in section 3 of Chapter II. This ability to enter readily into another person's emotions and experiences can play a big part in harmonization of marital intercourse. It has its origin in 'sentiment', which is directed primarily towards the 'human being' and so can temper and tone down the violent reactions of sensuality, which is so oriented only towards the 'body' and the uninhibited impulses of concupiscence. Precisely because a slower and more gradual rise in the curve of sexual arousal is characteristic of the female organism the need for tenderness during physical intercourse, and also before it begins and after its conclusion, is explicable in purely biological terms. If we take into account the shorter and more violent curve of arousal in the man, an act of tenderness on his part in the context of marital intercourse acquires the significance of an act of virtue-specifically, the virtue of continence, and so indirectly the virtue of love (see the analysis in Section 3 of Chapter III). Marriage cannot be reduced to the physical relationship, it needs an emotional climate without which the virtues-whether that of love or that of chastity-become difficult to realize in practice.\"\n (Emphasis mine)\n \n Christopher West even states in his book Theology of the Body for Beginners which explains Pope John Paul II's Theology of the Body and incorporates the teaching of his book Love and Responsibility that \"behind virtually every abortion is a man of lust.\" But if one operates by the personalistic norm and values sex as it should be valued--in the context of marriage, then this won't happen.\n \n Based on the above foundation, you might see why I have no need to stimulate arousal by reading posts in this forum. Nor would my wife for that matter.",

What did you think of what Karol Wojtyla (JP II) wrote? Did it have any substance? Was his analysis of sexual relationships and his descriptions of men and women accurate? What would you think of a man that wanted to give to you in sex rather than get from you?

Was he wrong in stating that men are the ones who most often abuse the sexual relationship? Was Christopher West's interpretation and extrapolation of the pope's teaching wrong in saying that \"there is a lustful man behind every abortion?\" I am wrong in saying that this is another reason premarital sex cannot be sanctioned--because women must protect themselves from lustful men with ulterior motives?\n \n Can celibate priests counsel on sex? What do you think after reading the excerpt I provided? Obviously, not all priests could do it but obviously, some would be very good at doing it. A good celibate priest is not one who has no desire or no natural inclinations toward women and a nuptial relationship.

I am simply objectively stating that abortion is a contradiction of love based on the information you volunteered. Destroying another being--more specifically, a being that came about because two people were \"expressing their love\" is contrary to love.\n \n If you love your fiance so completely then why did you not accept his child? Why did you not care for and love the embodiment and manifestation of your love for him? You all made love. In fact, you made your love into someone, into somebody, another body distinct from you all but at the same time part of you both, your own flesh and blood--the union of persons made another person. A person resulted from your love and you did not love that person, you destroyed it.\n \n This situation might very well have brought the two of you closer together. Often, bad situations and wrong actions bring people together. This happens all the time when tragedy or crisis strikes.

As I already said, the natural arguments do not work, in fact, they blow up in your own face.\n\n It is hilarious if you can't see that you are the one who started the natural line of reasoning. Go back to your post #17 that I just quoted in my previous post to you. You attempted to say that you were doing what was \"natural,\" as if that was justification for having sex with someone whom you weren't married to. If you follow that reasoning, then the natural thing for you to have done was to carry, deliver, and care for your baby. That's what a mother does--that is what is natural. But you did not continue with what was natural, you did something quite unnatural. You destroyed the fruit of your love.\n \n \nFirst of all, nothing but attraction (and not even that, money, etc.) is really neeed to have sex. Sex can be an expression of love, bt it doesn't have to be. Marriage is not the be-all end-all of love: I know several people who have not been married, and yet have lived together and loved each other for over thirty years.\n\n Nothing is needed to have sex but much is needed for sex to happen in the right way. If it does not then pain and hardship is the result--single motherhood, abandonment, teenage pregnancy, broken families, poverty, emotional trauma, lack of loyalty/committment/trustworthiness in other aspects of life, disease, etc.\n \n Marriage is the be all end all of love. How could one get more poetic and ideal than marriage?... a life-long pledge of love, fidelity, sacrifice in sickness and health, in good times and bad, in poverty or riches, 'til death do they part. Why not be strong enough and bold enough to profess the vows and then live them?\n \n \nSorry, but it is mainly the catholics that are against abortion. Many christians are pro-choicers, notably my own church. It really depends on when you think the soul actually enters into the equation. Many people beleive that it is when mental existance begins, which is my personal beleif: Just as death is determined by the ceasing of mental existence, which signifies the soul leaving the body, so life begins with mental existence where the soul enters the body.\n\n God's hand enters the creative process at conception. We cannot create without him. That is when life starts. \n \n I reiterate, Jesus said, \"this is my body, given up for you.\" Christian morality must reflect that kind of love. Abortion contradicts it. \n \n All Christian churches were against contraception until the Anglicans split at the Lambeth Conference in 1930. Look it up. And as they were all against contraception and its wrongs, so too were they all against abortion until very recently when they have allowed the culture of the day to skew the truth.\n \n \nAll of those are valid reasons to have an abortion. If you would support forcing a girl who was raped or her family members forced her to have sex with them to carry out a pregnancy, then I think that is repulsive, and you immediately lose any credibility in my eyes. God gave us our bodies and minds to make our own decisions, not to have others force decisions on us\n\n God gave us our bodies is what you said. Who gave the being in the womb his body? God. Then how can we infringe on the property of God and destroy it? There are no valid reasons to take the life of another being in abortion. The child of rape and incest is an innocent. There is no repulsion in showing the mercy of God to an innocent child.",

   "I was never saying abortion will remedy all the problems with parenting in this world. But there's a lot of suffering caused to babies and children when brought into families who can't look after them, or are too stoned to look after them. I would think abortion should have probably been considered when they found themselves pregnant. Though, here they have been trying to allow doctors to make birth control mandatory for heroin addicts, but 'human rights' protests have prevented them from doing so. I'm probably getting too off topic but I feel there are a lot of situations when abortion is justifiable.\n\n There is no suffering greater than those victims of abortion suffer when their innocent life is taken from them. You are trying to solve problems with abortion as a solution when the problem is not even related to abortion. Solve the addiction. Solve the distorted value of sex and its abuse outside of the committed relationship of marriage. Come up with effective interventions for these problems. But killing a being after they have come into existence does not even address those problems. It adds another problem into the mix.",

Go on with the pregnancy and everything will be OK.\" Say hi to Bambi for me, Max\n\n I have never made statements that a woman should be a domestic doormat, quite the contrary.\n \n The only real solution is love...not a sappy ideal but the MOST REAL solution. There is much love extended to those women considering abortion though much more needs to be extended. Much more love needs to be extended from the fathers to the mother and child. Much more needs to be extended from the mother to the child in the womb. Sex itself must operate on love with committment...not on satisfying a need, on lust, on curiosity or exploring, on everybody else is doing it, on they will \"naturally\" do it...but on love with committment. This must be instilled in our children. Because from sex (i.e. making love) comes a unique being made from love and made to love and made to be loved...a lifelong love of stability, committment, and care is required...anyone venturing into that arena should be prepared for it. (Everybody loves Bambi right!)\n \n \"The Church can never renounce 'the principle of truth and consistency, whereby she does not agree to call good evil and evil good;' she must always be careful not to break the bruised reed or to quench the dimly burning wick (cf. IS 42:3). As Paul VI wrote: 'While it is an outstanding manifestation of charity towards souls to omit nothing from the saving doctrine of Christ, this must always be joined with tolerance and charity, as Christ himself showed by his conversations and dealings with men. Having come not to judge the world but to save it, he was uncompromisingly stern towards sin, but patient and rich in mercy towards sinners'\n \n The Church's firmness in defending the universal and unchanging moral norms is not demeaning at all. Its only purpose is to serve man's true freedom. Because THERE CAN BE NO FREEDOM APART FROM or in OPPOSITION TO THE TRUTH, the categorical--unyielding and uncompromising--defense of the absolutely ESSENTIAL DEMANDS OF MAN'S PERSONAL DIGNITY must be considered the way and the condition FOR THE VERY EXISTENCE OF FREEDOM.\" Veritatis Splendor/The Splendor of Truth #95 & 96, Encyclical Letter of Pope John Paul II (emphasis mine)\n \n Abortion supporters attempt to make it seem that they defend a freedom. But it is a \"freedom\" separated from the ESSENTIAL TRUTH that the being in the womb is one of uniqueness, dignity, and value that deserves respect, care, and protection--just as we all do. Because abortion is a \"freedom\" separated from the truth then it is a counterfeit freedom, a lie, a slavery. It is an attempt to solve bad situations with a bad solution. It is an evil hurled at other evils so that evil is multiplied (most of the time this evil having been initiated by the lust and abandonment of a man, as I said previously). \n \n But the Church welcomes all as Christ did. It extends the mercy of Christ to those considering abortion, those having gone through abortion, those performing abortion. It calls them back to right judgment and justice in their living. It tells them as Christ told the woman whom he saved from being stoned, \"Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?...Neither do I condemn you; go, and sin no more.\"",

However, from a previous discussion I had with Sigma, it seems that Sigma takes the view at one end of the spectrum that would fully allow abortion at all stages of pregnancy because of rights of the mother over her own body outweighing all other considerations. Most pro-choice supporters apparently don't take the arguement as far as Sigma does. The statistics (shown below) show that most pro-choice supporters would generally outlaw abortion in the third trimester. This means that they acknowledge a right to life of the fetus, once it is sufficiently developed, which outweighs the rights of the woman over her own body. If they are already making this determination for the third trimester, then they certainly would not change their minds once the full term baby is born. Your claim is invalid. \n \n The statistics come from http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm which shows the one poll from Jan. 10-12, 2003 in which 84% of those polled said that abortion in the third trimester should generally be outlawed. It is the only poll I've found which addresses the trimesters separately. If one assumes that 50% of people are pro-choice and 50% are pro-life and all pro-life people would outlaw third trimester abortions, then that means that at least 68% of pro-choice supporters would generally outlaw third trimester abortions. (= (84% total - 50% pro-life) / 50% pro-choice).",

   "They have already pointed out to you - the use of a woman's body against her will. Its that simple. This is partcularly true when one, as you do, has the expectation that rape victims carry out their pregnancies.\n \n A rapist seeks to gratify him or herself through harm. They enjoy causing pain to another and do it for pleasure. This may be a desire, it most certainly is not a need in any real sense.\n \n A woman seeking an abortion is doing becuase in some way that pregnancy is a threat to her. Where your analogy fails is in the assumption that there are no valid concerns/needs that these women face and that they are acting out of malice. Nice job showing your real regard for women again, by the way.\n\n Jito,\n I have not stated that these women face no valid concerns or needs. But there is a priority of needs and concerns. The priority of life is number one.\n \n I also have not mentioned that women who are rape victims and have abortions have acted with malice. I have said that they are responding to a violent act with another violent act. \n \n I have said that there is an imbalance of power in the relationship, as in rape, and the more powerful uses that imbalance to harm. \n \n I have said that a current need or desire is prioritized over the value of human life. \n \n I have not said that there are no injuries, needs, or harm to the woman.\n \n I know you don't believe in Christianity. But consider the crucifixion for one moment. Jesus experienced a very humiliating, ridiculing, cruel, painful, violent, and fatal event. But he absorbed it and transformed it into good. He transformed hate into love. He transformed violence into mercy. He transformed death into salvation. \n \n I believe he truly, factually, and historically did these things. But even the unbeliever must admit that the author, if not writing history, was attempting to transmit a message in the crucifixion. You are in a unique position in that you have been raped. I don't remember if your son was the result of that rape. Whether he was or was not, you have the ability to transform something very bad into something that will change lives. If you advocate for a response to rape and pregnancy with acceptance of the child then you can transform fear into hope, violence into mercy, bad into good, hate into love, and even death into salvation. Is this response easy? No. Is this response painful to the mother? In certain ways, yes. Is this response difficult and trying for the mother? Definitely. Is it worth the pain, effort, emotional stress? Perhaps the rape victims who have kept their children could tell us. \n \n I know the testimony of Jennifer Maas and her mother. I have posted it previously:\n \n http://www.humanlife.org/abortion_jenni_story.php\n \n http://www.defendlife.org/newsletters/June2005/maas.htm\n \n I wish I knew of other available testimony of mothers and children who have been through rape and survived it without abortion.",

They may have greater physical strength or weild the influence of a weapon - but no do mistake such things for power. \n \n \nI have said that a current need or desire is prioritized over the value of human life. \n\n \n Yep, the mothers life and liberty. We are more than wombs.\n \n \nI have not said that there are no injuries, needs, or harm to the woman.\n\n \n Your trivialization of them says otherwise.\n \n \nI know you don't believe in Christianity. But consider the crucifixion for one moment. Jesus experienced a very humiliating, ridiculing, cruel, painful, violent, and fatal event. But he absorbed it and transformed it into good. He transformed hate into love. He transformed violence into mercy. He transformed death into salvation. \n\n \n Don't care about the lessons of your faith.\n \n \nI believe he truly, factually, and historically did these things. But even the unbeliever must admit that the author, if not writing history, was attempting to transmit a message in the crucifixion. \n\n \n I must do nothing. I find the very idea that we are so bad that we require salvatiion from a homopobic, misogynistic deity abhorrant.\n \n \nYou are in a unique position in that you have been raped. I don't remember if your son was the result of that rape. \n\n \n No. I was not made pregnant in rape nor would I keep a pregnancy from rape.\n \n \nWhether he was or was not, you have the ability to transform something very bad into something that will change lives. If you advocate for a response to rape and pregnancy with acceptance of the child then you can transform fear into hope, violence into mercy, bad into good, hate into love, and even death into salvation. \n\n \n I would never advocate for something that further disempowers victims of rape. \n \n \nIs this response easy? No. Is this response painful to the mother? In certain ways, yes. Is this response difficult and trying for the mother? Definitely. Is it worth the pain, effort, emotional stress? Perhaps the rape victims who have kept their children could tell us. \n\n \n Please stop. You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. You get more insulting every time you post. \n \n \nI know the testimony of Jennifer Maas and her mother. I have posted it previously:\n \n I wish I knew of other available testimony of mothers and children who have been through rape and survived it without abortion.\n\n \n Well, I knew a rape victim who also kept her baby and turned her trauma from the rape into abuse. We all have our little stories.",
