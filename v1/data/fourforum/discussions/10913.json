Homosexuals were the first in the US to begin contracting AIDS, and their activities (in bath houses, having anal sex, oral sex, etc.) spread the disease like wildfire.\n\n \n This is really just finger-pointing, though. To say it spread \"due\" to a certain group is offensive and accomplishes nothing, a point made(in relation to Haitians) in this informative article:\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/04/AR2007110400959_pf.html\n \n Are gay people any less unwitting victims of the initial spread of a sexually(not merely homosexually), transmitted virus? It would make sense that it would stay mostly in the community where members only have sex with one another(rarely with heterosexuals). When it spreads to heterosexuals from their activities, are they less responsible, it is less \"due\" to them because they identify with the heterosexual label or group? \n \n \nIn fact, it is quite telling that the AIDS virus was first called GRID - Gay Related Immunodeficiency Disease before the PC crowd applied pressure to rename it to a more neutral name. Link here to a 1982 paper where GRID is mentioned: http://www.aegis.org/news/nyt/1982/NYT820610.html\n\n \n It wasn't an accurate name however, as it happens to heterosexuals as well. Keeping the inaccurate name would serve what purpose?\n \n \nOnce it was permeating the Gay Community blood supply it spread through the bisexuals of the community (very often to their unsuspecting heterosexual partners) and the innumerous Gay intraveous drug users throughout the general populace,\n\n \n \"Innumerous\" gay IV drug users, you make it sound like it's especially prevelent amongst gay people, and that isn't so. It also spread through heterosexual IV drug users. Drug use has nothing to do with sexuality. \n \n \nIt is well known that homosexual sex spreads HIV/AIDS more easily than heterosexual sex, mainly due to the parts of the body that are being used in each - the anus is quite open to transmittal of the virus, while the vagina is much less conducive to the transmittal of the virus.\n\n \n Gay people have the same types of sex as heterosexuals. It may be more easily spread through anal sex than vaginal. However there are many other variables to consider for an individual person and risk. Unprotected vaginal sex is considered high risk for transmission of HIV. \n \n \nI would go so far as to say that if \"Patient Zero\" had in fact been a heterosexual, there is a large possibility that there would never have been a \"Patient one\".\n\n \n There's really no such thing as a \"patient zero\", as my link above shows.

There is no such thing as \"homosexual behaviour\". Gay people have the same types of sex as heterosexuals, and the way we have sex as gays will vary.\n \n \nAddressing the topic of AIDS, Foreman drastically deviated from the \"gay\" lobby's party line by admitting, \"Internally, when these numbers come out, the 'established' gay community seems to have a collective shrug as if this isn't our problem. Folks, with 70 percent of the people in this country living with HIV being gay or bi, we cannot deny that HIV is a gay disease. We have to own that and face up to that.\"\n\n \n Yes, of course gay people need to be vigilant about prevention, we shouldn't have apathy. This is clearly not soley a gay disease. The fastest growing group getting it in North America, are young heterosexual women. In the 1990s numbers of new infected went down dramatically, because the gay community was using prevention practices. There is always more that can be done. \n \n \nA little over a year ago, Lorri Jean, CEO of the Los Angeles-based Gay and Lesbian Center, similarly shocked the \"gay\" community by stating that, \"HIV is a Gay Disease. Own it. End it.\"\n\n \n Well, again that is factually incorrect. HIV is not a gay disease. Ending it by taking responsibility for one's own actions, I'd have no problem with. Not every gay sexual action is irresponisible or leads to the harm of others.\n \n \nForeman's admission comes on the heels of a letter from Matt Barber, Concerned Women for America's (CWA) Policy Director for Cultural Issues, inviting Foreman and other homosexual activists to work together in discouraging homosexuals from engaging in the high-risk behaviors researchers recently determined are responsible for the epidemic spread of a potentially deadly strain of staph infection among certain segments of the \"gay\" community. The CDC has acknowledged that many of those same high-risk behaviors, such as male-male anal sex, are chiefly responsible for spreading HIV/AIDS.\n\n \n UNPROTECTED male-male anal sex will spread HIV. How about gay men in long-term monogamous relationships or marriages, where trust is there? That is not high risk. \n \n \nMatt Barber addressed Foreman's admission: \"It's extremely encouraging to see Matt Foreman, a homosexual activist who has for so long been in denial about the dangers of the lifestyle he has promoted, publicly coming to terms with the undeniable perils of that lifestyle.\n\n \n Foreman wasn't saying that. There is no \"gay lifestyle\". Gay people live out sexuality in many diverse ways. \n \n \n\"I only hope he will now stop promoting homosexual conduct and push for other liberal elites, especially those running our public schools, to do the same. Educators must truthfully address the 'gay' lifestyle's potentially deadly consequences.\n\n \n Barber doesn't have a clue, adding one and one and getting five! \n \n \n\"It's criminally reckless for the National Education Association and liberal educators to put political correctness and a deceptive political agenda above the lives, health and well-being of America's children.

Link here to a 1982 paper where GRID is mentioned: AEGiS-NYT: Clue Found on Homosexuals' Precancer Syndrome Once it was permeating the Gay Community blood supply it spread through the bisexuals of the community (very often to their unsuspecting heterosexual partners) and the innumerous Gay intraveous drug users throughout the general populace, and then through the numerous gays that supplied blood to blood banks (many of them even after it was revealed that it could be spread through blood and that gays should be tested first, etc.), shich sent it even further into the general population.\n \n Here is a timeline: Timeline: A Brief History of HIV/AIDS - AEGiS\n (emphasis mine)\n \n \n It is well known that homosexual sex spreads HIV/AIDS more easily than heterosexual sex, mainly due to the parts of the body that are being used in each - the anus is quite open to transmittal of the virus, while the vagina is much less conducive to the transmittal of the virus.\n \n I would go so far as to say that if \"Patient Zero\" had in fact been a heterosexual, there is a large possibility that there would never have been a \"Patient one\".\n \n Well, hopefully this will be a good startup for thedebate - I will post more later on.\n\n \n Listen to your logic (or as the case may be, the lack of it).\n If the disease was contracted and spread, within the gay community, amongst gays..then how could it have possibly jumped into the heterosexual community, unless folks are straddling the fence and having both straight and gay sex...and \"unprotected sex\", at that? \n You have no right to blame the gay community for the spread of the disease into the general population. Blame those of your community that like to \"creep\", with men (infected and otherwise) and then take the virus home to their girlfriends and wives and lovers. \n And let's not forget that \"allegedly\" Patient Zero, Gaetan Dugas, was a French-Canadian flight attendent who like to get his freak on with African males....who were infected with tainted monkey polio vaccine, either neglectfully or maliciously. Rumors of wiping out whole populations to exploit resources has basis in fact. Man's inhumanity to man..and all that.",

Not that you will regard it as anything but propaganda, but at least I will have made the effort to communicate the truth of history. \n \n African slave trade - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n African Slave Trade, 1788\n \n \n \n Then perhaps the Jews are the ones who created the AIDS virus with their advanced science from the future in order to depopulate Africa and raid its resources. You claim they control everything, perhaps they're behind the current AIDS epidemic. Of course such an argument would undercut your claims about a white conspiracy since Jews originated from the Middle East rather than Europe where the white people were.\n\n \n Uh, I minored in history.
