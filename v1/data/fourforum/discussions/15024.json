   "Congratulations everyone! Pat on the back all-around. \n \n Debt now equals total U.S. economy - Washington Times\n President Obama projects that the gross federal debt will top $15 trillion this year, officially equalling the size of the entire U.S. economy, and will jump to nearly $21 trillion in five years' time.\n \n Amid the other staggering numbers in the budget Mr. Obama sent to Congress on Monday, the debt stands out - both because Congress will need to vote to raise the debt limit later this year, and because the numbers are so large.\n \n Mr. Obama's budget said 2011 will see the biggest one-year jump in debt in history, or nearly $2 trillion in a single year. And the administration says it will reach $15.476 trillion by Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year, to reach 102.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) - the first time since World War II that dubious figure has been reached.\n We are running out of time to solve this thing.",

   "I agree with you, we must do something, we can't just let the deficit grown uncontrollably.\n\n \n The good thing is it is easy to figure out the solution. When you are 100% over your revenues you simply have to cut half the budget. Considering Medicare/Social Security/Defense/interest make up close to 2/3rds the budget you know good places to start. \n \n Each departments budget should be cut immediately by 15-20% this year, then 10-15% the following, then 5-10% after that. Tell the departments to make a priority list and simply go down until you run out of money. Everything below the line is gone. \n \n The states did it, the feds can do it too.",
