There's some validity in your argument, certainly. But I do think the majority of cat owners already agree with you - letting our cats out is generally a bad idea, but mostly for the cat's sake. It presents more opportunities to catch diseases and get killed in the road.

I have bird feeders set up on my property and don't appreciate my neighbor's cats stalking the very birds I attract with my feeders.

There's basically two types of irresponsibility we're talking about here. The first being cats being let out in the first place. As I said, its dangerous for the cats. However, many people simply feel that this is where their cats belong, where they're happiest. This leads to the second issue, which is spaying/neutering those outdoor cats. Now, if all pet owners who aren't breeding cats have them spayed or neutered, as they should, then this would go a long way towards cutting down on the feral population, which would ease the burden on the bird population. \n \n \nThat's your rebuttal to cats trespassing on other's property?
