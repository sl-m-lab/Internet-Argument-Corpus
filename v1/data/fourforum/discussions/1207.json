   "God did not 'come' from anywhere, time did not exist before the big bang so God does not have a beginning. Life outside of spacetime is stagnant there is no time.\n Space and Time are tangled up, this is what modern physicists believe. \n The universe is spacetime. So if the Universe did not exist neither did time. \n \n \nThere is one school of thought that says that time is a loop with no real beginning or end. Maybe everything has happened. Whatever everything is\n\n \n Yes, but remember space and time are connected. The Universe is spacetime. So saying that the universe is in a time loop is the same as saying that space is static and has been here always which is not very probable considering the findings made by physicists in the past century.\n \n \nI've heard creationists use the same question when they also try to disprove that the universe is around 15 billion years old instead of their 10,000 years. \n \n The answer to that argument is that the Universe is expanding, so light does not heat up the Universe, that is also why we have not reached a thermal equilibrium and observations of background radiation have shown that the density in the Universe was once 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons per cubic inch, meaning that the matter in the Universe was once on top of one another in the 'primeval atom' Lamaitre talked about. \n If you want to disgagree take it up with Stephen Hawking, becase i got this from his book.\n Besides, What does thier argument have to do with my argument? I never said the Universe was only 10,000 years old. You said the concept of God is illogical, I say it's not. I say that there is plenty of evidence of God.\n I'm not talking about a Hebrew war God here. I'm talking about the only God there is, a Supreme Being who governs the Universe and who is only concerned with the make-up of the Universe, of which we are a part. \n You haven't presented any evidence against God. All you've been using are 'what ifs' and posing ad hominem arguments against Christians.\n \n \nIt makes more sense than what you believe which is \"Puff, GODDIDIT!\". We can show that these things exist, we can't show that god exists.\n Define oblivion in this context? Is it a place without time and form? Isn't that where you say you god came from?\n You can believe that your god came from nothing, or has existed forever, but you can't accept the same of the universe. The difference is that the universe is easy to prove its existence, it is not so easy to prove god's existence. \n You believe in god because you want to, not because of any real evidence. Read my thread \"Why People want to believe there is a god.\" and you'll see this.\n\n \n \n Do you have any proof that God is a figment of the imagination?\n So far the only God you've been debating about is the traditional Pentecostal or Catholic God. You seem to think that the only God people believe in is the God they taught about in Sunday school. I don't think you know why people believe in God (or gods).\n I'm talking about a Prime Mover, a God of quantum mechanics, a God of chaos theory, a God that can be understood. \n You keep mentioning these people who just believe. But I 've seen many different religions and I can tell you there are people out there who know rather than believe. They understand everything, biology, astronomy, ecology, physics.

It is therefore finite in extent. In the second kind of model, which expands forever, space is bent the other way, like the surface of a saddle. So in this case space is infinite. Finally, in the third kind of Friedmann model, with just the critical rate of expansion, space is flat (and therefore is also infinite).\n \n But which Friedmann model describes our universe? Will the universe eventually stop expanding and start contracting, or will it expand forever? To answer this question we need to know the present rate of expansion of the universe and its present average density. If the density is less than a certain critical value, determined by the rate of expansion, the gravitational attraction will be too weak to halt the expansion. If the density is greater than the critical value, gravity will stop the expansion at some time in the future and cause the universe to recollapse.\n \n \nI have also read a brief History of Time.
