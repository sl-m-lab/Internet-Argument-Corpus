While to me the fact that the Sauds can't seem to pony up an extra million barrels per day is a pretty clear indicator of what is going on in the real world, I believe this is the first time any ME nation has slipped up and allowed anybody to see realistic numbers. If you couple this with the fact that Gewar has peaked, it seems likely that Kuwaits oil production is either at peak or very close to it. \n \n I would think this would be front page news, not something that you are not likely to find without a search. If this is indicitive of the entire ME, as seems likely, that puts our oil peak a LOT closer than the 50 yrs that the US DOE has pegged.",
