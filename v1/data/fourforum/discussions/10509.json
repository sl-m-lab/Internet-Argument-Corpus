   "Um, no. Seven pair of every clean (kosher) animal, and two pair of the unclean (trafe).\nI don't think that the Bible is quite clear on that subject. I have seen some discussion before about whether Noah took 7 of each clean animal, as opposed to 7 pair. However, as I read Genesis, it seems pretty clear that Noah was to take 2 (not 2 pair) of every unclean animal, you know, male and female.\n \n(I like the seven pairs of each species of elephant best.)\nI had never considered whether elephants were clean or unclean before. However, there are 3 extant species of elephant, and at least 4 times that many species of mammoth and mastodon. How interesting that Noah had over 200 of these huge animals aboard.\n \nInsects are unclean. So you need two termite queens and two males of each species of termite.\nThat's not how I understand Genesis. As I understand it, and as it has been explained to me by several fundamentalists, unclean animals were brought aboard by twos - not two pairs. That would make one queen and one drone of a whole lot of communal insects. In fact, in termites, ants and bees, the queen mates with multiple partners only once in her life, when these insects swarm. One female and one male just doesn't cut it.\n \nThen you have to decide whether to take any non-breeding female workers and the colony apparatus, or whether you want to take care of the queens and their later offspring yourself until the colonies can function on their own again.\nThat's a good point. Certainly none of these communal insects would have been able to reproduce without the workers to care for the eggs and feed the larvae. That is a problem that would be true of all of the Hymenoptera - and yet, we have many species of ants, bees, and wasps.\n \nPS I find that it is much more fun, with much less aggro, to agree with Creationists and work around to the contradictions, rather than to tell them they're wrong.\nI particularly enjoy presenting the problems that arise from the creationist position and asking them to explain. Maybe your method is better since mine results in creationist exit from the discussion.\n \nOf course people in that advanced state of cognitive dissonance are as incapable of seeing their contradictions as if they had been hypnotized. Cognitive dissonance was first described in a church where the prediction of the end of the world on a certain day had failed, and the church grew as a direct result.\nOf course, they like to talk about how science is based on assumptions or presuppositions, while 'creation science' is based on TROOTH. All you need to do is start from the 'assumption' or 'presupposition' that the Bible is literally true in every detail, and then reject all facts and observations that disagree.
