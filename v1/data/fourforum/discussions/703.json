   "Where are the weapons of mass destruction that Bush claimed Saddam had? Recently, pro-war people like myself have been asked this question by those who were opposed to the war.\n \n My answer is:\n \n 1) Saddam may not have WMD anymore. He might have given them to a terrorist group or to another country like Syria. If this were the case, I would tend to go with Syria because Saddam doesn't care for too many terrorist organizations and Saddam would have a better chance of getting his weapons back from Syria than he would from a group like Al Qaeda.\n \n However, Saddam's actions prior to the war make it obvious that he was hiding something. Whenever inspectors arrived at a place where Saddam's people seemed even remotely surprised, the inspectors were either delayed or were told that they would have to return at a later time.\n \n Also, why did it take two UN resolutions to get inspectors back into Iraq? If Saddam destroyed his weapons like he claimed he did once the inspectors left, why wouldn't he let the inspectors back in to inspect the remaints, as UNSCR 687 requires?\n \n 2) If WMD still exist in Iraq, they are hidden. Saddam is a master survivalist. He survived the Gulf War and then survived 7 extra years while WMD were being found by inspectors by playing deceptive games with the UN and the US. Saddam's weapons aren't going to be in plain view; they're going to be well hidden.\n \n Right now, soldiers are in Iraq looking for WMD, but the soldiers have other duties, too. Baath party members and Republican Guard units are still in Iraq and are still fighting our troops. Everyone wants to find those weapons, but very few even have time to search for them right now.\n \n If WMD are in Iraq, we will find them. It might take awhile, but we will eventually find them.\n \n Weapons inspectors who are trained to find WMD searched Iraq for four months and found nothing. Many people said to give them more time. American soldiers who are not trained to find WMD have searched Iraq for one month and found nothing. The same people now claim the weapons didn't exist. Doesn't that seem hypocritical to anyone?",

   "It seems like you are giving a poor excuse here, Wjim.\n Hypothetical situation:\n Policeman knocks at your door, asks to search your house. You say \"no.\" later he comes back with a search warrent, which you make sure is valid, then, grudgingly, you let him in. He finds nothing.\n What does this mean?\n Well in America, it means nothing. We accept, through the 4th amendment and a general right to privacy, that people can refuse to be searched for any reason at all, so long as the searching authority doesn't have a warrent. The refusal to grant a search in ones home doesn't de facto make one guilty. No court would accept the policeman's argument that \"I couldn't find anything, but if there was nothing, why wouldn't he let me in?\" We accept, as a matter of principle, that people have the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. At the point where the exercising of that right becomes an argument for guilt, the right is meaningless. Iraq was, in effect, doing the same thing in this case. Just as you cannot be assumed guilty for refusing to allow a search in your house until forced to, neither can Iraq. Think of the consequences for national sovereignty.",
