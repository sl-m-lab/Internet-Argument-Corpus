   "There were several reasons for the outbreak of the American Revolution, all revolving around one central theme. That theme was the attempt by the British aristocracy to exert control over the American colonies. Prior to ~1763, for over 100 years, the colonies had enjoyed a form of 'benign neglect'. London had essentially ignored the colonies and the colonists had liked the relationship, establishing their own local governments. Several English (before the Act of Union, so they were English not British) governments tried to change the situation but the chaos that was the English political system in the 17th century prevented that. Charles I fell just before trying to establish control over the colonies; the same was true of Oliver Cromwell and James II (?, the one that fell in the Glorious Revolution). \n \n Starting around 1763, King George III launched his own initiative designed to bend the colonies to London's authority. By this point, the colonists' luck had run out and George III was able to start the program without a political collapse back home. The colonists, seeing a policy that went against over a century of tradition, were worried. Some of that fear was lessened by the American popular support of the monarchy. The Empire's victory in the Seven Years' War/French and Indian War, however, meant that the colonies no longer faced the threat of the French from Canada, reducing the need for protection from Great Britain. Furthermore, One Parlamentary Act after another slowly eroded at the support of the monarchy and the mother country. \n \n This erosion was only partly due to taxation. Yes, the colonists were quite angry over the lack of representation. The areas that became the heart of the early Revolution (particularly New England) enjoyed a long history of representative government and local town meetings. These men were perfectly willing to pay taxes (many small villages paid vast sums to arm themselves in defense of the right to avoid a small tax from Great Britain, not exactly a monetarily based argument), but they wanted to be involved in the decision making process. Or, more accurately, they wanted to tax themselves. There were other sources of discontent. Many colonists feared that London would impose an official Anglican Church on the colonies (there were recommendations to do so). The Currency Act was blamed for the collapse in the colonial economy in the 1760s. The garrisoning of troops in seaport cities (rather than the frontier where they were needed) caused many conspiracy-minded Americans to ponder why, and none of the answers were innocent. This interference or imagined interference drove many colonials to support the Whig movement or end open support for the Tories.",

   "Actually if you want to know the reasons for the war read the Declaration of Independance, it's a very informative document if you want the opinion of the revolutionaries. Anyway they were and always had been part of England, but England had spoiled them by letting them be independant and they kind of liked that experience. They liked it enough that when England tried to show it had control over the colonies they decided to fight a war. And the tea tax was not the sole reason, it was the breaking point. We read \"Johnny Tremain\" in 7th grade and that sort of explained why. If any newspaper printed a single thing wrong about England the newspaper was banned and the editors could be hanged for treason. They had to quarter Brittish soldiers even though there was no war. It would be sort of like if we sent soldiers to Puerta Rico (an American colony) and quartered them in the houses of people there. And if they overheard anything said bad about America we gave them permission to shoot them. Then on top of that we decided to put taxes on them. Of course we protect them from other countries but they have no proptection against their own country. Before the war, we had been apart from England long enough to know that we could live without England, so when they tried to show they had complete control, we rebelled and decided we wanted to be our own country. Again in the Declaration of Independence they list the grievences they had with the king.",

Imagine how ****** you'd be if you were Scotch-Irish.\n \n If Britain had allowed America to be an independent nation under the commonwealth, the whole war could have been avoided. America would have achieved its goal of self determination before the war had even begun. But Britain decided to rely on something called 'virtual representation' which basically made the statement that 'we, the Brits represent you'.. we weren't buying it, so eventually after they felt pressured enough Britain offered to allow proportional representation in their parliament. However, America's population was small enough that we couldn't have made any kind of impact, and we therefore, would never have achieved self determination.. taxation, shipping rights, and relations with the indians were the main American interests. I think Duo gave a pretty good summary of the Indian wars and their relation to the taxations.\n \n Britain continuously found ways to tarnish their image, for instance, their governors simply 'sucked', especially the New York Royal governor. \n \n Well, I'm a wee bit drunk right now, but that's what I had in mind-- not thorough, but good enough.\n \n EDIT: Also, if you lived over the line of the Proclamation of 1760, Britain couldn't give a damn what the Indians did to you.",

   "The keyword you're using there is: apologist. I can't help but notice that maybe that is the route you're taking. Believe it or not, Europe wasn't always such a beautiful place. Europe was the embodiment of all that America hates. There was absolutely no social mobility, given that the European quasi-feudal system was at complete odds with America's system of meritocracy. Wherever you went in Europe there would be a grand 'establishment', if your opinions differed on certain subject matters (religion, etc.), you would not succeed, in fact you might be killed.\n \n If there was nothing wrong with Europe, then I guess the Catholics, the Hugenauts, the French peasants, the German revolutionaries never existed.\n \n Europe was a ****ed up place even up until World War I, when a bunch of XXXXX cousins decided they would sacrafice thousands of their countrymen for literally nothing. And don't give to me a bunch of XXXX about 'loyalty to alliances' following the Serbian assassination of some regal Austrian (logic would have persuaded these nations to get their asses out of these alliances and agree to diplomatic conclusions.. oh, but wait, when all the power is to be held by some pomp pricks, I guess the people end up getting screwed).. hm.. that's odd, I wonder what the Serbs were fighting for.. it couldn't have been against anything 'bad' could it? Because nothing bad ever existed in Europe.\n \n It's probably not a good idea to leave negotiations up to a bunch of Euro-fruits either. Hm.. what happens when you get a bunch of dumbassed, unintelligent, nationalistic XXXXXX together to decide the fate of Germany in something called The Treaty of Versailles? You get Nazi Germany, that's what you get.\n \n I guess there was never a peasant class in Russia, either... nor a such thing as the USSR.\n \n Given the roots of these events, clearly there was nothing (sarcasm) to leave Europe for.\n \n PS. It doesn't take a kid with an elementary knowlege of American history to know who the people populating the western fringes of the Proclamation Line were. Learn who those people (yes, you might have to hear about a group of people known as the Scots-Irish)are, why they came here, and I think you should pick up a text-book that isn't some XXXXXXn British perspective on American history that glosses over everything that portrays Europe as something other than what it wants itself to be. Pick up a Bailey and Kennedy textbook called 'American Pageant' from a used online bookstore, and learn about our history. Until then, don't try and pretend that you know everything about our history and about our ancestors. \n \n The sad thing is that you are European, you should understand your own history and its correlation to our's.. but then you throw around this 'apologist' theory and don't understand the hypocrisy in it all.\n\n Nothing here is backed up. You're the one throwing claims like 'There was absolutely no social mobility' which is ridiculous from the little knowledge of history I have: I recently read about Henry VIII and his most powerful minister was Wolsey, born the son of a poor butcher.",
