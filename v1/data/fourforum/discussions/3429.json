   "National Sales Tax Continuing to Outpace Other Reform Proposals\n \n An October 6 House Budget Committee hearing gave several GOP lawmakers a public forum to vet their tax reform proposals, but a national sales tax bill (H.R. 25) sponsored by Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., is looking increasingly like the Republican favorite.\n \n Part of an ongoing GOP campaign to build momentum toward a major tax reform effort in 2005, the hearing appeared to be the public equivalent of last week's closed-door House Republican Conference meeting on fundamental tax reform. \n \n \"It's become clear in recent months that the Linder bill has more momentum than any other proposal,\" a GOP leadership aide told Tax Analysts. Linder denied, however, that the hearing was held only for show, telling Tax Analysts that all the proposals would be given a fair shake.\n \n \"I think I'll win the argument in the final analysis,\" Linder said. \n ------------------------------------------- \n \n In my travels across the country as a volunteer for FairTax, coalitions director, and eventually as executive director, I have seen the passion and commitment to replacing the income tax with the FairTax grow to monumental proportions. We are at a critical juncture. The clock is ticking and funds are very low. \n \n Your contributions are needed today to pay for research, materials for volunteers (we are running low), and media. If everyone who received this e-mail gave a mere $10 a month, we would be able to keep this momentum going and multiply it by 100 times. Yes, 100 times!! \n \n If you have not given before or if you have some spare this month, please contribute today http://secure.fairtaxvolunteer.org/contribute/index.html. \n \n If you are giving on a regular basis, I ask that you increase your amount to the maximum that you can afford at this time. We are nearing a critical point where all forces must be rallied. http://secure.fairtaxvolunteer.org/contribute/sustain.html. Thank you for your sacrifice. \n \n You can also contribute by mailing or faxing in your donations. http://www.fairtaxvolunteer.org/join/join_check.html. \n \n We can win this but only with your help. \n \n ONWARD & UPWARD!!\n \n Best Regards,\n Tom Wright, Executive Director\n AFFT (Americans For Fair Taxation)",
