   "My earliest memories are of being in my grandmother's vegetable garden. I have had my own garden almost every year since 1981. From 2007 to last January I had been living on a 3/4 acre piece of property that my mother and I inherited from her brother. I had a 1600 square foot garden. But between my conjestive heart failure and my severe arthritis I cannot keep that much property mowed and will have to sell it. Now I am back where I had been- on a city lot with little space for a garden.\n \n So earlier this year I got involved with a community garden that was being organized by a post-middleaged man who knows nothing about gardening.\n \n However, my experience with this garden and its organizer has been dismal. You see, the organizer is a left-wing new age fruitcake who is the epitome of the typical Obama supporter (he contributed $1500 to Obama's campaign according to records published on the Huffington Post website).\n \n 1. He doesn't have the common sense that God gave a gnat. I set out 35 tomato and pepper plants only to be told that the only way we can water the garden is to hand-dip stagnant water out of a retention pond because the nearest well is 1200 feet away (you cannot pump water that far without having multiple pumps and there is no power source except at the existing well- but the man thought the well would be useable anyway). I was promised a pump for the pond and eventually a new well with solar panels. But it is now 4 months later and hand-dipping the stagnant water is all the garden still has. Only a fool or an Obama supporter would be stupid enough to think you can grow anything without water- especially in Florida's 90+ degree heat (which was 100 degree heat a few days last month).\n \n 2. Since the garden organization has over 40 members while the organizer, two other people and myself have been the only people to actually attend the meetings or do any of the work involved (as of last May), I suggested to the organizer that we ask the other members for financial help so a well could be dug. The organizer refused. The garden consists of a large communal plot that is bound to lead to having non-workers step in at harvest time and demand a share like welfare recipients. But when I expressed objections to this set up the organizer told me to contribute to the world and see what the world gives in return. The fool and Obama supporter has no clue how the world has treated me- born 10 weeks premature; divorced parents; deadbeat father; mother disabled with lupus and now I have congestive heart failure due to a leaky aortic heart valve. I don't trust the world any further than I could throw it.\n \n 3. The man is naive to a fault. The local Ag department and a local pond contractor have warned me against using the water from the retention pond. By the organizer's own admission the water has coliform bacteria in it, but he is crazy enough to believe the water is safe.\n \n 4. The garden organizer is also the property owner, but in typical Obama-supporter lying fashion he has not bothered to tell anyone of this fact. According to records I found on the net the organizer is the sole incorporator and officer of the corporation that owns the property. He says the garden is set up as a non-profit organization, but he has yet to show anyone the paperwork to this effect (it must be with Obama's birth certificate). Any improvements that the garden organization makes to the property will be money in his pocket when he decides to expel the garden and build condos- which he already has zoning to do.\n \n 5. The man also has no trouble making up lies on the spur of the moment to try to get something he needs. He has no gardening experience so he wants me to teach him. But by the end of April I had told him that I would not be involved without having a decent source of water. So now that his garden is overrun with weeds and bugs and he is clueless about what to do he is lying to me by saying the retention pond is spring fed. He also told me that he has financial commitment for half the cost of a well, but it was only last week before he announced this fact on the garden's website. \n \n 6. Last month I found online where the organizer has set up another organization for people who want to use their psychic abilities to change the world. So I guess the man is using his psychic abilities to protect himself from the stagnant water he is putting on his food. It's too bad that his psychic abilities won't protect us from Obama's taxes, energy policy or healthcare program.",

The UK Conservative party would love to funnel money into the pockets of private healthcare the way Obama has, but they would get themselves lynched if they tried it here.",
