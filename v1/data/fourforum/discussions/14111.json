We have some books written in their name, but not written by them.\n\n \n So all you have is supposition are guess work, based on the idea that Paul doesn't agree with conventional Jewish thought. Who knew, someone who had experienced a huge, life changing conversion doesn't believe exactly the same as he did before. His rejection of the law is a result of his conversion, not any indicator of the depth of his prior conviction. Quoting from the septuagint makes sense if that is the extant copy of the scriptures in the language he was writing at the time, which it clearly was. It would be frankly bizarre for Paul to take passages from Hebrew scripture and translate them himself, when the passages already existed in the Greek text of the Septuagint.",

You are ignorant of the purpose of the Law.\n \n THE LAW\n \n The \"Law,\" as we have come to know it in systematic theology, is often seen as a collection of Old Testament commandments, given to Moses by God on Mount Sinai, and carried forth into the New Testament, most notably by Jesus Christ and the apostle Paul. Originally, torah (the usual Hebrew word in the Old Testament for \"law\") meant oral instruction or direction . It has since come to be used as a comprehensive term for the whole Pentateuch, in which all of the most important legal collections were carefully included (Hastings 533). \n \n In the Old Testament, there were three main categories of law: ceremonial, civil, and moral.\n \n CEREMONIAL LAW\n \n Ceremonial law is specifically related to the Levitical priesthood, and is seen in explicit detail in the book of Leviticus. In addition, we see other ceremonial requirements for the preparation and maintenance of the tabernacle, and its furnishings, in other books of the Pentateuch (Exodus 25, for example). Ceremonial law applies not only to the holiness and qualifications of the high priest, but also to how various types of sacrifices should be prepared and offered. Burnt offerings, fellowship offerings, sin offerings, etc., all required a knowledge of God's divine and ceremonial law before the proper sacrifice could be presented. It's primary purpose was to foreshadow, or point forward to, the perfect sacrifice of Christ that was made at Calvary. These laws, for all intents and purposes, were discarded and rendered unnecessary after Christ's crucifixion, though the necessity of worshipping a holy and righteous God through a holy and consecrated priesthood of believers still applies. \n \n CIVIL LAW\n \n The civil laws that were given to the Israelites were primarily meant to address tenets of everyday living. These laws governed such things as divorce, lending, payment of wages, harvesting, and numerous other activities (note Deuteronomy chapter 24). Though many of these laws have now been abrogated in some detail, they still remain as a basic guideline for godly living in many parts of the world. American civil law, tort law, contract law - all have a \"genetic\" heritage in the civil laws of ancient Israel, and show us the \"mind of God\" for the civility of mankind.\n \n MORAL LAW\n \n Includes the Ten Commandments. These basic laws, perhaps more than any other Old Testament commandments, show us the divine nature and character of God, and are absolutely revered in all institutions of true Christianity to this day. For the record, they are as follows, as stated in Exodus chapter 20:\n \n 1. You shall have no other gods before (besides) me.\n 2. You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in\n heaven above, or on the earth beneath, or in the waters below.\n 3. You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God.\n 4. Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.\n 5. Honor your father and your mother.\n 6. You shall not murder.\n 7. You shall not commit adultery.\n 8. You shall not steal.\n 9. You shall not give false testimony against your brother.\n 10. You shall not covet. \n \n These laws of God are objective. They are for all people, at all times in history, in all places of civilization. Man's laws, by comparison, are subjective. They vary from culture to culture, from one time period to another, and from place to place. Prohibition (of alcohol) is a good example. At one time alcohol consumption was legal. Then came prohibition, and finally alcohol was again legalized (through certain restrictions still apply today). So we see the subjective and changing nature of \"worldly\" law in contrast to God's eternal standards. When God says, \"You shall not commit adultery,\" that commandment is for everyone, no matter when or where they may live.\n \n When studying Biblical law, it is important to recognize the difference between the \"letter\" of the law and the \"spirit\" of the law. This was an extremely contentious issue between Jesus and the pharisees of His day. Several examples of this are noted in Matthew chapter twelve, when the pharisees chastised Jesus for healing the man with the withered hand on the Sabbath, and when the disciples were picking grains of wheat to eat. The pharisees went to an extreme to keep the letter of the law, but forgot to keep the Spirit of the law when they tried to keep God's children from being healed and fed on the Sabbath day. Jesus replied that, \"it is lawful to good on the Sabbath\" (Matthew 12:12). Noting this, the apostle Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians 3:6 that the \"letter (of the law) kills, but the Spirit gives life.\" \"Mercy triumphs over judgment\" (James 2:13). \n \n Author Josh McDowell once said, \"True justice demands a clear, moral definition of right and wrong (as in the Ten Commandments). With today's humanistic doctrine of \"tolerance\" (tolerance of alternative \"lifestyles,\" fornication, lying, etc.), there are no clear, moral guidelines, because most everything's \"okay.\"  So you can't have justice and tolerance both.\" Any thorough review of early American history shows that the founding fathers did not want a theocracy, yet at the same time they still recognized God as the foundation upon which this country was established. \n \n THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW\n \n From my review of scripture there are four major purposes of the law. The first is that the law was intended to show us the character and morality of the sovereign God. If we want to know what God's opinion is concerning adultery or murder, we can look at the sixth and seventh commandments to realize that God does not approve of them. If we want to know if we are involved in idol worship (such as money), we can look at God's second commandment, as well as Matthew 6:24, and Luke 16:13, to see what God's word says about that. But the most important realization that we can come to is that there is but one righteous and sovereign God who is clearly defined through His divine law, and that divine law is perfect.\n \n \"For the law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul.\" (Psalm 19:7)\n \n The second major purpose of the law is that it is a tutor, or a teacher, to lead us to Christ. \n \n \"So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ, that we might\n be justified by faith.\" (Galatians 3:24)\n \n \"Indeed I would not have know what sin was except through the\n law.\" (Romans 7:7)\n \n In Galatians 3:19 the apostle Paul wrote, \"What, then was the purpose of the law? It was added because of transgression until the Seed to whom the promise referred (Christ) had come.\" The main point here is that man needs to have some set of guidelines, or law, as a reference to know whether or not he is sinful. Without the law, man indeed did not know what sin was, but once the law was given, three things happened: (1) Man knew the moral character of the righteous God; (2) Man knew by his review of the law that he was sinful;\n \n \"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.\"\n (Romans 3:23)\n \n (3) Man came to the realization that an unfathomable gulf exists between the righteous God and unrighteous, sinful man, and therefore a savior was needed to bridge the gap.\n \n \"What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this\n body of death? Thanks be to God - through Jesus Christ our\n Lord.\" (Romans 7:24-25)\n \n \n \"But now a righteousness from God, apart from the law, has\n been made known....This righteousness from God comes \n through faith in Jesus Christ...\" (Romans 3:21, 22)\n \n The third purpose of the law is that it is a guide for Christians to live by (as opposed to be saved by). Whereas the law was initially provided as a tutor to lead us to Christ, the law also serves as a reminder to keep us \"in\" Christ. One of the interesting things that happens to a Christian in his \"walk\" is that the closer he gets to God, the more aware he is of his sinful nature. This realization serves the purpose of keeping us close to Christ, depending on and trusting in Him for our salvation. \n \n So the law is meant to guide us in our day-to-day walk of faith in Christ. Now there is one extremely important observation that needs to be addressed here. That has to do with the relationship of the law to salvation. Keeping the law does not result in eternal life or salvation. That was never the purpose of the law in regards to man. But it was the purpose of Christ to fulfill that law on our behalf, so that by faith in Him we could all become righteous in the eyes of God. \n \n \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the\n Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill\n them.\" (Jesus, Matthew 5:17)\n \n \"(In Christ)....We have been released from the law so that\n we serve in the new way of the Spirit.\" (Romans 7:6)\n \n This is one of the biggest stumbling blocks that Jews and some Christians get caught up in - trying to \"keep\" the law, or trying to do something to help win their salvation.\n \n  \"Know that a man is not justified (righteous) by observing\n the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ....(by) observing the \n law no one will be justified.\" (Galatians 2:16)\n \n It would do us well to forget about the law as far as our salvation goes, and try to remember it as a guide for daily Christian living. \n \n The last purpose of the law is to show us where there may be \"traps\" and pitfalls in our lives.  For instance, by not committing adultery, we don't have to worry about getting shot at by a jealous husband, or a jealous wife. Our reputations and our consciences stay clear from disgrace. Our marriages remain stronger, and our families tend to stay together longer. Furthermore, we are free from any discipline from God that might take place should we commit such a sin, and we tend to stay out of the \"clutches\" of Satan at the same time.\n \n \"...Hand this man over to Satan, so that the sinful nature\n may be destroyed and his spirit saved on the day of the\n Lord.\" (1 Corinthians 5:5)\n \n Another example is if we keep God's law about not stealing, we don't have to worry about going to jail. And so it goes from law to law. The law is there for our protection, and grants us liberty from many adverse and unpleasant consequences. \n \n In summary, the law serves four major purposes:\n \n 1. It shows us the moral character of God.\n 2. It is a tutor to lead us to Christ.\n 3. It is a guide for Christian living\n 4. It can keep us from suffering the adverse consequences of our sins.\n \n The law does not provide salvation, or justify a person.\n The law does not sanctify, or make a person holy.\n \n LEGALISM\n \n Now, whereas Christianity is based on the grace and unmerited favor of God for salvation, and not on works for salvation, worldly religion is viewed as any system in which man, through his own efforts and works, tries to do something to earn God's favor, and eternal life. Accordingly, legalism is a religious system that promotes and teaches the idea that man can earn, through his own efforts and works, the blessings and salvation of God.  It is often seen in one or more of the following equations:\n \n Good Works = Salvation\n Grace + Works = Salvation\n Grace + Baptism + Works = Salvation\n Grace + Circumcision = Salvation\n \n Of course, the correct salvation equation is:\n \n Grace (through faith in Jesus Christ) = Salvation\n \n Works does not enter into it, because works is something that man does. If man can do it, then he can boast about it, and Paul reminds us:\n \n \"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and\n this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works,\n so that no one can boast.\" (Ephesians 2:8-9)\n \n Works was not a factor in the salvation of the thief on the cross next to Jesus. Nor is it a factor in the salvation of any man, at any time in history. Grace is the gift of God, and as such, it cannot be earned.\n \n So, pappi, that's your Law101 review for today.",

You are ignorant of the purpose of the Law.\n\n \n I am going to go out on a limb here, before even reading the jibberish below and say most if not all of it will be wrong or incomplete making it purposefully misleading.\n \n \nTHE LAW\n \n The \"Law,\" as we have come to know it in systematic theology, is often seen as a collection of Old Testament commandments, given to Moses by God on Mount Sinai, and carried forth into the New Testament, most notably by Jesus Christ and the apostle Paul. \n\n \n To bad other types of Theology see it differently. If Paul carried the Law anywhere it was to a hole in the ground where he tossed it and had future generations all take a scoop of dirt to bury it. \n \n How is it possible you can say Paul did anything but engineer the Christian position that the Law is not necessary?\n \n \n \nOriginally, torah (the usual Hebrew word in the Old Testament for \"law\") meant oral instruction or direction . It has since come to be used as a comprehensive term for the whole Pentateuch, in which all of the most important legal collections were carefully included (Hastings 533). \n\n \n Some will use it this way, but is that correct?\n \n \nIn the Old Testament, there were three main categories of law: ceremonial, civil, and moral.\n\n \n And so man begins to put forth his desire and his will on God's word. If God wanted it separate and distinct he would have made it that way. Since he didn't why do feel it necessary to correct him? God didn't make categories, man did.\n \n \n \nCEREMONIAL LAW\n \n Ceremonial law is specifically related to the Levitical priesthood, and is seen in explicit detail in the book of Leviticus. In addition, we see other ceremonial requirements for the preparation and maintenance of the tabernacle, and its furnishings, in other books of the Pentateuch (Exodus 25, for example).

Did God tell you which ones are and which are not? Man determined which huh?\n \n \nIt's primary purpose was to foreshadow, or point forward to, the perfect sacrifice of Christ that was made at Calvary.\n \n \n According to God's Laws he was not a perfect sacrifice, nor was he properly sacrificed. God is specific on how a sacrifice is to be offered and what condition it is to be in.\n \n \nThese laws, for all intents and purposes, were discarded and rendered unnecessary after Christ's crucifixion,\n \n \n Discarded yes, rendered unnecessary, only if you want to make God a liar.\n \n \nthough the necessity of worshipping a holy and righteous God through a holy and consecrated priesthood of believers still applies. \n \n \n Gee the church was lucky that clause manged to survive Jesus. Where does JESUS say this?\n \n CIVIL LAW\n \n \nThe civil laws that were given to the Israelites were primarily meant to address tenets of everyday living. These laws governed such things as divorce, lending, payment of wages, harvesting, and numerous other activities (note Deuteronomy chapter 24). Though many of these laws have now been abrogated in some detail, they still remain as a basic guideline for godly living in many parts of the world. American civil law, tort law, contract law - all have a \"genetic\" heritage in the civil laws of ancient Israel, and show us the \"mind of God\" for the civility of mankind.\n\n \n So Gods laws were not good enough. Man found them to be imperfect and that is the reason many of them have been abrogated.\n \n Genetic heritage? Seriously? If it wasn't for man there there would be no Law. God had no intention of writing down the Law for man.\n \n \n \nMORAL LAW\n \n Includes the Ten Commandments.

Then came prohibition, and finally alcohol was again legalized (through certain restrictions still apply today). \n\n \n Cherry picking is really not a good way to make your point. \n God's laws must be subjective as well. The differ from one denomination to another. They differ from one religion to another. The Sabbath used to a sanctified holy day to last forever, now it isn't.\n God's law says know images of anything in Heaven, but almost every church has a statue of the Crucifixion or angels or some other representation of something in Heaven. \n \n \nSo we see the subjective and changing nature of \"worldly\" law in contrast to God's eternal standards. When God says, \"You shall not commit adultery,\" that commandment is for everyone, no matter when or where they may live.\n\n \n But man had already come up with many of these laws prior to them being given by God. If eternal then why does man see fit to ignore or modify them?\n \n \nWhen studying Biblical law, it is important to recognize the difference between the \"letter\" of the law and the \"spirit\" of the law. This was an extremely contentious issue between Jesus and the pharisees of His day. Several examples of this are noted in Matthew chapter twelve, when the pharisees chastised Jesus for healing the man with the withered hand on the Sabbath, and when the disciples were picking grains of wheat to eat. The pharisees went to an extreme to keep the letter of the law, but forgot to keep the Spirit of the law when they tried to keep God's children from being healed and fed on the Sabbath day. Jesus replied that, \"it is lawful to good on the Sabbath\" (Matthew 12:12). Noting this, the apostle Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians 3:6 that the \"letter (of the law) kills, but the Spirit gives life.\" \"Mercy triumphs over judgment\" (James 2:13). \n\n \n This in my opinion is one of the biggest problems facing Christianity today. Deny it all you want, but it's out there and getting worse.\n \n \n \nAuthor Josh McDowell once said, \"True justice demands a clear, moral definition of right and wrong (as in the Ten Commandments). With today's humanistic doctrine of \"tolerance\" (tolerance of alternative \"lifestyles,\" fornication, lying, etc.), there are no clear, moral guidelines, because most everything's \"okay.\"  So you can't have justice and tolerance both.\"\n\n \n You mean like God will tolerate sinners in heaven who accept Jesus?\n \n Cherry picking your your augments again. \n \n How many times does it take to forgive the same offense because the perpetrator repented to make it tolerating the behavior?\n \n \nAny thorough review of early American history shows that the founding fathers did not want a theocracy,\n \n \n yep\n \n \nyet at the same time they still recognized God as the foundation upon which this country was established.\n \n \n Nope\n \n \nTHE PURPOSE OF THE LAW\n \n From my review of scripture there are four major purposes of the law. The first is that the law was intended to show us the character and morality of the sovereign God. \n \n \n How? It didn't come from God.\n \n \nIf we want to know what God's opinion is concerning adultery or murder, we can look at the sixth and seventh commandments to realize that God does not approve of them. If we want to know if we are involved in idol worship (such as money), we can look at God's second commandment, as well as Matthew 6:24, and Luke 16:13, to see what God's word says about that. \n\n \n What about #4 or #9?\n \n \n \nBut the most important realization that we can come to is that there is but one righteous and sovereign God who is clearly defined through His divine law, and that divine law is perfect.\n \n\n \n \n Then why don't you follow it and why do you accept it being changed?\n \n \n \nThe second major purpose of the law is that it is a tutor, or a teacher, to lead us to Christ. \n \n \"So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ, that we might\n be justified by faith.\" (Galatians 3:24)\n \n \"Indeed I would not have know what sin was except through the\n law.\" (Romans 7:7)\n \n\n \n Tutor maybe, guide no.\n \n \n \nIn Galatians 3:19 the apostle Paul wrote, \"What, then was the purpose of the law? It was added because of transgression until the Seed to whom the promise referred (Christ) had come.\" The main point here is that man needs to have some set of guidelines, or law, as a reference to know whether or not he is sinful. Without the law, man indeed did not know what sin was, but once the law was given, three things happened: (1) Man knew the moral character of the righteous God; (2) Man knew by his review of the law that he was sinful;\n\n \n Please explain how this is in harmony wit hthe merciful God of Adam and Eve? Did they not eat the fruit of knowledge of good and evil? Is that not why man suffers and dies for all his generations? Were not cities destroyed and genocide committed by God because of man being wicked? Did not God flood the world for this same reason, but here man did not know he was doing evil until merciful God gave him the law. If man did not know the moral character of God then he does now.\n \n \n \"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.\"\n (Romans 3:23)\n\n \n We would be God if we did and then what need of God would we have?\n \n \n \n(3) Man came to the realization that an unfathomable gulf exists between the righteous God and unrighteous, sinful man, and therefore a savior was needed to bridge the gap.\n \n \"What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this\n body of death? Thanks be to God - through Jesus Christ our\n Lord.\" (Romans 7:24-25)\n\n \n You seem quite capable of fathoming the gulf. At least well enough to explain it in such detail. As far as I know nothing has changed for man. He is still a sinner, still scratches out an existance, still suffers and still dies. He had hope of an afterlife before God came and reminded him he existed.\n \n \n \nThe third purpose of the law is that it is a guide for Christians to live by (as opposed to be saved by). Whereas the law was initially provided as a tutor to lead us to Christ, the law also serves as a reminder to keep us \"in\" Christ. One of the interesting things that happens to a Christian in his \"walk\" is that the closer he gets to God, the more aware he is of his sinful nature. This realization serves the purpose of keeping us close to Christ, depending on and trusting in Him for our salvation. \n \n \n Nothing says pride like being dependent and wallowing in or finding comfort in your shortcomings. Makes a parent proud to know their children can't take care of themselves.\n \n \n \nSo the law is meant to guide us in our day-to-day walk of faith in Christ. \n \n \n No still doesn't.\n \n \nNow there is one extremely important observation that needs to be addressed here. That has to do with the relationship of the law to salvation. Keeping the law does not result in eternal life or salvation. That was never the purpose of the law in regards to man.\n \n \n I am going to go with God on this one over Paul. Because God implies a very different set of concepts.\n \n \n \nBut it was the purpose of Christ to fulfill that law on our behalf, so that by faith in Him we could all become righteous in the eyes of God. \n\n \n \n Look forward to you explaining this.\n \n \n \nNow, whereas Christianity is based on the grace and unmerited favor of God for salvation, and not on works for salvation, worldly religion is viewed as any system in which man, through his own efforts and works, tries to do something to earn God's favor, and eternal life. Accordingly, legalism is a religious system that promotes and teaches the idea that man can earn, through his own efforts and works, the blessings and salvation of God.  It is often seen in one or more of the following equations:\n \n Good Works = Salvation\n Grace + Works = Salvation\n Grace + Baptism + Works = Salvation\n Grace + Circumcision = Salvation\n \n Of course, the correct salvation equation is:\n \n Grace (through faith in Jesus Christ) = Salvation\n \n Works does not enter into it, because works is something that man does. If man can do it, then he can boast about it, and Paul reminds us:\n \n \"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and\n this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works,\n so that no one can boast.\" (Ephesians 2:8-9)\n \n\n \n And yet they still mange to do so. \n \n \n \n \nWorks was not a factor in the salvation of the thief on the cross next to Jesus. Nor is it a factor in the salvation of any man, at any time in history. Grace is the gift of God, and as such, it cannot be earned.\n \n\n \n \n What do you think you do by accepting Jesus? A work. Will faith alone give salvation? No it won't. God must have intended works to give forgiveness and he allowed man to participate in that. God was letting man learn to take responsibility.\n \n By the way, that thief on the cross what happened to him? Jesus said he would be in Heaven that day, but nobody could be resurrected until Jesus and Jesus was supposedly in the ground for 3 days (but not even the Apostles who were there know for sure) and those dead that came up when Jesus died and went into the town how did that work?\n \n \nSo, pappi, that's your Law101 review for today.\n\n \n Remind me to only hire you on a contingency basis and only after you finish \"Teach yourself the Bible in 24 hours\" book you have been working on.",

   "Why am I not surprised that you don't see how that verse would be applicable to the two of you?\n\n \n I didn't say it doesn't apply to us specifically, since it is speaking to believers, it does. But I said it doesn't apply to the point you should have wanted to make to Easy based on the discussion you are having with him. After all, you know nothing at all about either of us personally so how can you claim that we don't work for the cause of Christ in our personal lives? That is after all what James 2:17-18 is speaking about. My post is clear, read it again for comprehension rather than with a knee jerk slant and maybe you'll learn something. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/398165-post87.html",
