   "Sigma and I discussed the idea that doctor's violated their Hippocratic oath when performing abortion a while back on another thread. Any comments on a comparison of the classical Hippocratic oath and the one of modern day medicine?\n \n The classical one can be seen here:\n \n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/doctors/oath_classical.html \n \n The modern one here:\n \n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/doctors/oath_modern.html \n \n Note this paragraph in the classical oath and its implication for doctors performing abortion and euthanasia:\n \n \"I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody who asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect.

The oath specifically mentions teaching medicine to sons, while daughters are not mentioned. The quote you mention follows the same vein, that women's desires are not considered (whether to persue medicine or control their reproduction).\n \n \nTo hold him who has taught me this art as equal to my parents and to live my life in partnership with him, and if he is in need of money to give him a share of mine, and to regard his offspring as equal to my brothers in male lineage and to teach them this art - if they desire to learn it - without fee and covenant; to give a share of precepts and oral instruction and all the other learning to my sons and to the sons of him who has instructed me and to pupils who have signed the covenant and have taken an oath according to the medical law, but no one else\n\n \n Note that only male offspring are mentioned.\n \n The modern oath supports pro-choice more, imo.\n \n \nI will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick.\n\n \n When treating a woman, her situation is taken into account instead of a black-and-white \"Its a life must protect\" attitude.

Risks of STIs including AIDS and unwanted pregnancy are obvious examples that can be largely avoided by not having sex.\n \n Cervical cancer is triggered by a virus that a woman is exposed to through sex.

A person who has sex with someone he/she knows in marriage is at the same risk as a person who has casual sex with someone he/she barely knows, etc. I'm not understanding your seemingly contradictory presentations of health risks and health benefits.\n\n \n I don't know why you insist on inserting marriage into the conversation. Marriage conveys no protection nor does it increase risk. A virgin who has sex with another virgin will have very decreased risk of contracting a STD (not a 0 risk however). Having multiple partners without knowing them is obviously risky behavior. With the risks of AIDS and other STDs, I have no idea why anyone would have sex with someone they do not know, but infections still occur between people who know(or think they know) each other. Making a blanket generalization over-simplifies the problem. \n \n The reason you do not understand is that you have a preconcieved notion that marriage is some magical bond that instantly protects you from any sex related conditions. That is simply not the case. Monogamy reduces risks of some conditions, not marriage, and it does not eliminate risk. Unwanted pregnancies still will occur with monogamous relationships (even marriage), and various forms of cancer still affect married and/or monogamous couples.\n \n \n\n (Shouldn't there also be a qualification on cervical cancer related to sex also? You stated that the risk increased with multiple partners but doesn't it also increase the earlier one begins to have sex? )\n\n \n There is no single cause of cervical cancer. The National Cancer Institute lists risk factors, which does indeed include an early age of intercourse. Other risk factors are: HPV virus, a history of multiple sex partners, smoking and the drug Diethylstilbestrol (DES) given during pregnancy to prevent miscarriage.\n \n \n\n But you do agree that pregnancy benefits the health and life of the woman?\n\n \n Are you speaking in the purely physical sense? During the pregnancy or after the completion of the gestation?\n \n If the fetus and resulting baby are deformed, does that negativly affect the life of the woman? If the deformities are a result of medication needed by the woman during the pregnancy? Which is worse, not having the medication or having a miscarriage? There are simply too many variables to make a generalization, way way way too many things that affect the fetus during the pregnancy to make any sort of statement regarding what will benefit the woman.\n \n \n\n A fine line indeed. Do not some of the hormones produced during the pregnancy benefit the health of the woman?\n\n \n I'd have to do more research. With everything going on, it's hard to find anything that is a bona fide benefit.\n \n \n\n So sex is healthy in the context of life? No qualifications?\n\n \n Is there anything that is healthy, with no qualification? To the example of eating, eating is healthy. However, there are unhealthy eating habits that can put you at a high risk of choking. So, you can die from eating. Is eating now unhealthy? Certainly eating excessivly is not. Obesity is not healthy, and that results from over-eating and eating when one is not hungry. Chewing adequately is healthier for you than not, but not won't kill you. At least, not right away :P\n \n As with anything, there are risks.",

   "Do abstinence and fidelity convey more protection?\n\n \n Yep.\n \n \n\n So you believe that abstinence is a reachable goal for opposite sex couples or individuals in general?\n\n \n No, I believe abstinence-until-marriage is an unreachable goal for same-sex couples.\n \n If that is just a general question and not confusion over what I said, then I believe it is a reachable goal, but not easily reachable(depending on the person).\n \n \n\n Perfect use of safe-sex devices does not grant the same benefits of abstinence. There is one risk that abstinence does not hold--the possibility of failure or defect of the device itself.\n\n \n Nor does abstinence grant the same benefits of safe-sex devices :P They each have their benefits, they each have their drawbacks. Each person should decide for themselves which is best for them.\n \n One of the benefits of safe-sex devices is that you can have sex. Another is the regulatory benefits of the Pill. Another is the psychological benefits of sex, and the physical benefits of sex.\n \n eta, perfect use of 2 or more safe-sex devices reduce the chance of failure to effectively zero. There will still be failures, but I believe it would be much less than those who \"give in\" and fail at abstinence.\n \n \n\n Perhaps abstinence doesn't work because people don't take it seriously. Many parents committ their children to the self-fulfilling prophecy of everyone is doing it and everyone will do it. I believe that many of the failures of abstinence are simply due to someone of notable influence in a child's life (mainly parents) not taking the time to explain the value of abstinence.\n\n \n Perhaps. I don't believe it's self-fulfilling, I believe that the people who want to have sex are going to have sex. I believe that regardless of who raised the child with whatever values, there is nothing that will predict whether that child will have sex. Some might do it as an act of rebellion, some might because of pressure at school, because of a boyfriend/girlfriend, because they discovered masturbation and wanted to explore more, etc. I don't believe how you raise them will determine what they decide. I believe it will influence them to make the right choice themselves, for themselves.\n \n I also believe that raising a child in an atmosphere where sex is not discussed will distort that child's view about sex. \n \n \n\n \"How can it be more important to teach a child how to avoid disease than how to value life?\" G.K. Chesterton\n\n \n Why not both? Doesn't one lead to the other? Avoiding disease is about valuing life.\n \n \n\n I would hope that one would not take an oath lightly. Especially one like the Hippocratic Oath. The implications could be dangerous.\n\n \n Is that a threat? ;)\n \n Seriously, what implications? Taking it lightly? Why is this oath more important than others?",

   "Do you believe that one should love their partner before engaging in sex or do you approve of casual sex?\n\n \n Oh, I would always advocate loving your partner before engaging in sex. Truly told, I think we agree a lot on this subject, and disagree on how to address the problems.\n \n \n\n And these outweigh emotional trauma from the bond of sex/break-ups as well as the STD, cancer, pregnancy risks?\n\n \n I would not think so. Every person is different... some move from relationship to relationship (not necessarily casual sex) without getting emotionally invested.\n \n \n\n Does this outweigh the risk of poverty when a teen becomes pregnant? For an adult, do you believe that getting money for sex is okay?\n\n \n For me it would not. For the teen in the situation, obviously yes if she engages in that activity. It could be that she does not realize the reality of what could happen.\n \n Sex for money, as an activity stripped of the consequences, I have no real problem with. However, with the risks of various diseases and unwanted pregnancies I do not believe it is a good thing.\n \n \n\n A teen might see it in that distorted way but that doesn't make it true or right. I would hope that in this country there is always a way to support oneself besides teen prostitution.\n\n \n \"True\" and \"right\" have very little meaning for those who are desperate. I too would hope that there is always a way to support oneself, but this is not always the case. That is why I cannot support banning abortion, for instance. There will always be cases where being pregnant will force someone into a bad decision such as this. A situation where abortion will be the lesser of two evils.\n \n \n\n I disagree. I believe parents can be very influential on teens. You are saying that nothing a parent does will have an effect on their children--there is a bit of nihilism in that. If that \"child wants to have sex badly enough\" he will have it but intervention and education by the parents stem that desire in the child to put sex as an inevitable need and allow them to put in in the proper context. \n\n \n Oh, no, you misunderstand. I'm not saying that a parent has no influence on a child. I'm saying that whatever that influence, the child will weigh the risks (disobeying a parent, being punished at home, disappointment from parents, risks of diseases if they were told of them, etc) with the benefits (having sex and all that entails), and then will make a decision. If the desire to have sex is greater than the desire to remain true and pure and be in good graces with God or their parents, then that child will have sex. The desire for sex will be greater or less, depending on the person and there is no way to predict which way it will go. There is no way to predict what certain child will have sex no matter what type of family they come from.\n \n A strict puritan family can raise a girl who has sex at the first opportunity, or a free-spirited 60s family can raise a girl who waits until marriage. The parents values influence, but do not determine what the child will decide. The childs personal values will determine if he or she has sex.\n \n \n\n I know what a self-fulfilling prophecy is. I believe your statements to a type of self-fulfilling prophecy. To say that there will always be people having sex is a truism. To say that we should not attempt to intervene in the most appropriate, safe way leads into the self-fulfilling prophecy. Any kid reading your posts will do the same thing that he does when he hears his parents give the approval of which you speak (although his parents views might hold more sway).

Your statements will be reinforced by MTV safe sex campaigns, or movies, or sex education in schools all saying this and leading the kid to believe that pre-marital sex is a good thing (see your benefits above) and that it is the appropriate path to take in life. \n\n \n It is inevitable. There are too many people to think that good parenting will win out every time, or even most of the time. And there are few enough good parents to make it even a race.\n \n Pre-marital sex is natural and, the way our society is, normal. Sex in general has risks. We do what we can to reduce the risks. We should of course intervene with our kids and tell them how to be safe. That is what safe-sex education is all about.\n \n \n\n You know, sit-coms, magazines on the newstand, movies, sex education at early ages, internet porn, adult stores (the kid wondering what they are driving by), the news. \"Forced upon\" to a certain extent. The parent must monitor the children. But even if the parent does a great job of that in this society there is still exposure. \n\n \n I don't believe a parent is doing a great job if they sheild their child from the world. Hardcore internet porn I can understand ;) Like you said, however, if sex is in the proper context then virtually none of those things should distort a childs view.\n \n \n\n Yes, agreed. But the best way to deal with these sexual desires is not necessarily to have sex.\n\n \n Of course. \"Deal with\" can mean many different things. Repressing them is not a good way, imo.\n \n \n\n You putting forth something sounding incredibly liberal? I would not have guessed it. :) Yes, on the value of life we disagree.\n\n \n ;)\n \n \n\n I see your point although I would probably disagree with some of your shading in the shades of grey.\n\n \n Most likely.\n \n I kind of rambled on and may have not gotten to the point of a few things...
