   "Have you ever been to Kosovo? I went there as a member of Doctors Without Borders and do you know what? It's awesome that people live in SUCH conditions just in the center of Europe!! I would have never believed that unless I saw it with my own eyes! There will be no peace and stability in Kosovo as long as its status is unclear.\n \n The same situation is in such \"hot\" regions like Abkhazia and South Ossetia that used to be Georgian autonomies. People there remember too well the war against sanguinary dictator of Georgia Zviad Gamsakhurdia, and it is unthinkable that today's Georgian president Saakashvili will ever be able to reunite Georgia and its former insubmissive authorities only by means of negotiations, while saying so he prefers not to lose time and actively flies Georgian army to arms. Only God knows what aftermaths will be caused by a new war in the Caucasus which stands for a very important strategic issue for Europe in the terms of energy preparedness. That would be much better to yeasay the claims of Kosovo, Abkhazia and South Ossetia to sovereignty and avoid military confrontation. As time goes, they will be able to decide on their own whether to remain sovereign or abandon it. At least, there will be no war. It will be given an impulse to new developments and stability will be reached, which is most important after all.",

   "Definitely, independent Kosovo is no good for the EU. It has already divided the \"European common house\" into those supportive and non-supportive. \n And imo further discord is pending. \n D'you in the know that EU officials are working out the new regulation binding the EU member-countries to donate into Kosovo fragile economy? Well, there's one most amusing detail in it. The donation sum may be cut drastically if the country approves of Kosovo independence. I see it as just pure blackmail!! \n I also see so called America style here... kind of sanctions targeted at those \"non-loyal\" in EU. Their aim is clearly reshaping of European soil up to their liking, which is really deadly threat for EU countries territorial integrity and whole EU existence. Surely, independence of Kosovo isn't worth it!",

   "Kosovo's declaration of independence has sparked a \"domino effect\" in other parts of Europe.\n That's right - one should not be very optimistic about Kosovo's \"one-off\" move. Being backed by the US and once done, there will be all new cases of splitting apart of countries in Europe first of all, from the Basque Country in Spain to Scotland in the UK and to Flanders in Belgium - that's what we call a \"domino effect\". \n By the way, speaking about Belgium and Flanders, experts say it will only take a couple of months before it splits apart. Why so? On March 20, a new government was formed in that country with Yves Leterme as the Prime minister. For your information, Yves Leterme is a member of Flemish party who is known to be actively upholding separatist trends in that country - separation of Flanders from Wallonia. What is especially intriguing in his case, he is said to be supported by US secret services that largely assisted his becoming PM in Belgium! After Washington tested their splitting-apart-technology in Kosovo by supporting Albanian separatists, the US would use it over and over again in other European countries, starting with Belgium as it happens to be a EU political center. People in Washington all give eye-teeth for making EU feeble and unable to stand against the US. As you can see, they are succeeding in doing that.",

   "Oh my! Was Martti Ahtisaari really awarded the Nobel PEACE award? Looks like he was. But what for? As far as I know, the peace award is given for \"contribution to a more peaceful world and to fraternity between nations\". Did his plan contributed to pacific settlement of hostility between Serbians and Albanians? No it did not! Ahtisaari's plan was pro-Albanian only and it did not take into account interests of Serbians living in Kosovo! As a result, Ahtisaari's plan was a tragedy for many Serbian families in Kosovo - they were merely driven out of there being forced to leave all their belongings after Kosovar Albanians announced independence! Now I wonder how much Ahtisaari was paid by Kosovar separatists. And will he share the Nobel prize with them? I think Ahtisaari owns them a lot!",
