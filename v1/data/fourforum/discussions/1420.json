All of the money that is in it is transferred to individual accounts over the course of 10-15 years. This allows people to begin to use dollar cost averaging. (I would even be okay with 20-30 years to allow for a generational shift). It would prevent the market from being overwhelmed and allow us to slowly decrease the SSA workforce (The largest US government employer I think.) This would in turn reduce the financial obligation of the government, infuse the economy with more money, lower taxes, increase consumption, production, jobs, technology, etc.\n \n Over any 10 year period the stock market has been up. The plan to allow a phase out over 20 years or so would allow those short timers to keep their current savings in the SSA to minimize risk to them. The rest of us that are looking at 20 to 30 years to retirement would likely have a million or two to work with at retirement. \n \n What do you think?",

But you did base your argument on \"what you have seen.\" At least that is what you stated. However, to the real argument. I understand that the market is unpredictable in the short term. However, Pick any, any, 10 year period of time since the market's inception and you will find that the market has always finished up. That still isn't a guarnatee, but I will take that over the odds in Vegas any day. That 10 year period can even include the stock market crash. \n \n Someone told me that once and, being the statistic hound that I am, I looked up all of the data and did the simple calculations. It is fundamentally why I am in the market today. I wish I had started sooner. I wish someone had taught me this from the beginning.\n \n The plan I suggested, while I am no expert, allows for people to remain on the short term to protect against losses. It would require anyone starting with more than 10 years to go until retirement to invest otherwise. It would allow for the elimination of one of the largest departments on the federal level. Granted, that puts some folks out of jobs, but they would simply transition to private firms to handle the increased business. They would make more money. It works for everyone. Given the last 100 or so years of market history it would be foolish not to get your money into the private sector.\n \n Given the governments historically poor handling of money and unbelievably high overhead, it would be foolish to leave your money with them. Remember it is your money not theirs or anyone elses. You have earned it and have the right to decide what to do with it. I think it violates my rights for the government to require me to invest in a fund that has a low return that we KNOW will be defunct in 20 or so years.

It is why tax cuts here are a good thing. \n \n The problem with the economy now is that it will not likely remain growing and stable without some cuts in spending by the government and investment, by the government in the private sector.\n\n \n \n Hmmm... Well, consumption is generally effected in either two ways; either it is effected by the total demand of goods and services, or it is effected by the total supply of goods and services. When demand increases, so does consumption. When supply increases, so does consumption.\n \n Now, what you are describing here is really what generally happens when demand increases. Government can often increase the total demand by reducing taxes, or increasing governmental expenditures (like building roads or raise unemployment benefits). And it is true that the US economy is in need of an increase of total demand (as far as I know, US is experiencing a recession)\n \n It also possible for consumption to rise as an effect of increased total supply. This is generally achieved by a productivity increase caused by investments or technical breakthroughs. \n \n What I described in my previous post was would happen if the government decided to take resources from consumption (resulting in lower demand) and invest them (resulting in higher supply). Resulting in both an increase and decrease in consumption. But it is safe to say that the net result of these increases and decreases would be a decrease. This is because the investments would have a relative low marginal profit, and would thus produce low returns.\n \n Now, to try to tie this back to the original topic (privatised social service payments) it is clear that the US economy cannot afford to reduce the total demand by cutting of all current social service payments and placing the the current social service revenues in private pension funds. It would also result in a situation where the current social service recievers would get nothing. Therefor it cannot be done \"overnight\" but rather gradually during a prolonged period of time. My point is that just because the stock market historicly has produced large returns on invested capital doesn`t mean that it will be profitable for the society to use the social security payments as stock investments. It is all dependant on which effects this measure will have on the total supply and total demand on all goods and services in the economy.",

I have no idea how many there are in the old system.

I assume that you don`t have to pay tax on those savings as a wealth tax(?), but I think you will pay tax on the (potential) profit you make when you sell of your fund (or rather, your fund will pay those taxes, but you, as a customer, will pay for it in the end) and sales tax on the administration fees as well. Don`t really know what it would add up in real numbers though. I`ll do some research and get back to it.",
