Tonight, on the syndicated McLaughlin Group political talk show, Lawrence O'Donnell, senior MSNBC political analyst, claimed to know that name--and it is, according to him, top White House mastermind Karl Rove.\n \n Here is the transcript of O'Donnell's remarks:\n \n \"What we're going to go to now in the next stage, when Matt Cooper's e-mails, within Time Magazine, are handed over to the grand jury, the ultimate revelation, probably within the week of who his source is. \n \n \"And I know I'm going to get pulled into the grand jury for saying this but the source of...for Matt Cooper was Karl Rove, and that will be revealed in this document dump that Time magazine's going to do with the grand jury.\"\n \n Other panelists then joined in discussing whether, if true, this would suggest a perjury rap for Rove, if he told the grand jury he did not leak to Cooper. . . .",

Some people will be disappointed that Rove isn't implicated.\n \n \nNEWSWEEK obtained a copy of the e-mail that Cooper sent his bureau chief after speaking to Rove.

Rather, \"it was, KR said, wilson's wife, who apparently works at the agency on wmd [weapons of mass destruction] issues who authorized the trip.\" \n -snip-\n Nothing in the Cooper e-mail suggests that Rove used Plame's name or knew she was a covert operative. \n\n Source",

   "Here is a good chunk of the Newsweek article, with something else emphasized other than what the last poster did.\n \n \nJuly 18 issue - It was 11:07 on a Friday morning, July 11, 2003, and Time magazine correspondent Matt Cooper was tapping out an e-mail to his bureau chief, Michael Duffy. \"Subject: Rove/P&C,\" (for personal and confidential), Cooper began. \"Spoke to Rove on double super secret background for about two mins before he went on vacation ...\" Cooper proceeded to spell out some guidance on a story that was beginning to roil Washington. He finished, \"please don't source this to rove or even WH [White House]\" and suggested another reporter check with the CIA.\n \n Last week, after Time turned over that e-mail, among other notes and e-mails, Cooper agreed to testify before a grand jury in the Valerie Plame case. Explaining that he had obtained last-minute \"personal consent\" from his source, Cooper was able to avoid a jail sentence for contempt of court. Another reporter, Judith Miller of The New York Times, refused to identify her source and chose to go to jail instead.\n \n For two years, a federal prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, has been investigating the leak of Plame's identity as an undercover CIA agent. The leak was first reported by columnist Robert Novak on July 14, 2003. Novak apparently made some arrangement with the prosecutor, but Fitzgerald continued to press other reporters for their sources, possibly to show a pattern (to prove intent) or to make a perjury case. (It is illegal to knowingly identify an undercover CIA officer.) Rove's words on the Plame case have always been carefully chosen. \"I didn't know her name. I didn't leak her name,\" Rove told CNN last year when asked if he had anything to do with the Plame leak. Rove has never publicly acknowledged talking to any reporter about former ambassador Joseph Wilson and his wife. But last week, his lawyer, Robert Luskin, confirmed to NEWSWEEK that Rove did-and that Rove was the secret source who, at the request of both Cooper's lawyer and the prosecutor, gave Cooper permission to testify.\n \n The controversy arose when Wilson wrote an op-ed column in The New York Times saying that he had been sent by the CIA in February 2002 to investigate charges that Iraq was trying to buy uranium from the African country of Niger. Wilson said he had found no evidence to support the claim. Wilson's column was an early attack on the evidence used by the Bush administration to justify going to war in Iraq. The White House wished to discredit Wilson and his attacks. The question for the prosecutor is whether someone in the administration, in an effort to undermine Wilson's credibility, intentionally revealed the covert identity of his wife.\n \n In a brief conversation with Rove, Cooper asked what to make of the flap over Wilson's criticisms. NEWSWEEK obtained a copy of the e-mail that Cooper sent his bureau chief after speaking to Rove. (The e-mail was authenticated by a source intimately familiar with Time's editorial handling of the Wilson story, but who has asked not to be identified because of the magazine's corporate decision not to disclose its contents.) Cooper wrote that Rove offered him a \"big warning\" not to \"get too far out on Wilson.\" Rove told Cooper that Wilson's trip had not been authorized by \"DCIA\"-CIA Director George Tenet-or Vice President Dick Cheney. Rather, \"it was, KR said, wilson's wife, who apparently works at the agency on wmd [weapons of mass destruction] issues who authorized the trip.\" Wilson's wife is Plame, then an undercover agent working as an analyst in the CIA's Directorate of Operations counterproliferation division. (Cooper later included the essence of what Rove told him in an online story.) The e-mail characterizing the conversation continues: \"not only the genesis of the trip is flawed an[d] suspect but so is the report. he [Rove] implied strongly there's still plenty to implicate iraqi interest in acquiring uranium fro[m] Niger ... \"\n\n \n What the #$%&! How is Karl Rove's head not on a platter? Now they're going through all sorts of verbal gymnastics to try to get out of it. This is just like the stuff with Clinton, except this administration is lying about something that's actually important.\n Excuse me there, I forgot that no rules apply to the Bush administration.",

If it turns out that he did, he should be tried for treason. If it turns out that he had no idea that she was an agent, he should (IMO) not get into trouble for this. Whether he actually used her name or not is irrelevant. \n \n My personal guess would be that he knew Wilsons wif was an agent, but probably didn't know her name. The fact his wife is a CIA agent would have been in wilsons background file, though there is a good chance her name would have been omitted unless specifically requested. The first thing Rove would have done in something like this is request Wilsons file.",

   "Wow, you're good at substantive arguments and confronting the facts, as opposed to the usual liberal tactic of ad hominem attacks.\n \n I bow before your amazing debate skills.\n \n Oh, just an aside...Wilson lied about why he went there and the quality of the information he received. Check out the Senate report on intelligence. Rove's email warned a reporter that Wilson's story wasn't exactly true (Cheney didn't send Wilson to Nigeria, his wife was instrumental in getting him the assignment).\n \n But please, don't let me distract you from your reasoning with something so trivial as the facts.\n\n Have you been hanging out with VoR lately? You seem to be parrotting his usual rhetoric of calling anybody who doesn't agree with him a liberal.\n \n As for the Senate Report, I've read it (or at least the parts that weren't blacked out) and it appears that Wilson indeed lied about the subject of knowing that the CIA documents were forged.\n Nevertheless, all the evidence shows that Iraq did not buy uranium from Niger, nor was there credible evidence that they wanted to apart from people 'thinking' or 'believing' that Iraq wanted to. How on Earth did GW Bush get from intelligence reports that say 'no uranium from Niger to Iraq' to 'credible evidence that Iraq wants to acquire uranium from Niger'?\n \n I still say that Wilson got punished for speaking out and contradicting statements by the President, statements which were the basis for the war in Iraq.",
