   "Speaking of dishonesty, evolutionists should worry about themselves. You point out an example where christians question a mans personal faith, and I point out a fraud which was perpetrated against millions of students over multiple generations, even though Haeckel was proven wrong way back in 1830 \n \n \"Another Evolution Fraud Exposed\"\n \n Biblically-based scientists have always known that the theory of evolution is fraught with false evidence. Whether in the form of deliberate hoaxes or misinterpretations of the facts based on pre-conceived biases, practically every \"proof\" of evolution supplied by Darwin's supporters has turned out to be false. A notable example of this was provided by German scientist Ernst Haeckel, Darwin's staunchest supporter in nineteenth-century Europe. Like most proponents of evolution, Haeckel was less than honest and accurate in his scholarship. Stephen J. Gould, professor of biology, geology, and the history of science at Harvard and the world's leading supporter of the evolution myth, admitted in an article in the March, 2000 issue of Natural History:\n  Haeckel's forceful, eminently comprehensible, IF NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE, books appeared in all major languages and surely exerted more influence than the works of any other scientist, including Darwin...in convincing people throughout the world about the validity of evolution (p. 42, emphasis added).\n To \"prove\" the greater myth of evolution, Haeckel invented the lesser myth known as \"ontology recapitulates phylogeny.\" In a nutshell, he claimed that evolution was proved by the fact that, from its conception to its birth (or hatching), every animal passes through an evolutionary \"climb\" identical to the worldwide process of evolution from one-celled animals to advanced life-forms over eons of time. In other words, every animal embryo \"evolves\" from a microscopic mass of cells to a fish, then to an amphibian, then to a reptile, and so on. To prove his claim, Haeckel created numerous drawings of embryonic fish, salamanders, tortoises, chickens, pigs, dogs, and humans, all placed side by side. His drawings showed each species starting its fetal existence looking exactly like all the others, and then undergoing an individual evolutionary ascent identical to that which Darwin had proposed for the entire animal kingdom.\n The problem with Haeckel's \"proof\" of evolution was that his drawings were a hoax. Even Dr. Gould admitted that\n Haeckel had exaggerated the similarities [between embryos of different species] by idealizations and omissions. He also, in some cases - in a procedure that can only be called fraudulent - simply copied the same figure over and over again....Haeckel's drawings never fooled expert embryologists, who recognized his fudgings right from the start (p. 44).\n Most of the scientific establishment, eager to reject the Book of Genesis and embrace Darwin's myth, uncritically accepted Haeckel's artwork. Of the very few who knew them to be fraudulent, the most vocal figure was one of the greatest Creation scientists of all time, Louis Agassiz. A professor of zoology at Harvard and the first scientist to discover that the Earth had once been under a \"Great Ice Age,\" Agassiz had vigorously opposed the introduction of evolutionary teaching at Harvard. The Swiss-born scientist made no bones about Haeckel's pro-evolution dishonesty. When he examined the book in which Haeckel's bogus drawings first appeared, Agassiz wrote in the margins that the drawings were \"artistically crafted similarities mixed with inaccuracies,\" and that \"these figures were not drawn from nature, but rather copied one from the other!\" He then wrote the word \"Atrocious\" (p. 48). In the fight that erupted between the two scientists, Gould admitted that\n Agassiz generally sticks to the high road, despite ample provocation, by marshaling the facts of his greatest disciplinary expertise (in geology, paleontology, and zoology) to refute Haeckel's frequent exaggerations and rhetorical inconsistencies. Agassiz may have been exhausted and discouraged, but he could still put up one whale of a fight, even if only in private (pp. 47-48).\n Despite the fact that Haeckel's embryo drawings have long since been exposed as fraudulent, the profoundly dishonest pro-evolution movement is, astonishingly, STILL presenting his artwork as \"proof\" of Darwin's theory. Ironically, no one has been more vigorous in exposing this travesty than Dr. Gould, the world's staunchest proponent of Darwin's great myth. He wrote:\n Haeckel's drawings, despite their noted inaccuracies, entered into the most impenetrable and permanent of all quasi-scientific literatures: standard student textbooks of biology (p. 44)....Once ensconced in textbooks, misinformation becomes cocooned and effectively permanent, because...textbooks copy from previous texts (p. 45).\n Prof. Gould then made this absolutely startling admission:...[W]e do, I think, have the right to be both astonished and ashamed by the century of mindless recycling that has led to the persistence of these drawings in a large number, IF NOT A MAJORITY, of modern textbooks! (p. 45, emphasis added)Stephen Caesar's Articles\n \n Here's a 2002 example. Evolution News & Views: The Textbooks Don?t Lie: Haeckel?s Faked Drawings Have Been Used to Promote Evolution: Raven & Johnson (2002) (Part 2)\n \n And here are examples of the lies Darwin, the father of evolution told in order to get his so called theory to be accepted.

   "Another lie commonly perpetuated by Creationist cranks is the fable of the Haeckel hoax. They allege that Haeckel's theory that ontology recapitulates phylogeny was promoted even in modern biology text books by inclusion of Haeckel's iconic, but wrong, diagram of embryological development. Thus they accuse biologists of deliberate fraud. They accuse them of doing what they do so often themselves.\n \n One of the Creationist icons is Jonathan Wells, who devotes a chapter of his mendacious book, Icons of Evolution, to the longevity of Haeckel diagram. Are his claims accurate?\n \n Not very. Here's what TalkOrigins has to say about what little is true about Wells's claims:\n \n \nIn the case of Haeckel, though, I have to begin by admitting that Wells has got the core of the story right. Haeckel was wrong. His theory was invalid, some of his drawings were faked, and he willfully over-interpreted the data to prop up a false thesis. Furthermore, he was influential, both in the sciences and the popular press; his theory still gets echoed in the latter today. Wells is also correct in criticizing textbook authors for perpetuating Haeckel's infamous diagram without commenting on its inaccuracies or the way it was misused to support a falsified theory.\n \n \n This quote is from: Wells and Haeckel's Embryos\n \n The rest of this extensive commentary explains what is wrong with Wells's claims. The author concludes:\n \n \nJonathan Wells would like to discredit evolution, and in Haeckel's embryos, he has found a story to his liking. There is a bit of intentional fakery to it, there is a clear affiliation with Darwin himself, and there is a long history of recognition of Haeckel's influence intermingled with unambiguous repudiation of his ideas. All he has to do is try to entangle Haeckel's discredited theories and poor modern reputation with the set of valid observations and modern explanations, and he can bury the truth under innuendo and association. However, we just have to remember three things:\n [*]Evolutionary theory is not founded on Haeckel's observations or theories. Haeckel's work was discredited in the 19 th century, and has not been relevant to biology since the rediscovery of Mendel's laws of genetics. That the biogenetic law is false has been the consensus of biologists for over 100 years, and developmental biologists have been working constructively to provide alternative explanations, which have so far all been evolutionary in nature.\n [*]The similarities between vertebrate embryos are real. We must distinguish between observations of those similarities and hypotheses about their causes. The similarities are not in doubt; there are worthwhile studies of the degree and timing of the similarities, but none that question their overall existence. What Wells has described is one hypothesis about the cause, Haeckel's biogenetic law, which failed early and spectacularly. He has not addressed any modern hypotheses, nor has he provided a better alternative.\n [*]Evidence for common descent lies in the unity of form and process. We do not use Haeckel's outmoded, invalid mechanism to argue for evolution. Instead, we look at the marvelous convergence of disparate organisms on common principles: all animals use the same genes to define regions of their bodies, all vertebrates build their faces by unlikely rearrangements of odd pharyngeal protrusions, and even tailless mammals like us have to start with tailed embryos. The best explanation for these phenomena is that they are a consequence of a common heritage.\n\n \n One can fault some biology text books for not clearly explaining the context of Haeckel's diagram. It was neither accurate nor entirely objective. It was misleading. However, one cannot fault them for perpetuating Haeckel's theories themselves. They don't. They present current data in support of evolution, data that no Creationist dare read for fear of losing their immortal souls. That doesn't depend on Haeckel.\n \n So as ever, the Creationist motto: Per Ardua Ad Ignoratia. Forever.",

I can provide you with the link.\n\n \n No thanks, I believe you! ;) Creationists do not believe in reason, therefore they cannot see a circular argument for the logical vacuity it represents. Creationists believe in belief. They are strictly faith-based, not reason-based.\n \n The irony is that they have seen the sheer, raw power of science. They have science envy. So even though Creationists are not intellectually capable of the skepticism needed to do science well, they love to clothe their ruminations in the trappings of science, because they imagine that this gives their flatulence an odor of authority rather than rancid decay. For them, the bible has become a science text, and reality has to faithfully reflect whatever it is they read into the bible.\n \n Their attempts to pretend to do science are pathetic and amusing. The work of Jonathan Wells, a Moonie with a science degree, is exemplary of this genre. Peppered with seemingly scientific jargon and replete with references -- after all, do not scientific works contain references? Therefore, if a work has references, it must be scientific! -- it's actually a total snow job designed to gull the religiously credulous into thinking their faith-based beliefs are actually reasoned. All without any of the hard work of real reasoning.\n \n After all, even Creationists realise, dimly in the back of their minds, that reason produces results. So they want to seem reasonable, they want to appear to base their beliefs on objective reality, and so they miss the point of religious faith entirely. They mistake mythos for logos, and remain in terminal confusion. Faith isn't supposed to be about what you can prove -- it never has been.

Just because he made the drawings up himself doesn't mean he got the idea wrong.\n\n \n Welcome little child, the perpetrator of the constant fallacy.\n \n Feel free to quote me saying that every text book reflects this info little child. Only you could provide one example that doesn't use his fraudulent images as evidence for evolution and then claim that you have refuted the meat of the argument that it is still happening even though the Haeckel fraud was soundly refuted in the early 19th century. Don't you get it that that's the point being made?\n \n Let me simplify this for you in layman terms for you. In a nutshell, he claimed that evolution was proved by the fact that, from its conception to its birth (or hatching), every animal passes through an evolutionary \"climb\" identical to the worldwide process of evolution from one-celled animals to advanced life-forms over eons of time. In other words, every animal embryo \"evolves\" from a microscopic mass of cells to a fish, then to an amphibian, then to a reptile, and so on. \n \n To prove his claim, Haeckel created numerous drawings of embryonic fish, salamanders, tortoises, chickens, pigs, dogs, and humans, all placed side by side. His drawings showed each species starting its fetal existence looking exactly like all the others, and then undergoing an individual evolutionary ascent identical to that which Darwin had proposed for the entire animal kingdom. The problem with Haeckel&#8217;s \"proof\" of evolution was that his drawings were a hoax. Most of the scientific establishment, eager to reject the Book of Genesis and embrace Darwin&#8217;s myth, uncritically accepted Haeckel&#8217;s artwork. \n \n Of the very few who knew them to be fraudulent, the most vocal figure was one of the greatest Creation scientists of all time, Louis Agassiz. A professor of zoology at Harvard and the first scientist to discover that the Earth had once been under a \"Great Ice Age,\" Agassiz had vigorously opposed the introduction of evolutionary teaching at Harvard. The Swiss-born scientist made no bones about Haeckel&#8217;s pro-evolution dishonesty. When he examined the book in which Haeckel&#8217;s bogus drawings first appeared, Agassiz wrote in the margins that the drawings were \"artistically crafted similarities mixed with inaccuracies,\" and that \"these figures were not drawn from nature, but rather copied one from the other!\" He then wrote the word \"Atrocious\". \n \n In the fight that erupted between the two scientists, Gould admitted that\n Agassiz generally sticks to the high road, despite ample provocation, by marshaling the facts of his greatest disciplinary expertise (in geology, paleontology, and zoology) to refute Haeckel&#8217;s frequent exaggerations and rhetorical inconsistencies. Agassiz may have been exhausted and discouraged, but he could still put up one whale of a fight, even if only in private.\n \n AND HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE.\n \n Despite the fact that Haeckel&#8217;s embryo drawings have long since been exposed as fraudulent, the profoundly dishonest pro-evolution movement is, astonishingly, STILL presenting his artwork as \"proof\" of Darwin&#8217;s theory. Ironically, no one has been more vigorous in exposing this travesty than Dr. Gould, the world&#8217;s staunchest proponent of Darwin&#8217;s great myth. He wrote:\n Haeckel&#8217;s drawings, despite their noted inaccuracies, entered into the most impenetrable and permanent of all quasi-scientific literatures: standard student textbooks of biology &#8230;.Once ensconced in textbooks, misinformation becomes cocooned and effectively permanent, because&#8230;textbooks copy from previous texts.",

   "Rationally, that would be correct. However, creationists have an inherently capacity to ignore all reason, facts and logic. For instance, creationists drink water out of the tap. That tap water generally comes from local aquifers. Those aquifers are managed by hydrodynamics. Hydrodynamics works on a very long period of time, millions of years. That inherently conflicts with literal creationism. How can you drink water from a tap from a source that is run by a system that doesn't fit into your belief time frame? That's illogical. But they still do it.\n \n Creationists in the US get some of their electricity from nuclear power plants. Nuclear reactors are done through the principles of radioactivity. That works on an extremely long period of time, billions of years. How can those years exist to a 6,000 year old belief? Doesn't make sense. They still use it. \n \n Creationists eat meat and plants that have been specifically bred from an understanding of evolutionary breeding. Without such understanding, we wouldn't have those specific breeds. Yet they still eat them despite the organisms being long ago created from the principle they consider false.\n \n Literal creationists are essentially living a giant lie as their every day matters conflict with their belief in an old Earth.\n\n \n Yes, Creationists are irrational.

This whole premise should have been erased from evolutionist consideration as a valid concept all together since it has been shown to be absolutely wrong.\nAdd to that that Haeckel was born in 1834 and didn't make his drawings until 1874. (I can't find the original year in which the drawings (not the theory) were refuted, or even who refuted them in the first place... got any links, Archie?) and the gap shrinks again to an absolute maximum of 127 years... I agree, however, that this is still poor reporting by the science textbooks if all you have told us is true.\n \n However... how true is it? The science textbooks do not promote the same theory as Haeckel did, instead they promote a different theory - that features/structures tend to develop on a foetus in the order that they evolved in. This process of development is an observed fact - and if new observations look similar to Haeckel's faked drawings, then the fact that his hoaxes looked similar to reality is not a reason to stop using some real drawings that happen to look like his fakes.\n \n Finally, I'd say that the whole thing is as much an argument against evolution as Piltdown Man, Nebraska Man, or any of the other fakes that have been dealt with in this thread. Using what is taught to schoolchildren to debunk the original theory is simply not logical - firstly, it ignores the fact that the taught version may well be be oversimplified to the extreme and secondly, if it is completely factually incorrect then that's merely bad teaching, not bad science.",

And this issue isn't about the difference between showing the historical progression of ideas and stating outdated information as fact at all.

Nothing more objective or substantial than its slanted and biased perspective. You're not even smart enough to realize that TO is exactly the problem we are speaking about with the so called science of evolution. Their sole purpose for existing is to debunk any and all criticisms which attempt to hold evolution accountable for their distortions and junk science. Yet you sheeple carry it around like its your bible. And rely on it as if it's absolute truth.\n \n And one more thing, based on this statement, the peer-review system means that anyone, anywhere, can critically analyse and debunk a scientific report if they can provide a valid argument which stands up to criticism. you obviously don't have an actual clue regarding what the peer review system entails. Here is an objective News Article which deals with the problems with the peer review system as it exists today. Here's an excerpt:\n For Science's Gatekeepers, a Credibility Gap\n \n By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.\n Recent disclosures of fraudulent or flawed studies in medical and scientific journals have called into question as never before the merits of their peer-review system.\n \n The system is based on journals inviting independent experts to critique submitted manuscripts. The stated aim is to weed out sloppy and bad research, ensuring the integrity of the what it has published.\n \n Because findings published in peer-reviewed journals affect patient care, public policy and the authors' academic promotions, journal editors contend that new scientific information should be published in a peer-reviewed journal before it is presented to doctors and the public.\n \n That message, however, has created a widespread misimpression that passing peer review is the scientific equivalent of the Good Housekeeping seal of approval.\n \n Virtually every major scientific and medical journal has been humbled recently by publishing findings that are later discredited. The flurry of episodes has led many people to ask why authors, editors and independent expert reviewers all failed to detect the problems before publication.\n \n The publication process is complex. Many factors can allow error, even fraud, to slip through. They include economic pressures for journals to avoid investigating suspected errors; the desire to avoid displeasing the authors and the experts who review manuscripts; and the fear that angry scientists will withhold the manuscripts that are the lifeline of the journals, putting them out of business.By promoting the sanctity of peer review and using it to justify a number of their actions in recent years, journals have added to their enormous power.\n \n The release of news about scientific and medical findings is among the most tightly managed in country. Journals control when the public learns about findings from taxpayer-supported research by setting dates when the research can be published. They also impose severe restrictions on what authors can say publicly, even before they submit a manuscript, and they have penalized authors for infractions by refusing to publish their papers. Exceptions are made for scientific meetings and health emergencies.\n \n But many authors have still withheld information for fear that journals would pull their papers for an infraction. Increasingly, journals and authors' institutions also send out news releases ahead of time about a peer-reviewed discovery so that reports from news organizations coincide with a journal's date of issue.\n \n A barrage of news reports can follow. But often the news release is sent without the full paper, so reports may be based only on the spin created by a journal or an institution.\n \n Journal editors say publicity about corrections and retractions distorts and erodes confidence in science, which is an honorable business. Editors also say they are gatekeepers, not detectives, and that even though peer review is not intended to detect fraud, it catches flawed research and improves the quality of the thousands of published papers.\n \n However, even the system's most ardent supporters acknowledge that peer review does not eliminate mediocre and inferior papers and has never passed the very test for which it is used. Studies have found that journals publish findings based on sloppy statistics. If peer review were a drug, it would never be marketed, say critics, including journal editors.\n \n None of the recent flawed studies have been as humiliating as an article in 1972 in the journal Pediatrics that labeled sudden infant death syndrome a hereditary disorder, when, in the case examined, the real cause was murder.\n \n Twenty-three years later, the mother was convicted of smothering her five children. Scientific na\u00efvet\u00e9 surely contributed to the false conclusion, but a forensic pathologist was not one of the reviewers. The faulty research in part prompted the National Institutes of Health to spend millions of dollars on a wrong line of research.\n \n Fraud, flawed articles and corrections have haunted general interest news organizations. But such problems are far more embarrassing for scientific journals because of their claims for the superiority of their system of editing.\n \n A widespread belief among nonscientists is that journal editors and their reviewers check authors' research firsthand and even repeat the research. In fact, journal editors do not routinely examine authors' scientific notebooks. Instead, they rely on peer reviewers' criticisms, which are based on the information submitted by the authors.\n \n While editors and reviewers may ask authors for more information, journals and their invited experts examine raw data only under the most unusual circumstances.\n \n In that respect, journal editors are like newspaper editors, who check the content of reporters' copy for facts and internal inconsistencies but generally not their notes. Still, journal editors have refused to call peer review what many others say it is &#8212; a form of vetting or technical editing.\n \n In spot checks, many scientists and nonscientists said they believed that editors decided what to publish by counting reviewers' votes. But journal editors say that they are not tally clerks and that decisions to publish are theirs, not the reviewers'.\n \n Editors say they have accepted a number of papers that reviewers have harshly criticized as unworthy of publication and have rejected many that received high plaudits.http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/02/health/02docs.html?ex=1163566800&en=b5874c8dae7cd378&ei=5070",

Here is a partial review of the book;\n \n \n Amazon] Many of Dawkins's metaphors have caused raised eyebrows - one outstanding example is his characterization of living things as \"lumbering robots\" built to protect the genes that hide in them - but the metaphors are always (eventually) brought under control. The title is one such metaphor that has often been misunderstood by superficial analysis. The 'selfish gene' is simply a gene that does not aid others at its own expense. Such genes would be better able to reproduce and spread through the gene pool than those that did sacrifice themselves for others, and therefore completely dominate the gene pools of all species as a result of billions of years of evolutionary pressure.\n \n I cannot hope to adequately summarize Dawkins's arguments in a mere review, so I sincerely urge you to read \"The Selfish Gene\" for yourself. I should warn that conservatives would probably not enjoy the book nearly as much as I did. Dawkins is an open secular humanist with socialist leanings, and is not worried about offending the delicate sensibilities of creationists and fundamentalists. This book should only be read by those willing to 'accept' the validity of natural selection and evolution; others would only waste their time. I would direct readers seeking a more scientific discussion of these issues to G. C.

In the meantime, science has sat on the sidelines and quietly watched this game of words march up and down the field. Despite the fact that science has revolutionised every aspect of human life and greatly clarified our understanding of the world, somehow the notion has arisen that it has nothing to say about the possibility of a supreme being, which much of humanity worships as the source of all reality. Physicist Victor J Stenger contends that, if God exists, some evidence for this existence should be detectable by scientific means, especially considering the central role that God is alleged to play in the operation of the universe and the lives of humans. Treating the traditional God concept, as conventionally presented in the Judeo-Christian and Islamic traditions, like any other scientific hypothesis, Stenger examines all of the claims made for God's existence. He considers the latest Intelligent Design arguments as evidence of God's influence in biology. He looks at human behaviour for evidence of immaterial souls and the possible effects of prayer. He discusses the findings of physics and astronomy in weighing the suggestions that the universe is the work of a creator and that humans are God's special creation. After evaluating all the scientific evidence, Stenger concludes that beyond a reasonable doubt the universe and life appear exactly as we might expect if there were no God. \"",

Selfishness is a metaphor. Genes, of course, have no more feelings such as selfishness than a slice of salami. Dawkins makes no argument that a Darwinian explanation for life means that humans \"ought\" to behave in selfish ways. In fact, a good case can be made that genes \"want\" -- careful here, Creationists, I am using another metaphor -- humans to be cooperative. Dawkins makes it persuasively: humans are made to be cooperative because that increases the chance of their genes' survival into the next generation.\n \n But then, you would have to actually, you know, read the book to have a chance of figuring that out. Perhaps Creationists have problem understanding the notion of metaphor itself, having become far too used used to reading their bible as a literal historical text, rather than an allegorical one.

   "Well, in my personal experience, this is not a widespread or pervasive problem. \n\n \n Seriously Karl, am I to understand that you are saying that your individual personal experience trumps the combined realities which have been outlined in the links posted above which speak to this problem which is inherent with the peer review process? Here's more on the fraud and plagiarism which gets past the peer review process on a regular basis. Below is an example of a shoddy peer review doing damage to a reputable scientists career and standing in the community.\n \"Thank you, but your (bad) review just cost me my job and I'm suing you\"\n \n In 2000 Dr Schulze won a settlement of close to US$15 million after the court agreed that he had indeed been victimized and his reputation severely damaged by a badly conducted peer review of his medical practice by a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) (Rice 2001). Prior to the HMO's peer review Dr Schulze, a general practitioner from Corpus Christi, Texas, held an excellent reputation of untarnished medical practice spanning 35 years that suffered during a period of investigation by his peers that lasted approximately 6 years. The lawyer for the HMO argued that Dr Schulze's victory was a set back that damaged the confidentiality of the peer review process, which is an essential component of the process for maintaining the quality of health care. The fact is, however, that if the peer review process is unfair, if the rights of the individual under review are not protected, if the \"facts\" presented during the review are inaccurate, and the result is a damaged reputation and loss of income then why shouldn't you sue? We are, of course, not recommending that everyone who believes that the review of their grant or manuscript was conducted by an incompetent or vindictive reviewer launch a law suit, but the case of Dr Schulze reveals that the process of peer review is a very serious matter and must be conducted fairly. The onus, of course, lies with the committee chairs and editors to be vigilant and recognise what might be considered unfair or bias in the peer review process, but it is up to all of us, as the reviewers, to make their task easier by being fair and commit the time to what is a very important (but usually underappreciated and unpaid) job. Reviews that either intentionally or simply due to laziness and/or incompetence misrepresent what the authors have stated also reflect scientific fraud or misconduct by the reviewer. In other professions incompetence usually results in penalties. Why not the same for incompetent or fraudulent reviewers? The solution, of course, may well be a few well-aimed lawsuits that will wake up the scientific community from its complacency; What is the future of peer review? Why is there fraud in science? Is plagiarism out of control? Why do scientists do bad things? Is it all a case of:&#x0201c;All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing?&#x0201d;\n \n These examples below illustrate frauds and other problems with the peer review system from every possible angle within the process. They illistrate a broken system and define the serious damage it has done in the scientific community\n \n FROM THE SAME LINK:Having a problem publishing your paper? No worries-just launch your own journal!\n \n Of course, you will need a wealthy backer and, if you accept the views put forward in an article in The Lancet (Garne et al 2005), the tobacco industry may have provided backing and undue influence in establishing the research journal Indoor and Built Environment. Garne et al (2005) report that, since its birth in 1987, Indoor and Built Environment has published a surprisingly large percentage of manuscripts from authors having tobacco industry connections that reflected a favorable view on the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke. Such revelations only add fuel to the fires that are flaring up globally concerning scientific integrity and what really is \"good science\". According to many, good science is that published in journals that have a high impact, but is this true or just another urban legend reflecting unsubstantiated beliefs maintained for self-perpetuation of the scientific elite?Publish or perish or publish and then perish?-The real meaning of JIF\n \n The emergence of thejournal impact factor or JIF has greatly influenced how we evaluate science. The argument in favor of \"impact factors\" was first mentioned some 50 years ago (Garfield 1955) and its history and meaning reviewed recently (Garfield 1999, 2006). Thus, JIF was originally proposed as a measure for selection and inclusion of a journal in Science Citation Index (Garfield 1999, 2006), but has become extensively used as a means of defining the impact of a scientist's research and, indeed, an individual's career and the Institute of Scientific Information's (ISI) Journal Impact Factor has served as the cornerstone for categorizing journals for approaching 50 years. The number of citations for an article in a given year, the numerator, and the denominator determines the JIF, which is the number of articles/reviews published in the samejournal during the past two years. Most evaluators misunderstand the true meaning of JIF and incorrectly assume/infer that a publication in a journal with a high JIF must have a high impact. This is far from the truth as we will indicate. This confusion is, perhaps, not surprising as, according to the science fiction novel, Hitchhikers Guide to The Universe, by Douglas Adams, the second greatest computer of all time, \"Deep Thought\" took 7.5 million years to determine that 42 was the ultimate answer, but what was the ultimate question? Similarly, to provide a numerical value to the 'impact' of a scientist's publications is of questionable significance. What does it really mean when a reviewer states: \"Dr X publishes in high impact journals?\" Does this really imply that Dr X's publications also have a high impact? Careers for scientists are made or lost based on an individual's track record-publish frequently and in high impact journals or suffer the consequences. Is this fair? The argument in favor of such a draconian approach to career selection and progression is, of course, Darwinian. During the past 40 years there has been an increasing attention paid to where your paper is published and, of course, we all believe, or, at least, hope that our data are worthy of a paper in high impact (JIF) journals such as Nature or Science. The benefit to the authors of publishing in a high profilejournal is the anticipation that their article will have greater visibility and, therefore, more likely to be cited. Such benefit also contributes to the pressure to obtain results and to publish, a pressure that is not necessarily always beneficial to science or to the scientist.Fraud in science and the case of the repeat offender\n \n The difficulty with allegations of scientific fraud is the need to determine with complete certainty that malicious intent and not interpretation error, or simply bad laboratory practice, was the cause. Fraud in science, at least where it has been discovered, has often been explained as reflecting the misdirected activities of an individual suffering from excessive stress-perhaps a post-doctoral fellow who is anxious to ensure a successful career progression. Furthermore, some well-known instances of fraud are often referred to as hoaxes thus suggesting that the intention behind the offence was simply that of an innocent prank. A famous case is the Piltdown forgery-in 1913 a skull was discovered at the Piltdown archaeological site in England that seemingly had similarities to a human cranium and an ape's jaw thus fitting the expectation of the day that brain size increased first in the evolution from ape to modern man and was the driving force for this change. Additionally, the discovery probably fitted also into the political-social climate of the time-given the then still significant power and influence of the British Empire: what more natural that this \"dawn man\" should be British? However, in 1953 the find was exposed as a \"hoax\" and the skull revealed to be made up from the cranium case of a modern man and the jaw of an Orang Utan. Speculation, however, still remains as to whom was responsible although it has been argued that the perpetrator was Martin Hinton, the curator of Zoology at the London Natural History Museum (Gee 1996). Possibly the Piltdown hoax was originally fabricated as a joke, but the truth took 40 years to emerge and confused both the literature on the evolution of hominids as well as many physical anthropologists (Walsh 1996). Another notable and more recent case is that of Dr William Summerlin who, in the early 1970s, was a scientist working on organ transplants at the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research. Dr Summerlin was discovered to have used a black felt-tip pen to enhance evidence for the success of grafts of black skin grafts from black onto white mice. Investigations revealed that earlier data concerning the success of human cornea transplants into rabbits was also suspect. Using a black felt-tip pen to falsify data would be considered rather amateurish today given the potential for the use of computer-assisted manipulation. Unfortunately there are many other cases of scientific fraud indicating that the problem is more common than should be expected (see Lock et al 2004). However, it must be admitted that it is, in most cases, impossible for the journal to detect scientific fraud.\n \n Scientific fraud is now beginning to be seen as no different from any other criminal and often perpetrated by a repeat offender. A US-based survey suggests that the incidence of falsification, fabrication and plagiarism is higher than one would have hoped with approximately 33% of the participants admitting to one or more of the top 10 (mis) behaviours (Martinson et al 2005). So where should behaviour modification begin? Presumably such modification should start at the top with national governments and academic institutions establishing policies that are both followed and enforced.\n \n Indeed, fraud in science, whether initially intended as hoaxes or planned with career and profit-making intentions, not only ruins the careers of the perpetrator, but also, potentially, their innocent colleagues, as well as tarnishing the reputation of the institution where the work was performed and reducing the confidence of the public in the value of scientific research. Fraud in health research may also have direct or indirect negative effects on health care and peoples lives; fraud in other areas of science may, of course, affect the economy and the lives of people. It can been argued that one approach to dealing with scientific fraud is to proceed through civil courts as, likely, misuse of grant funds is also involved (see Smith 2005).\n \n Several recent instances of alleged fraud in nutrition research-Drs Ram B Singh of India and RK Chandra from Canada (see White 2005; Smith 2005, respectively), in cancer research with Dr Jon Sudb\u00f8 of Norway, and, in the area of stem cell research, Dr Woo Suk Hwang of South Korea have been reported. Interestingly, all of these scientists achieved almost hero status in their own countries: achieving such status may be a significant motivation for scientific fraud.\n \n An analogy is the athlete who receives the gold medal at the Olympics but then has it stripped from them (and their country) as the result of a drug-tainted urine sample. In the case of Dr Hwang the rise and fall were both dramatic and fast with his landmark paper on stem cells from a cloned human blastocyst (embryo) first published in Science in March 2004, a second paper in Science in June 2005 and both withdrawn in an editorial retraction in January, 2006 (Hwang et al 2004, 2005; Kennedy 2006). The only good news in this the Hwang case is that his Afghan cloned puppy, \"Snuppy\", was, apparently, real (Lee et al 2005; Lee and Park 2006). The negative fall-out for stem cell research internationally has affected not only Dr Hwang's US-Based collaborators but, by creating public and scientific anger and dismay, will likely significantly slow progress in this entire field. The impact of the other allegations noted above in terms of nutrition and human health are, potentially, no less severe. The reaction of the Norwegian government to the fraudulent study by Dr Sudb\u00f8 (Morris 2006) has been strong, and may lead to the government passing legislation that will make medical fraud a criminal offence that probably should be extended to all areas of science.",

Do you even know what peer review means in a scientific context?\n\n \n The question pandion and lesz, is do either of you know what peer review means! In the first example, why did the MD win the 15 million dollar lawsuit, if his claim was bogus? Here is the poignant quote from that example. Note the bolded:In 2000 Dr Schulze won a settlement of close to US$15 million after the court agreed that he had indeed been victimized and his reputation severely damaged by a badly conducted peer review of his medical practice by a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) (Rice 2001). Prior to the HMO&#8217;s peer review Dr Schulze, a general practitioner from Corpus Christi, Texas, held an excellent reputation of untarnished medical practice spanning 35 years that suffered during a period of investigation by his peers that lasted approximately 6 years.\n Why is your understanding so limited that you don't understand that there are various types of PEER REVIEWS that take place? Also, I compiled these examples from the same qualified link which it titled: What is the future of peer review? Why is there fraud in science? Is plagiarism out of control? Why do scientists do bad things? Is it all a case of:&#8220;All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing?&#8221;\n \n As for the second example, it is a perfect example of how wealthy partisans bypass the legitimate PEER REVIEW process by starting their own journal and maintaining control over the peer review process in order to control the outcome of studies, thereby guaranteeing positive outcomes. It is a classic loop hole around legitimate critiques and therefore worth considering as a true flaw in the peer review system. Also, it too is from the same link as the title above. And it begs the question as to why it's so important to you to define the term \"peer review\" so narrowly that you will criticize me for posting a link which considers a complete picture of the problems it faces as a system of checks and balances?\n \n \nHis third article actually mentions Piltdown Man. It doesn't even make an attempt to link it to scientific peer review. \n \n \n Are you actually suggesting that the Piltdown Man discovery didn't go through a type of peer review back in 1913 pandion? Is that your claim? Wasn't Dr. Arthur Smith Woodward of the Natural History Museum Dawsons scientific mentor and a world renowned expert on fossil fishes, writing his Catalogue of the Fossil Fishes in the British Museum (1889-1901). His contribution to paleoichthyology resulted in him receiving many awards, including a Royal Medal from the Royal Society, the Lyell and Wollaston Medals of the Geological Society, and the Linnean Medal of the Linnean Society. He retired from the museum in 1924. \n \n Do you think Piltdown Man would have received world wide press had it been from some questionable or insignificant source? But you know all this, yet you accuse me of attempting to slip something past you. Talk about being dishonest and ignoring reality as you again attempt to narrowly define what that fraud represent in the larger picture of seeking and protecting the concept of scientific accuracy. \n \n You just can't help but try to make this about me as you avoid admitting that the peer review process is seriously broken. Try opening your mind and realize the legitimacy of criticizing this system, otherwise you have no hope of ever fixing it. You just prove how thin skinned your whole science is by attacking the messenger rather than considering the valid evidence being shown to you. Here, from the NATURE JOURNAL is another article which is attempting to objectively define the problem rather than bury it as you have attempted to do. Peer review and fraud : Article : Nature And below is an excerpt from another Journal article which defines the depth and seriousness of this issue which you will no doubt find some reason to blame me for attempting to slip something past you.

   "The question pandion and lesz, is do either of you know what peer review means!\n\n \n Yes, archie, unlike you, I do know what is involved, because it was one of my jobs as a working scientist, therefore I know how it's done. You get sent a paper by an editor of a scientific journal, you read it, evaluate its strengths and weakness, then write a report back summarising how significant it is, whether the evidence supports its conclusion, and whether you think it worth publishing in the journal in question. Papers are usually, not always, submitted to at least two reviewers. The editor then makes up his or her own mind whether the reviews are fair and whether to follow them or not. Often, if the two reviewers are poles apart in their assessment, the paper gets sent out to a third.\n \n \nWhy is your understanding so limited that you don't understand that there are various types of PEER REVIEWS that take place? Also, I compiled these examples from the same qualified link which it titled: What is the future of peer review? Why is there fraud in science? Is plagiarism out of control? Why do scientists do bad things? Is it all a case of:&#8220;All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing?&#8221;\n\n \n Scientists are busy people, and the more successful they are, the more prominent, the more likely they are to be asked to review papers. Sometimes, probably increasingly often, they will do a less than thorough job. It may be that the peer review process needs to be tightened up, and budgets allotted for scientists who are willing to take on this task, which is arguably a little less interesting and prominent than actually doing science. I'm not sure the few problems that exist make that necessary, however.\n \n As for why does fraud occasionally take place in science? Well, scientists are human, and often under pressure to report results that will allow them to renew their grants. So a few may cut corners, very, very occasionally, so occasionally it makes national headlines, one or two just make things up. Bad scientist, bad scientist! Slap! No more grants for you!\n \n However, in my not inconsiderable experience in biology, this is very rare. You conveniently forget two points in your spluttering outrage:\n \n (1) Most science is honestly done and honestly reported. Why? because...\n \n (2) Science is a very competitive enterprise, and scientists are constantly checking each other's results. Consequently, if a scientist reports erroneous results (which you mistakenly equate to fraud), or worse, deliberately publishes false results (which is actual fraud), then he or she will sooner or later be found out.\n \n If the scientist is publishing in a hot and competitive field, that will be sooner rather than later, even if the initial paper does get through peer review. So science has a back-up system that catches wayward horses after they have bolted the barn and brings them back. Peer review pre-publication is just the first line of defense against bad science; it is not the only one. Think about it, archie... if the system didn't work, then frauds wouldn't be discovered, you wouldn't know about them, and you wouldn't be able to get all het up about it. It is because the nature of science collectively is self-correcting that the system works so well.\n \n Contrast that to the religious enterprise where fraud is a way of life. Every day, hundreds of televangelists lie to their flocks on tv and radio. Every week, millions of sheep are fleeced in churches. You don't complain about that, though, do you. A tiny minority of scientists engage in, then get caught at, fraud, and you quiver in self-righteous outrage. When clergymen do it as a way of living, you honor them for it. emoticon_rolleyes Let's try to keep things in proportion, shall we?",

And these aren't pro-creationist sites in any way at all but are from within the scientific community itself. For example, \"NATURE\" Has this to say regarding the \"Peer Review\" process, and is experimenting with opening the system up before publishing, rather than continuing to embrace the current closed system. They admit this: \n \n Given the fact that cases of fraud demonstrably make it through refereeing processes, and given the importance of public trust in science, it proposes that journals apply additional scrutiny and risk assessment to papers that are likely to have a significant public impact, such as those with direct implications for policy, public health or climate change. The additional scrutiny recommended by the panel includes greater attention to raw data and a clarification of the contributions of each co-author. http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7122/full/444971b.html\n \n As an example, look at what lesz said above regarding the peer review process as he insists that unlike me, he understands how it works. He say's this, QUOTE:\n \n Yes, archie, unlike you, I do know what is involved, because it was one of my jobs as a working scientist, therefore I know how it's done.

Papers are usually, not always, submitted to at least two reviewers. The editor then makes up his or her own mind whether the reviews are fair and whether to follow them or not. Often, if the two reviewers are poles apart in their assessment, the paper gets sent out to a third.\n \n Tell me Karl, does lesz represent a protected system which has safeguards built into it to prevent fraud and plagiarism? Did he say he repeats experiments in order to assure the claimed outcomes? Did he say he does a search to make sure that what he read wasn't lifted whole cloth from a prior author? NOT AT ALL!!! He takes the paper at face value assuming it is a valid paper which is based on valid science and is honestly produced with original information from the author, thereby affirming why the problem of fraud exists and is so rampant. There is no automatic procedure for first weeding out fraudulent or plagiarized work before even considering its scientific value according to our resident self declared mental giant, lesz.\n \n In his ignorance, lesz thought he was shutting my arguments down as he claims some significant insight into the PEER REVIEW PROCESS when in fact he just confirmed the seriousness of the problem since he mentioned no standard automatic procedure for fact checking whether the paper is even based on valid and real science before determining its value on its own merits. \n \n Here's another example of how the peer review process has been used as a weapon for vindictive purposes in order to destroy careers, and the ongoing battle to prevent and curtail such abuses. http://www.jpands.org/vol11no1/huntoon.pdf\n \n And you know what I find most interesting Karl? That is that not one of you apologists who has attempted to make this about me has posted one respected journal article, scientist or scientific source that praises the PEER REVIEW SYSTEM as reliable and fraud proof just the way it is. In fact none of you have posted any respected scientific experts who defend it at all. Once again, all I get in rebuttal are your personal opinions regarding how uninformed and ignorant I must be as you produce no evidence at all defending what you claim. So I did it for you, and here's what I came up with. See if you can find 5 links which defend the peer review process as perfect just the way it is. \n \n peer review process is accurate and effective method for judging scientific papers - Google Search\n \n So tell me Karl, how my premise is fallacious if even a search for links complimenting this broken process also criticize it and acknowledge its very real flaws? Which of us is really dealing with fallacies here?",

You see lesz, peer review is relatively new to science, and accomplishes little to preserve the integrity of new ideas as it is so susceptible to fraud and other abuses. But Peer usage is different. That is how scientific concepts are replicated and proven or disproved in real time. \n \n My question to you is, why haven't any of you told me that, yet you must be told about it by the so called ignorant christian. Here's what I'm talking about, I tracked down a link which explains it in depth. \n Peer usage versus peer review\n \n Charlton BG. Peer usage versus peer review BMJ 2007; 335: 451 \n \n It is often asserted that peer review is the essence of scientific evaluation, but this is incorrect. Peer review is not specific to science but is employed by all academic subjects from English literature to theology. Neither is it necessary to science. Until a few decades ago-and during the scientific golden age of the mid-20th century-there was very little peer review in the modern sense. So peer review is neither necessary nor sufficient for scientific progress. \n \n The truly definitive scientific evaluation is in fact \"peer usage,\" which entails testing facts and theories not by opinion but in actual practice. This means that, even when published in the best journals, new science should never be regarded as valid until its predictions have been retrospectively validated by use in further relevant research by competent scientific peers. \n \n Peer usage is essential to science because it evaluates how research stands up when used for intervening in the natural world. This is often termed \"replication\"; however, it is not usually repetition but instead a process by which ideas and facts are incorporated into future successful research. As long as later research that is built on earlier research continues to grow and thrive, then that earlier science is provisionally regarded as valid.\n \n But peer usage is a retrospective process, and testing science by usage is slow and expensive. It involves persuading other scientists that it is worth their while to expend energy and resources. Evaluation by peer usage has a timescale of years. Published research must be noticed, read, understood, incorporated; new work must be planned and executed, then published, noticed, read, etc. Peer usage is also incomplete, because more scientific theories and findings are published than can ever be checked in practice. Only a small percentage of published science ever actually gets evaluated by peer usage. \n \n As a result, there has been a major shift away from retrospective peer usage towards the predictive process of peer review. Peer review is faster (taking weeks rather than years) and cheaper (because it asks only for opinions). In effect peer review is prospective filtering by a consensus of informed judgment. \n \n Although peer review is not specifically scientific, in principle it can identify ideas and facts that are probably correct, so long as research is an incremental extrapolation of established knowledge, methods are standard and well established, and investigations are performed by researchers of validated competence. In other words, peer review usually works well for applied science or \"research and development.\" \n \n However, peer opinion becomes markedly less valid when research is more ambitious and radical. Many or most major scientific advances were initially rejected by peer review. This implies that there is a continuing need for other methods of evaluating radical and ambitious science. \n Medical Hypotheses: Peer usage versus peer review",

   "Oy veh. When asked if he's read Dawkins' The Selfish Gene, one of our Creationists responds...\n \n \n \n Well, no, one never expects Creationists to have read scientific texts, not even ones written for the popular market. That way lies thinking, and thought is bad for the soul...\n\n \n It's a characteristic of both sides in the creation/evolution debate to not pay detailed attention to authors with the opposing worldview. \n \n \n \n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nWell, Dawkins did later admit he regretted the choice of title... it might as easily have been entitled The Cooperative Gene. Not that it would have made much difference, as Creationists don't read science texts -- they far prefer condemning a book by its cover rather than risk finding out what's in it. \n\n \n Aaaand have you ever gotten within 20 feet of any of William Dembski's books on intelligent design? Or a Bible? \n \n \nBut no, even if they were to be brave enough read the book, and learned enough to understand it, they would find that Dawkins makes no such foolish argument. Selfishness is a metaphor. Genes, of course, have no more feelings such as selfishness than a slice of salami. Dawkins makes no argument that a Darwinian explanation for life means that humans \"ought\" to behave in selfish ways. In fact, a good case can be made that genes \"want\" -- careful here, Creationists, I am using another metaphor -- humans to be cooperative. Dawkins makes it persuasively: humans are made to be cooperative because that increases the chance of their genes' survival into the next generation. \n\n \n Your review seems to differ from the one at Amazon that I showed in post #58. He said that non-evolutionists would be \"wasting their time\" as Dawkins is not worried about offending their \"delicate sensibilities\", probably with his integration of \"socialist leanings\" in the mix of his cooperative style of science. \n \n \nBut then, you would have to actually, you know, read the book to have a chance of figuring that out. Perhaps Creationists have problem understanding the notion of metaphor itself, having become far too used used to reading their bible as a literal historical text, rather than an allegorical one. The idea that others might use metaphor to explain something a bit difficult to understand at first might not occur to them.\n\n \n Then, from a subsequent post, we have;\n \n \nArchie, dear, whenever someone posts a reasonable rebuttal of your non-arguments, why is it you respond with a flurry of unreadable, unintelligeable spam? \n\n \n Eight paragraphs is \"unreadable\" and \"unintelligeable\" to you, and you can't understand why I don't read an entire book of Dawkins drivel?",

And remember, we can extend this faith you have in unknown beginnings to life on Earth itself, since according to your beliefs that too spontaneously began from non life on a dead planet. Yet you foolishly believe that from that unknown beginning, life not only grew, but opposing organisms worked in unison to expand life rather than fight and destroy each other for survival as we know happens in the real world. \n \n But hey, it's your preferred belief system right? It doesn't matter that it makes no sense in the real world of physics and cosmology, right? At least we creationists can explain our beliefs through supernatural avenues since God is all powerful and able to have spoken creation into existence.

Another is that the big bang was not the beginning, merely one more intermediate state - albeit a very special one.\n \nAccording to my understanding infinity means no beginning and no end. Finite means something has a beginning but no end. \n\n No. Finite means a beginning (possibly unbounded) and an end (also possibly unbounded) The positive integers are infinite, despite having a beginning. The set of integers between 0 and 100 is finite.\n \nSo according to even your definition the universe must be finite assuming you believe it will never end.\n\n Incorrect; see above.\n \nSo what exactly are you defending here?

Perhaps you didn't appreciate the relevance:\n \nThirdly, time and space are dimensions - and interchangeable ones at that, as Einstein proved IIRC. We perceive time in terms of sequential events, but that is only our perception. When you watch a movie, you likewise perceive sequential events - but all the individual frames of the movie are right there, all at once on the reel. Imagine the universe as an infinite reel of film, and by living we're watching one tiny bit of it. Relativity proves there's no such thing as a unique 'now': there's no projector and no screen for our film, just the film itself, with us embedded within it.\n\n When we speak of causality in our universe, we're effectively talking about how adjacent 'frames' of the film relate to one another. But it's not mandatory to apply the same causal rules to the existence of the film itself.\n \n I appreciate that it's not easy to visualise this sort of thing, but I'll try to help.\n \n Imagine a universe with one spacial dimension: a line. As an inhabitant of this universe, all you can do is move back and forth along that line, right?\n \n Now, imagine time in that universe as a second dimension. What is to you one dimensional movement along a line is revealed to be a wiggly trace on a two-dimensional sheet - like the old lie-detector machines or seismometers, with the little scritchy pens? You know what I mean. The pens scribble back and forth (motion in space), the sheet rolls out beneath them (motion in time).\n \n Ok, so, now imagine we're looking at this sheet with your life-trace drawn on it. The sheet has finite extent in both axes. Your 'life' has a beginning and an end, as does the paper. But the whole thing simply exists. There was never a 'time' when it didn't exist, because time is one of the axes on the paper itself. Similarly, you're not 'dead' just because your lifeline is static: you are and will forever be alive at every point along that trace. Expanding that to two and three dimensional space gives us a model of the universe which exists as a static 4D sculpture. And although time has a beginning and an end in this model, just as a statue has feet and a head, as a whole it simply exists.\n \nThat question regarding what caused the big bang originally is the pertinent question and also the question you hate to consider as science has no clue or explanation for that question.\n\n Actually there are a number of theories around at the moment; the most recent I can recall reading about being a collision between two 'branes' wafting around in umpteen-dimensional space :)\n \n I freely admit I really don't know very much at all about what could cause the big bang. At the same time, I don't see the point of inventing some arcane semantic construct to paper over that uncertainty. If god can simply 'exist' with no creator, why can't the static 4D universe simply 'exist' with no creator? What do you gain? Whose rules is the universe breaking by 'just existing'? As you yourself say:\n \nIf I could just get you to admit that believing that the big bang occurred spontaneously goes against all of the laws of physics you otherwise hold to, then you would have to admit how ludicrous this theory is on its face.\n\n But the universe existing isn't against the laws of physics, because the laws of physics apply to relationships between events within the universe.\n \nJust imagine peeling, you are attributing the existence of the universe; all of time and space, and asking us to believe it occurred when there is no remnant of evidence for the catalyst which caused it to take place. I mean, where did this tiny ball of super dense matter come from which miraculously expanded into the universe we now inhabit?\n\n Why did it have to come from somewhere? That's like looking at a statue and saying 'Well, ok, but what's on top of its head? A statue can't just end like that.'\n \nAnd what existing law in physics have we observed which confirms that event? Not in theory mind you, but in reality. The answer is none, because it hasn't happened in reality.\n\n Well, the occurrence of the big bang isn't in doubt - at least so far as I know. A lot of very precise observations indicate that it really did occur, so it's something we simply have to deal with. We can't just pretend it didn't happen because we can't fully explain it yet :)\n \nSo do you see why the very premise upon which your perceived reality is based is unprovable and requires more faith to accept than the concept of an intelligent designer?\n\n No, I really don't :) It doesn't require faith to be honest about what is certain and what remains uncertain, or to reserve judgement. You, on the other hand, have not only chosen to have absolute faith in a creation story that is flatly contradicted by every mote of evidence we can lay our hands on, but also to have faith in a creator deity for whose existence you have absolutely zero evidence or explanation at all. Your version of events has far, far more unknowns than mine, and consequently belief in it requires far, far more faith.\n \nAnd remember, we can extend this faith you have in unknown beginnings to life on Earth itself, since according to your beliefs that too spontaneously began from non life on a dead planet.\n\n As I've explained on numerous occasions, seemingly to no avail, I don't have any firm convictions regarding precisely how life began on Earth because there is insufficient evidence to make a judgement. We certainly know early life was microbial in nature, and evolution proceeded from there, but back beyond that it's not yet possible to say for sure. In what way does this opinion require 'faith'?\n \nYet you foolishly believe that from that unknown beginning, life not only grew, but opposing organisms worked in unison to expand life rather than fight and destroy each other for survival as we know happens in the real world.\n\n Oh, AA... I really don't know how you've managed to argue about this subject for so many years without at least some information rubbing off on you.\n \n There are countless examples of cooperation - symbiosis - in nature, just as there are countless arms-races and competitive struggles. The evolution of these relationships is perfectly straightforward, if you would just take a few moments to think about it.\n \nAt least we creationists can explain our beliefs through supernatural avenues since God is all powerful and able to have spoken creation into existence.\n\n And why, exactly, is that a good thing? So what if you can imagine a god capable of bringing the universe into existence? I can imagine a plate of pasta and meatballs capable of doing the same thing; it's just meaningless nonsense. It doesn't make it true, and it doesn't make it an explanation.\n \n I apologise if I'm coming across as less sympathetic than usual; it's inevitable when you directly question my reasons for thinking as I do. I have no desire whatsoever to make anyone unhappy and I feel reconciling beliefs with reality is, on the whole, less traumatic than trying to batter those beliefs into submission. But when you start saying 'You are so foolish because...' I'm obliged to speak up for myself.\n \nIn the end peeling, you will ultimately learn that God Did Do It.\n\n Perhaps you're right :) I don't presently see any reason to think you are, but nothing can be entirely ruled out. Myself, I don't find the idea of adopting a belief that merely can't be entirely ruled out particularly appealing; sorry.",

I suggest you find out what Infinite actually means before you start making more such errors.\n \n mr.michael\n No I'm not, im assuming infinity is something unstarted and unending. I observe this universe progressing through events in a progressive sequential manner (one event followed by another and another..) To say the universe has an infinite past of events would be like someone or something counting all the negative integers in the number scale and then reaching 0, only to go on and try to finish counting all the positive integers. Impossible, you would never reach 0.\n \n Peeling\n First, the impossibility in your argument is of your own construction: you are trying to make the universe infinitely old while retaining the concept of a 'start', a point from which things began\n \n mr.michael \n Actually, I'm arguing the universe is not infinitely old, but was created by being that is outside of time\n \n Peeling\n This would mean the total elapsed time in the universe would never be greater than X, but nor would you ever be able to pinpoint an exact starting point\n \n mr.michael\n I'm assuming x means infinity, if so than yes. But there has to be a start (i don't know exactly when it was, but I know it has to be) lest we would never experience sequential progression of events, and we could never reach the present event happening now. A theoretical and abstract sense of the infinite is one thing (the idea of the number scale), saying that there are real concrete empiracle and infinite events in the past is quite another. This cannot be turned around on the intelligent designer because the designer is one being (not infinite events) that is infinite in the sense of being outside the bounds of time (this universe is not outside the bounds of time, and needs a beginning).",

   "Actually, I'm arguing the universe is not infinitely old, but was created by being that is outside of time\n\n I know that :) In your argument, however, you were trying to prove it by showing that the universe could not be infinitely old, yes? A proof of the form 'If the universe was infinitely old... -< contradiction', yes?\n \n However, the contradiction was smuggled into the argument by your choice of assumptions: an infinitely old universe AND a beginning from which all subsequent events could be measured. All you've proven is that the universe cannot be infinitely old relative to us AND have had a beginning. You haven't proven which of those two is false. It could equally well be that the universe had no beginning, in which case it is perfectly acceptable for it to be infinitely old.\n \n \n(unbounded yet finite) This would mean the total elapsed time in the universe would never be greater than X, but nor would you ever be able to pinpoint an exact starting point\n \n mr.michael\n I'm assuming x means infinity, if so than yes. \n\n No, X does not mean infinity. X can be any finite number. I think you've missed the point of what 'unbounded' means.\n \n The set of real numbers between 0 and 10 inclusive is bounded: the top number is 10 and the bottom number is 0.\n \n The set of real numbers between 0 and 10 exclusive is unbounded.

   "Peeling, what mm did was trap you into arguing against your own fallacious claims regarding the age of the universe. You are now arguing for an infinite age of the universe when according to the big bang theory which you have defended many times, it took place between 14.5 and 20 billion years ago which means cosmologists believe it had a definite beginning. \n \n According to my understanding infinity means no beginning and no end. Finite means something has a beginning but no end. So according to even your definition the universe must be finite assuming you believe it will never end. But even the science of cosmology belies that belief as it teaches that just as the universe is expanding NOW, it will one day reach its apex and will then snap back and contract into its pre-singularity density of matter thereby reversing the process which originally created what we call the universe.\n \n So what exactly are you defending here? And how can you argue for an infinite universe now when you will be arguing its beginning next week in another debate? Is it always the practice of the evolutionist to oppose any argument the opposition makes, even if what they say agrees with what you claim to believe on tuesdays?\n \n The part of mm's post you should have focussed on was his assertion that Things that begin to exist, don't cause themselves to exist  That question regarding what caused the big bang originally is the pertinent question and also the question you hate to consider as science has no clue or explanation for that question. \n \n If I could just get you to admit that believing that the big bang occurred spontaneously goes against all of the laws of physics you otherwise hold to, then you would have to admit how ludicrous this theory is on its face. Just imagine peeling, you are attributing the existence of the universe; all of time and space, and asking us to believe it occurred when there is no remnant of evidence for the catalyst which caused it to take place. I mean, where did this tiny ball of super dense matter come from which miraculously expanded into the universe we now inhabit? And what existing law in physics have we observed which confirms that event? Not in theory mind you, but in reality. The answer is none, because it hasn't happened in reality.\n \n So do you see why the very premise upon which your perceived reality is based is unprovable and requires more faith to accept than the concept of an intelligent designer? And remember, we can extend this faith you have in unknown beginnings to life on Earth itself, since according to your beliefs that too spontaneously began from non life on a dead planet. Yet you foolishly believe that from that unknown beginning, life not only grew, but opposing organisms worked in unison to expand life rather than fight and destroy each other for survival as we know happens in the real world. \n \n But hey, it's your preferred belief system right? It doesn't matter that it makes no sense in the real world of physics and cosmology, right? At least we creationists can explain our beliefs through supernatural avenues since God is all powerful and able to have spoken creation into existence. As foolish as that belief seems to you, it makes more sense that breaking all of the laws that your beliefs must ignore or destroy in believing as you do. In the end peeling, you will ultimately learn that God Did Do It.\n\n \n \n Uh. No. This current 'time frame', and the expansion happened. There are several theories that cause the singularity to 'disappear' and there is a viewpoint on what happened 'before' the big bang. The Cern accelerator should be able to test those theories once it gets back online in the spring.\n \n Now, even if those specific theories are falsified, that does not mean that the conditions that allowed for the expansion of the universe is not infinite. It just means we do not currently know what happened.\n \n We do not know does not mean 'God did it'. It means we do not know.\n \n Now, I know you are a fervent believer, but to proclaim beliefs in the view of unknown, be obnoxious to those who do not accept your particular version of your beliefs and to be scornful of 'non-believers' is just plain immature.",

Ahead of us, more things happening within the universe.\n \n I suppose an even more apt analogy than film might be a DVD movie. Imagine a DVD being pressed in a machine.

But if I said I'd give you a candy bar after an infinite number of days, then you'd never get the candy bar. Therefore, how could there be an infinite number of events in the past?

   "Hardly :) I was merely pointing out the logical mistakes in his argument.\n \n \n See point two of my post: finite but unbounded is not the same as infinite, and that is one possibility. Another is that the big bang was not the beginning, merely one more intermediate state - albeit a very special one.\n\n \n Finite but unbounded doesn't mean anything to me peeling. It's like using a play on words so you can have it both ways when it suits your cause. Either the universe is infinite or it isn't. If it has a specific beginning then it isn't; PERIOD!\n \n \nNo. Finite means a beginning (possibly unbounded) and an end (also possibly unbounded) The positive integers are infinite, despite having a beginning. The set of integers between 0 and 100 is finite.\n\n \n Again, you'll have to define what you mean by unbounded. This term seems contradictory to me.\n \n \nLike I said, I was pointing out logical errors in a claim that something was impossible, not proposing any particular model.\n\n \n Not really true. Your reasoning is circular in that your speculating that the universe may be finite yet unbounded; what ever that means. That is definitely proposing a particular model.\n \n \nI did address that. Perhaps you didn't appreciate the relevance:\n \n When we speak of causality in our universe, we're effectively talking about how adjacent 'frames' of the film relate to one another. But it's not mandatory to apply the same causal rules to the existence of the film itself.\n \n I appreciate that it's not easy to visualise this sort of thing, but I'll try to help.\n \n Imagine a universe with one spacial dimension: a line. As an inhabitant of this universe, all you can do is move back and forth along that line, right?\n \n Now, imagine time in that universe as a second dimension. What is to you one dimensional movement along a line is revealed to be a wiggly trace on a two-dimensional sheet - like the old lie-detector machines or seismometers, with the little scritchy pens? You know what I mean. The pens scribble back and forth (motion in space), the sheet rolls out beneath them (motion in time).\n \n Ok, so, now imagine we're looking at this sheet with your life-trace drawn on it. The sheet has finite extent in both axes. Your 'life' has a beginning and an end, as does the paper. But the whole thing simply exists. There was never a 'time' when it didn't exist, because time is one of the axes on the paper itself. Similarly, you're not 'dead' just because your lifeline is static: you are and will forever be alive at every point along that trace. Expanding that to two and three dimensional space gives us a model of the universe which exists as a static 4D sculpture. And although time has a beginning and an end in this model, just as a statue has feet and a head, as a whole it simply exists.\n\n \n To start with, note the bolded. The answer is no we can't go back and forth on our time line. All we can do is go forward. Time moves in only one direction from the human perspective. And even from a cosmological perspective also. For example, when we look at distant stars we speak in terms of the fact that by the time that light reaches us, we are seeing what occurred millions of years or longer in the past because that's how long it took that light to reach us. Never do scientists say we are seeing future light since we're looking in another direction, if you get my meaning. \n \n Also I understand the multiple dimensions theory that say's that if we could travel in time we could go to Rome in its heyday and experience it first hand. In other words, it still exists in its place in time even though its removed from us NOW in this day and age. But again, that is irrelevant to the issue of how our universe came into being if the scientific term \"singularity\" which is used by cosmologists still works. The theory your defining is very esoteric. It is an abstract hypothesis which is based in nothing provable or justifiable based on what we currently know.\n \n \nActually there are a number of theories around at the moment; the most recent I can recall reading about being a collision between two 'branes' wafting around in umpteen-dimensional space :)\n \n I freely admit I really don't know very much at all about what could cause the big bang. At the same time, I don't see the point of inventing some arcane semantic construct to paper over that uncertainty. If god can simply 'exist' with no creator, why can't the static 4D universe simply 'exist' with no creator? What do you gain? Whose rules is the universe breaking by 'just existing'? As you yourself say:\n\n \n Because one is an intelligent being of incalculable wisdom while the other is inanimate matter which must be formed or constructed by someone in order to give it meaning. As chaotic as time, space and life on Earth appears to be at first glance, it is absolutely orderly in its overall function. There is a glue that holds it all together which goes way beyond the explanation of science. All they can hope to do is make guesses, and again this is what's happening, that fit with the predicted outcome they are seeking to answer. Even though the hypothetical they are proposing is based on no actual evidence that it's real at all. \n \n In other words, they believe the big bang occurred, which in itself isn't proven. But in order to explain how it happened, which is the hot question to be answered, they come up with the Bane Theory for example, as a rational explanation for it occurring. But nothing in reality supports this hypothesis. It is designed specifically to answer a question which we have no way of practically testing or repeating in a controlled setting.\n \n \nBut the universe existing isn't against the laws of physics, because the laws of physics apply to relationships between events within the universe.\n\n \n I DIDN'T SAY THE UNIVERSE EXISTING GOES AGAINST THE LAWS OF PHYSICS PEELING. Why do you do that? I said this: If I could just get you to admit that believing that the big bang occurred spontaneously goes against all of the laws of physics you otherwise hold to, It's the spontaneous big bang that goes against the laws of physics, not the universe.\n \n \nWhy did it have to come from somewhere? That's like looking at a statue and saying 'Well, ok, but what's on top of its head? A statue can't just end like that.'\n\n \n No peeling, that isn't like it at all. It's like looking at a statue and confidently declaring that it just spontaneously sculpted itself when anyone with a brain knows it was created by an intelligent person with an imagination and the desire to create it. Some things don't just spontaneously appear. And if we've never seen it happen with a simple thing like a statue, how arrogant are we to think it happened with this massive and complex universe? \n \n \nWell, the occurrence of the big bang isn't in doubt - at least so far as I know. A lot of very precise observations indicate that it really did occur, so it's something we simply have to deal with. We can't just pretend it didn't happen because we can't fully explain it yet :)\n\n \n Sure it is in doubt. I doubt it occurred as described by science. I don't doubt the result of the universes creation at some point in the past. But every bit of evidence you have and will produce is still totally theoretical which is why so many alternate theories are out their regarding its beginning, its expansion, the speed of its expansion, it's impending contraction and the various effects on gravity and light as they travel through it. None of it is consistent as we would expect it to be and nothing we believe about cosmology is just cut and dry accepted fact in anyones mind.\n \n \nNo, I really don't :) It doesn't require faith to be honest about what is certain and what remains uncertain, or to reserve judgement. You, on the other hand, have not only chosen to have absolute faith in a creation story that is flatly contradicted by every mote of evidence we can lay our hands on, but also to have faith in a creator deity for whose existence you have absolutely zero evidence or explanation at all. Your version of events has far, far more unknowns than mine, and consequently belief in it requires far, far more faith.\n\n \n Not true at all, on all counts peeling. I have said it before and I'll say it again. We are working from the same exact available info yet we both interpret it differently according to the world view we hold to. My world view allows for the supernatural where as yours only allows for the natural explanation. But none of the available facts work in your favor at all, since with every new theory raised to fill the information gaps, it either conflicts with or contradicts with other theories you rely on. For example Dark Matter is theorized to exist in order to answer specific questions regarding the formation of the universe, yet every cosmologist must admit that their is no solid evidence that dark matter even exists.\n \n \nAs I've explained on numerous occasions, seemingly to no avail, I don't have any firm convictions regarding precisely how life began on Earth because there is insufficient evidence to make a judgement. We certainly know early life was microbial in nature, and evolution proceeded from there, but back beyond that it's not yet possible to say for sure. In what way does this opinion require 'faith'?\n\n \n Note the underlined and bolded peeling. Do you know how frustrating it is when make opposing and contradictory statements in the same paragraph? You simultaneously said \"you have no firm convictions regarding how life began\" and immediately followed it up with but \"we certainly know early life was microbial in nature and evolution proceeded from there.\" It sound like you definitely believe that abiogenesis and evolution occurred, therefore your first statement is not what you truly believe.\n \n And how it requires faith is because you have no solid evidence that any of what evolution, abigenesis or the big bang is absolutely true at all. It takes great faith in the imaginings of men to place your faith in these theories when we live in a world when men can't even do a proper peer review. \n \n \nOh, AA... I really don't know how you've managed to argue about this subject for so many years without at least some information rubbing off on you.\n \n There are countless examples of cooperation - symbiosis - in nature, just as there are countless arms-races and competitive struggles. The evolution of these relationships is perfectly straightforward, if you would just take a few moments to think about it.\n\n \n Sure there are. But they aren't taking place in a violent and inhospitable world which is not in the least bit conducive to harboring or nurturing any life at all. Just as you choose to believe this was some sort of microbial love fest taking place, I choose to believe that any microbes that may have existed in these conditions would have perceived all other microbes as enemies to be consumed or destroyed, and all for the sake of personal survival. And since neither of us was there this alleged billions of years ago, my interpretation of events is as valid as yours is.\n \n \nAnd why, exactly, is that a good thing? So what if you can imagine a god capable of bringing the universe into existence? I can imagine a plate of pasta and meatballs capable of doing the same thing; it's just meaningless nonsense. It doesn't make it true, and it doesn't make it an explanation.\n\n \n Again peeling, your example is childish and nonsensical. Not to mention insulting to our Creator God. God is not a plate of pasta; He is our maker and Father. And as ridiculous as believing He called all that is into existence to you, it is perfectly rational to those of us who have a personal relationship with Him by way of His Holy Spirit indwelling us on a moment by moment basis from the time we accept Jesus as our Savior. We have personal evidence of his deep and abiding love for us, so we can see clearly all that He is capable of. You may be blind to that reality, but it is as clear as the sun in the sky to me.\n \n \nI apologise if I'm coming across as less sympathetic than usual; it's inevitable when you directly question my reasons for thinking as I do. I have no desire whatsoever to make anyone unhappy and I feel reconciling beliefs with reality is, on the whole, less traumatic than trying to batter those beliefs into submission. But when you start saying 'You are so foolish because...' I'm obliged to speak up for myself.\n\n \n I don't think you are foolish peeling. I believe the science you cling to and defend is since it's unprovable and forwarded by men who have no greater vision to discern the unknown than you do.\n \n \nPerhaps you're right :) I don't presently see any reason to think you are, but nothing can be entirely ruled out. Myself, I don't find the idea of adopting a belief that merely can't be entirely ruled out particularly appealing; sorry.\n\n \n That's ok, and I don't claim to understand the process which actually took place when God called the Heavens and the Earth, as the bible puts it, into existence. Who knows, maybe He clapped His hands together and it did cause a big bang event. But what I do know is that it didn't happen naturally or spontaneously. It was consciously and intelligently designed and created for a purpose which God conceived in His mind.",

   "lesz, if your talking about the universe being the entirety of existence, than of course something infinite has to be within the entirety of existence, because going from non-existence to existence without anything causing it, would be an uncaused effect (which is a contradiction in terms). The physical or created universe is that which is finite, and a metaphysical \"something\" has to be the infinite part of the entirety of existence, in order to account for how the finite part came to be. Again, the idea of an infinite past for the universe infers that there had to be an infinite number of actual beings in the past that had to be before we beings could come to be, whereas God is only ONE being. This is where it is fatal to the infinite universe theory and can't be turned over on God, infinitely many beings transpiring through history to the present is contradictory but one being is not.\n\n \n The bit in bold is an assumption, not a deduction. The notion of an infinite universe, or a universe that occupies all of existence in all time and all space, whatever that might be, does not necessitate an originator. In fact, it rather excludes one, because where is there room? This one universe occupying all of time and space is only one entity, so why postulate a separate one? This universe had no beginning, even though our own existence did. It just goes on forever, infinite in its existence.\n \n You assume the universe is finite... why? Because we can only see a bit of it? You cannot see over the horizon, so do you think the world is bounded by your vision?\n \n In fact, the planet is a good example of an unbounded yet finite surface. You could fly over it forever without ever reaching its beginning or end... till you ran out of fuel. Your ability to move around the earth is infinite, fuel restrictions aside... yet it has a limited volume and surface area. There are many such examples of where finiteness meets infinity. \n \n These are only analogies, and the earth is a poor analogy for the universe as a whole. However, they do undermine the dualistic notion of creator and created. Why plump for this dualism? No logic necessitates it. The universe could very well be entire of itself, with nothing outside of itself, if it comprises all of existence. And if there is nothing outside the universe, how could it possibly have a creator? Again, where is there room?\n \n Would you argue that the creator is hiding in higher dimensions? Well, then how many dimensions would it take to hide the creator's creator? There is no easy way out there.\n \n There simply is no logical proof of god. All attempts at that have failed.",

Let's suppose we feel that a universe needs a creator. Then we reach the conclusion that the universe plus the creator is all that there is.\n \n But here's the crunch... why stop there? The universe plus the creator is now all that there is, but we already argued that all that there is isn't enough, we need more to explain all that there is! So now we postulate a universe with a creator, plus a supercreator...\n \n And off we zoom into the infinities again!\n \n These sorts of arguments are pointless.

(BTW Arch I do respect you; you've been remarkably consistent in your postings here and even though I think your view of science is irretrievably twisted, I do think you are honest and sincere, if misguided:))\n \n \nFinite but unbounded doesn't mean anything to me peeling. It's like using a play on words so you can have it both ways when it suits your cause. Either the universe is infinite or it isn't. If it has a specific beginning then it isn't; PERIOD!\n\n \n Finite but unbounded: this describes a sphere. Its surface area is finite, but you can travel around it again and again and never repeat your journey. the same goes for theories of the 3D (or 4D) universe (where the surface of a sphere is 2D); you can travel forever in a finite but unbounded universe, but you curve back on yourself just like on a sphere.\n \n In other words, according to (extremely well verified) theory (see general relativity) if you went off in a \"straight\" line (if you understand GR you'll know why 'straight' is in quotations) at some horrendous speed you would eventually come back upon your original path; if you could see or travel infinitely you would see or hit the back of your own head. \n \n I know that's hard to grasp; I've been there! But when you really get to grips with GR and see what Einstein was saying, a finite & unbounded universe seems almost inevitable.\n \n \n \n \nAgain, you'll have to define what you mean by unbounded. This term seems contradictory to me.\n\n \n Unbounded means you can return onto your original path; a great analogy is going off the edge of a computer screen in a game and the result is you come back on the other edge, only in 3 (or rather 4) dimensions.\n \n That's my 2c. Just try and imagine the universe wrapped around, finite in extent, but like a computer screen in that if you go off one 'edge', you come back on the opposite one. There is a vast quantity of data that suggests that this is how things are. \n \n This really is a case of conclusions based on evidence, no a priori assumptions involved. If the universe isn't like this, it bloody sure as hell looks like it is.\n \n There's plenty more in your post i haven't replied to but I think that's best left to Peeling. I hope my analogies and examples made sense. These models of the universe described by contemporary physics are hardly flippant or ramshackle; they are based on decades of observation and seriously high-level maths, and are scrutinised constantly by the best minds on the planet. \n \n Physicists are the first to admit that their theories seem to 'make no sense', but they are also (in my experience) the best at following the evidence. this approach has given us the insanely counterintuitive sciences of Relativity and Quantum, which also both happen to be among the most precisely and rigourously verified of the sciences. \n \n They spit in the face of common seese and reason, but without them we would not have spaceflight (either orbital or interplanetary), lasers, TVs, computers, CDs, and almost evreything the C20th is famed for.",

   "Peeling, the theory about not being able to pinpoint an exact beginning can be applied to abstract numbers, especially in regards to time, but not to actual empiricle beings. Zeno's paradox, which is what your deriving from, even knows that though there is an infinite number of points between me and the door, I still am able to walk through the door. So I think you've committed the fallacy of equivication, by confusing the ideas of the infinitely small or aka infinitesimal, with the infinitely large. One is theoretically traversed (infinitesimal) while the other actually cannot be traversed.

In the case of an unbounded beginning to the universe, there is no start point to reach. I know that's a bit brain-bending, but it's true: there is no smallest number greater than zero. That's why reaching it is unattainable: it doesn't exist. It's quite different from Zeno's paradox of being forced to take smaller and smaller steps towards an attainable goal.",

   "Finite but unbounded doesn't mean anything to me peeling. It's like using a play on words so you can have it both ways when it suits your cause.\n\n I'm sorry; I forget that not everyone found mathematics as interesting as I did at school :)\n \n Finite but unbounded is really straightforward. Like I said before, the set of real numbers (decimals) between 0 and 10 inclusive is what we call 'bounded': the end numbers belong to the set. 0 is the lowest, 10 the highest. With me so far?\n \n Ok. The set of decimals between 0 and 10 exclusive is unbounded at both ends. Although every single number in that set is between 0 and 10, it's impossible to say what the biggest one or the smallest one is. Still with me?\n \n Now, about the universe having a specific beginning in time. If that were the case, it would be bounded at one end - let's call it time = 0.\n \n But what if the universe was finitely old, but unbounded at the end? Now it has no specific beginning, just like the set 0-10 exclusive has no smallest number. That's one way of having a finitely old universe with no beginning.\n \nEither the universe is infinite or it isn't. If it has a specific beginning then it isn't; PERIOD!\n\n Well, unfortunately THAT isn't true either. Certainly, if it has a specific beginning that moment is a finite amount of time ago - as measured from now. But 'now' keeps changing, moving forward. If we stepped outside of time, we might see that it, like the set of positive integers, began at 0 and just kept on going forever. The universe would be infinite, containing an infinite number of events each a finite distance in time away from the start.\n \nNot really true. Your reasoning is circular in that your speculating that the universe may be finite yet unbounded; what ever that means. That is definitely proposing a particular model.\n\n Oh no; sorry if I gave that impression. I was merely pointing out that a finitely old universe could still have no starting point, if it was unbounded.\n \nTo start with, note the bolded. The answer is no we can't go back and forth on our time line. All we can do is go forward. \n\n Oh dear; you've misunderstood completely right from the get-go :(\n \n Let's try again. You actually live in a universe of 3D space, yes? You can move forwards and backwards, left and right, and up and down. Now, can you imagine living in a [I]1D[I] universe? You would be a dot on a line, able to move back and forth along that line but nothing else.\n \n So where does time come in? Time is another dimension. In our universe it's the fourth dimension. In our hypothetical 1D universe, it's the second. What does a 2D universe look like? A sheet of paper. We can imagine 'space' being left-to-right on the paper, and 'time' being top-to-bottom. What does your busy little 1D life look like, now that we can see both space and time spread out before us? It looks like a wiggly trace on the paper, representing your movement through both space and time. What we've done, in effect, is stepped outside of time.\n \n It's much, much harder to imagine the same procedure, turning time into another visible dimension, for our 3D universe. The closest I can get is to imagine a video camera recording my movements. The tape in the camera contains me, at every moment of my life. There's no special 'now' moment. Every frame of 'me' exists equally.\n \n In this analogy, the laws of physics as we know them only dictate what can happen between frames of film. They don't necessarily apply at all to the existence of the film itself. So it's quite wrong to say that the laws of physics say the universe can't exist without an external cause. As I said before, the big bang doesn't represent the creation of the universe: it's just one end of a big list of things that happened inside it.\n \n(What do you gain by postulating a god?) Because one is an intelligent being of incalculable wisdom while the other is inanimate matter which must be formed or constructed by someone in order to give it meaning.\n \n Who says it must be? First you're inventing a god, and now you're inventing a reason for him to have to exist! Why does a first cause have to have a personality? It just raises more questions than it answers.\n \nBut in order to explain how it happened, which is the hot question to be answered, they come up with the Bane Theory for example, as a rational explanation for it occurring. \n\n It is, as you say, the hot question to answer. But inventing a creator doesn't answer the hot question, it just neuters it and raises a different hot question: 'What created the creator?' At which point you change the rules without rhyme or reason: suddenly things don't have to have a personality creating them in order to exist. But if you're going to say that, why not say it before you went and invented god?\n \n That's the big problem I have: religion pretends to have the 'ultimate' answer, but it really doesn't. It just proposes that our existence is not really the ultimate question at all.\n \nI DIDN'T SAY THE UNIVERSE EXISTING GOES AGAINST THE LAWS OF PHYSICS PEELING. Why do you do that? I said this: If I could just get you to admit that believing that the big bang occurred spontaneously goes against all of the laws of physics you otherwise hold to, It's the spontaneous big bang that goes against the laws of physics, not the universe.\n\n Sorry; I knew that was what you meant, and I really was responding to that.\n \n The big bang doesn't go against the laws of physics, because as I said before, the laws of physics apply to events within the universe: they dictate what can happen from one moment to the next. The big bang isn't the universe coming into existence. The universe simply exists, all of it, top to bottom, side to side, end to end and start to finish.\n \n \nNo peeling, that isn't like it at all. It's like looking at a statue and confidently declaring that it just spontaneously sculpted itself when anyone with a brain knows it was created by an intelligent person with an imagination and the desire to create it. Some things don't just spontaneously appear. And if we've never seen it happen with a simple thing like a statue, how arrogant are we to think it happened with this massive and complex universe? \n\n You're still hung up on the universe appearing, being not-there and then there. Why should we assume that's correct? Remember: the big bang is not the universe coming into existence: it is just one end of one of its dimensions, namely time.\n \nSure it is in doubt. I doubt it occurred as described by science. I don't doubt the result of the universes creation at some point in the past. But every bit of evidence you have and will produce is still totally theoretical which is why so many alternate theories are out their regarding its beginning, its expansion, the speed of its expansion, it's impending contraction and the various effects on gravity and light as they travel through it. None of it is consistent as we would expect it to be and nothing we believe about cosmology is just cut and dry accepted fact in anyones mind.\n\n Yep, the variables are uncertain. But we still know there was a big bang :) Being uncertain /= all bets are off.\n \n \nNot true at all, on all counts peeling. I have said it before and I'll say it again. We are working from the same exact available info yet we both interpret it differently according to the world view we hold to.\n\n Well, we're clearly not working from the same info, given the number of facts I've had to try and acquaint you with :) But that's a minor quibble - I'm sure that whatever info you had, you would still, as you say, interpret it according to your worldview, which is that nothing can be true if it contradicts the bible. My worldview is that one should try to make the best judgement taking all the available facts into account. So yes, we come up with different results.\n \nMy world view allows for the supernatural where as yours only allows for the natural explanation.\n\n No, your world view pre-emptively invokes the supernatural - a supernatural of human design, by the way, not any kind of objectively observed supernatural.\n \nBut none of the available facts work in your favor at all, since with every new theory raised to fill the information gaps, it either conflicts with or contradicts with other theories you rely on. For example Dark Matter is theorized to exist in order to answer specific questions regarding the formation of the universe, yet every cosmologist must admit that their is no solid evidence that dark matter even exists.\n\n This is one of those times we're working from different info. Extremely good evidence for dark matter has been observed, in galaxies that have undergone collision: the dark matter whizzes on through without slowing, while the normal baryonic matter interacts and is slowed down, effectively sieving the normal matter out of the dark matter, which can then be observed by gravitational lensing of the galaxies behind. A quick google search will show you what I mean.\n \n \nNote the underlined and bolded peeling. Do you know how frustrating it is when make opposing and contradictory statements in the same paragraph?\n\n I'm experiencing a degree of frustration myself :)\n \nYou simultaneously said \"you have no firm convictions regarding how life began\" and immediately followed it up with but \"we certainly know early life was microbial in nature and evolution proceeded from there.\" It sound like you definitely believe that abiogenesis and evolution occurred, therefore your first statement is not what you truly believe.\n\n Those statements do not contradict one another. Please, just read them. What does the first one say? It talks about uncertainty regarding how life began. Now read the second one. What does it say? It says early life was microbial in nature and evolution proceeded from there. Not first life. Early life. Nothing about how first life came to be, or how first life became early life. No contradiction.\n \n \nSure there are. But they aren't taking place in a violent and inhospitable world which is not in the least bit conducive to harboring or nurturing any life at all.\n\n In what ways do you think early conditions were less hospitable to life?\n \nJust as you choose to believe this was some sort of microbial love fest taking place, I choose to believe that any microbes that may have existed in these conditions would have perceived all other microbes as enemies to be consumed or destroyed,\n\n Just think for a moment: first life. As simple as it gets. And you choose to believe that it has all the complex biological machinery we know is required to perceive and respond to threats. Is that a reasonable choice? \n \n I'm not saying creatures didn't consume one another; of course they did. But what did first life eat? Couldn't have been other creatures, could it? No, so it logically had to live off the raw materials in the environment. Hardly a vicious predator, hmm?\n \n If anything, conditions back then were far more idyllic for life than they are today. No corrosive oxygen in the atmosphere, no predatory creatures, just microbes quietly getting on with their metabolic cycle.\n \nAnd since neither of us was there this alleged billions of years ago, my interpretation of events is as valid as yours is.\n\n Nnnnno. I don't think so. Opinions aren't binary; they're not just absolutely proved true or nothing. It's possible for one to be more reasonable than another.\n \nAgain peeling, your example is childish and nonsensical. Not to mention insulting to our Creator God. God is not a plate of pasta; He is our maker and Father. And as ridiculous as believing He called all that is into existence to you, it is perfectly rational to those of us who have a personal relationship with Him by way of His Holy Spirit indwelling us on a moment by moment basis from the time we accept Jesus as our Savior. We have personal evidence of his deep and abiding love for us, so we can see clearly all that He is capable of. You may be blind to that reality, but it is as clear as the sun in the sky to me.\n\n Well, I'm very happy for you. The fact remains that you cannot demonstrate any benefit for having involved or invoked the supernatural in your version of how the universe came to be. It answers nothing, and introduces even more intractable questions.\n \n \nI don't think you are foolish peeling. I believe the science you cling to and defend is since it's unprovable and forwarded by men who have no greater vision to discern the unknown than you do.\n\n Well, I'm not going to quibble over semantics. The word 'foolish' was used. More to the point, why do you endlessly brandish that word 'unprovable'? The very thing science has over faith is that certainty and uncertainty can be quantified. By contrast, not only are your beliefs unprovable, their uncertainty is absolute. And you don't even think there's anything wrong with that!\n \n I'm sure there's something pithy I could say about a mote and a plank at this point, but it quite escapes me.\n \nThat's ok, and I don't claim to understand the process which actually took place when God called the Heavens and the Earth, as the bible puts it, into existence. Who knows, maybe He clapped His hands together and it did cause a big bang event. But what I do know is that it didn't happen naturally or spontaneously. It was consciously and intelligently designed and created for a purpose which God conceived in His mind.\n\n Well, it's nice to have that sorted out.",

   "Lesz, with all due respect, I don't think you fully understand the weight of the argument.. and maybe its my inability to communicate, and i'm sorry for sounding redundant but let me see if i can break it down into several points.\n 1.the universe either had a beginning or it didn't. These are mutually exclusive terms, there isn't any way it can sorta and sorta not have a beginning (universe here means all of existence).\n 2. So either the timeline of existence looks like this..\n (infinity of past events)------<----<(NOW)\n or this\n (beginning)--------<(NOW)\n Now you used the idea of a circle, but this would be characterized by the first model, since an infinite number of revolutions around the circle have to occur (infinite revolutions in the past) before reaching the present revolution. Each hyphon (-) in each model represents an event in the chain of events of history. Both of these models pose impossibilities. \n A) Model One, it is impossible for you to get from (infinity of past events) to (NOW), because in order to do that you have to pass through an infinite number of events in the past, which by definition of infinity, is impossible.\n B) Model Two, it is possible to get from beginning to now, but the model shows that there was nothing before the first event (beginning), so what caused it? It can't be uncaused, that would lead to something coming from nothing.\n 3. There has to be something that exists that caused the beginning to happen. This 'something' has to itself be infinite (lest we end up having to find a cause for it, and then a cause for that, ad infinitum to absurdity). But the \"infinite\" nature of this 'something' is different than the rest of existence, and does not violate the first model, because it is one being existing infinitely, not infinitely many beings or events existing. Understand the difference?\n this being is not infinity----<infinity-----<infinity---<-\n its more like ________________________________\n \n This 'something' or God is the same being in the past... as he is NOW, but the events or finite beings are not the same now as they were in the past. God doesn't have to traverse infinity to reach now. But an infinite number of beings would have to take place, and that is traversing the infinite. But because this being is infinite in nature (and not in beings) it has a higher order of existence than the rest of existence, so I have to distinguish it from the rest of existence since it transcends it. \n Again, infinite universe implies infinite number of beings transpiring before the present beings of now. One infinite being, explains how the rest of the universe came to be. How do we explain the beginning of the one infinite being? Well, if it was infinite, it had no begining... but that cannot be applied to the rest of the universe as i've shown. So does this infinite being transcend an infinite amount of moments in time to reach the present moment? No, time involves measurement of change, and this being if it is truly infinite does not change. \n \n So really, its a deduction to distinguish between the infinite part of existence, and the finite part, not an assumption.\n LESZ:\n You assume the universe is finite... why? Because we can only see a bit of it? You cannot see over the horizon, so do you think the world is bounded by your vision?\n \n I'm not talking about infinity in terms of space for the universe... I'm talking about infinity in terms of how many events in the past transpired before NOW. I've reached the conclusion of a finite universe (with one infinite being to have started it) because of the impossibility of the contrary.\n\n \n Well, don't think in straight lines! Think in circles -- each effect has its cause. In any case, you haven't addressed the difficulty that the same problems you find in the origins of the universe apply to the origins of god. It is not at all obvious that there has to be an infinite entity in order for there to be a finite universe, if one does not consider the universe to be finite in any meanihngful way. The earth and solar system are finite, but why can not the universe itself be the infinity you desire? Either recycling as some Eastern philosophies would have it, or perhaps through infinite subdivisions of which the universe we can see is only one tine fraction.\n \n If numbers can be infinite, then why not the universe? Infinity is a hard concept for human minds to handle, which is perhaps why we grope for a beginning and end to things and call it god. That doesn't make such an entity logically necessary.",

   "\n You're still hung up on the universe appearing, being not-there and then there. Why should we assume that's correct? Remember: the big bang is not the universe coming into existence: it is just one end of one of its dimensions, namely time.\n\n \n This is a cop out in order to avoid dealing with the larger issue at hand peeling. Here it is explained by Paul Davies, an astrophysicist I'm sure you respect. And he opposes your opinion so exactly, it's as if you sat side by side with that goal in mind. Here are his credentials. Paul Davies: Home\n One evasive tactic is to claim that the universe didn't have a beginning, that it has existed for all eternity. Unfortunately, there are many scientific reasons why this obvious idea is unsound. For starters, given an infinite amount of time, anything that can happen will already have happened, for if a physical process is likely to occur with a certain nonzero probability-however small-then given an infinite amount of time the process must occur, with probability one. By now, the universe should have reached some sort of final state in which all possible physical processes have run their course. \n Furthermore, you don't explain the existence of the universe by asserting that it has always existed. That is rather like saying that nobody wrote the Bible: it was. just copied from earlier versions. Quite apart from all this, there is very good evidence that the universe did come into existence in a big bang, about fifteen billion years ago. The effects of that primeval explosion are clearly detectable today-in the fact that the universe is still expanding, and is filled with an afterglow of radiant heat. \n \n So we are faced with the problem of what happened beforehand to trigger the big bang. Journalists love to taunt scientists with this question when they complain about the money being spent on science. Actually, the answer (in my opinion) was spotted a long time ago, by one Augustine of Hippo, a Christian saint who lived in the fifth century. But Augustine was more subtle. The world, he claimed, was made \"not in time, but simultaneously with time.\" \n In other words, the origin of the universe-what we now call the big bang-was not simply the sudden appearance of matter in an eternally preexisting void, but the coming into being of time itself. Time began with the cosmic origin. There was no \"before,\" no endless ocean of time for a god, or a physical process, to wear itself out in infinite preparation. \n \n Remarkably, modern science has arrived at more or less the same conclusion as Augustine, based on what we now know about the nature of space, time, and gravitation. It was Albert Einstein who taught us that time and space are not merely an immutable arena in which the great cosmic drama is acted out, but are part of the cast-part of the physical universe.http://www.fortunecity.com/emachines/e11/86/big-bang.html\n \n How does it make you feel to know that modern science agrees with the conclusions arrived at by a 5th century christian? It tells me that with all of our gadgets and theories, we haven't gone much beyond confirming what has long since been known by early man.\n \n \nThis is one of those times we're working from different info. Extremely good evidence for dark matter has been observed, in galaxies that have undergone collision: the dark matter whizzes on through without slowing, while the normal baryonic matter interacts and is slowed down, effectively sieving the normal matter out of the dark matter, which can then be observed by gravitational lensing of the galaxies behind. A quick google search will show you what I mean.\n\n \n You always assume that because I disagree with you that I don't understand the theory. What I am saying is that we obviously require different thresholds of evidence in order to accept the results. The problem is that I'm not alone in my skepticism regarding the claims regarding these unseen forms of energy and matter.\n Since there is no experimental or observable evidence that dark matter exists, is it just a prop for the beleaguered big bang theory? This highly speculative construct is now combined with one just as fabulous--dark energy--to shore up current cosmological dogma.\n \n In the 1930s, astronomers Fritz Zwicky and Sinclair Smith were puzzled by the motions they observed within the Virgo and Coma galactic clusters. Everything seemed to be moving too fast to be held in place by gravity. So they conjectured that something they could not see was exerting a gravitational effect on these clusters. But most astronomers were only marginally impressed.\n \n In the 1970s, however, astronomers began to examine the rotational motions of spiral galaxies such as our own Milky Way. The rotational speeds of the stars that make up spiral galaxies are far too great, they said: At such speeds the constituent stars should be flying apart. So astronomers, accustomed to thinking only in terms of gravity, calculated how much additional matter was required&#8212;and where&#8212;to fit the observations. The idea of invisible material or &#8220;dark matter&#8221; soon became essential if the observed motions were to make sense gravitationally. Today astronomers say there is far more dark matter than visible matter acting on galactic structure.\n \n In the years that followed the questions only deepened, as the proposed &#8220;answers&#8221; grew more complex and bizarre and theorists speculated about MACHOs&#8212;&#8220; Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects&#8221;&#8212;and a presumed counterpart called WIMPs&#8212;&#8220;Weakly Interacting Massive Particles&#8221;. Then the theorists began to distinguish between &#8220;cold&#8221; dark matter and &#8220;hot&#8221; dark matter, supplemented by &#8220;warm&#8221; dark matter and &#8220;baryonic&#8221; dark matter.\n \n From the beginning it has been a game accessible only to mathematicians. But today, suspicions abound that the theoretical excursions have no actual connection to anything occurring in nature. As The Complete #####'s Guide to Theories of the Universe puts it, \"there is no experimental or observable evidence that dark matter exists. It's a theory to make the big bang work\".\n \n Advocates of the Electric Universe point out that astronomers can maintain the &#8220;credibility&#8221; of this game only by insisting that electromagnetism has no appreciable role in the organization of cosmic structure. &#8220;And it isn&#8217;t as if the evidence for galactic magnetic fields and therefore electricity is lacking!&#8221; laughs Wallace Thornhill, who has devoted much of his life to exploring the role of electricity in space.\n \n What is the nature of &#8220;missing matter&#8221;, and does it even exist in truth? It is interesting to note that astronomers cannot answer the first question, but do not doubt the answer to the second. We see the contradiction ratified daily in the popular scientific media. A story at the Universe Today website begins, &#8220;Dark matter is a mystery. Astronomers know it's there because they can measure the effect of its gravity on stars and galaxies, but they can't see it&#8221;. Perhaps the author does not realize that the confidence he exudes rests entirely on the astronomers&#8217; conjectures. Their equations &#8220;work&#8221; only in an abstract world, and only because the mathematicians have systematically excluded electricity.\n \n The diagram at the top of the page shows the universal confusion between matter and mass. (It's a pity both words begin with \"m\", say the electrical theorists; otherwise mathematicians might not have gotten away with this sleight of hand). Everyone recognizes the equation relating energy and mass (E = mc2), but no one knows what gives matter its apparent mass. One of the foundational principles of physics states that matter cannot be created or destroyed. Matter cannot be converted into energy or vice versa. In other words, energy and matter are not equivalent and cannot be lumped together as in the above diagram.\n \n The truth is that we have no real idea of the relationship between matter, mass, and gravity. It is our ignorance of this relationship that has permitted the big bang theory to flourish and has created the &#8220;problem&#8221; of missing mass. Dark matter was invented to rescue a gravity-driven universe and to make the big bang work, even if the theory requires &#8220;creation from nothing\" and must violate, in its first principles, every fundamental law of physics.\n \n Is there an alternative? Yes, plasma cosmologists are waiting in the wings for working scientists to tire of the theorists&#8217; mathematical escapades, and to think first of the things we actually know. Grant the role of electricity on a galactic scale, and the case for dark matter evaporates. Plasma physicists have successfully demonstrated the formation and dynamics of the classic spiral shape (spiral galaxy) in laboratory electrical discharges. And observations of magnetic fields in spiral galaxies match the laboratory forms, which are known to be scaleable over more than 14 orders of magnitude. The magnetic fields trace the electric currents flowing along the spiral arms of galaxies. Electromagnetic forces alone can thus produce the classic structure and rotation of ubiquitous, magnificent galactic formations. No dark matter required!http://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2006/image06/060228dark-energy.jpg\n In the Dark on Matter\n \n So, as I said earlier to Liminus, \"we don&#8217;t know what we don&#8217;t know and we can&#8217;t calculate a probability for an unknown.\" And the unknowns are as infinite as space itself.\n \n \nThose statements do not contradict one another. Please, just read them. What does the first one say? It talks about uncertainty regarding how life began. Now read the second one. What does it say? It says early life was microbial in nature and evolution proceeded from there. Not first life. Early life. Nothing about how first life came to be, or how first life became early life. No contradiction.\n\n \n Semantics. You are playing word games as you accept these vague theories as rational and reasonable results when you have no absolute evidence to support them.\n \n \nIn what ways do you think early conditions were less hospitable to life?\n\n \n I think? I'm speaking about what your science claims. None of this is what I personally believe occurred. But I'm debating this using your scientific assumption, yet you still argue against them when it serves your purpose. Here's a clip from a show that is dealing with this question according to current scientific theory.\n YouTube - 1of6 -- Origins - How Life Began\n \n \nJust think for a moment: first life. As simple as it gets. And you choose to believe that it has all the complex biological machinery we know is required to perceive and respond to threats. Is that a reasonable choice?\n \n \n But isn't survival of the fittest like the first law of random mutation by way of natural selection? Are you again contradicting one law in order to promote another unanswerable part of your flawed theory? I am looking for consistency peeling, yet you go to and fro, back and forth with opposing laws depending on which aspect of this pseudo science we are discussing at the time. \n \n To expand my point, how did these original microbial organisms survive in such a violent and inhospitable world if they had no defenses against invading microbes?\n \n \nI'm not saying creatures didn't consume one another; of course they did. But what did first life eat? Couldn't have been other creatures, could it? No, so it logically had to live off the raw materials in the environment. Hardly a vicious predator, hmm?\n\n \n I disagree completely. Based on your beliefs of natural selection, the assumption is just that. The stronger microbes consumed and destroyed the weaker ones in order to survive and grow. What was their option? To consume lava and sulphuric acid in the atmosphere?\n \n \nIf anything, conditions back then were far more idyllic for life than they are today. No corrosive oxygen in the atmosphere, no predatory creatures, just microbes quietly getting on with their metabolic cycle.\n\n \n This is so naive, I don't even know where to start with it. You're saying that Oxygen, the fuel which feeds the life of a carbon based world is more corrosive than the gasses, lava fields, volcanoes and acids which defined this planets atmosphere and environment back then? According to your own science, it wasn't until oxygen replaced these conditions that life multiplied, diversified and prospered.\n \n Consistency Peeling. I'm looking for consistency, and you don't seem to have any to offer.",

Science has definitely NOT arrived at the same conclusion as Augustine. Merely because Augustine, a mere theologian, postulated that time began when the universe began, does not make that statement identical to the scientific hypothesis. It's pure speculation, a coincidental, lucky guess, with none of the work that has gone into the scientific hypothesis. Augustine certainly doesn't earn a place as a prescient forecaster, because he had none of the knowledge on which this scientific interpretation is based.\n \n And to be fair, with all due respect to St. Paul Davies, it is merely a scientific hypothesis that time began with the big bang and that it is meaningless to speak of time \"before\" the big bang. That is just one interpretation of the evidence, which stands independently of that conclusion. Not all scientists subscribe to that notion.\n \n Once again the vast and unbridgeable difference between science and religion is that science stands on evidence, and that in many cases, its conclusions are provisional.

   "How does it make you feel to know that modern science agrees with the conclusions arrived at by a 5th century christian?\n\n \n \nAs for this nonsense:\n Pure twaddle. Science has definitely NOT arrived at the same conclusion as Augustine. Merely because Augustine, a mere theologian, postulated that time began when the universe began, does not make that statement identical to the scientific hypothesis. \n\n \n Tell that to Paul Davies. Go on, I dare you to debate him on this issue.\n \n \n It's pure speculation, a coincidental, lucky guess, with none of the work that has gone into the scientific hypothesis. Augustine certainly doesn't earn a place as a prescient forecaster, because he had none of the knowledge on which this scientific interpretation is based.\n\n \n And yet his work has survived well enough so that a modern day astrophysicist like Paul Davies is aware enough of his stated beliefs that he quotes him and credits him with first defining the event.\n \n \nAnd to be fair, with all due respect to St. Paul Davies, it is merely a scientific hypothesis that time began with the big bang and that it is meaningless to speak of time \"before\" the big bang. That is just one interpretation of the evidence, which stands independently of that conclusion. Not all scientists subscribe to that notion.\n\n \n Exactly my point throughout this whole debate. Even scientists who live and breathe this stuff can't agree on any single aspect of it unanimously. And yet you pseudo intellectuals are so arrogant that you will call me ignorant for daring to refute your unproven assumptions and theoretical conclusions. Let me put it this way lesz; since we're never going to agree on anything. If you guys would simply admit that my beliefs and problems with the science you rely on is valid, and I have a right to believe as I do, then we would at least have found a happy medium which allows mutual respect to exist for opposing views. Unless you can absolutely prove what you believe is true, but we both know that is impossible.\n \n \nOnce again the vast and unbridgeable difference between science and religion is that science stands on evidence, and that in many cases, its conclusions are provisional. What are the XXXXXX crowing about Augustine's guess today going to do when science uncovers new evidence, and new theories less compatible with this nonsense replace the old?\n\n \n First of all, it remains to be seen if new evidence will EVER contradict what Augustine proposed. (See again how easily you make assumptions?) Secondly, I haven't used one christian or creationist source for any of my rebuttals in this debate with peeling. I'm not arguing creationism as opposed to evolution here at all. I am defeating evolution by showing the inconsistencies within it depending on who you refer to. I'm showing that there are no absolutes and therefore no consistencies in what you pseudo intellectuals claim to believe here. I'm showing that \"we don't know what we don't know and we can't calculate a probability for an unknown.\" And the unknowns regarding cosmology are as infinite as eternity itself. So if anyone here defines the epitome of ignorance, it is he who makes absolute claims based on so many unknowns which can never be factored into the equations upon which these theories are based.",

   "Your ignorance of current scientific understanding is too profound for me to correct in a single post. You would have to go back to school -- high school -- to catch up. However, let me point out the more obvious obtusities:\n \n \nNotice how you first admit it's a theory, a theory mind you which is unprovable beyond making predictions which are based on what sounds reasonable according to the way our world works today. But we have no actual, provable or supportable clue as to how it worked this alleged 4+ BILLION YEARS AGO. \n\n \n Sweetums, I hate to break this to you, but ALL of science is theories about how the real world operates. I know you aren't able to grasp this most elementary point about science, but that is just how science works. It knits theories together to find the most probable explanation for a group of otherwise meaningless facts.\n \n As to the date, that is established by science, the same science that allows you to post your inane drivel on these message boards. It works. Science works. You won't admit it, but it does. Otherwise, you wouldn't even be here.\n \n I went on to point out the scientific conclusion that life evolved under anaerobic conditions, and you pontificated:\n \n \nand then in the very next paragraph you go right on to make an absolute statement of fact as if it's a proven conclusion in which there is no doubt at all. Another glowing example of the inconsistency and contradictory way that you rationalize what you choose to believe but have no absolute evidence of. \n\n \n What you refer to (if only you knew it) is the sudden appearance of iron oxide sediments in the geological record about 2.5 billion years ago. Now, the reason scientists conclude that life evolved in anaerobic environments is because chemistry tells us that oxygen is a very reactive element. It won't stay free for long, unless there is a source that is constantly producing it. Then suddenly, in the geological record, the banded iron formations appear, evidence that oxygen had at that point been introduced into the atmosphere. \n \n The inference is that photosynthesis began at that time, because we know of no other natural source of such abundant oxygen. Perhaps you god wiggled his oxygen finger, but scientists prefer natural explanations.\n \n \nReally? Prove it by showing the repeatable process by which it occurred. And show the original evidence upon which these conclusions were arrived at. I mean, I'm so ignorant and you're so enlightened, so stop with the unfounded opinions and support your claims with actual evidence. \n\n \n My dear, the evidence is under your nose. Open your eyes and learn to read. The geological record doesn't lie. There was no free atmospheric oxygen before about 2.5 billion years ago, and after that, there was. Live with it, Accept reality for a change. History leaves its marks for science to understand. Your wilful denial of facts is testimony to your religious zeal, but not to your intellect.\n \n Read some science for a change, instead of screaming against it.\n \n As for your demand that scientists show you a repeat of earth's evolution, that's a laugh coming from a religious fundie! We might as well ask you to show us a repeat of god's so-called creation before we believe it. Can you produce? Of course not.\n \n So it is beyond stupid to demand that scientists recreate a one-time event. Science reads the tale history leaves behind in the rocks. You refuse to, because you dare not.\n \n \nAgain, prove it! Show the timeline that proves it occurred when you say it did. And show that for life to originate, an oxygen based atmosphere would have been a bad thing. With more than your unsupported opinion I mean. For future reference lesz, just keep in mind that you have absolutely no credibility with me. \n\n \n The timelines are in the literature, and you can find them online, only you are too terrified to look. My opinion is supported by evidence; yours is nothing more than rancid hot air. If I ever did develop credibility with you, I'd have to check myself in for psychiatric evaluation.\n \n \nSo if you're going to start a response to me by asserting how ignorant I am when I document most of what I say with evidence, then don't even bother responding unless you're able to support your claims with objective evidence which will stand on its own merits.\n\n \n You have documented nothing at all. You either quote loony Creationist websites, or you rip quotes out of context as all Creos do. You have zero understanding of the science you condemn. Your arguments have no merit because they are based on fantasy, not reality. You are a fundamentalist bible-worshipper, not a credible witness.",

He is well aware that what he writes are theories and speculations, not facts established beyond all reasonable doubt. He wouldn't dispute there are many physicists who do not agree with him, and that his opinions are not the word of god, the way you seem to think.\n \n \nAnd yet his work has survived well enough so that a modern day astrophysicist like Paul Davies is aware enough of his stated beliefs that he quotes him and credits him with first defining the event.\n\n \n Sweetie, Augustine was presumably familiar with the science of his day. He made a philosophical stab in the dark. It just does not compare with the work of science today. He didn't have insight, just a lucky guess that coincides with some current scientific ideas. That doesn't make him a prescient genius.\n \n \nFirst of all, it remains to be seen if new evidence will EVER contradict what Augustine proposed. (See again how easily you make assumptions?)

You are merely bloviating about it. You, Archie, are never going to defeat science -- you haven't the capability.\n \n Even if we were to assume that somehow Augustine had anticipated modern science, which he certainly did not, how would that argue against evolution? Evolution is real no matter how the universe itself began!\n \n Archie dear, get it into your noggin... the theory of evolution had abundant evidence even before gene theory was a reality. How else would Darwin have come up with it? He wasn't looking for it... it dawned on him and Wallace, independently, because they were confronted with facts. Facts, archie, another concept you seem to have trouble with. All it depends on is certain facts: variation, selection and inheritance. These were obvious even in Darwin's day, it's just that he was the first to put them all together.\n \n It doesn't depend on whether this particular universe is eternal or had a beginning.\n \n Finally, Archie, I challenge you to put together for us a recreation of Genesis.

   "Apologies, it's been a busy week. To get up to speed...\n \n Archie - on peer review (which seems to have been abandoned a long time ago): \n Mainly laughable statements, although I especially liked these two (paraphrased) gems from post 73; \"scientists are criticising the scientific method and they're not even creationists!\" (surely this is evidence of the scientific method being analysed and improving itself?) and \"you're accusing me of cherry-picking my results, but all my results agree with me\" (well, yes. That would be because they're cherry-picked.) \n I'd also say that you are holding fairly massive double standards anyway by demanding that the scientific method be subjected to testing and criticism despite the fact that creationism is untestable and ignores all criticism.

One is, as you've said - the existence of some entity that exists 'outside' of the universe. This could be anything from multi-dimensional 'branes' (see string theory) to the Flying Spaghetti Monster, to a 'universe primordial soup' that everything buds out of.\n Another answer is that there is a hole in your logic.

This is all I've been trying to get to all along.\n\n \n Let me just use that hoary old trick and rewrite that from a slightly different perspective (my replacements in bold):\n There is a part of the universe that is infinite, and a part that is finite. We don't know what the infinite part is, but we do know THAT IT IS, or in other words, we know that it must exist. If something exists, then it is real. So this over-arching reality, or infinite (or at least larger and encompassing) framework, has to be the cause of the finite universe. I may not know how it caused it, but I know that it is a cause none the less. [...] Because this part of the universe is infinite, it has a higher order of existence than the finite part of the universe, so it is primary or causal with respect to the universe we observe. Put it all together and what do you get? There exists some higher physical reality or plane that is the cause of the physical universe that we can observe [...].\n Says basically the same thing, but reads a bit differently, no? Using a phrase such as \"there exists a being\" is rather leading, dontcha think, leaping to a conclusion before the argument really gets us there. It is a huge logical jump from \"the universe we observe must have had some cause\" to \"there exists a being that can create universes\", because of all the other implications of words like \"being\" and \"create\".\n \n The only trouble with this sort of idea -- your original statement and my paraphrase -- is that it only puts back the problem one level. It doesn't really get solved at all: where, then, did the infinite or primarily causal part of the universe come from? Why something at all, rather than nothing at all? One is still left groping for a truly satisfying resolution of the conundrum. A logical conjuring trick just doesn't do the problem justice at all. If it were that simple and obvious, we wouldn't all still be arguing about it after centuries of discussion. As Bertrand Russell once remarked, it's a lot easier to grasp that somehow, somewhere, this logical trickery has a flaw, but far less easy to spot exactly where that flaw lies. It is so neat it even has the conjurer fooled! ;)\n \n Physicists like to play with various notions of how the universe began. One idea I rather like is that the universe sprang into being out of the vacuum, the vacuum being true nothingness, no space, time or anything else. Borrowing energy from the vacuum, it purchased temporary existence, rather like the virtual particles physicists believe are popping in and out of existence all the time. Borrowed energy eventually gets returned, so the equation balances.\n \n Another notion that sounds promising is that universes give birth to other universes, perhaps in the centers of black holes. You could get an infinite number of universes nested within each other that way, rather like a sort of cosmological Mandelbrot set. (To paraphrase the little old lady, \"You can't fool me, it's turtles all the way up and down!) And then there are various other multiverse notions around, quantum, multidimensional, etc., etc. Perhaps universes exist as bubbles within some plum duff, the plum duff being defined by the existence of the universes rather than having existence of its own.\n \n Another point made by physicists is that by definition, if the universe is everything that exists, then it does not exist \"in\" anything else, because there is no \"outside\" for it to exist \"within\". One should not regard the universe as if it were a ball in a box. The ball and the box are one, and there is nothing \"outside\" the ball at all. Hard to imagine that, isn't it. Maybe a topologist could do it. And if the universe encompasses everything that exists, then it must also encompass its own causes, no? \"God\" then becomes part of the universe, and the universe becomes self-creating, because there is nothing \"outside\" of it to do any creating! So one can dispense with the word \"god\" and replace it with \"the universe\".\n \n I knew you'd like that! ;)\n \n At any rate, all this jiggery-pokery aside, it just seems to me that a simple explanation or logical twist isn't a satisfying answer, and I think lots of freethinkers tend to see it the same way, even if they disagree about how to refute it or how succeesful any particular refutation is. There are ways of looking at it that don't postulate some infinite and supreme \"creator being\" but that do not seem (to me at any rate) any inferior to that notion. Perhaps after a few more centuries of debate and discovery, we might have a better handle on what reality actually is!",

I was just trying to show that at least some kind of transcendant and infinite being exists.\nOh, absolutely. I was just emphasising that you can in no way start with 'trancendant infinite being' and end with a single answer of 'God'.\n \n \nAbout causality, aren't there examples of cause and effect taking place without time elapsing? For example: How much time elapses between the cause of a force putting pressure on a wall, and the effect of the wall recieving the pressure?\nIn the case of putting pressure on a wall, the 'force' experienced by both parties is an electromagnetic interaction. As such, it takes place at the speed of light - but that is still a finite speed.\n \n \nAnd even if causality only happened with time, that doesn't refute what I've said so far, does it? The first causal action happens with the first elapsed amount of time... neither causality or time precedes the other, they both come to be simultaneously, they would be mutually dependent on each other. Your treating it as if one precedes the other.\nI don't particularly see this as refuation - just rewording.

   "If causality came into being at the same instant as time (and as the Big Bang), then that still makes the BB the 'uncaused cause'. There need not be a transcendent entity at all.\n\n \n I'd second that. What we have in the cosmological argument for god is the conclusion that there must be a causeless cause, and they call it \"God\". You might as well call it the \"Big Bang\". Or the First Singularity. Or whatever. It is ironic that the argument is based on their observation that all events in this universe have a prior cause... except they are forced to argue that although all other events have causes, the first one did not. It is not obvious why they plump for a god, an uncaused cause at one remove from the BB, yet reject the BB itself as the uncaused cause. There does seem to be no logical necessity for this, because either way, we are still stuck with an uncaused cause as the beginning.\n \n Worse, it's a logical leap to claim that the first uncaused cause was therefore eternal -- it could, as you suggest, have been instantaneous. If there was truly nothing before the Big Bang, then it would make no sense to claim that something created it. If time came into existence at the moment of the BB, then there could be no entity that preceded it.\n \n Of course, the rebuttal is that god exists outside of time, but this is just an ad hoc argument to support the central claim of godhead, not a logically necessary conclusion argued from unimpeachable premises. If time did not exist before the beginning, how could god be said to exist outside it? There is no outside of something that doesn't exist.",

Rather than even admit a problem exists, they prefer to shoot the messenger. \n \n \n and \"you're accusing me of cherry-picking my results, but all my results agree with me\" (well, yes. That would be because they're cherry-picked.) \n I'd also say that you are holding fairly massive double standards anyway by demanding that the scientific method be subjected to testing and criticism despite the fact that creationism is untestable and ignores all criticism.

Those few that you claim to have suffer from two flaws - that they aren't pro-creationism, they're just anti-evolution/old earth and that they have all been pretty thoroughly rebuked.\n \n \nAnd I have proposed an effective alternative.

I can't post my own knowledge because that's 'my opinion with no evidence'. I think you've ruled out pretty much all means of knowledge communication beyond a divine message, ironically.\n \n We're back to your double standards again. You feel that it's OK to complain if I attack your links as 'wrong and ignorant' even though I include evidence that shows why your links are 'wrong and ignorant'.

   "[QUOTE=lesz;336596]\n Let me just use that hoary old trick and rewrite that from a slightly different perspective (my replacements in bold):\n 1[INDENT]There is a part of the universe that is infinite, and a part that is finite. We don't know what the infinite part is, but we do know THAT IT IS, or in other words, we know that it must exist. If something exists, then it is real. So this over-arching reality, or infinite (or at least larger and encompassing) framework, has to be the cause of the finite universe. I may not know how it caused it, but I know that it is a cause none the less. [...] Because this part of the universe is infinite, it has a higher order of existence than the finite part of the universe, so it is primary or causal with respect to the universe we observe. Put it all together and what do you get? There exists some higher physical reality or plane that is the cause of the physical universe that we can observe \n 2\n Says basically the same thing, but reads a bit differently, no? It is a huge logical jump from \"the universe we observe must have had some cause\" to \"there exists a being that can create universes\n 3\n Another point made by physicists is that by definition, if the universe is everything that exists, then it does not exist \"in\" anything else, because there is no \"outside\" for it to exist \"within\". One should not regard the universe as if it were a ball in a box. The ball and the box are one, and there is nothing \"outside\" the ball at all. Hard to imagine that, isn't it.

And if the universe encompasses everything that exists, then it must also encompass its own causes, no? \"God\" then becomes part of the universe, and the universe becomes self-creating, because there is nothing \"outside\" of it to do any creating! So one can dispense with the word \"god\" and replace it with \"the universe\".\n \n I knew you'd like that! ;)QUOTE]\n \n (Sidenote:Forgive this poor quotation, I had a bit of technical trouble with this post)\n \n 1\n One tiny little problem. Everything you said here is true, I actually agree with your reworded statement except for the part where you say 'framework'. I used the word 'being' because being does not mean something that is personal or something that is impersonal or something that is a God or not or anything like that. All being means is SOMETHING THAT EXISTS! The word being is very ambigious because we both said that we don't know exactly what it is that is out there, but you kinda turned around and changed your mind by saying you do know what it is, and that it is a framework. For someone against leaps over logic, you did it yourself. The word 'framework' is much more specific than the word 'being' and so I would ask that you provide some sort of backing for your claim that this being is a framework. \n 2\n Well, Lesz, create just means to bring into existence, to make, or to cause... which is what we both are talking about (webster.com) So you can use the word cause, fine its the same idea. As for your word 'being' it just means something that exists... the word you chose instead was 'framework' which is actually a huge leap from 'being' into specifity. I thought just a moment ago you were talking about how we cannot know anything about the cause? And now your telling me it's a framework?\n 3\n Actually yes, I did like that, because it was only reiterating what I had said before. The universe is all that exists, and therefore IF God existed, he would be part of the universe. But why bring up this dead issue? I already said we're dealing with some being, not necessarily God. And yes, this being would be part of the universe.... but the being could not be part of the finite universe (like you said our solar system, remember?) I'm saying this being is the infinite part of the universe and is NOT part of the FINITE universe. Again, your not making the distinction as you were doing so before, and its butchering the issue.",

   "I wasn't even saying it was God, I was only saying it was some being.\nI would prefer the term 'thing', because 'being' implies (to me, at least) life of some sort. But that's just semantics.\n \n \nNo disrespect at all on this, I would just be interested in some sources on how pressure is electromagnetic and speed of light and such.\nNo problem. Will Wikipedia do?\n The Electromagnetic interaction.\n \n Essentially, all 'everyday' forces are caused by electromagnetic repulsion between the electrons surrounding atoms. If I push a wall, the atoms in my hand don't 'bounce off' the atoms in the wall - as they get very close, electromagnetic repulsion simply becomes great enough to keep the two atoms separate. As e/m force is mediated by exchange of photons/virtual photons, this would happen at the speed of light.\n \n Another way of looking at it is via a more fundamental route - nothing can go faster than the speed of light. The atoms in the wall cannot 'feel' the force from the atoms in your hand until that force gets there - and as the atoms never touch, there is always that finite distance to be crossed.\n \n \nAh yes, I see. Your saying that if both causality came into existence with time, then there could be no cause for it, because causality would not have existed to cause causality. Got it.

May I please have some more information concerning why it is that causality has to exist with time?\nHopefully, I've given you a bit more info on why causality is time-dependant, with effect following cause. You're still hung up on finding causality in a situation where causality cannot apply (as we understand causality, at least).\n \n To turn your question on it's head - if effect does not have to follow cause (but both must exist), then why is the possibility that there was nothing 'before' the big bang an issue?\n \n EDIT: Another post.\n \nWait a minute.. I'm not a physics genius, but I know something about E=mc^2 and Einsteins theory of special relativity. Doesn't it say that the closer we get to the speed of light, the more time slows down? And if we were to reach the speed of light, time would stop in our frame of reference? (correct me if i'm wrong) So if the cause and effect took place at the speed of light, doesn't that mean that no time elapsed during the causal action?\n\n Apologies. I'm a physics graduate, I sometimes use colloquialisms that can be misunderstood without the relevant knowledge.\n What I meant to say was that the particles governing the interaction that we perceive as 'force' move at the speed of light. To analogise: your hand 'pushes' the wall. To do this, your hand shoots out millions of virtual photons at the speed of light, which cross the gap between your hand and the wall and 'push' it away. Simultaneously, the wall shoots out millions of it's own virtual photons, which push your hand away once they have reached it.\n \n There is a gap between you pushing the wall and the wall 'felling' the force - this time gap is equal to [the distance from your hand to the wall]/[the speed of light]",

   "That's not the 'greatest argument against ID/Creationism'. The greatest argument in that respect is that you don't have any scientific articles - not peer reviewed ones, but ones that actually use the scientific method to give evidence that the earth is 8000 years old. Those few that you claim to have suffer from two flaws - that they aren't pro-creationism, they're just anti-evolution/old earth and that they have all been pretty thoroughly rebuked.\n\n \n I'm going to concentrate on this issue because it's a constant assertion made by proponents of evolution and just isn't true. The theory of intelligent design holds that certain features of the universe and living things are best explained by an intelligent designer rather than an undirected process such as natural selection. ID is thus a scientific disagreement with the core claim about evolutionary theory that the random design of living systems is an illusion.\n \n In a broader sense, Intelligent Design is simply the science of design detection -- how to recognize patterns arranged by an intelligent cause for a purpose. Design detection is used in a number of scientific fields, including anthropology, forensic sciences that seek to explain the cause of events such as a death or fire, cryptanalysis and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). An inference that certain biological information may be the product of an intelligent cause can be tested or evaluated in the same manner as scientists daily test for design in other sciences.\n \n ID is controversial because of the implications of its evidence, rather than the significant weight of its evidence. ID proponents believe science should be conducted objectively, without regard to the implications of its findings. This is particularly necessary in origins science because of its historical (and thus very subjective) nature, and because it is a science that unavoidably impacts religion. \n \n Positive evidence of design in living systems consists of the semantic, meaningful or functional nature of biological information, the lack of any known law that can explain the sequence of symbols that carry the \"messages,\" and statistical and experimental evidence that tends to rule out chance as a plausible explanation. Other evidence challenges the adequacy of natural or material causes to explain both the origin and diversity of life.\n \n Intelligent Design is an intellectual movement that includes a scientific research program for investigating intelligent causes and that challenges naturalistic explanations of origins which currently drive science education and research. Here's an excerpt of a speech by Behe which offers evidence for ID while exposing flaws in Darwins evolution theory by exposing how shallow it ultimately is.\n Evidence for Intelligent Design from Biochemistry\n From a speech delivered at Discovery Institute's God & Culture Conference\n \n Michael J. Behe\n Discovery Institute\n August 10, 1996\n \n A Series of Eyes\n \n How do we see? In the 19th century the anatomy of the eye was known in great detail, and its sophisticated features astounded everyone who was familiar with them. Scientists of the time correctly observed that if a person were so unfortunate as to be missing one of the eye's many integrated features, such as the lens, or iris, or ocular muscles, the inevitable result would be a severe loss of vision or outright blindness. So it was concluded that the eye could only function if it were nearly intact.\n \n Charles Darwin knew about the eye too. In the Origin of Species, Darwin dealt with many objections to his theory of evolution by natural selection. He discussed the problem of the eye in a section of the book appropriately entitled \"Organs of extreme perfection and complication.\" Somehow, for evolution to be believable, Darwin had to convince the public that complex organs could be formed gradually, in a step-by-step process.\n \n He succeeded brilliantly. Cleverly, Darwin didn't try to discover a real pathway that evolution might have used to make the eye. Instead, he pointed to modern animals with different kinds of eyes, ranging from the simple to the complex, and suggested that the evolution of the human eye might have involved similar organs as intermediates.\n \n Here is a paraphrase of Darwin's argument. Although humans have complex camera-type eyes, many animals get by with less. Some tiny creatures have just a simple group of pigmented cells, or not much more than a light sensitive spot. That simple arrangement can hardly be said to confer vision, but it can sense light and dark, and so it meets the creature's needs. The light-sensing organ of some starfishes is somewhat more sophisticated. Their eye is located in a depressed region. This allows the animal to sense which direction the light is coming from, since the curvature of the depression blocks off light from some directions. If the curvature becomes more pronounced, the directional sense of the eye improves. But more curvature lessens the amount of light that enters the eye, decreasing its sensitivity. The sensitivity can be increased by placement of gelatinous material in the cavity to act as a lens. Some modern animals have eyes with such crude lenses. Gradual improvements in the lens could then provide an image of increasing sharpness, as the requirements of the animal's environment dictated.\n \n Using reasoning like this, Darwin convinced many of his readers that an evolutionary pathway leads from the simplest light sensitive spot to the sophisticated camera-eye of man. But the question remains, how did vision begin? Darwin persuaded much of the world that a modern eye evolved gradually from a simpler structure, but he did not even try to explain where his starting point for the simple light sensitive spot came from. On the contrary, Darwin dismissed the question of the eye's ultimate origin:\n Is Darwins methodology for coming to these conclusions what you consider valid science? Are these not simply the imaginings and beliefs of one individual in order to promote his own unprovable ideas? Here is how the eye works to produce human vision.\n How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light hardly concerns us more than how life itself originated. He had an excellent reason for declining the question: it was completely beyond nineteenth century science. How the eye works; that is, what happens when a photon of light first hits the retina simply could not be answered at that time. As a matter of fact, no question about the underlying mechanisms of life could be answered. How did animal muscles cause movement? How did photosynthesis work? How was energy extracted from food? How did the body fight infection? No one knew.\n \n To Darwin vision was a black box, but today, after the hard, cumulative work of many biochemists, we are approaching answers to the question of sight. Here is a brief overview of the biochemistry of vision. When light first strikes the retina, a photon interacts with a molecule called 11-cis-retinal, which rearranges within picoseconds to trans-retinal. The change in the shape of retinal forces a change in the shape of the protein, rhodopsin, to which the retinal is tightly bound. The protein's metamorphosis alters its behavior, making it stick to another protein called transducin. Before bumping into activated rhodopsin, transducin had tightly bound a small molecule called GDP. But when transducin interacts with activated rhodopsin, the GDP falls off and a molecule called GTP binds to transducin. (GTP is closely related to, but critically different from, GDP.)\n \n GTP-transducin-activated rhodopsin now binds to a protein called phosphodiesterase, located in the inner membrane of the cell. When attached to activated rhodopsin and its entourage, the phosphodiesterase acquires the ability to chemically cut a molecule called cGMP (a chemical relative of both GDP and GTP). Initially there are a lot of cGMP molecules in the cell, but the phosphodiesterase lowers its concentration, like a pulled plug lowers the water level in a bathtub.\n \n Another membrane protein that binds cGMP is called an ion channel. It acts as a gateway that regulates the number of sodium ions in the cell. Normally the ion channel allows sodium ions to flow into the cell, while a separate protein actively pumps them out again. The dual action of the ion channel and pump keeps the level of sodium ions in the cell within a narrow range. When the amount of cGMP is reduced because of cleavage by the phosphodiesterase, the ion channel closes, causing the cellular concentration of positively charged sodium ions to be reduced. This causes an imbalance of charge across the cell membrane which, finally, causes a current to be transmitted down the optic nerve to the brain. The result, when interpreted by the brain, is vision.\n \n My explanation is just a sketchy overview of the biochemistry of vision. Ultimately, though, this is what it means to \"explain\" vision. This is the level of explanation for which biological science must aim. In order to truly understand a function, one must understand in detail every relevant step in the process. The relevant steps in biological processes occur ultimately at the molecular level, so a satisfactory explanation of a biological phenomenon such as vision, or digestion, or immunity must include its molecular explanation.\n \n Now that the black box of vision has been opened it is no longer enough for an \"evolutionary explanation\" of that power to consider only the anatomical structures of whole eyes, as Darwin did in the nineteenth century, and as popularizers of evolution continue to do today. Each of the anatomical steps and structures that Darwin thought were so simple actually involves staggeringly complicated biochemical processes that cannot be papered over with rhetoric. Darwin's simple steps are now revealed to be huge leaps between carefully tailored machines. Thus biochemistry offers a Lilliputian challenge to Darwin. Now the black box of the cell has been opened and a Lilliputian world of staggering complexity stands revealed. It must be explained.Irreducible Complexity\n \n How can we decide if Darwin's theory can account for the complexity of molecular life? It turns out that Darwin himself set the standard. He acknowledged that:\n \n If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But what type of biological system could not be formed by \"numerous, successive, slight modifications\"?\n \n Well, for starters, a system that is irreducibly complex. Irreducible complexity is just a fancy phrase I use to mean a single system which is composed of several interacting parts, and where the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to cease functioning.\n \n Let's consider an everyday example of irreducible complexity: the humble mousetrap. The mousetraps that my family uses consist of a number of parts. There are: 1) a flat wooden platform to act as a base; 2) a metal hammer, which does the actual job of crushing the little mouse; 3) a spring with extended ends to press against the platform and the hammer when the trap is charged; 4) a sensitive catch which releases when slight pressure is applied, and 5) a metal bar which connects to the catch and holds the hammer back when the trap is charged. Now you can't catch a few mice with just a platform, add a spring and catch a few more mice, add a holding bar and catch a few more. All the pieces of the mousetrap have to be in place before you catch any mice. Therefore the mousetrap is irreducibly complex.\n \n An irreducibly complex system cannot be produced directly by numerous, successive, slight modifications of a precursor system, because any precursor to an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional. An irreducibly complex biological system, if there is such a thing, would be a powerful challenge to Darwinian evolution. Since natural selection can only choose systems that are already working, then if a biological system cannot be produced gradually it would have to arise as an integrated unit, in one fell swoop, for natural selection to have anything to act on.\n \n Demonstration that a system is irreducibly complex is not a proof that there is absolutely no gradual route to its production. Although an irreducibly complex system can't be produced directly, one can't definitively rule out the possibility of an indirect, circuitous route. However, as the complexity of an interacting system increases, the likelihood of such an indirect route drops precipitously. And as the number of unexplained, irreducibly complex biological systems increases, our confidence that Darwin's criterion of failure has been met skyrockets toward the maximum that science allows.\n \n The Cilium\n \n Now, are any biochemical systems irreducibly complex? Yes, it turns out that many are. A good example is the cilium. Cilia are hairlike structures on the surfaces of many animal and lower plant cells that can move fluid over the cell's surface or \"row\" single cells through a fluid. Inhumans, for example, cells lining the respiratory tract each have about 200 cilia that beat in synchrony to sweep mucus towards the throat for elimination. What is the structure of a cilium? A cilium consists of bundle of fibers called an axoneme. An axoneme contains a ring of 9 double \"microtubules\" surrounding two central single microtubules. Each outer doublet consists of a ring of 13 filaments (subfiber A) fused to an assembly of 10 filaments (subfiber B). The filaments of the microtubules are composedof two proteins called alpha and beta tubulin. The 11 microtubules forming an axoneme are held together by three types of connectors: subfibers A are joined to the central microtubules by radial spokes; adjacent outer doublets are joined by linkers of a highly elastic protein called nexin; and the central microtubules are joined by a connecting bridge. Finally, every subfiber A bears two arms, an inner arm and an outer arm, both containing a protein called dynein.\n \n But how does a cilium work? Experiments have shown that ciliary motion results from the chemically-powered \"walking\" of the dynein arms on one microtubule up a second microtubule so that the two microtubules slide past each other. The protein cross-links between microtubules in a cilium prevent neighboring microtubules from sliding past each other by more than a short distance. These cross-links, therefore, convert the dynein-induced sliding motion to a bending motion of the entire axoneme.\n \n Now, let us consider what this implies. What components are needed for a cilium to work? Ciliary motion certainly requires microtubules; otherwise, there would be no strands to slide. Additionally we require a motor, or else the microtubules of the cilium would lie stiff and motionless. Furthermore, we require linkers to tug on neighboring strands, converting the sliding motion into a bending motion, and preventing the structure from falling apart. All of these parts are required to perform one function: ciliary motion. Just as a mousetrap does not work unless all of its constituent parts are present, ciliary motion simply does not exist in the absence of microtubules, connectors, and motors. Therefore, we can conclude that the cilium is irreducibly complex; an enormous monkey wrench thrown into its presumed gradual, Darwinian evolution.\n \n Blood Clotting\n \n Now let's talk about a different biochemical system of blood clotting. Amusingly, the way in which the blood clotting system works is reminiscent of a Rube Goldberg machine.\n \n The name of Rube Goldberg; the great cartoonist who entertained America with his silly machines, lives on in our culture, but the man himself has pretty much faded from view. Here's a typical example of his humor. In this cartoon Goldberg imagined a system where water from a drain-pipe fills a flask, causing a cork with attached needle to rise and puncture a paper cup containing beer, which sprinkles on a bird. The intoxicated bird falls onto a spring, bounces up to a platform, and pulls a string thinking it's a worm. The string triggers a cannon which frightens a dog. The dog flips over, and his rapid breathing raises and lowers a scratcher over a mosquito bite, causing no embarrassment while talking to a lady.\n \n When you think about it for a moment you realize that the Rube Goldberg machine is irreducibly complex. It is a single system which is composed of several interacting parts, and where the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to break down. If the dog is missing the machine doesn't work; if the needle hasn't been put on the cork, the whole system is useless.\n \n It turns out that we all have Rube Goldberg in our blood. Here's a picture of a cell trapped in a clot. The meshwork is formed from a protein called fibrin. But what controls blood clotting? Why does blood clot when you cut yourself, but not at other times when a clot would cause a stroke or heart attack? Here's a diagram of what's called the blood clotting cascade. Let's go through just some of the reactions of clotting.\n \n When an animal is cut a protein called Hageman factor sticks to the surface of cells near the wound. Bound Hageman factor is then cleaved by a protein called HMK to yield activated Hageman factor. Immediately the activated Hageman factor converts another protein, called prekallikrein, to its active form, kallikrein. Kallikrein helps HMK speed up the conversion of more Hageman factor to its active form. Activated Hageman factor and HMK then together transform another protein, called PTA, to its active form. Activated PTA in turn, together with the activated form of another protein (discussed below) called convertin, switch a protein called Christmas factor to its active form. Activated Christmas factor, together with antihemophilic factor (which is itself activated by thrombin in a manner similar to that of proaccelerin) changes Stuart factor to its active form. Stuart factor,working with accelerin, converts prothrombin to thrombin. Finally thrombin cuts fibrinogen to give fibrin, which aggregates with other fibrin molecules to form the meshwork clot you saw in the last picture.\n \n Blood clotting requires extreme precision. When a pressurized blood circulation system is punctured, a clot must form quickly or the animal will bleed to death. On the other hand, if blood congeals at the wrong time or place, then the clot may block circulation as it does in heart attacks and strokes. Furthermore, a clot has to stop bleeding all along the length of the cut, sealing it completely. Yet blood clotting must be confined to the cut or the entire blood system of the animal might solidify, killing it. Consequently, clotting requires this enormously complex system so that the clot forms only when and only where it is required. Blood clotting is the ultimate Rube Goldberg machine.\n \n Detection of Design\n \n What's going on? Imagine a room in which a body lies crushed, flat as a pancake. A dozen detectives crawl around, examining the floor with magnifying glasses for any clue to the identity of the perpetrator. In the middle of the room next to the body stands a large, gray elephant. The detectives carefully avoid bumping into the pachyderm's legs as they crawl, and never even glance at it. Over time the detectives get frustrated with their lack of progress but resolutely press on, looking even more closely at the floor. You see, textbooks say detectives must \"get their man,\" so they never consider elephants.\n \n There is an elephant in the roomful of scientists who are trying to explain the development of life. The elephant is labeled \"intelligent design.\" To a person who does not feel obliged to restrict his search to unintelligent causes, the straightforward conclusion is that many biochemical systems were designed. They were designed not by the laws of nature, not by chance and necessity. Rather, they were planned. The designer knew what the systems would look like when they were completed; the designer took steps to bring the systems about. Life on earth at its most fundamental level, in its most critical components, is the product of intelligent activity.\n \n The conclusion of intelligent design flows naturally from the data itself, not from sacred books or sectarian beliefs. Inferring that biochemical systems were designed by an intelligent agent is a humdrum process that requires no new principles of logic or science. It comes simply from the hard work that biochemistry has done over the past forty years, combined with consideration of the way in which we reach conclusions of design every day.\n \n What is \"design\"? Design is simply the purposeful arrangement of parts. The scientific question is how we detect design. This can be done in various ways, but design can most easily be inferred for mechanical objects. While walking through a junkyard you might observe separated bolts and screws and bits of plastic and glass, most scattered, some piled on top of each other, some wedged together. Suppose you saw a pile that seemed particularly compact, and when you picked up a bar sticking out of the pile, the whole pile came along with it. When you pushed on the bar it slid smoothly to one side of the pile and pulled an attached chain along with it. The chain in turn yanked a gear which turned three other gears which turned a red-and-white striped rod, spinning it like a barber pole. You quickly conclude that the pile was not a chance accumulation of junk, but was designed, was put together in that order by an intelligent agent, because you see that the components of the system interact with great specificity to do something.\n \n It is not only artificial mechanical systems for which design can easily be concluded. Systems made entirely from natural components can also evince design. For example, suppose you are walking with a friend in the woods. All of a sudden your friend is pulled high in the air and left dangling by his foot from a vine attached to a tree branch. After cutting him down you reconstruct the trap. You see that the vine was wrapped around the tree branch, and the end pulled tightly down to the ground. It was securely anchored to the ground by a forked branch. The branch was attached to another vine, hidden by leaves so that, when the trigger-vine was disturbed, it would pull down the forked stick, releasing the spring-vine. The end of the vine formed a loop with a slipknot to grab an appendage and snap it up into the air. Even though the trap was made completely of natural materials you would quickly conclude that it was the product of intelligent design.Evidence for Intelligent Design from Biochemistry-- From a speech delivered at Discovery Institute's God & Culture Conference: Behe, Michael",

   "\n 1\n One tiny little problem. Everything you said here is true,\n\n \n Oh, would that all problems were that simple!\n \n \n I actually agree with your reworded statement except for the part where you say 'framework'. I used the word 'being' because being does not mean something that is personal or something that is impersonal or something that is a God or not or anything like that. All being means is SOMETHING THAT EXISTS! The word being is very ambigious because we both said that we don't know exactly what it is that is out there, but you kinda turned around and changed your mind by saying you do know what it is, and that it is a framework. For someone against leaps over logic, you did it yourself. The word 'framework' is much more specific than the word 'being' and so I would ask that you provide some sort of backing for your claim that this being is a framework. \n\n \n Well, that is why I used an impersonal word, because to me, at any rate, \"a being\" does imply something with personality. At least in the English I am familiar with. And there is no reason to infer personality to a first cause, even if we insist there has to be one. If you don't like \"framework\", then substitute \"thing\". \n \n \n2\n Well, Lesz, create just means to bring into existence, to make, or to cause... which is what we both are talking about (webster.com)\n\n \n And it also happens to be a word we find in bibles and pulpits a lot. No coincidence there, I think. \"Creation\" implies a creative and purposeful intelligence. Again, even if we insist on a first cause that is separate from the rest of the universe, there is no logical reason to impute purpose or intelligence to it that I can think of. All I am really trying to do is avoid loaded language. \"Framework\" or \"cause\" aren't theologically or philosophically loaded so far as I can see. But if you are arguing that only \"being\" and \"creation\" will do, then we have a problem.\n \n \nSo you can use the word cause, fine its the same idea. As for your word 'being' it just means something that exists... the word you chose instead was 'framework' which is actually a huge leap from 'being' into specifity. I thought just a moment ago you were talking about how we cannot know anything about the cause? And now your telling me it's a framework?\n\n \n Call it \"thing\", I don't mind. I just meant an all-encompassing something that \"framed\" everything else, like the box around the ball. Of course, there may be no box, hence no framework.\n \n \n3\n Actually yes, I did like that, because it was only reiterating what I had said before. The universe is all that exists, and therefore IF God existed, he would be part of the universe. But why bring up this dead issue? I already said we're dealing with some being, not necessarily God. And yes, this being would be part of the universe.... but the being could not be part of the finite universe (like you said our solar system, remember?) I'm saying this being is the infinite part of the universe and is NOT part of the FINITE universe. Again, your not making the distinction as you were doing so before, and its butchering the issue.\n\n \n Well, I don't insist a first cause has to be infinite, either. It just has to jump-start the expansion of the universe we see. The infinity bit I see as just a trick of logic. Maybe it makes sense to think of it as infinite, maybe it doesn't. Or maybe a universe is perfectly capable of jump-starting itself. I just do not know, and neither do you or anyone else.\n \n Call me agnostic on the issue of first origins! ;) I'm just chatting over the possibilities here, not making a hard and fast argument for one view over another.",

   "I would prefer the term 'thing', because 'being' implies (to me, at least) life of some sort. But that's just semantics.\n \n No problem. Will Wikipedia do?\n The Electromagnetic interaction.\n \n Essentially, all 'everyday' forces are caused by electromagnetic repulsion between the electrons surrounding atoms. If I push a wall, the atoms in my hand don't 'bounce off' the atoms in the wall - as they get very close, electromagnetic repulsion simply becomes great enough to keep the two atoms separate. As e/m force is mediated by exchange of photons/virtual photons, this would happen at the speed of light.\n \n \n Apologies. I'm a physics graduate, I sometimes use colloquialisms that can be misunderstood without the relevant knowledge.\n What I meant to say was that the particles governing the interaction that we perceive as 'force' move at the speed of light. To analogise: your hand 'pushes' the wall. To do this, your hand shoots out millions of virtual photons at the speed of light, which cross the gap between your hand and the wall and 'push' it away. Simultaneously, the wall shoots out millions of it's own virtual photons, which push your hand away once they have reached it.\n \n There is a gap between you pushing the wall and the wall 'felling' the force - this time gap is equal to [the distance from your hand to the wall]/[the speed of light]\n\n \n I'm assuming you know Einstein's theory of special relativity (probably better than me). The closer something approaches the speed of light, the slower it experiences time. So in fact, if something could go the speed of light, no time elapses for that thing's frame of reference (theoretically, nothing can exceed the speed of light). If the particles are really the actual agents in this causal action, and they are boosting at the speed of light, then there is no time elapsing for the particles in their causal action. It looks as if this is causality happening without an elapsation of time, no?",

   "This is a cop out in order to avoid dealing with the larger issue at hand peeling. Here it is explained by Paul Davies, an astrophysicist I'm sure you respect. And he opposes your opinion so exactly, it's as if you sat side by side with that goal in mind.\n\n Except... he agrees with me exactly! Do you really not see that?\n \nOne evasive tactic is to claim that the universe didn't have a beginning, that it has existed for all eternity. Unfortunately, there are many scientific reasons why this obvious idea is unsound. For starters, given an infinite amount of time, anything that can happen will already have happened, for if a physical process is likely to occur with a certain nonzero probability-however small-then given an infinite amount of time the process must occur, with probability one. By now, the universe should have reached some sort of final state in which all possible physical processes have run their course.\n\n This is a rejigging of Mr.Michael's argument regarding the impossibility of a universe in which time extends infinitely into the past from here. I actually don't like his version as much, and here's why: he says that given an infinite amount of time, anything that can happen will already have happened - so it can't be happening now. Except - he's just used the fact that 'now' happened to prove that 'now' can't be happening :) I might write to him about that.\n \n Anyway, that's interesting but not really relevant. What he's saying, and I agree and have done all along is that the universe's past, the timeline of events within it to this point, is not infinite. What he goes on to say is this:\n \nSo we are faced with the problem of what happened beforehand to trigger the big bang. Journalists love to taunt scientists with this question when they complain about the money being spent on science. Actually, the answer (in my opinion) was spotted a long time ago, by one Augustine of Hippo, a Christian saint who lived in the fifth century. But Augustine was more subtle. The world, he claimed, was made \"not in time, but simultaneously with time.\" \n In other words, the origin of the universe-what we now call the big bang-was not simply the sudden appearance of matter in an eternally preexisting void, but the coming into being of time itself. Time began with the cosmic origin. There was no \"before,\" no endless ocean of time for a god, or a physical process, to wear itself out in infinite preparation. \n\n That's exactly the scenario I've been describing:\n \nYou're still hung up on the universe appearing, being not-there and then there. Why should we assume that's correct? Remember: the big bang is not the universe coming into existence: it is just one end of one of its dimensions, namely time.\n\n Do you understand? The universe didn't begin its existence at the big bang any more than a car begins its existence at the rear bumper: the rear bumper is just one end of its physical form, just as the big bang is one end of the universe's space-time form.\n \nHow does it make you feel to know that modern science agrees with the conclusions arrived at by a 5th century christian? It tells me that with all of our gadgets and theories, we haven't gone much beyond confirming what has long since been known by early man.\n\n Oh, I wouldn't say the intervening years have been wasted, as such ;)\n \n I get the impression I'm supposed to be upset by this information, which is saddening because it demonstrates how badly I've failed in conveying my way of thinking to you. I don't think ideas have to be wrong just because they're old, or because they come from someone with different religious beliefs to myself. All credit to the saint in question.\n \nYou always assume that because I disagree with you that I don't understand the theory.\n\n I never assume; I only ever go by what you post here. And in this case it's not about misunderstanding a theory, it's about quoting an outdated article.\n \n What I am saying is that we obviously require different thresholds of evidence in order to accept the results. The problem is that I'm not alone in my skepticism regarding the claims regarding these unseen forms of energy and matter.\n Since there is no experimental or observable evidence that dark matter exists, is it just a prop for the beleaguered big bang theory?\n\n That article was written in February 2006. The first direct observations of Dark Matter were made in august of that year.\n \n(I did not contradict myself when I admitted uncertainty as to how first life came to exist, while being sure that early life was microbial and evolution proceeded from there) Semantics.\n \n Well, since semantics is the study of meaning in communication, I suppose you're right :) The meaning of what I said was not what you construed it to be: I did not contradict myself. Thanks for the apology though emoticon_rolleyes\n \nyou accept these vague theories as rational and reasonable results when you have no absolute evidence to support them.\n\n True, true - there's never any absolute evidence of anything. So I guess I'll have to make do with a nested hierarchy of living forms, genetic, phenotypic and developmental atavisms, observable speciation, and a three billion year tree of life stamped into the earth's crust :)\n \n \nI think? I'm speaking about what your science claims. None of this is what I personally believe occurred. But I'm debating this using your scientific assumption, yet you still argue against them when it serves your purpose. Here's a clip from a show that is dealing with this question according to current scientific theory.\n YouTube - 1of6 -- Origins - How Life Began\n\n So you say the earth was hostile to life at the time early life was around, and back that up with a video saying the earth was violent and inhospitable to modern forms of life over two billion years earlier? What possible relevance does that have?\n \n(first life wouldn't have had the complex biological mechanisms to perceive and respond to threats) But isn't survival of the fittest like the first law of random mutation by way of natural selection? Are you again contradicting one law in order to promote another unanswerable part of your flawed theory?\n\n Erm... no. Please, just think: when first life emerged - regardless of how crappy and primitive and defenceless it would seem today, which would be the fittest organism on the planet? That's right: it would be. The evolutionary arms race began at a crawl, as it were.\n \nI am looking for consistency peeling, yet you go to and fro, back and forth with opposing laws depending on which aspect of this pseudo science we are discussing at the time. \n\n I hate to appear rude but the only inconsistency evident here is in your application of logic. You've jumped to a snap decision that first life would have torn itself apart before it could have evolved, and you like that idea so much that you simply will not think critically about it.\n \nTo expand my point, how did these original microbial organisms survive in such a violent and inhospitable world if they had no defenses against invading microbes?\n\n Against WHAT invading microbes? I mean, come on; at least parse your own sentences!\n \nI disagree completely. Based on your beliefs of natural selection, the assumption is just that. The stronger microbes consumed and destroyed the weaker ones in order to survive and grow. What was their option? To consume lava and sulphuric acid in the atmosphere?\n\n AA, this is getting beyond a joke. \n \n First of all, natural selection involves competition for resources. Those resources might be sunlight, water - anything in finite supply. Where predators and prey are involved, natural selection is not predators wiping out and supplanting their prey, it is predators weeding out the weakest prey, and prey weeding out the weakest predators. So, for the umpteenth time, something you believe about what evolutionary theory says is wrong.\n \n Next, does it really make the slightest bit of sense to propose a biosphere in which there is one kind of organism which only has itself to eat in order to survive and reproduce? Starting with one of them, how would you ever get two?\n \n Finally, you express incredulity that life could thrive by processing naturally occurring raw materials (non-life). Leaving aside little things like - oh, plants - and focusing exclusively upon microbial life, there are all kinds of anaerobic bacteria even today in our oxygen-rich world, busily processing sulphates, iron - you name it, really. Photosynthesis proceeds perfectly happily without the need to consume other organisms or their products. \n \nThis is so naive, I don't even know where to start with it. You're saying that Oxygen, the fuel which feeds the life of a carbon based world is more corrosive than the gasses, lava fields, volcanoes and acids which defined this planets atmosphere and environment back then? According to your own science, it wasn't until oxygen replaced these conditions that life multiplied, diversified and prospered.\n\n Oxygen doesn't fuel plants or algae; it's a waste product of theirs. It's lethal to many kinds of bacteria. It's toxic to humans at high concentrations (an oxygen tent, for instance, is nothing of the sort) and lethal if concentrated at high pressures. Isn't it naive not to know that sort of thing, before speaking out on the subject?\n \n The reason life could diversify when free oxygen became widely available is, IIRC, that it's a better oxident than those previously present, making higher-energy processes possible.",

   "Your reasoning leads you to believe the universe created itself?\n How can the big bang be it's own cause? For it to cause itself would mean it would have to be before it is. The big bang would have to already exist in order to cause itself to exist. Thats contradictory.\n On the other hand, if 'nothing caused the big bang' then that is just as logically incoherent, since \"nothing\" has no power to do anything (even the big bang), it does not even exist. \n\n Firstly, I don't know how the universe was created. We're discussing probabilities and potential, not belief. Personally, I find the view offered by string theory amongst the most appealing, because it explains (amongst other things) 'fine tuning' in a novel way - and the 'string theory' answer is one variant on the 'thing/being/entity that overarches the universe' answer. However, the other solutions are equally viable, which is why we are discussing them. My reasoning leads me to believe that 'the big bang was it's own cause' is just as valid an answer - and as logical - as any other.\n \n Your objection to this answer ignores entriely your own argument from the last few posts - that causality can be instantanious. Bear in mind, also, that at the instance of the big bang it was (probably) a 'singularity', which greatly eases the issues with instantanious causation - with all matter at one point, a causal action would not have to travel any distance in order to take effect, so it circumvents the speed-of-light problem.\n \n You have two choices. Either causation is time-dependant, or it can be instantanious. If it can be instantanious then the big bang could (possibly) be 'its own cause'. If casuality is time-dependent, then the question makes no sense, because there was no time before the big bang for there to be a cause.\n \n \nThe idea of causality coming into being at the same instant as time is very misleading. Causality isn't a being in the sense that it embodies form, it would be more accurate to say that causality happens rather than comes to exist. Now, the big bang is an instance of causality happening, and the first state of universe comes to be. As a result of this, 'time' comes to be as well.

This means that we have no guarentee that causality is omnipresent in all situations - and the situations surrounding the Big Bang are pretty extreme. The principle 'causality' is \"cause and effect\" - we have an effect, but it's only causality that demands a cause - and as you say, causality is just an explanation for something that has been observed - it doesn't 'exist' per se. You're trying to apply a scientific construct to a situation where 'normal' science (for example, the presence of time and space) doesn't apply - why should causality be any different?",

If time is measured by distances travelled by objects, and any motion that happens deals with causality.. then wouldn't time depend on causality? The first causal happening was the BB, and this happening involved motion and thus time followed as a result, co-incidentally. I realize that this is similar to time and causality being instantanious, but I'm speaking of dependence in terms of hierarchy. Motion and time would then happen instantanously with the causal action, but the causal action would precede in this certain sense. Time and space and motion could never come to be unless a causal action took place. Without the universe or the big bang, causality would only have the potential of happening. When the 'potential' turns to a an actual kinetic causal action, motion and time proceed from it, and we call this the BB.

The question is whether the valid conclusion is true of the real world, because any argument, no matter how solid logically, is only as good as its premises. All of its premises, hidden as well as acknowleded ones.\n \n Thus empirical testing of premises and conclusions allows one to place more reliance on an argument. It's all matter of degree of confidence. Propositions in mathematics can be rigorously proven or disprove, at least much of the time. The origin of the universe is not a simple proposition in mathematics, no matter that some might like to think so. While I don't doubt it followed (or follows, if our friend Peeling is correct in his supposition that the universe coexists at al points of time and space) mathematical laws that have their own logic, what are they?\n \n I do not think one can deduce them from a process of logical ratiocination.

Or if you count up integers, you will never, ever reach an end, because you can always add just one more. Where did the integers start? Not at zero, because we can have negative integers. Infinity in both directions.\n \n What about Zeno's paradox? To understand that, you have to take into consideration that the arrow is moving at a fixed forward velocity (ignoring air friction). Although you can argue that it keeps travelling only half the distance, that would be to argue that it is traversing an asymptote to its target, that it can get ever closer, but never quite reach it. (Again, there examples in nature of this sort of behaviour, in biochemistry.) But that would be to ignore that it is travelling at a fixed velocity. If it were never to reach its target, then it would have to approach a speed of zero, and that is physically impossible until it contacts its target.

   "But you still have an infinite number of numbers betwee 0 and 1. Or if you count up integers, you will never, ever reach an end, because you can always add just one more. Where did the integers start? Not at zero, because we can have negative integers. Infinity in both directions.\n \n What about Zeno's paradox? To understand that, you have to take into consideration that the arrow is moving at a fixed forward velocity (ignoring air friction). Although you can argue that it keeps travelling only half the distance, that would be to argue that it is traversing an asymptote to its target, that it can get ever closer, but never quite reach it. (Again, there examples in nature of this sort of behaviour, in biochemistry.) But that would be to ignore that it is travelling at a fixed velocity. If it were never to reach its target, then it would have to approach a speed of zero, and that is physically impossible until it contacts its target. So Zeno's paradox is actually a contradiction in physics. Thinking about it in terms of repeatedly covering half the distance is to entertain a physical impossibility. The arrow must reach its target, because it cannot throw away its energy and slow down.\n \n However, I don't see this analogy applying to the universe. If the universe is self-starting, then nothing existed before or outside it. In which case, nothing created it -- it must have generated itself. As for us, we are only a part of the picture. .\n\n \n Okay, then you agree with me that the universe started. Then what are you arguing? I though Peeling was saying that the universe was finite but never started (because it is unbounded).\n \n \n\n Well, think of us as an arc in a circle, or a patch on a sphere. THAT has bounds, though what it is contained in does not. We are only here for a brief flicker of a candle. The universe has experienced eternities we canot hope to know.\n\n \n Aah, very interesting. But what are we talking about when we say that the universe created itself. Was it the sphere/circle that created itself, or was it the patch/arc on the sphere/circle that created itself?",

I'm just trying out various ideas to see where they might lead. Maybe the universe had a beginning, maybe it always existed in some sense in that there can be no before or after. Perhaps it does make more sense to think of it in a Zen sort of way, rather than Western Greek. I don't know. What I do suggest is that it's wise not to invest too much emotional capital in any one idea, at this stage in the growth of our knowledge.\n \n Now personally, I lean towards the notion that the part of the universe we observe had a beginning, but that it's just a fraction of something much ... well, more extensive or complex in space-time, and I am willing to entertain the notion that this something may ramify out to some space-time inifinity.

   "Hi michael,\n That's exactly what he's saying, yes. But his definition of the universe is a ball which someone continuously circles and eventually comes back to where they started, only to continue on eternally around the universal ball again and again with maybe a 1 degree variation each new rotation. He is purposely not considering the possibility of going from one end of the universe to another. That is the fallacy of his argument for the sake of this debate. \n\n Actually, AA, I wasn't talking about a circular universe. Someone else chipped in with that when I mentioned 'unbounded'.\n \nBut he is not considering the linear route through the universe which from that perspective definitely has a beginning and an end.\n\n I am considering a linear route :) And as I said, a linear route of finite length may nevertheless have no beginning or end.\n \n Consider the example I've supplied several times now: the set of real (decimal) numbers between 0 and 10 exclusive. Every number in that set is certainly finite, yes? Because every number is between 0 and 10. So, all you have to do to prove your belief that it must have a beginning and an end is to tell me what they are: give me the largest and smallest number in the set.",

   "1. I do not agree with this premise either, to believe everything has a cause leads to absurd conclusions. The law of causality however is more of an extensions of the law of contradiction, because the notion of 'effect' carries with it in its definition the notion of a cause . . it is analytically true. The premise is that every effect has a cause, and iangb was speaking contradictions when he denied this.\n \n 2. the statement \"has no known cause\" and \"has no cause\" are completely different. How am I to understand when you say \"has no (known) cause\"? If the cause is merely not known, then all that means is that we do not know WHAT caused the decay.. but we can still hold THAT the decay was still caused. But to say there there is no cause at all is denying there is a reason behind the decay... think about it ... if there was no reason behind it or reason to explain it, then it is without reason ... it is unreasonable.\n\n \n There's no way to know the difference between \"no cause\" and \"no known cause\" (this would be analogous to 'proving a negative.') but these events seem to happen completely at random, with no cause or reason.",

   "lesz, if your talking about the universe being the entirety of existence, than of course something infinite has to be within the entirety of existence, because going from non-existence to existence without anything causing it, would be an uncaused effect (which is a contradiction in terms). The physical or created universe is that which is finite, and a metaphysical \"something\" has to be the infinite part of the entirety of existence, in order to account for how the finite part came to be. Again, the idea of an infinite past for the universe infers that there had to be an infinite number of actual beings in the past that had to be before we beings could come to be, whereas God is only ONE being. This is where it is fatal to the infinite universe theory and can't be turned over on God, infinitely many beings transpiring through history to the present is contradictory but one being is not.\n\n \n I think I've pinpointed the beginning of your errors. You are the one asserting that the Big Bang was an effect. This is a circular argument, because if it wasn't caused, then it wasn't an effect, now was it?\n \n Also the whole argument here you make doesn't make much sense.

   "When read in its context, I said rational reasoning based on intuition and go on to say that quantum mechanics is unintuitive. It is clear that rational reasoning based on what our brains are hardwired to perceive flies in the face of what experimental evidence is telling us must be true in the quantum world. That is why you must abandon intuitive reasoning in this case. While your conclusions may be completely rational to your normal way of thinking, they are not necessarily leading you in the right direction.\n\n \n These are some very bold claims to be making about an area of physics that is heavily disputed and still has much more to be explored. There is a difference between something being unintuitive and something being unreasonable or illogical. Take the double slit experiment, the behavior of particles and electrons is indeed elusive and unintuitive, but nothing about the results of such experiments violates any rules of logic (like the law of identity or the excluded middle) what the experimental data flies in the face of is the models and theories that were previously thought. It would be more accurate to say that quantum physics challenges our intuitive thinking. I would think that shining a laser through a tiny slit would cause the laser's projection on a screen to thin out, but the projection in fact widens. This is very unintuitive to what we are used to in every day life, but again, this does not eliminate THAT there are causes or reasons in the quantum world... it only changes WHAT those causes or reasons are. It is unwise to claim things move without cause just because the cause is not visible. How visible is gravity? Can we conclude that some particles move without cause since those causes are not observed? It is only in the interpretations of experimental data that scholars throw 'cause and effect' out the window. It would be more intellectually honest to say that quantum movement is inexplicable to us at least, at this time and that we do not know what the reasons are, rather than to say it is unknowable in its nature or it has no reason.",

Well, the usual way this is presented is that the physical universe as we know it, is finite, that is it wasn't always existing.

I pose that it is the limitedness and contingency of the physical universe as we know it that points to an outside cause. \n \n The Big Bang is an answer, but not a complete one.

These laws guide our reasoning of which science itself is founded upon. \n\n What easy feels when he reads the bible, I feel when I read that; thank you.\n \n \nNow, does the idea of something behaving like a particle in one instance and then behaving like a wave in another instance violate any of these laws of logic? No, I don't see that at all. What about the fact that this something has a dual nature? Is this illogical or unreasonable? No. This idea is very strange yes, and it is like nothing we experience in our daily life, but it isn't contradictory. I say this to point out that although something may be unintuitive, does not mean it be illogical. I don't understand why you are trying to convince me that quantum physics is unintuitive; I'm convinced. But logical thought should certainly still guide the research shouldn't it?\n\n Bravo! Yes you are of course right. A man who claims he has to abandon reason in pursuit of the truth is a variant on the theme of Delphi. Anyone who claims that quantum mechanics or any other field of study defies human logic has branded that field as mysticism and claimed it is not science.\n \n \nLook again at the double slit experiment. This 'something' behaves like a particle when hitting the wall, but when slits are placed in such a way that it passes through the slits, it then behaves like a wave. Here we see that the slits were at least some kind of a cause of the 'something' behaving like a wave right? Isn't this an example of cause and effect in the quantum world? I'm not saying I know HOW it was caused, merely THAT it was caused. Therefore, it would seem to me that throwing cause and effect out the window when studying the quantum world would be a bit premature to say the least, and unfounded at worst.\n\n I would say impossible, as I stated above causality is a law that is based off of more than just 'how things typically go'. Opposing it is basically assuming that there is a function which is neither constant nor changing.",

   "I see what your saying, if you agree with an effect needing to have a cause by definition, then it is indeed begging the question. The forum member I was talking to before would not allow that 'effects needed causes' though, I didn't get why, but I apologize nonetheless. So the question is still on the table about the Big Bang, is it an effect? Well, the usual way this is presented is that the physical universe as we know it, is finite, that is it wasn't always existing. So because of these characteristics of contingency, one would ask how the universe came to be. I pose that it is the limitedness and contingency of the physical universe as we know it that points to an outside cause. \n \n The Big Bang is an answer, but not a complete one. The Big Bang isn't itself something that exists (has form or being) it is an event, and events are interactions of things that do exist or have form or being. Dictionary.com definition 2 of the nouns states it like this.\n \n 2. The outcome, issue, or result of anything\n \n I think you can see that this is just another way of saying effect. So really when people claim the Big Bang, they are (whether they know it or not) claiming an event, and hence claiming a cause. Unless of course they would deny that the Big Bang is an event, which would be quite bizarre. I then would require some clarification on their part to describe just what they think the Big Bang is.\n\n \n It is an event. I was simply arguing that the Big Bang wasn't necessarily caused by anything (or no more so than a 'random' quantum event). Personally, I think it is most likely that something external did cause it, but there's no real evidence either way.",

If you can't understand what I am saying, you probably need to abandon scientific reasoning and pick up philosophy, it seems to me you are rooted more in that area anyway.\n \n \n\n \n 1. Time is a measurement of change, a system used to compare events. If time measures change, and if things were unchanging, the measurement system would not be applicable, time would read a zero because no change occurs; timeless. However, if things do change (causality), time (a measurment system for those changes) becomes possible. Time is indeed dependent on change, on causality. \n \n The only reason 'time flows forward' (this sounds idiomatic) so to speak, is because causality is pushing it right along (my idiomatic response). \n \n 2. A perfect example of the law of the exluded middle, this is a very logical statement: either there is something, or there is nothing. Agreed.\n \n 3. It is here Databed that you speak contradictions. Lets analyze what your saying here; \"Nothing at all (you mean 'no cause at all') suggests pure spontaneity behind the Big Bang.\" What does spontaneous mean? (spontaneity is the state of being spontaneous) I looked it up and found the major definitions all saying something to the like of \n 'arising from internal forces or causes; self-acting' \n If this is what you mean then you are saying the physical universe as we know did not come about by something that caused it but rather arose from internal forces; it caused itself. Surely you see the contradiction here, it is impossible for the universe, the big bang, or anything for that matter to cause itself into existence, to create itself. That would mean it would have to exist before it was, which means it already existed in the first place when it was creating itself. Basically saying it would have to be and not be at the same time and in the same respect; contradiction.\n However, you might be using the definition found on webster, the 6th one down which says:\n 'not apparently contrived or manipulated' this is just another way of saying 'not caused'\n But this is quite redundant don't you think? To say \"[No cause at all] suggests no cause at all behind the Big Bang\" is either circular reasoning or begging the question.\n \n 4. I understand you loud and clear, you don't think a cause is necessary, I'm trying to tell you it is. Please understand this, I am using reason and logic to show these things, reason and logic are the shoulders upon which the science and physics you are using stand! If you attack that, your attacking your own science and physics, and all your arguments would crumble under their own weight. I am not communicating something that is too hard to understand (this ain't philosophical jargon), it is very basic and straightforward, and in fact much more foundational. If your 'scientific' theories do not hold up under these rules of logic, then you need to change those theories so that they do not violate those rules; it is not the other way around. Again, since reason and logic are the building blocks for science, then you really should have no problem with me communicating to you in this way.\n \n 5. On a side note, I don't like philosophy, it bores me. There are however intersections in the fields of physics, mathematics and philosophy (like logic for example), but my real enjoyment is in mathematics.",

   "1. Time is a measurement of change, a system used to compare events. If time measures change, and if things were unchanging, the measurement system would not be applicable, time would read a zero because no change occurs; timeless. However, if things do change (causality), time (a measurment system for those changes) becomes possible. Time is indeed dependent on change, on causality. \n \n The only reason 'time flows forward' (this sounds idiomatic) so to speak, is because causality is pushing it right along (my idiomatic response). \n \n 2. A perfect example of the law of the exluded middle, this is a very logical statement: either there is something, or there is nothing. Agreed.\n \n 3. It is here Databed that you speak contradictions. Lets analyze what your saying here; \"Nothing at all (you mean 'no cause at all') suggests pure spontaneity behind the Big Bang.\" What does spontaneous mean? (spontaneity is the state of being spontaneous) I looked it up and found the major definitions all saying something to the like of \n 'arising from internal forces or causes; self-acting' \n If this is what you mean then you are saying the physical universe as we know did not come about by something that caused it but rather arose from internal forces; it caused itself. Surely you see the contradiction here, it is impossible for the universe, the big bang, or anything for that matter to cause itself into existence, to create itself. That would mean it would have to exist before it was, which means it already existed in the first place when it was creating itself. Basically saying it would have to be and not be at the same time and in the same respect; contradiction.\n However, you might be using the definition found on webster, the 6th one down which says:\n 'not apparently contrived or manipulated' this is just another way of saying 'not caused'\n But this is quite redundant don't you think? To say \"[No cause at all] suggests no cause at all behind the Big Bang\" is either circular reasoning or begging the question.\n \n 4. I understand you loud and clear, you don't think a cause is necessary, I'm trying to tell you it is. Please understand this, I am using reason and logic to show these things, reason and logic are the shoulders upon which the science and physics you are using stand! If you attack that, your attacking your own science and physics, and all your arguments would crumble under their own weight. I am not communicating something that is too hard to understand (this ain't philosophical jargon), it is very basic and straightforward, and in fact much more foundational. If your 'scientific' theories do not hold up under these rules of logic, then you need to change those theories so that they do not violate those rules; it is not the other way around. Again, since reason and logic are the building blocks for science, then you really should have no problem with me communicating to you in this way.\n \n 5. On a side note, I don't like philosophy, it bores me. There are however intersections in the fields of physics, mathematics and philosophy (like logic for example), but my real enjoyment is in mathematics.\n\n \n \n If mathematics is your interest, you should really look into theoretical physics. It is hypothetical yes, but very math driven and hopefully testable. Many of the concepts I am trying to convey have been discovered/modeled mathematically. Many others have been ruled out mathematically. Not my area of expertise, but I like reading into it. \n \n I am surprised that someone into math would deny the ideas I am trying to push. A mathematician that strives to explain the universe is going to be the person who eventually figures it all out. I doubt it can be done with rational reasoning and observation alone.",

   "\n 1. The Big Bang was not some normal event. If the Big Bang was the beginning of time (as we have some reason to believe), then there very well could be no cause (at least not a knowable cause).\n \n 2. And if you want to ignore quantum mechanics causelessness and say that we just don't yet know the cause (as opposed to the currently accepted hypothesis that quantum randomness is uncaused), then that's fine\n \n 3. but until there is some evidence that would suggest that there is a cause, it's just your opinion, and based on nothing.\n \n 4. Actions at the quantum level, which is likely the stage that the Big Bang was at in its earliest stages, do not follow classical cause and effect 'laws' and do not behave like everything else. \n \n\n \n 1. You say that if the Big Bang was the beginning of time then this means there wasn't necessarily a cause, but this is not true in the least. Time is a measurement system for change (cause and effect) and if there is no change to measure, there is no time. This means time is dependent on change, not the other way around. \n \n \n 2. But the quantum world DOES have causality (from JJ Thompsons experiment, to the particle accelerators of today). I mean if it weren't for the electron behaving by the principle of causality for example, we would have never known it existed in the first place. If a majority of the physicists in the field of quantum mechanics agree on something, it doesn't make it true (it does cause me to notice it though, and take special consideration of it). But it doesn't matter how many people believe that something can come from nothing by itself, if it doesn't hold up to the laws of logic and reason it is illogical and unreasonable. Look, I understand that there are many physicists that make statements which communicate that they think the universe exploded into being out of nothing, but the sad part is that they get away with statements like this unchallenged! Many people believe it simply because these physicists get away with it; its credulity.\n \n 3.What? Think about this for a second. If the big bang was caused by nothing, then there is no reason behind it ... it is itself based on nothing ... it is without reason; unreasonable. Your saying that the Big Bang itself might be based on nothing, and then on the other hand say that my 'opinion' (which is based on reason and logic) is based on nothing. What gives? It seems, you think that a viable option is that the Big Bang just happened, and thats it; no cause no reason .. based on nothing. \n \n 4. I agree with this... but you misunderstand, I'm not arguing from the perspective of classical cause and effect laws (this would be Newton's laws of motion) I am arguing from the perspective of reason and logic. Allow me to explain. Classical physics states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. This is Newtons attempt to describe how causal relationships happen in the (macro)world, but do not confuse it with the actual law of causality. Lets say that it is observed that one action may produce an unequal and/or a non-opposite reaction, if this phenomenon is observed to occur then Newton's classical law of motion does not apply, however, the actual law of causality is still retained. Do you see? The action (or the cause) produced an effect; cause and effect. It might be that the reaction was not equal and/or opposite to the action (don't know HOW it happened), but it was a reaction nontheless (do know THAT it happened); causality. To throw out causality all-together just because classical physics does not apply would be to throw the baby out with the bath water.",

   "1. You say that if the Big Bang was the beginning of time then this means there wasn't necessarily a cause, but this is not true in the least. Time is a measurement system for change (cause and effect) and if there is no change to measure, there is no time. This means time is dependent on change, not the other way around. \n\n \n Change isn't dependent on time? I think it goes both ways, and I also don't think it matters. If there was nothing before the big bang (that is, if everything, including time, space, and matter, originated in the big bang), and nothing existed outside of it, then there is no possibility for a cause. Because if nothing existed before, there could be no prior thing to cause it. \n \n \n2. But the quantum world DOES have causality (from JJ Thompsons experiment, to the particle accelerators of today). I mean if it weren't for the electron behaving by the principle of causality for example, we would have never known it existed in the first place. If a majority of the physicists in the field of quantum mechanics agree on something, it doesn't make it true (it does cause me to notice it though, and take special consideration of it). But it doesn't matter how many people believe that something can come from nothing by itself, if it doesn't hold up to the laws of logic and reason it is illogical and unreasonable. Look, I understand that there are many physicists that make statements which communicate that they think the universe exploded into being out of nothing, but the sad part is that they get away with statements like this unchallenged! Many people believe it simply because these physicists get away with it; its credulity.\n\n \n Yeah, particles can collide and deflect. But when it comes to radioactive decay, quantum fluctuations, and uncertainty in general, cause and effect don't seem to hold up. \n \n \n3.What? Think about this for a second. If the big bang was caused by nothing, then there is no reason behind it ... it is itself based on nothing ... it is without reason; unreasonable. Your saying that the Big Bang itself might be based on nothing, and then on the other hand say that my 'opinion' (which is based on reason and logic) is based on nothing. What gives? It seems, you think that a viable option is that the Big Bang just happened, and thats it; no cause no reason .. based on nothing. \n\n \n It would be unreasonable to assert that it is uncaused just as it is unreasonable for anyone to assert that they know it was caused or what caused it. But maybe it is reasonable to accept that the universe might be unreasonable. Here's a paper on the subject from a guy who has been arguing for the uncaused universe for a long time. There really isn't much more to say about the subject than what I've said and what this paper has. \n \n The Uncaused Beginning of the Universe \n \n Simply put, I think quantum mechanics makes it possible, and since you don't accept acausality in quantum physics, you don't. Not much more to say. You get as philosophical as you like, but when I look at the data and see what is written about it, acausality seems to be very reasonable.\n \n \n4. I agree with this... but you misunderstand, I'm not arguing from the perspective of classical cause and effect laws (this would be Newton's laws of motion) I am arguing from the perspective of reason and logic. Allow me to explain. Classical physics states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. This is Newtons attempt to describe how causal relationships happen in the (macro)world, but do not confuse it with the actual law of causality. Lets say that it is observed that one action may produce an unequal and/or a non-opposite reaction, if this phenomenon is observed to occur then Newton's classical law of motion does not apply, however, the actual law of causality is still retained. Do you see? The action (or the cause) produced an effect; cause and effect. It might be that the reaction was not equal and/or opposite to the action (don't know HOW it happened), but it was a reaction nontheless (do know THAT it happened); causality. To throw out causality all-together just because classical physics does not apply would be to throw the baby out with the bath water.\n\n \n Yeah, I don't buy this. What action/cause in quantum mechanics is causing the Casimir effect? What allows one particle to be in multiple places at once? What allows quantum tunneling? Yeah, causality is law when it comes to the macroscopic, but the micro is a whole 'nother can of worms.",

If you remember stoichiometry every unit in those equations was a dimension, our math can handle an unlimited number and our minds can directly handle at least 10 (personal experience). That we cannot visualize more than three spatial dimensions is not surprising as our brains would never need to have machinery to do that. We can however model it just as easily as we model other dimensions provided we know the relationship. I know many people who are confused because they try to imagine four dimensional space and they cannot. There are tricks to doing so that could help if you need to, for instance imagine 3d space and add a dimension by imagining each point has a color, and that different colors are different values on this forth spatial dimension, although I have rarely had to use this trick to think about anything as straight math is much more trustworthy than intuition.\n \n \nHaha, just read through that again to make sure I wasn't crazy, Freedom.

For the atoms in the sun to overcome the strong nuclear force and allow for hydrogen fusion, the temperature needs to be around 10 billion degrees K. The sun's temperature, though, is only about 15 million degrees K... The gravity that is crushing these atoms (and causing the heat) is putting the hydrogen nuclei into a very tiny box, which severely limits where the protons can be found (meaning the momentum and position don't have a lot of options here). Because of this, the uncertainty principle allows protons to jump out of the nucleus in what is know as tunneling. Without the uncertainty principle, the sun wouldn't shine at all. \n \n It doesn't matter that there is no observer in the middle of the sun to see it, it is the simple principle that causes these particles to act sporadically.",

I'm not really sure with the conservation of energy thing. I've always kind of thought of the fluctuations as being within a 'margin of error' allowed by the uncertainty principle, even though I'm pretty sure that's an inaccurate view. I'm also not sure how the particle/anti-particle dynamic really works, and if that cancels out the effects.\n \n With the quantum fluctuation to Big Bang thing, I guess the answer would be that it wasn't observed? I really don't know. It's just a pretty wild hypothesis, and I (and scientists, even) aren't sure how a lot of that stuff worked (for example, how did there get to be an asymmetry in matter and antimatter). There is still a lot of mystery in the Big Bang/inflation model.\n \n Well, I think the single photon in the dual slit experiment creating the interference pattern is pretty good proof that the virtual photons exist (I guess you could turn this into an argument about 'what is existence' or 'what is real,' but that's getting philosophical again). \n \n \n \n I think that sentence in the wiki article is a bit misleading (and note that there really is no further talk of it on that page, and if you read the discussion page on the wiki). I think it is referring to the \"critical Casimir effect\" which is a different, classical version that includes a liquid instead of a vacuum (I could be wrong about that, I'm not at all an expert on this stuff). But even so, van der Waals force is not quantum-free... check out LDFs which are a part of the van der Waals force.\n \n London dispersion force - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Since you like wikipedia (as do I), here's a list of some more examples, anyway. I particularly like Hawking radiation, which is kind of an offshoot on quantum vacuum fluctuations. \n \n Virtual particle - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n 2. Well, again, you could never actually see the photon (or electron) in both slits, but yeah, there are whole (virtual) photons going through both. If it was only going through one, it wouldn't be possible to interfere with itself. It's hard to really think about, but things can exist in many places at once... until you observe them... I'm not really sure that it is accurate to say that the 'particle' exists in both slits though, since it's really the 'wave' of the photon/electron that is passing through both at once, but the effect is the same.\n \n By the way I don't mind the questions...

   "I think I maybe worded that poorly...\n \n String theory is built on quantum theory, relativity, and Lorentz invariance. All those things are legitimate, falsifiable scientific theories/principles. \n \n Quantum theory isn't going to be falsified anytime soon (not that it's impossible), and there's nothing in string theory to threaten it. I think if quantum theory ever did \"go under\" it wouldn't be that it is 'wrong' per se, but it would be superseded, like what relativity did to Newtonian gravity. \n \n Anyway, the problem (and what I was originally trying to say) is that there is nothing specific to string theory that is really falsifiable. The only way to falsify the theory would be to falsify one of the major foundations of modern physics... in other words, it's not really all that convincing at this point, since string theory just kind of makes its living off of other theories and can't really be falsified on its own merits.\n\n \n I think I get it now.\n Some fundamental principles of physics would have to be proved wrong to disprove string theory because it relies on them to be valid...something like that.",

   "1. I'm not really sure with the conservation of energy thing. I've always kind of thought of the fluctuations as being within a 'margin of error' allowed by the uncertainty principle, even though I'm pretty sure that's an inaccurate view. I'm also not sure how the particle/anti-particle dynamic really works, and if that cancels out the effects.\n \n With the quantum fluctuation to Big Bang thing, I guess the answer would be that it wasn't observed? I really don't know. It's just a pretty wild hypothesis, and I (and scientists, even) aren't sure how a lot of that stuff worked (for example, how did there get to be an asymmetry in matter and antimatter). There is still a lot of mystery in the Big Bang/inflation model.\n \n 2. I'm not really sure that it is accurate to say that the 'particle' exists in both slits though, since it's really the 'wave' of the photon/electron that is passing through both at once, but the effect is the same.\n\n \n Okay, so if accipter is right, and the law of thermodynamics is retained by energy changing form to mass and mass changing form to energy, then virtual particles aren't really coming from nothing in the literal sense. Its just energy changing forms; that's reasonable enough (weird, but reasonable). And I think I follow you with the double slit experiment thing, its not really the 'particle' per se that is at both slits, but the 'wave' that is; describing it like that makes sense since we are talking about the wave characteristics of these quantum things (still mysterious though). But about the wave collapse and the Big Bang. If your going to follow this particular interpretation of physics (sounds like Copenhagen Interpretation to me) that the wave function collapses upon being observed, then it would follow that the wave function at the Big Bang was observed in order for macroscopic proportions to be possible. I mean, why do you guess that it wasn't observed? It seems like you switched gears at that point and disregarded what we know about wave collapse altogether just to avoid reaching a \"cosmic observer\" conclusion.

Because of the uncertainty principle, 'nothing' is impossible. There can't be a state where we know that there is zero energy; there are always fluctuations, and it's precisely this pseudo-zero energy state that these virtual particles spring up. \n \n Anyway, we don't know what was before the Big Bang, and if it was truly 'nothing,' then our laws couldn't apply, and if it was a 'pseudo-nothing', then the universe could possibly be the result of some strange type of fluctuation (or energy changing forms if you so desire), and it could be nothing more than a big ol' virtual universe.

I never suggested that a quantum fluctuation like what we are talking about caused the Big Bang. The quantum fluctuations were just an example of acausality in the quantum world to refute the claim that everything must have a cause. I said that the origin of the universe... the original matter, could have spawned in a quantum event that was similarly uncaused. \n \n Quantum fluctuations always spawn in pairs, and they only last for very tiny amounts of time before destroying themselves. There is no expansion, not enough matter involved, etc. for a quantum fluctuation like we see to have been the origin of everything. And when 'observing' a particle created in a fluctuation, it simply disappears, this idea that something could collapse into a state like that of our universe doesn't make sense when speaking of a fluctuation. Observation and wave functions would also be no explanation at all for getting from a microscopic universe to a macroscopic one. As I already said, there is no expansion involved these fluctuations, and observation wouldn't help expansion, since it would just make the whole thing disappear. \n \n Also, you've got your wording mixed up. Copenhagen Interpretation does not state that the wave function collapses when something is made manifest, but that something is made manifest when it collapses. This isn't the same thing, but even so (and going along with the impossible idea of a quantum fluctuation creating the Big Bang), there would be no need for the universe to be observed or made manifest anyway in the beginning... it could have just done its own thing (and lived out all possibilities) until something evolved that could view it, and it would fall into whatever state... You can even think of something like a tree as having a wave function. Imagine someone planted a tree, and then no one observed it for 50 years. The wave function of this tree would mean that until someone viewed it, that tree simultaneously was fallen over, dead but standing, living, or anything else you can think of. Even though no one observed it for 50 years, and its wave function covers many virtual possibilities, it doesn't mean that someone had to be viewing it for it to exist and grow.\n \n This also brings me to the last problem with the assumption. If you assumed the universe was the result of a quantum fluctuation and was basically 'virtual,' who is to say that it is possible to even observe it? What is the momentum of the universe? or the position? What does that even mean? \n \n I think we've just gotten way too deep into something here that I never meant to imply, and is nothing more than two laymen discussing something that experts are baffled about. All I suggested is that the universe could have been an uncaused quantum event... that's it.

I'll explain later) and the object assumes one state, or position. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n This isn't the same thing, but even so (and going along with the impossible idea of a quantum fluctuation creating the Big Bang), there would be no need for the universe to be observed or made manifest anyway in the beginning... it could have just done its own thing (and lived out all possibilities) until something evolved that could view it, and it would fall into whatever state...

(The tree is really growing, dying and being struck by lightning etc. all at the same time in reality.) If it is a possibility, then it is a reality.\n \n or\n \n Option 2: Copenhagen Interpretation\n It means that all the possibilities are there, but they are not lived out or played out in reality. The possibilities are only possible events or are things that could happen potentially, but do not actually happen (because they are not defined)... until a wave function collapse. Only one of the many possibilities plays out or actually happens or is defined in reality whenever the wave function collapses, and all the other options lose their probability status. This requires an observer.\n \n Now, according to Copenhagen, there is a possibility that someone could evolve to see and observe the universe, it is one of the many probabilities in the wave function. But none of these possibilities ever actually happens in reality unless or until the wave function collapses, which requires an observer. Until the observance, all we have is mere potential of all those possibilities, nothing really happens since there's no defined state or path.\n \n There is a difference between a potential of someone evolving to observe (nothing happens) and the reality of someone who evolved to observe (something happens or one of the possibilities is defined; a wave collapse). You don't need to repeat yourself, but you do need to address this issue, which you haven't done yet. The only way someone could evolve to observe the universe, would be if the wave function, that carried that possibility, collapsed upon being observed by a prior observer, and then we are still left with a \"cosmic observer.\" Please understand, I'm not trying to annoy you, but your assuming an already defined state by saying someone was evolving, this means the wave function already collapsed before anything could have evolved.",

We are here. If nothing evolved, then we wouldn't be able to talk about it. It's impossible for the possibility of the universe 'not' evolving someone to exist if indeed someone does exist. Your problem is just coming from not knowing how that possibility is chosen out of all the others, and that's not a question that the Copenhagen interpretation (or decoherence for that matter) tries to answer. \n \n And with your point of view, something would have to be viewing everything at all times for anything to exist physically (like a god), which I simply find preposterous (for reasons I will explain in the next paragraph), and if this is your interpretation, or what you consider the Copenhagen interpretation to be stating, then I don't hold to that, I won't argue respecting what I find to be a flawed point of view, and I would assert that your view of the Copenhagen interpretation is wrong.\n \n Your assumption is based on the belief that there is no 'true state' and that nothing 'truly' exists or can exist before it is observed. All possibilities are equal, and nothing can ever come along to collapse the wave function, because within the wave function no single truth can really exist (a person can't evolve because that is assuming that a 'true' reality occurred when in your opinion that was only one of many 'virtual' possibilities that occurred.) So in your view, for anything to actually exist, something would have to view the universe from its very start... even a millionth of a second past the beginning would render the universe forever unreal, only possibilities. This is not the Copenhagen interpretation. For one, there is no possibility of a wave function collapse or even for a wave function. The wave of the universe has to start its 'life' in a collapsed state. And if everything is simultaneously observed from the outside (which would have to be the case), then there would never be the possibility for a collapse in the future (even experiments would have to be observed which would make a collapse unnoticeable to the experimenters). A person could never force a wave function collapse because there would already be something viewing it. And if there isn't an outsider viewing all things at all times, then no history (and thus no present) can ever actually exist. It's just all around an odd view you are holding, if I am reading it right (and if you can understand what I am trying to say here as I'm sure this paragraph was kind of confusing). \n \n Your idea about the logic of two contradictory things existing at once is incorrect in my opinion, and it's one of the things that makes quantum mechanics crazy. Like the particle being in two places at one in the slit experiment or a photon of light simultaneously passing through and deflecting off a glass window, things are indeed odd. This is an excerpt from Michio Kaku's book 'Parallel Worlds,' page 153, where he summarizes the postulates of the Copenhagen interpretation into 3 points. Here are the second two points:\n \n \nb. Matter is represented by point particles, but the probability of finding the particle is given by a wave. The wave, in turn, obeys a specific wave equation (such as Schrodinger;s wave equation).\n \n c. Before an observation is made, an object exists in all possible states simultaneously. To determine which state the object is in, we have to make an observation, which \"collapses\" the wave function, and the object goes into a definite state. The act of observation destroys the wave function, and the object now assumes a definite reality. The wave function has served its purpose: it has given us the precise probability of finding the object in that particular state.\n \n \n Your ideas contradict both these points. You are basically ignoring the duality of particles. An object can exist in particle form or wave form (though not as the same time). By considering only the particle form to be 'real' and the wave form to be in a sense imaginary, I feel like you are missing the point. \n \n I feel like within a wave function, all things do exist, but not all are equal, because when observed directly, the function has to collapse to what is a 'true state.' This true state doesn't exist until it is observed. Now when this is applied to something like a photon or an electron, the 'past' doesn't really become any clearer just because you know the present state (as well as you can know with uncertainty), because the behavior of these tiny particles is very sporadic and unpredictable. But when talking about wave functions in regards to something macroscopic, like a tree or the universe, the past has to become clear. The 'mystery' of the past gets narrowed down. If the tree is standing, then it wasn't dead 3 years ago; if life is here, then a universe where life doesn't come to be is not a possible past any longer. The past must be compatible with the present and vice versa.",

Then it would be possible for wave functions and wave function collapses to exist and occur in these areas where the Observer is not looking. So it would be like a god at least in the macroscopic world, observing on the macroscopic scale but not observering the microscopic.\n \n If your right though, and this Observer HAS to be omniscient.. seeing all and knowing all, then this does in fact make wave function collapses and wave functions in general impossible (unless this Observer has the power and decides to \"create\" the wave functions). But notice, this is not a problem for me, rather it is a problem for the Copenhagen Interpretation itself! The Copenhagen Principle demands that there be an observer for your neanderthal friend evolving (and I'm not sure that you have specifically challenged that)... and you have reasoned to find out that this necessarily implies the impossibility of wave functions!

That's kind of been the whole point that I've been arguing. \n \n You've just been asserting that, but I don't think you've backed it up. It's just something you keep stating, and I can't really find much to back up your view. I did find this little tidbit that seems to fit my view though:\n \n From a section in a 1987 issue of New Scientist, at the end of p. 46, talking about a topic similar to what we are... \n \n \"[Some people including John Wheeler] suggest that the presence of an observer is required to make the quantum mechanical probabilities coalesce into a physical universe: universes are \"real\" only if they contain observers.\"\n \n This sounds familiar, no? We both are basically saying this is true (for the given interpretation of quantum mechanics). I am saying something that evolves is good enough, you are saying something had to be there originally. The article continues, and implies that an evolved being is enough on its own to fit the requirements (a 'cosmic observer' isn't even mentioned. It is assumed that the possibility of evolving consciousness is all that is needed): \n \n \"What distinguishes a stillborn universe from one in which an observer can evolve?\"\n \n New Scientist - Google Books\n \n \n \nLet me put these two statements right next to each other.\n \n Michio Kaku stated:\n Before an observation is made, an object exists in all possible states simultaneously.\n \n and you stated:\n An object can exist in particle form or wave form (though not as the same time).\n \n You know what simultaneously means right? It means 'at the same time.' So Kaku is saying an object can exist in particle form and wave form at the same time, while you say it can exist in particle form and wave form but NOT at the same time. You might need to restate this because that \"at the same time\" clause is all the difference between logic and contradiction. Otherwise, its not my problem, its Copenhagen's ... as you have shown.\n\n \n Um, no. That isn't something that any expert would say as it violates the principle of complimentarity. I recommend looking at David Bohm's book 'Quantum Theory' Ch. 6.2 'Impossibility of Simultaneous Observation of Wave and Particle Properties of Matter' as it clearly describes how things act as either particles or waves, but not both at the same time. \n \n What Kaku is referring to by \"existing in all states\" is the different states of the wave function ... This is clear from the very next sentence: \"To determine which state the object is in, we have to make an observation, which collapses the wave function, and the object goes into a definite state.\" He's talking about superposition of states.\n \n -----\n \n Also, with the all-seeing thing (I felt it best to talk about this last since I'll be incorporating everything into it)... The observer would have to be. Look at how you treated my example of the tree. If the tree goes unnoticed for 50 years, but a person comes back and sees it living and standing, you said that in order for it to have been living during that time, there had to be an observer. \n \n Here is what I am saying, in a long, drawn out way:\n \n Paraphrasing Kaku, matter exists as point particles, and waves give the probability of where the particle may be found. Upon observation, the wave collapses to the true state of the particle. \n \n When the wave still 'exists' before observation, there is a 'truth' in there, which can't be known until it is observed. While those possibilities at the time all exist, when put to the test and observed, you find this 'truth' among all the possibilities. Before that time, though, when the truth is unknown, all the other possibilities are still real (this is why the interference shows up on the screen in the double slit experiment)... when thinking of it in terms of electrons and photons, it's pretty hard to get what I'm trying to say, but back in the macro-world, it's a little easier. \n \n Think of Schrodinger's cat (I could have kept on with the tree since it is basically the same thing, but everybody is familiar with the cat, so it's nicer). The wave function of the cat is simultaneously dead and alive when the box is shut, but if you pull out the cat and it is alive, then you have discovered the truth. It is clear that the 'truth' was that the cat was alive the whole time; it was never dead... The past becomes clear through the observation (although before the observation, the cat was indeed both dead and alive). \n \n It's the same thing with the universe. Before an observer was ever around to observe, there was a superposition of many, many states, but there was always a truth, and when that observer evolves: Boom. The past is now clear. Maybe it would be easier to understand if I said that the past 'from the present point of view' is now clear. Because I think that might be what you are getting hung up on. The ACTUAL past, if you could go back and see it without the effects of observation collapsing everything, is still a big ol' mystery ball of many different states.\n \n I know this is somewhat confusing, but I've done about the best that I can to explain it, and I'm utterly convinced that I'm right. That said, it's getting old because it feels like I am explaining the same things over and over, and you really haven't given your claims much more than the simple assertion that \"there has to be\" some cosmic observer. I think my \"past is clear from the present point of view\" statement is about as good as I can do to show you that I'm not committing any begging the question or circular argument fallacies, and if that's all you're going to keep pointing to, then I'm done, because I've explained it ad nauseam to the best of my ability.",

   "Poking my head briefly back in on this....\n \n 'Observation' in physics does not require consciousness, it simply requires an interaction between two particles. This is easily provable, as it is this fact which prevents quantum weirdness from affecting the world in a macroscopic way. An example - put a particle in a box and there is a minute chance that it will escape through the wall; this is called quantum tunneling and it has been repeatedly observed - indeed, current ideas suggest that it's responsible in part for how we are sensitive to smells. However, put a juggling ball in a box and leave the room, and you can be certain that the ball will still be in the box when you come back in - this is because the ball is constantly 'observing' itself; air particles are bouncing off the ball, photons are bouncing off the ball, even the atoms of the ball are vibrating into each other because of their kinetic energy.\n \n Hope that helps. Some further reading/watching for those interested would be:\n \"The Elegant Universe\" by Brian Greene (he also did a TV show of the same name, though the book is better), which is a comprehensive introduction to relativity, quantum mechanics, the problems with them and the solutions that string theory provides (which does include some info on the Big Bang, from what I can remember)\n \"How Long Is A Piece Of String?\", by BBC Horizon, presented by Alan Davies - this is an excellent hour-long documentary where comedian Davies wanders around getting confused by quantum, though it takes a little while to get to the interesting stuff\n This video which is a whole 8 minutes long and only came out recently, with an expert explaining some of the latest developments in our understanding of The Weird.",

   "\n Paraphrasing Kaku, matter exists as point particles, and waves give the probability of where the particle may be found. Upon observation, the wave collapses to the true state of the particle. \n \n It is assumed that the possibility of evolving consciousness is all that is needed\n \n\n Okay, so your saying if it is a possibility in the wave function, then it is a truth. So the fact that someone evolving was even a possibility means it was 'true' and this evolved being collapsed the wave function that it was apart of. In a way, your saying the wave function collapsed itself. I will say that if this is what Copenhagen says, then it indeed does not need an outside or prior 'cosmic' observer to collapse it, because the 'observers' are located within the wave function itself. But this necessarily means that all possibilities of a wave function are realities, and not just mere potentiallities.\n \n\n When the wave still 'exists' before observation, there is a 'truth' in there, which can't be known until it is observed. While those possibilities at the time all exist, when put to the test and observed, you find this 'truth' among all the possibilities. Before that time, though, when the truth is unknown, all the other possibilities are still real (this is why the interference shows up on the screen in the double slit experiment)... when thinking of it in terms of electrons and photons, it's pretty hard to get what I'm trying to say, but back in the macro-world, it's a little easier. \n\n Here, you clarify and state that all the possibilities that a wave function carries are 'real', but only one of them is 'truth.' I'm confused about what the difference is since dictionary.com uses both of these words to define the other one.\n \n\n Think of Schrodinger's cat (I could have kept on with the tree since it is basically the same thing, but everybody is familiar with the cat, so it's nicer). The wave function of the cat is simultaneously dead and alive when the box is shut, but if you pull out the cat and it is alive, then you have discovered the truth. It is clear that the 'truth' was that the cat was alive the whole time; it was never dead... The past becomes clear through the observation (although before the observation, the cat was indeed both dead and alive). \n \n\n Your saying the 'truth' was that the cat was alive before observation, but 'actually' it was dead and alive (not dead) before observation.\n \n\n It's the same thing with the universe. Before an observer was ever around to observe, there was a superposition of many, many states, but there was always a truth, and when that observer evolves: Boom. The past is now clear. Maybe it would be easier to understand if I said that the past 'from the present point of view' is now clear. Because I think that might be what you are getting hung up on. The ACTUAL past, if you could go back and see it without the effects of observation collapsing everything, is still a big ol' mystery ball of many different states.\n \n\n Okay, this makes a bit more sense when I put it all together. From a Copenhagen standpoint, your saying that 'from the present point of view' the TRUTH was that Schrodinger's cat was alive, but since that 'truth' is just based on our limited perspective it isn't what the past ACTUALLY was. Our perspective of the TRUTH was inaccurate in a way (and wasn't really or literally true afterall), because the cat was ACTUALLY both dead and alive at the same time. \n \n Now I would like to focus on the ACTUAL state of this cat, that is, the state of the cat carried by the wave function before the observation. \n It seems you are saying from a Copenhagen standpoint:\n \n The cat was alive and not alive at the same time and in the same sense (the ACTUAL sense).\n \n But that right there, is a bona fide contradiction. \n Maybe you mean that the cat is both alive and not alive at the same time, but in different senses.

And sadly, it's being repeated here.\n \n \nIt is an axiom not only of science but of knowledge itself.\n\n \n And on cue! Knew the \"axiom\" declaration was coming.\n \n Study the etymology of the word \"axiom,\" and you will discover that even the Greeks more then two millennia ago understood the inherently practical nature of accepting certain principles without argument. What the Greeks did not realize, however, is that the \"value\" (there's that etymology...) of believing many things they accepted without argument was not universal but contextual. Hence are there non-Euclidean geometries, for example.\n \n And hence is there quantum mechanics, which can set aside some of the axioms of ordinary logic in order to make -- this is ironic -- more sense out of some observations.\n \n \nTo state that 'our' reason doesn't apply to something just because it is large or small is to state that it is beyond our knowledge because it is large or small.\n\n \n Who said that our reason \"doesn't apply?\" I made no such overly general, blanket declaration. I said the reason that we have evolved to deal with objects at sizes we can perceive doesn't apply to objects that are too large or too small for us to perceive.\n \n (I could swear I referred only to \"many of the logical norms that guide our thinking perfectly well in our customary daily lives,\" rather than to all such norms. Oh, look! There in the third sentence! Well, I'll be damned!)\n \n I am merely trying to point out that the logic of everyday experience doesn't have to apply to things that are outside such experience, which is a good thing since the empirical evidence indicates that it doesn't. To insist otherwise is to insist that reality as such is reducible to reality as it makes sense to us in everyday life. Whether one realizes it or not, this is a form of metaphysical idealism, and a pretty unjustifiable form of metaphysical idealism insofar as empirical evidence conflicts with it.\n \n \nGo nurse your self induced ignorance while real scientist search for the truth.\n\n \n Ah, the continuing ad hominem!

You assume I regard \"reason\" and \"classical logic\" as identical. What if I don't?\n \n What if I instead think that in the last 200 years, the capabilities but also the limitations of classical logic have become apparent? Must \"rational\" mean \"obedient to the principles of classical logic under any and all circumstances,\" even if there is reason (e.g. quantum mechanics, for pity's sake...) to suspect that those principles are not so universal and exclusive? Is there an argument for this claim? or must it be accepted as \"axiomatic,\" despite empirical evidence suggesting otherwise? and if the latter, on whose say-so?...\n \n \nhistory has proven a thousand times that some people were willing to take the conceptually easy road, who just kind of ignored contradictions and kept going; only to be forgotten by virtue that every step they took past the boundary of reason was one deeper into folly.\n\n \n Who exactly is ignoring the contradictions here? That the world as described by quantum mechanics leads to contradictions in terms of the logic of everyday experience is acknowledged by virtually everyone. But the mathematics of quantum mechanics is not self-contradictory at all, so the question is, why should the logic of everyday experience be allowed to trump that of quantum mechanics?\n \n QM is supported by the empirical evidence (e.g. the slit experiment), and the logic of everyday experience is not. So much the worse for the logic of everyday experience. It has its uses, but it isn't universally useful.\n \n \nIf you are indeed correct that QM requires contradiction...\n\n \n It does -- but not of itself.

For geophysical cooling was ultimately not supported by the empirical evidence, while plate tectonics was. Geophysical cooling was wrong in fact, not in principle.\n \n What you are arguing is that QM could be wrong, even if it is supported by the evidence (and it is).

What makes it an axiom however is that no one can argue against it or in this case even argue at all without it.\n \n If you expect me to follow you or anyone else down the rabbit hole where fallacy and truth are just so much fluff arising from X (where x can be god, emotion, intuition, common sense, 'every day thinking', faith etc...) I am not going to and I laugh at the idea that such is weakness of position.\n \n I don't know very much about QM (and I doubt anyone here really knows the math well enough to make truly informed post's either) but that doesn't stop me from dealing with certain statements by the only sane standard that exists.\n \n You say I don't want to argue my position? Of course I do, I'm just not going to cede unreason. If you claim to be able to proceed under that 'limitation' do so and you can just completly ignore this as a random outburst.\n \n \nI've encountered it many times before. And sadly, it's being repeated here.\n\n Did you manage to get around it yet, or does it always seem to end in you giving up?\n \n What were you saying in the other thread? Well perhaps you're just being unreasonable and stubborn?\n \n Perhaps? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nStudy the etymology of the word \"axiom,\" and you will discover that even the Greeks more then two millennia ago understood the inherently practical nature of accepting certain principles without argument. What the Greeks did not realize, however, is that the \"value\" (there's that etymology...) of believing many things they accepted without argument was not universal but contextual. Hence are there non-Euclidean geometries, for example.\n\n Not all premises are givens(assumptions), but all givens and axioms are premises.\n \n \nAnd hence is there quantum mechanics, which can set aside some of the axioms of ordinary logic in order to make -- this is ironic -- more sense out of some observations.\n\n It cannot set aside logic.\n \n Define for me the difference between ordinary logic and ___logic please? Are contradictions allowed in ___logic? Are the premises not common?\n \n \nWho said that our reason \"doesn't apply?\" I made no such overly general, blanket declaration.\n\n \nare you saying that Copenhagen embraces contradictions? \nPretty much yes\n\n \nWhy this is surprising to anyone\n\n \n I suppose I did leave out a possible interpretation, you could have meant that the copenhagen interpretation is a load of bull and everyone should expect that, but I doubt it.\n \n Otherwise you meant that people should not be surprised that QM embraces contradictions. Embracing contradictions is mutually exclusive with reason. So you were saying reason doesn't apply to QM. Since QM is purported to be an aspect of reality, you were saying that reason doesn't apply to an aspect of reality.\n \n \n \nI said the reason that we have evolved to deal with objects at sizes we can perceive doesn't apply to objects that are too large or too small for us to perceive.\n\n Reason does not rely on spatial physics, understanding spatial physics relies on reason. Force fields at a distance are phenomenon that our brains would never have had to deal with until the last 150 years, reason did just fine on those. There was no terrible discord between the human brain and a truth that it never comprehended before. The essence of the human mind is abstraction and variable logical relationships, we don't have any inherent problem with any concept unless it is irrational.\n \n \nI am merely trying to point out that the logic of everyday experience doesn't have to apply to things that are outside such experience, which is a good thing since the empirical evidence indicates that it doesn't. To insist otherwise is to insist that reality as such is reducible to reality as it makes sense to us in everyday life. Whether one realizes it or not, this is a form of metaphysical idealism, and a pretty unjustifiable form of metaphysical idealism insofar as empirical evidence conflicts with it.\n\n The only one talking about this imaginary 'logical norms of everyday life' is you. Neither mr. michael or I have appealed to any intuition or common sense (and until you correct me that is what I assume you mean).\n \n \nAh, the continuing ad hominem! Since I reject the universal applicability of the logic of everyday experience, I willfully make my self ignorant, unlike people who are really interested in The Truth.\n\n I admit that was an insult, but it was only made on the premise that you had rejected reason in this context; in which case there was no argument and this was just expressing my disgust at the idea. I am prepared to stand by the premise that you did imply the abandonment of reason.\n \n \nThere is plenty of empirical evidence for contradictions of the logic of everyday experience. The slit experiment is a perfect example.\n\n How is the slit experiment irrational?\n \n \nGood argument! \"You're nuts.\" I'll have to remember that one! Bet it gets me a long way in my philosophical work, and earns me points with scientists, too.\n \n Let me try: If you think that was what I was arguing... you're nuts. Convinced?\n\n No. My response was equal to your assertion. What did you want me to argue against?\n \n \nOh, I see. You assume I regard \"reason\" and \"classical logic\" as identical. What if I don't?\n\n Then tell me the difference.\n \n \nWho exactly is ignoring the contradictions here? That the world as described by quantum mechanics leads to contradictions in terms of the logic of everyday experience is acknowledged by virtually everyone. But the mathematics of quantum mechanics is not self-contradictory at all, so the question is, why should the logic of everyday experience be allowed to trump that of quantum mechanics?\n\n As sigma once pointed out rightly a mathematical system can be self-consistent and still wrong if the model was constructed from a bad premise. I am not saying that is the case here. The real question however is 'who dares to claim that mathematical logic contradicts logic?'\n \n If you answer 'no one' then we are agreed and there is no longer a reason for you to contradict me.\n \n \nIt does -- but not of itself. It requires contradiction of principles that make perfect sense in their applications to ordinary life. There is a difference.\n\n If QM is correct and it contradicts another concept the other concept is incorrect.\n \n \nExcept that it won't be like that. For geophysical cooling was ultimately not supported by the empirical evidence, while plate tectonics was. Geophysical cooling was wrong in fact, not in principle.\n \n What you are arguing is that QM could be wrong, even if it is supported by the evidence (and it is). Despite its evidential basis, it conflicts with some principles of logic, at least in their application to our ordinary experience. So you're claiming that it's wrong in principle, not merely in fact.\n \n\n Perhaps that was a bad example for you are correct. I should have found one where the theory was wrong in principle but not in fact, I just didn't want to go back to terracentrisim again.\n \n I am not arguing QM could be wrong, I don't know enough about it to make that claim. I am arguing that if it 'embraces contradictions' it is wrong without me even having to understand it.",

   "What do you make of Bell's Theorem, then?\n \n Been a while since I looked at it, but if I remember correctly, it holds that no hidden-variable interpretation can successfully provide the predictions that quantum mechanics does, in fact, successfully provide. -- With the implication that QM's probabilistic mathematics is not merely the result of an overlooked variable, but an accurate description of an indeterminate world.\n \n As I recall, the experimental evidence to date favors QM's accuracy rather than a hidden variable. But as I also recall, the jury is still out, and like I said, it's been a while.\n \n Just curious about what you -- and others! -- might think.\n\n \n The author of Bell's Theorem was John Stewart Bell, and he actually held to a hidden variables interpretation of quantum physics. It was John Von Neumann who tried to disprove hidden variables altogether in quantum mechanics, but John Bell showed that Von Neumann's conclusions were faulty. David Bohm's theory of quantum mechanics is a non-local hidden variable interpretation and it was Bell's Theorem (which Bell came up with after reading Bohm's work) that showed the physical impossibility of only local hidden variables but allowed for non-local ones, in corroboration with Bohm's theory. Even though Bell's Theorem is generally accepted as valid, it's true that the jury is still out. Wikipedia puts it like this: \n \n \"..none of the tests of his theorem performed to date has fulfilled all of the requisite conditions implicit in the theorem. Accordingly, none of the results are totally conclusive.\"\n \n While on the subject of locality and non-locality, it is difficult for me to know exactly what is meant by this. I think the phenomenon of quantum entanglement would be a causal relationship that is considered non-local, but there are other examples I'm not so sure about. For example, the Aharonov-Bohm effect has an electric wire running between the two slits of the double slit experiment (which sounds local) but the magnetic field produced by this wire is isolated out of the way of the slits or in other words, the field is contained and B = 0 Tesla for where the electrons are traveling (which sounds non-local). Yet, the intereference pattern is shifted and the electrons are affected, but why? What is affecting the electrons' behavior if they don't feel the magnetic field? It seems like there are factors or \"hidden variables\" that we did not know about before, but what else could that lead us to? Hidden variable theories try to answer these questions, whereas according to Basil Hiley, the Copenhagen Interpretation just says, \"well, it just happens.\"\n \n Like Stonewall said, the conflict is between the different interpretations of quantum mechanics. I understand that some of these theories are incomplete, but what I don't get is why someone would hold to an interpretation that outrightly and boldy admits contradictions (making it illogical) yet they still accept it as valid (and even celebrate it), when there are other options that are logical while maintaining mathematical and experimental consistency!! This widely taught and over publicized Copenhagen Interpretation and the 'suppression' of Bohm's Hidden Variable Theory was considered by John Stewart Bell to be a \"scandal.\"",

   "Reason defines objectivity, defines the limits of human knowledge. If you think you've found limitations then you have only identified the unknowable, not the knowable only by math (a contradiction) knowable by faith (an imaginary concept), knowable by mystical vision (also unreal).\n\n \n Read some Kant, or a lot of other philosophy from the last 200 years. The idea that reason is limited is not new. It serves as a corrective to speculative metaphysics that use reason to construct internally consistent but empirically unsupportable systems (e.g. Platonic forms -- whether transcendent, as in Plato himself, or immanent, as in Aristotle's reworking -- or Hegelian spirit).\n \n Moreover, recognizing such limits requires neither an abandonment of the scientific enterprise nor a commitment to faith-based speculative metaphysics. To say that reason has limits is neither to say that it doesn't work at all nor to say that there is a better path to knowledge. So please stop making straw man arguments based on false dichotomies that aren't implied by the claims being made.\n \n \nThat was how I was claiming you were painting reason.\n\n \n My mistake. Still, I think the mistake is understandable given the absurdity of the characterization. It simply isn't implied by anything I have ever said. If you think otherwise...\n \n \nHow could you teach logic when you can't even tell what you yourself implied?\n\n \n ...then prove it. Take a direct quote from me and show the step-by-step derivation of the alleged \"implication.\" If I misspoke, I will clarify; if I made a mistaken inference, I will admit it and correct my argument and/or position as necessary. The fact that I have taught logic for years doesn't make me immune from errors of phrasing or reasoning. But so far, I don't think I've made any such error, and you certainly haven't demonstrated it.\n \n \nWas this just an example of you not reading what you were responding to?\n\n \n No, as noted, the characterization was so far from my actual view that I failed to recognize it as a characterization of my view. I would suggest that is an example of you failing to understand me. Again.\n \n \nThat was an ad hominem? I don't think so...\n\n \n Not every ad hominem is a character attack. It is also ad hominem to attack someone's motives or purposes. The moment you start going after the messenger instead of the message, it's ad hominem.\n \n In this case, rather than show why knowledge requires what you said it does, you attribute advocacy of contradiction and faith to anyone who would disagree. Ad hominem. (And a shift of the burden of proof, to boot.)\n \n \n...not that I didn't insult you in the post but it was below that and it was well deserved.\n\n \n Which makes it not fallacious? Please.\n \n \nIt is a time honored randian strategy (that's a compliment BTW), and you are actually right factually in everything you just said. I would only modify one point, it not \"don't want to\" it's \"can't\" because one cannot argue for an axiom without assuming it; which is traditionally a begging the question fallacy. What makes it an axiom however is that no one can argue against it or in this case even argue at all without it.\n\n \n Which is a definition of \"axiom\" pretty much unique to Objectivism. The fact that something is accepted without argument to provide a basis for reasoning does not mean that it must be in order to reason at all. It just means that it must be accepted to reason within the parameters of the system established by the axioms -- and there may be circumstances under which that system should not be used.\n \n Hence we have non-Euclidian geometries that discard axioms about parallel lines never meeting, for example. We have post-Newtonian physics that discard axioms about the uniform emptiness of space.\n \n Here's a really interesting question for you. Suppose that someone disagrees with you -- as I do -- about the very nature of axioms in the first place. Is there any rational way even to discuss the issue, let alone settle it? Or is the only response to such a disagreement a repetition that the acceptance of the disputed definition of \"axiom\" is necessary before any rational discussion can even be attempted?\n \n My experience in arguing with Objectivists is that they always choose the latter. And this worries me for two reasons. First, it's question-begging, a classic example of presupposing precisely what is in dispute. Second, it it is intuitionist: one is just supposed to \"get it,\" to \"see it this way,\" because after all it is (allegedly) \"self-evident,\" despite its lack of evidence in the eyes of one party of the dispute. (Hence my misunderstanding that you believed reason was partly a matter of intuition in the earlier post.)\n \n \nIf you expect me to follow you or anyone else down the rabbit hole where fallacy and truth are just so much fluff arising from X (where x can be god, emotion, intuition, common sense, 'every day thinking', faith etc...) I am not going to and I laugh at the idea that such is weakness of position.\n\n \n And I'm sorry that you think I regard truth and falsity as such relativistic fluff. But it's not implied by what I've said.\n \n \nI don't know very much about QM (and I doubt anyone here really knows the math well enough to make truly informed post's either) but that doesn't stop me from dealing with certain statements by the only sane standard that exists.\n\n \n And what's at issue is precisely whether that standard is truly the only standard or not. You say it is, but I say it's not, and I've presented my reasons for saying that. In response, I am not presented with opposing reasons but am rather charged with a blanket disavowal of rationality -- and as the nature of rationality is precisely what's at issue, I reject the response as inadequate on grounds of circularity, which is fallacious even within the system from which the response has been launched!\n \n \nYou say I don't want to argue my position? Of course I do, I'm just not going to cede unreason.\n\n \n See? A perfect example. If the issue is the nature of reason itself, you're not willing to argue the point. You just paint your opponent as irrational.\n \n \nDid you manage to get around it yet, or does it always seem to end in you giving up?\n\n \n To my own satisfaction, as well as that of all non-Objectivist observers of the debates, I've always managed to get around it. To the Objectivist interlocutors themselves, of course, I failed, so they always declare that I've given up.\n \n Whatever. The fact that someone thinks my claim is view is wrong doesn't mean that it is, and I'm sure that even you would agree with that! And I'm under no obligation to continue arguing just to satisfy someone else, right?\n \n \nDefine for me the difference between ordinary logic and ___logic please? Are contradictions allowed in ___logic? Are the premises not common?\n\n \n Let me be a bit roundabout for a moment.\n \n It is possible to construct systems of logic with varying basic premises. Some ancient Vedantic philosophers, for example, worked out an entire system that did not include the principle of identity (a=a) as an axiom. I realize that, since this is a religious system of thought, it's automatically suspect for Objectivists, but the point is not about religion, or even whether the system in question is correct. The point is about the nature of axioms.\n \n I would say that axioms are always chosen on the basis of their practical consequences. The value of the principle of non-contradiction (\"x and not-x cannot both be true in the same sense and at the same time\") is an axiom for classical logic, for example. And the practical consequences of holding to this in daily life are immeasurably valuable. I cannot think of a single perceptual or social situation in which it isn't preferable to self-contradiction.\n \n But quantum mechanics doesn't seem to work that way. The slit experiment provides evidence for single electrons going through two separate slits at once (at least when not observed). The particle is here and not-here, there and not-there, so there is a violation of non-contradiction (and quite possibly of identity, too).\n \n I am not recommending that such violations of be countenanced under all circumstances. It seems quite possible to me that the interactions of literally trillions of such tiny particles together yield emergent properties such that non-contradiction and the rest of our more familiar logical principles apply. But it also seems to me that, if the observable evidence indicates that such principles don't apply to quite unfamiliar sub-atomic particles' behavior, then we shouldn't insist that they must. That would be the height of speculative idealistic folly: a demand that reality in itself must conform to one of our ways of thinking about it -- a very useful way under the overwhelming majority of circumstances, I grant you, but not the only way.\n \n So in returning to the original way you put it, I would say that any logic must be qualified. \"Ordinary\" or \"classical\" logic, or what I have often referred to as the logic \"of everyday experience,\" include the principle of non-contradiction as an inviolate axiom. But QM need not include it, at least not as an axiom never to be violated.\n \n This does not mean that QM is \"illogical,\" in my view. To the contrary, it is a system of thought that we use in the everyday world, and so if it is completely incapable of making sense in terms of classical logic, it would quickly be revealed as incoherent. But if the realities QM seeks to describe do not all appear to obey our more familiar logical rules, we shouldn't pretend that there's a problem with QM just because its descriptions don't force them to.\n \n \nI suppose I did leave out a possible interpretation, you could have meant that the copenhagen interpretation is a load of bull and everyone should expect that, but I doubt it.\n \n Otherwise you meant that people should not be surprised that QM embraces contradictions. Embracing contradictions is mutually exclusive with reason. So you were saying reason doesn't apply to QM.\n\n \n I did indeed mean that people should not be surprised that QM embraces contradictions -- but perhaps I should've said that QM only does so sometimes, namely when, and only when, the empirical evidence indicates that the reality being described doesn't conform to the principle of non-contradiction.\n \n And note further that the idea of embracing any contradictions being mutually exclusive with reason under all circumstances is, as discussed above, precisely what is at issue in this discussion. So please stop begging the question by presupposing precisely the unitary notion of reason that I am explicitly claiming QM challenges!\n \n I am not saying that reason doesn't apply to QM. I am saying that reason in accordance with the rules of classical logic doesn't always apply to QM. If you think that the rules of classical logic are the only rules that reason can or should ever use, feel free to make the case. But don't just scream \"Axiomatic!\" or \"You're abandoning reason!\" over and over again.\n \n \nSince QM is purported to be an aspect of reality, you were saying that reason doesn't apply to an aspect of reality.\n\n \n This I actually have no problem with, so long as it is again qualified: In all of its forms, whether classical or not, human reason may not apply to some aspects of reality. Clearly, reason does apply to much of reality, and correspondingly, much of reality must therefore be such that it can be understood by human reason. But \"reality\" and \"reality as human reason can understand it,\" while indistinguishable in practice, are quite distinct in principle. They cannot be theoretically reduced to one another. To do so is speculative metaphysical idealism, for which there is and can be no empirical or logical support.\n \n \nI admit that was an insult, but it was only made on the premise that you had rejected reason in this context; in which case there was no argument and this was just expressing my disgust at the idea. I am prepared to stand by the premise that you did imply the abandonment of reason.\n\n \n And as I have already explained, I am implying only the abandonment of reason as you are declaring -- not arguing, but declaring -- that it must be understood. The entire issue concerns the nature of reason, so I will reject (with good reason) any unargued claim that I abandon reason as such just because I argue that reason has both different forms and limitations.\n \n \nI am not arguing QM could be wrong, I don't know enough about it to make that claim. I am arguing that if it 'embraces contradictions' it is wrong without me even having to understand it.\n\n \n But what if there is empirical evidence (e.g. the slit experiment) that suggests a need to rethink your view of reason itself?... That is the issue posed by QM, ultimately.\n \n I should also add that like you, I'm no expert on QM. It is entirely possible that the Copenhagen interpretation is wrong, and there is no need to embrace any contradictions under any circumstances. But there needs to be an argument for that.",

Maybe reality itself isn't playing by the rules of classical logic, at least in the case of some behavior of subatomic particles.\n\n \n Yes Matthew, I am approaching QM with an assumption of Law of thought, three laws where one of them is the law of noncontradiction. Wikipedia puts it like this:\n \"The laws of thought are fundamental axiomatic rules upon which rational discourse itself is based ... The three classic laws of thought are attributed to Aristotle and were foundational in scholastic logic. They are:\n law of identity\n law of noncontradiction\n law of excluded middle\"\n \n Every world-view, philosophy, or whatever you want to call it, makes assumptions as their foundations.. the question is 'What assumptions are necessary?' I believe as Wikipedia puts it, that if discourse, thinking, thoughts, expressions and discussions are going to be meaningful, then this logic is a necessary assumption. \n \n But I can't tell if you are implying a different foundational logic other than this one. If so, can you please define what it is and why it is necessary to assume?\n \n Just to reiterate, Quantum Mechanics does not violate any of these laws. The experimental data (like the double slit experiment) and mathematical formulae in no way demand this. It is in the interpretations of Quantum Mechanics that these laws are violated. You see, in every physics experiment, scientists try to mathematically model what is happening in the experiment so as to be able to understand and make predictions about whatever it is they are studying. But in order to make sense of it, every mathematical equation needs to be interpreted in conceptual terms to convey what is actually happening. So, in QM, there are various interpretations of the mathematics which represent the experimental data. One of them is the Copenhagen Interpretation, and Stonewall said that it violates the law of noncontradiction; it doesn't make any sense (it is nonsense). But other interpretations like the different hidden variable interpretations do not violate this logic (there are others as well) and so it makes more sense.\n \n The very popular Copenhagen Interpretation is what is being widely taught as if it is reality, even though nothing in the data itself demands it; it is not a necessary conclusion but rather an unnecessary assumption (which violates logic).",

If the issue is the nature of reason itself, you're not willing to argue the point.\n\n Of course not, what do you expect? argument itself is dependent on reason.

Primary axioms are not a matter of arbitrary choice and the ability to use logic in the presence of assumed premises that are not truly primary axioms doesn't really have anything to do with their nature. The primary axiom of reason is that reason is valid, universally applicable, and singular in this matter. Any other position requires non-reason which is by definition irrational.\n \n A religious system is an example of an alternate epistemology and objectivist don't claim that it must collapse under it's own weight or even that it can be attacked by reason. They only say that it is irrational and that reason is a primary axiom of consciousness and reality. So they are saying it's dead wrong but not because reason demands it, but because reason cannot apply to it.\n \n \nI would say that axioms are always chosen on the basis of their practical consequences. The value of the principle of non-contradiction (\"x and not-x cannot both be true in the same sense and at the same time\") is an axiom for classical logic, for example. And the practical consequences of holding to this in daily life are immeasurably valuable. I cannot think of a single perceptual or social situation in which it isn't preferable to self-contradiction.\n\n Can you prove that x = ~x ?\n \n \nBut quantum mechanics doesn't seem to work that way. The slit experiment provides evidence for single electrons going through two separate slits at once (at least when not observed). The particle is here and not-here, there and not-there, so there is a violation of non-contradiction (and quite possibly of identity, too).\n\n What arrogance? You have the choice between preserving the classical definition of particles and fields and preserving logic and you choose to 'sacrifice' logic?! Why do you expect me to see a difference between this and advocating belief in God because you can't explain some aspect of reality?\n \n \nI am not recommending that such violations of be countenanced under all circumstances. It seems quite possible to me that the interactions of literally trillions of such tiny particles together yield emergent properties such that non-contradiction and the rest of our more familiar logical principles apply. But it also seems to me that, if the observable evidence indicates that such principles don't apply to quite unfamiliar sub-atomic particles' behavior, then we shouldn't insist that they must. \n\n They can't no observation stands alone, one must always recognize with reason what the data means to truth.\n \n \nThat would be the height of speculative idealistic folly: a demand that reality in itself must conform to one of our ways of thinking about it -- a very useful way under the overwhelming majority of circumstances, I grant you, but not the only way.\n\n Ready for some more objectivist claptrap? Consciousness is identification, demanding that the universe conform to our minds is ignoring a contradiction between our minds and reality, demanding that our minds conform to the universe is non-contradiction, integrating and resolving differences between our mind and reality. Anyone who claims that insisting upon non-contradiction is demanding reality conform to us has reversed the relationship. (yep that totally acceptable abstract conditional about positions again)\n \n \nSo in returning to the original way you put it, I would say that any logic must be qualified.\n\n By what? More logic? Or something else which you insist you didn't imply?\n \n \n\"Ordinary\" or \"classical\" logic, or what I have often referred to as the logic \"of everyday experience,\" include the principle of non-contradiction as an inviolate axiom. But QM need not include it, at least not as an axiom never to be violated.\n\n Classical logic = logic - non-contradiction ?\n \n \nThis does not mean that QM is \"illogical,\" in my view. To the contrary, it is a system of thought that we use in the everyday world, and so if it is completely incapable of making sense in terms of classical logic, it would quickly be revealed as incoherent. But if the realities QM seeks to describe do not all appear to obey our more familiar logical rules, we shouldn't pretend that there's a problem with QM just because its descriptions don't force them to.\n\n The only way we know that anything is wrong or has a problem with it is contradiction.\n \n \nI did indeed mean that people should not be surprised that QM embraces contradictions\n\n Then I have satisfied:\n \n...then prove it.\n\n \n \n -- but perhaps I should've said that QM only does so sometimes, namely when, and only when, the empirical evidence indicates that the reality being described doesn't conform to the principle of non-contradiction.\n\n Have you stopped to consider that the fact that empirical evidence does not match something, say non-contradiction; is in fact a contradiction? Without non-contradiction you can't use a contradiction as justification.\n \n \nBut don't just scream \"Axiomatic!\" or \"You're abandoning reason!\" over and over again.\n\n You know a primary axiom is falsifiable, all you have to do is make an argument for or against it without assuming it.\n \n \nThis I actually have no problem with, so long as it is again qualified: In all of its forms, whether classical or not, human reason may not apply to some aspects of reality. Clearly, reason does apply to much of reality, and correspondingly, much of reality must therefore be such that it can be understood by human reason. But \"reality\" and \"reality as human reason can understand it,\" while indistinguishable in practice, are quite distinct in principle. They cannot be theoretically reduced to one another. To do so is speculative metaphysical idealism, for which there is and can be no empirical or logical support.\n\n They are the same in principle since the only definition not assuming metaphysical rubbish is that A = A, identity = identification. We have a concept for that which is beyond human reason, it's called null; is QM defined as null?\n \n \nBut what if there is empirical evidence (e.g. the slit experiment) that suggests a need to rethink your view of reason itself?... That is the issue posed by QM, ultimately.\n\n To rethink reason I would need reason.\n \n \nI should also add that like you, I'm no expert on QM. It is entirely possible that the Copenhagen interpretation is wrong, and there is no need to embrace any contradictions under any circumstances. But there needs to be an argument for that.\n\n An argument assumes non-contradiction for validity and therefore soundness assume non-contradiction of premises. All that can exist without non-contradiction (and the other primaries of logic) is a statement, a lone statement is often referred to as an assertion.",

It is identical philosophically to faith.\n\n \n Only on the idiosyncratic Objectivist definition of \"faith.\"\n \n \nYou reference kant? Have you read Aquinas? I think he should be credited with this particular 'feat'.\n\n \n Hardly. For Aquinas, reason can accomplish things like proving that God exists or that human beings have immortal souls. Kant pulls back on what reason can accomplish quite a bit more than that.\n \n \nTo say that reason has limits on what knowledge it can acquire is to say that such 'knowledge' doesn't exist.\n\n \n Hardly. Absent empirical evidence, for example, it acquires nothing that qualifies as \"knowledge.\" And yet, despite this limitation, there is plenty of knowledge that reason can provide. So what does that tell you, in this case?...\n \n \ni.e. There are no limits on what knowledge reason can acquire, unless you assume an alternative epistemology.\n\n \n It certainly assumes an alternative epistemology to the warmed-over 17th century rationalism and empiricism that qualifies as an \"Objectivist Epistemology,\" that's true. (There is a reason why nobody takes Objectivism seriously in academic philosophy, and it isn't a political reason. Don't hold your breath waiting for that situation to change.)\n \n \nWhich is why it was a conditional about not a class of messengers but their position. If someone does advocate faith and tries to use that as an argument it is no an ad hominem to concentrate on this particular aspect of the messenger because their supposed support is that aspect.\n\n \n Focusing on the features of the messenger rather than the message is always ad hominem. If someone who rejects x advocates y, it is still illegitimate to argue that he's wrong to reject x because he advocates y. You have to show what's incorrect about rejecting x. If x implies y, then you should show how, and then show why y is some sort of problem on his own terms so he'll see the error of his ways.\n \n Meanwhile, I'll simply repeat that I certainly am no fan of \"faith.\"\n \n \nInteresting use of the phrase 'provide a basis for' then. If in the act of reasoning you must accept something, how can it not be a necessary condition?\n\n \n Interesting use of ignoring the difference between \"is accepted\" and \"must be accepted.\"\n \n If you're not specifying a particular thing that must be accepted, then yes, I will stipulate that something must be accepted without argument in order to get reasoning going. Systems are always incomplete and rely on principles that cannot be proved within the system.\n \n It does not follow from this that one particular something must be accepted in order to get any form of reasoning going.\n \n \nReality (and therefore reason) is a system.\n\n \n I'm not so sure -- but reality can certainly be described by at least one system, and probably more than one.\n \n \nIt is circular to argue unreason with reason as it is to argue reason with reason. I that is why as you so cleverly noted I haven't really made any argument for reason, that would be circular.\n\n \n At last you admit that you're not reasoning about this issue!... Which is to say...\n \n \nOf course not, what do you expect? argument itself is dependent on reason. Anything besides reason is by definition not something that is proven or shown to be true by logic but some thing that is just 'accepted' or 'felt'.\n\n \n ...that there is a limit to what reason can accomplish, yes?... I thank you for conceding exactly my central point.\n \n And so, the question is, which principles should we accept, under what circumstances, and why?\n \n \nThen perhaps you should ignore objectivist in the future.\n\n \n I am certainly considering it.\n \n \nWhy don't I call 'objectivist' axioms primary axioms from now on?\n\n \n Because changing the qualifier doesn't really accomplish anything.\n \n \nPrimary axioms are not a matter of arbitrary choice....\n\n \n Who said they were?

Any other position requires non-reason which is by definition irrational.\n\n \n And it is only irrational within the system whose parameters are delimited by that axiom. The issue is why we should accept that axiom. Who gets to make that decision and demand that everyone else play by that rule under all circumstances?\n \n Moreover, didn't you just say a few paragraphs above that reason could not argue for its own axioms (\"primary\" or otherwise)?

In specific circumstances, though, it might well be the case that not demanding x=x (since it's an axiom that, by your own account, can't be proved, either) is a good idea. In interpreting the slit experiment, for example.\n \n \nWhat arrogance? You have the choice between preserving the classical definition of particles and fields and preserving logic and you choose to 'sacrifice' logic?!\n\n \n Because I don't hold logic to be sacred and inviolable. What's arrogant about that? I actually think it's more humble to acknowledge that maybe even the principles of logic aren't unconditional -- that maybe for finite, non-omnipotent, non-omniscient beings such as ourselves, unconditional knowledge is not truly possible.\n \n I would argue this, and in fact have argued this, against theists who claim unconditional epistemic authority for revelation, not just against Objectivists who claim unconditional authority for reason itself. What can I tell you? I don't like absolutism and authoritarianism in any form.\n \n \nWhy do you expect me to see a difference between this and advocating belief in God because you can't explain some aspect of reality?\n\n \n Because I'm not saying that we need to appeal to anything else (e.g. God) to explain some aspect of reality.

For Aquinas, reason can accomplish things like proving that God exists or that human beings have immortal souls.

Should of said that from the beginning :p\n \n \nAnd so, the question is, which principles should we accept, under what circumstances, and why?\n\n The primary axioms are defined by being necessary to any thought or consciousness. They are automatic and cannot be escaped, we are merely observing an the abstract that we do assume them.\n \n \nBecause changing the qualifier doesn't really accomplish anything.\n\n It frees up the name space so we can stop arguing over the definition.\n \n \nWho said they were? I was suggesting that practical contexts determine whether we should or should not accept certain fundamental principles that we can't really argue for.\n\n Existence, consciousness, and thought; if you want to call them 'practical contexts' go ahead.\n \n \nAnd it is only irrational within the system whose parameters are delimited by that axiom. The issue is why we should accept that axiom. Who gets to make that decision and demand that everyone else play by that rule under all circumstances?\n\n Rationality is defined on the scope of existance, and it is reality that makes the demand.\n \n \nMoreover, didn't you just say a few paragraphs above that reason could not argue for its own axioms (\"primary\" or otherwise)? Even you don't believe that reason is, in fact, \"universally applicable.\"\n\n Of course it's universally applicable because no truth or falsehood lie outside of it's domain. Truth and falsehood in fact assume it. Saying that it can't argue for itself is saying that argument and even it's own truth cannot be established without assuming itself.\n \n You as a logic professor must realize that such would be a begging the question fallacy (fallacy assumes reason as well).\n \n That is nowhere near ceding alternative truths, it merely confirms that reason is a primary axiom.\n \n \nSo if reason can't apply to something, it's wrong? Seems like a definition game to me.\n\n The term is irrational, so yes. Definitions assume reason.\n \n \nAs a general principle, I don't even know why I'd want to. In specific circumstances, though, it might well be the case that not demanding x=x (since it's an axiom that, by your own account, can't be proved, either) is a good idea. In interpreting the slit experiment, for example.\n\n I'll take that as a no.\n \n \nBecause I don't hold logic to be sacred and inviolable.

The arrogance is in sacrificing reason to anything; as if it was a product of you're ego, defined only on the scope of your emotions.\n \n \nI would argue this, and in fact have argued this, against theists who claim unconditional epistemic authority for revelation, not just against Objectivists who claim unconditional authority for reason itself. What can I tell you? I don't like absolutism and authoritarianism in any form.\n\n Except you didn't have to assume that god reveals truth to man to argue against revelation as you had to assume reason to argue at all. I think your dislike for absolutism is what I am really contending with here.\n \n \nBecause I'm not saying that we need to appeal to anything else (e.g. God) to explain some aspect of reality. To the contrary, I'm saying that we need to acknowledge the possibility that some aspects of reality cannot be explained in terms of the classical logic that does so well at explaining so much else.\n\n God is just the plush version of the concept of the unexplainable formalized by a front end construct of simplistic 'common sense'.\n \n If you were professing ignorance in an area I would not have a problem, you have however claimed that something can be understood but first one must abandon reason. That is what makes it the same as religion. Do not claim that you haven't said this; you had nothing to say; in fact admitted that non-contradiction had to be abandoned to understand QM.\n \n \nNot really.

You start by raising the possibility that reality is logical in some areas but illogical in other areas, but then shift ground and say this implies that all of reality would be inconsistent. Seems like a fallacious move from properties of the parts to properties of the whole. It would still be entirely possible to make sense of those aspects of reality whose operations conform to logic and reasoning. It would also still be possible to communicate those understandings with others, as well as to communicate that there are aspects to which our reason doesn't seem to apply very well.\n \n \nBUT, if it is possible to make sense of reality (which is what science presumes), then reason and logic are necessary assumptions for us to understand it.\n\n \n Exactly: for us to understand reality. But not necessary for reality itself. That is the distinction that needs to be made here: reason and reality.\n \n As you ask in your earlier post about your epistemology, What assumptions are necessary? The basic rules of logic are necessary for our understanding of reality. It is not necessary, however, for us to make the much stronger metaphysical claim that all of reality itself is subject to those rules.\n \n If you think that all of reality must be such that human reason can understand it, then make that argument. Personally, I think that's a rather tough row to hoe. It's the kind of argument that takes us back to the internally consistent but mutually incompatible -- and in any event, entirely unprovable -- metaphysical systems that dominated philosophy from Plato to Leibniz, and which earned philosophy a reputation for head-in-the-clouds idle speculation.\n \n What can be said is, insofar as we can understand reality at all, it must be understandable, at least to that extent. But it does not follow from this that all of reality must be understandable. It might be the case that all of reality is understandable by human reason, but it also might not be -- and unfortunately we don't have the luxury of stepping outside the reason/reality relationship to establish that reason does in fact apply to all of reality.\n \n Better, then, to leave such metaphysical claims to a realm of speculation -- interesting, maybe even useful at times, but certainly not a form of knowledge -- and let science proceed without pretending to be metaphysics.\n \n \nIf you don't have these assumptions as your foundation, you might as well jump into a boat with Nietzsche, I won't stop you.\n\n \n Please. This is not Nietzsche. It's Kant. Read him some time. I won't stop you.\n \n \nSo when Stonewall makes statements like:\n \n \nThe universe is absurd. Deal with it.\n\n \n He is making a philosophical statement, not a scientific one.\n\n \n Indeed. I would say that the claim is overly strong. But it may well be the case that there are parts or aspects of the universe that are absurd, from the perspective of human reason.\n \n But I would also say that there's an error in claiming, as you did in that earlier post, that:\n \n \nQuantum Mechanics does not violate any of these laws. The experimental data (like the double slit experiment) and mathematical formulae in no way demand this. It is in the interpretations of Quantum Mechanics that these laws are violated. You see, in every physics experiment, scientists try to mathematically model what is happening in the experiment so as to be able to understand and make predictions about whatever it is they are studying. But in order to make sense of it, every mathematical equation needs to be interpreted in conceptual terms to convey what is actually happening. So, in QM, there are various interpretations of the mathematics which represent the experimental data. One of them is the Copenhagen Interpretation, and Stonewall said that it violates the law of noncontradiction; it doesn't make any sense (it is nonsense). But other interpretations like the different hidden variable interpretations do not violate this logic (there are others as well) and so it makes more sense.\n\n \n But keep in mind, the Copenhagen is saying that there are aspects of reality that don't function according to the rules by which we ordinarily make sense out of things. The mathematics is still the same, and so QM still makes sense in that respect, even on the Copenhagen interpretation -- it's a vast overgeneralization to say that \"it is nonsense.\"\n \n \nThe very popular Copenhagen Interpretation is what is being widely taught as if it is reality, even though nothing in the data itself demands it; it is not a necessary conclusion but rather an unnecessary assumption (which violates logic).\n\n \n But the math and the data don't \"demand\" any of the alternative interpretations! It's why there are so many!\n \n As I understand it, Copenhagen is actually not the most popular interpretation, actually. Many worlds is currently the star. But regardless, like the metaphysical debates prior to the 18th century, the debate between Copenhagen and the alternatives is winding up where all metaphysical debates do: total impasse. Neither the math nor the evidence is decisive, and so it becomes a matter for speculation. I certainly wouldn't say that any of these metaphysical views of quantum mechanics qualifies as \"knowledge.\"",

A and B are then by definition inconsistent with eachother, and since they compose all of what reality is, then reality is inconsistent with itself. Reality (taken as a whole) would be inconsistent and illogical (B contradicts A).\n\n \n But my point is, by what right do we demand that reality as a whole operate according to the rules of logic?\n \n Clearly, it is not the case that all of reality doesn't operate according to these rules, insofar as we can (so far as we can tell) make sense out of reality (to one extent or another) using those rules. But to say that all of reality must be consistent with itself, just because in order for us to understand reality we must employ our concepts consistently, is a leap into metaphysical idealism. I am still struggling with the justification for this leap. The metaphysical claim does not seem to follow from the epistemological requirement.\n \n This, essentially, is what Kant showed -- extremely convincingly, I might add -- when he published the Critique of Pure Reason in 1781. If you want to avoid both irresolvable metaphysical disputations and inconsolable skeptical defeatism, the way to do this is by changing our notion of what reason is capable of. Instead of believing that our reason can give us a complete picture of reality, we have to recognize the distinction between reality \"in itself\" (i.e., without relation to our minds) and reality \"as we can experience/perceive/understand/reason-about it\" (i.e., in relation to our minds). It is possible, as Kant himself acknowledged, that there is no difference between these two in fact. But in principle, we're never going to be able to transcend this distinction: we will always have to differentiate \"reality as it is\" and \"reality as we can understand it.\"\n \n \nHow can we then trust reason and logic to be reliable at all if there are \"areas\" of reality that do not hold to these principles? If reality itself has manifestations that behave illogically and unreasonably, then it would seem that reason and logic are not reliable tools to know what is real, indeed we would have to be skeptical of reason and logic (for both A and B).\n\n \n But why would it seem that way? Why is it all or nothing? Both metaphysics and skepticism are extreme reactions -- an unjustifiable leap and an unjustifiable refusal even to take a step.\n \n \nLet me put it another way. Assuming the reality of A and B as before, let's see where we end up.\n Q: Are reason and logic reliable? \n A: Yes (for part A)\n Q: Are reason and logic absolutely reliable? (that is, universally reliable; for A and B)\n A: Well, no.\n Q: Then, if reason and logic are not absolutely reliable, what is?\n A: Nothing. There are no absolutes.\n\n \n Which as far as I can tell just points out the pointlessness of the entire line of argument you're making. I would like to know why we are entitled to claim absolute knowledge -- knowledge \"absolved\" from any conditional or hypothetical limitations. We are not omniscient deities. We are finite human beings. Oh, well. Such is our condition, and no amount of metaphysical wishful thinking can transcend it.\n \n \nIf reason and logic are not absolutely reliable, then it leads to complete skepticism; we can't know anything for sure.\n\n \n This is about as perfect an example of \"over-reaction\" as could be hoped for. Why would the rejection of complete reliability lead to complete skepticism? Shouldn't it just lead to partial skepticism? to probabilistic thinking, rather than absolutist? to degrees of certainty, rather than perfect certainty?\n \n Rejecting the universal utility of reason is not at all the same as ascribing universal disutility to reason. If \"All S is P\" is false, this does not imply that \"No S is P\" is true. For pity's sake, that's straight Aristotelian logic: universal affirmatives and universal negatives are contrary rather than contradictory, i.e., they can't both be true but they could both be false. If it's false that \"All parts of reality can be understood by human reason and logic,\" it is not thereby true that \"No parts of reality can be understood by human reason and logic.\"\n \n \nBut this is self-defeating, for to believe there are no absolutes is itself an absolute belief.\n\n \n Which is of course true, but beside the point. Instead of the \"complete\" form of skepticism you say must follow, I would suggest that only a \"partial\" form follows: great skepticism regarding metaphysical claims that aren't subject to empirical testing, for example, and limiting oneself only to a degree of certainty for those claims that are.\n \n \nHowever, if you are posing that there is something absolutely reliable apart from reason and logic, then make your case.\n\n \n I have no interest in making such a case. I'm posing that we don't need \"absolute reliability,\" because it's an unattainable standard. To affirm contrariwise that reason and logic reach that standard is to make a metaphysical leap with no basis in reason or logic, and with no hope of proof. It matters not whether one calls that leap a \"leap of faith\" or an \"immediate intuition\" or a \"practical necessity\" or a \"self-evident axiom\" or anything else besides.\n \n And in saying this, I do not imply that reason and logic are \"absolutely\" useless, either, for the reasons outlined above (according to good-old-fashioned Aristotelian categorical logic). Can you see where I'm coming from here?",

   "I've claimed earlier that reason and logic are necessary assumptions, and if they are not assumed as universal standards, then you are left never knowing anything with absolute certainty (and partial certainty is not absolute certainty).\n\n \n Can't argue with that! You have made this claim, and the conditional is true. My question is, why must we be absolutely certain? What's so important about attaining perfect certainty? This sounds like the old Cartesian worry at the beginning of the Meditations on First Philosophy. And frankly, Descartes always struck me as a rather paranoid chap.\n \n \nAre you sure of that?\n\n \n Yes! But...\n \n \nIs this an absolute claim you are making?\n\n \n ...not absolutely.\n \n \nAnd what about this claim? Are you sure we don't need it? Are you absolutely certain it's unattainable?\n\n \n Ditto. Come on. This is just a matter of reflexivity. I'm quite happy to say that I'm not absolutely certain about anything. And unlike a metaphysician, I don't claim to know this.\n \n \nThe complete skepticism I'm referring to is completely towards all absolute certainty. According to you, (I think this is what your saying)\n \n We would have to be skeptical towards all things absolute and universal. \n (let this be Principle X)\n \n But is Principle X absolute? Is it universal that we should doubt universals? \n \n If yes, then it is self defeating.\n If no, then are you certain that it is not? \n and on and on ad infinitum. \n We are sent on a wild goose chase of uncertainty.\n\n \n And this whole line of argument presupposes exactly what I'm denying. It starts by treating my argument as just another absolutist metaphysical or skeptical claim, which is not what I'm saying.\n \n I reject -- not refute, but reject -- the all-or-nothing way in which the issue of certainty has traditionally been raised by both metaphysicians and skeptics. Set the issue up that way, and you are guaranteed an irresolvable debate between metaphysical speculators and skeptical naysayers.\n \n I prefer to be more pragmatic than metaphysical or skeptical. Don't set it up as an all-or-nothing issue, but as a matter of degree, as greater or lesser reliability. Can we be absolutely certain about our assessments of such reliability? No -- but who cares? We can't be absolutely certain of anything -- get over it.\n \n This is not a refutation of metaphysics or skepticism. (And in fairness, even Aristotle didn't think he could refute skeptics. His advice was not to talk to them. -- Which, while practically useful, isn't exactly a disproof. But I digress.) I am quite happy to acknowledge that I have not provided a knock-down, drag-out, \"absolutely certain\" disproof of metaphysics. But then...\n \n \nBecause of this, I submit to you that the contrary and better option would be to assume reason and logic as absolutely reliable. To avoid the wild goose chase, it is necessary to assume.\n\n \n ...I hardly think that \"assuming\" amounts to irrefutable and absolutely certain \"proof,\" either!\n \n This was my whole point in criticizing Freedom and other Objectivists' reliance on \"axioms\" at crucial points. \"Assuming\" doesn't prove anything, even if we baptize it as an \"axiom\" or declare it \"necessary.\" \"Necessary\" for what purpose? \"Worth\" believing (\"axiom\" deriving from the Greek \"axioma,\" \"to consider worthy\") for what purpose? The whole approach is shot through with unexamined, unthematized judgments of value in relation to this or that practical purpose.\n \n So contrary to what you claim, it is not \"necessary\" -- not absolutely necessary --to make your assumption in order to avoid a skeptical wild goose chase. The alternative is not to set the problem up this way in the first place -- to dissolve the problem rather than trying to solve it. This approach is not \"absolutely\" necessary, so please don't argue against me by presuming that I'm saying it is!

I'm merely explaining why I believe there is no need to ask the questions you're asking, and why I therefore don't try to answer them.\n \n Ironically, it is always -- and I mean that: always -- the metaphysicians who demand that others must accept their answers, the bases for those answers being \"immediately intuited\" or \"axiomatic\" or \"self-evident\" or some other such self-serving claptrap.\n \n \nBut why not?

I would be begging the question, if and only if I presumed what you presume about the nature of the argument and then gave the answers that I gave. But as I would hope is by now abundantly clear, you and I don't share the same presuppositions.\n \n In short: I am only begging the question if I presuppose something that I am trying to prove. I am not begging the question if I argue against something that you claim must be presupposed. See the difference?\n \n \nTelling me not to ask you certain questions is an attack on discourse, thinking, and expressing thoughts and ideas ... \n\n \n And this sort of hyperbolic bluster is an attack on me.

That is, in order for them to make sense to us. But not for them to simply exist, or be, or whatever you want to call it that reality does simply in virtue of being reality.\n \n I keep saying it: this is about whether reality must be such that reason applies to all of it. I still have yet to see the argument for why it must!...\n \n \nBut if I am not allowed to ask questions, then I can see why you would disregard their absoluteness.\n\n \n Ask any question you want.

One cannot make a distinction between known (phenomena) and the unknown (noumena) realms without some knowledge of both; to draw a line in the sand is to see beyond it.\n\n \n Oh, for pity's sake. Please re-read the section of the first Critique called \"Phenomena and Noumena,\" where he explicilty states that we cannot know that noumena even exist. He never claims to know anything about noumena or things-in-themselves.\n \n Still, he claims that, for practical purposes, it is necessary to think as if noumena were this way or that. It's what he calls the \"regulative\" use of rational principles, rather than the \"constitutive\" use: guides for action rather than keys to knowledge. Many post-Kantians have examined in detail just what practical considerations do indeed require; many (e.g. me) consider beliefs that Kant thought necessary in practice aren't so necessary after all (e.g. belief in an afterlife or in an omnipotent deity). That said, the distinctions and the basic framework for thinking is still Kantian. I consider myself \"Kantian\" to that extent, not because I think he was right about everything.\n \n \nYet Kant still uses reason to make an almost convincing argument. However, when I use reason to show where the argument faulters, you choose his reasoning over mine. What gives? Both use reason about the same subject? It seems to me that you have trouble overcoming a bias against all things anti-Kant.\n\n \n No, I find his reasoning correct and yours not. Presumably this is nothing strange, yes?\n \n Meanwhile, you have still to provide an argument about why it is that we must assume that all of reality operates according to the principles of logic. All you do is insist that we must assume this, and now you're even accusing me of attacking logic and discourse and thought itself if I disagree.

We can be absolutely sure that the sky is blue, and that it is a property of it's molecules that makes it so. etc...\n \n Some truth does not even require traditional evidence, like mathematical proofs.\n \n The slit experiment has been verified absolutely, what is not perfect about it is that it has now allowed a deductive argument of explaination to be made. Further any known or definition is open to expansion, but the common fallacy is to confuse that with redefinition or alteration.\n \nyou claim to provide a foundation for all else?\n\n Where did you get that?",

I am aware that Quantum Mechanics is generally unintuitive, but this might not be the best example. If a length of string has molecules moving at the very ends of it, then we cannot get a definite length because a definite length does not exist. It doesn't exist because things (atoms and molecules etc.) that move all the time do not have a definite postion, therefore the string does not have a definite length. The situation has been explained in a way that common sense alone can allow for understanding.

If you say 'yes' then there ARE absolutes and your view is self-defeating.\n \n\n \n I may not be arguing the same thing that Matthew is. When I say you can't be certain of anything, I am talking about a measurement before it has been taken. Say we do have a device that can measure a length to 100% accuracy. We use it, we get a result. There is no reason we can't be absolutely certain that at the time of our measurement, the result we got was in fact correct. But immediately after our measurement and immediately before, there is only a finite degree of certainty of what the length actually is. Also, in order to be certain of any measurement you have taken, there must be some sacrifice of certainty in some other aspect of the object which you are measuring. To get 100% certainty in length, you might not know exactly when to 100% certainty that you interacted with the object, or you might lose certainty in predicting where the object you are measuring is going to be in space. By the way, based on relativity, two different observers can get two different results for just about any measurement and both can be correct. Any measurement I speak of assumes a single frame of reference - just closing a loophole in my argument. \n \n Keep in mind, I am not saying we can't be absolutely certain that the sun existed at the time the light we perceive from it was emitted. We can also be 100% certain that we exist, that Jupiter has moons, etc etc. Any nitpicking of concepts like this falls in the realm of philosophy which is useless to scientific observation and conclusions. The only philosophical assumption that I will make is that my perception is not simply an illusion but the manifestation of something real. Science itself must make this assumption before it can proceed. \n \n We may have lost sight of our original argument here which was whether or not the universe was necessarily caused.

I am talking about events and phenomena that fall outside of our intrinsic understanding of existence. \n \n Also, I don't need to be absolutely sure of anything. What law requires that I be? \n \n\n There's no need at this point for a satisfactory explanation either ... but there is need for the existence of some kind of explanation. There has to be some kind of reason behind it (notice this is all the same thing as saying that there has got to be some kind of cause behind it). \n\n \n You can have explanation without cause. What if \"nothing\" is unstable? Therefore something sprang from nothing. There can be no cause of something from nothing - but the explanation is that \"nothing\" is unstable. \n \n \n\n This view of causality is indeed unreasonable, but you are committing another straw man fallacy. As I said before, finite things have causes. And there is no problem in reasoning back to a first event, but you have to ask what caused the first event? It must have been some thing. Please note that \"event\" is a word we use to describe actions; there is a difference between things and actions.\n\n \n When I say event, I mean any interaction of energy or matter or combination thereof at a specific place and a specific time. \n \n If finite things have causes, wouldn't such a cause be a finite thing or an infinite thing? So to say all finite things have causes is meaningless because it demands an infinite thing no matter which choice you make. The only way to have finite is to drop causality. If you want to argue that the universe is infinite, sure. I will concede that an infinite universe needs no cause. But keep in mind that we have to look for an answer, and when we do, we find evidence for a finite universe.",

I'm looking at the real world - not manifestations of the human mind.\n \n\n Perhaps you forgot what we were talking about. Allow me to recap.\n You said:\n \"..we're dealing with something atemporal which clearly wouldn't follow our laws of causality which are most definitely time dependent.\"\n Here you claim that causality is time dependent. I then reminded you to make the distinction between laws of physics (which are time dependent) and the law of causality (which is not). \n And then I used a mathematical example to show you how causality is not time dependent. At this point I have successfully refuted you're claim about the 'law of causality not functioning in atemporality'. You seem to agree with me when you say,\n \"You're giving a mathematical concept as an example of an atemporal cause and effect scenario\" \n Good, we can agree that causality is not confined by the barriers of time! \n Then you decide to say,\n \"You need more than that to convince me.\" \n I think you are confused, this was an example to show how cause and effect are not dependent on time for their function. \n It was NOT, and I repeat, it was NOT an example of HOW exactly the physical universe was caused. I don't have a detailed explanation of HOW it was caused, but I know THAT it was caused. \n My example showed that causality still functions in atemporality, which means we still have to account for a cause of the physical universe ... and you're objection to causality on the grounds of atemporality is refuted.\n \n\n So then what caused the state of instability? And once you answer that, you can keep going because you know what my next question will be.\n\n First of all, it was YOU who first postulated a state of instability. I think it's a contradiction really since \"state\" implies structure and \"instability\" implies no structure. However, if you still want to try to prove that this something is unstable, the burden of proof is on you. You did not address the fallacy of equivocation you commited earlier so I take that to mean that you agree with me that an explanation of this is impossible without a cause. But either way we are lead to something, and not \"nothing\". \n Second of all, you need to remember what the law of causality states; every effect has a cause. If this something did not have characteristics of contingency, then it would not be an effect of any kind and so it would not have an antecedant cause. Indeed, because it exists in atemporality as you said before, it would be outside of time and have some kind of unchanging or infinite nature. To ask what caused an infinite thing to exist would be meaningless. The law of causality is not violated at all in this, it is retained because remember, only effects need causes.\n \n\n What I am basically saying is that there is no law that says things can't spontaneously pop into existence.\n \n\n If these things pop into existence for no reason, or uncaused, then there ARE laws that say it cannot happen; like the law of causality.\n \n\n As you're well aware, it's happening all the time. \n \n\n You're confusing the math and experimental data of Quantum Physics with the interpretations of that math and data. Every physicist agrees on the math and hard data, but the physicists disagree on the interpretations of that math and data. 'Things spontaneously popping into existence all the time' is the interpretation, not the math and data. You're interpretation of the math and data is illogical and unreasonable as I have been trying to show. \n Below, you have provided a perfect example of falsly interpreting math and data to reach illogical conclusions...\n \n\n I gave the equation earlier:\n 1 + (-1) = 0\n In this case, something = nothing.\n \n\n 1-1=0 is not contradictory, but your interpretation of it is contradictory. This isn't even an honest interpretation of the equation, rather you're interpretation is mathematically equivalent to 1=0 (which is obviously false).

   "\n Can you demonstrate why you need to describe an atemporal something as unchanging?\n \n\n Sure. Generally speaking, time is a measurement of change. If something is atemporal, that means it is outside of time and therefore does not undergo change. You can measure the the amount of time between two events since there is a change in states, but there would be no amount of time that transpires for unchanging states; time = 0.\n \n\n To call it unchanging, you need passage of time to compare it to, no? \n \n\n I need passage of time to compare it to? Well of course! I am comparing it our own passage of time experience. You and I are temporal, and we undergo change (as well as the rest of the physical universe) so because I know what change is, I therefore know something about what unchanging is (I know what it is by negation; I know that unchanging states are states that are NOT what I am undergoing).\n \n\n This backs up my point that you're intuition, which is what this entire paragraph of yours is based on, fails you when trying to visualize such realms outside of our normal state of being.\n \n\n The conclusions we have reached are not based on intuition, they are based on reason and logic. What you and I have just done, is reasoned back to something that it is itself outside of time, infinite, unchanging and is the cause for the existence of the physical universe.\n \n Your objection at this point baffles me. You are not raising any objections about logical contradictions or inconsistent reasoning, rather you are objecting on the basis that you cannot visualize it. I certainly agree with you that as finite temporal beings we have difficulty in visualing something that is atemporal and infinite, but that does not make it false! Indeed, reason demands it and we have not violated any laws of logic on our journey. \n \n\n You're avoiding my real point which is if you require causality at the origin of the universe, you're stuck working your way back in time to infinity.\n \n\n I have already addressed this above, but to recap: \n Time is a measurement of change.\n Something that is outside of time is itself unchanging and infinite.\n Causality can function in time as well as outside of time.\n Something that is infinite by definition does not begin and hence does not require a cause for its own existence according to the law of causality. We then find that we do not work our way back \"in time\" to infinity because again, this 'something' is outside of time.\n \n\n Your mathematical construct is irrelevant to what we're talking about.. I really don't care about this abstract math as it is not representative of anything in reality. It is reality that we are talking about. Please try and remember that.\n \n\n You are simply ill-informed or uninformed; these mathematical constructs are both applicable and representative of reality. I presented a mathematical theorem used in Group Theory (and I am very happy to present you with more if you are not satisfied) and this field of mathematics has a special use in representing physical theories in Quantum Mechanics and describes the symmetries behind the laws of physics. There are much more applications of Group Theory beyond physics though, a brief description of a handful of applications are on this site\n \n Group theory - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n (click on) 7 Applications of group theory\n \n\n Besides, I don't agree that your mathematical example is really an example of causality.\n \n\n This isn't a refutation, or an attempt at one. If I have violated any laws of logic or reason I pray you tell me. Do you disagree because it is abstract in the sense that it has no applications in the real world? I have already shown this to be a false claim. Do you disagree because it is abstract in the sense that you cannot visualize it? As I have said already, that doesn't prove anything, it is not a good reason and you still have not shown me if or where I have reasoned falsely.\n \n Sidenote: There are areas of Group Theory that are easy to visualize, and others that are not.\n \n I thought your entire approach to this was coming from the quantum/particle physics perspective, and here I present the mathematical physics which is essential to the science in order to satisfy your perspective, but you don't like it. I wish you would concede to the logic and evidence, but if you are still going to disagree with me at least give a me good reason why ... you're going to have to come with something better than \"I don't agree.\"\n \n\n On the other hand, my formula demonstrates that something can be derived from nothing and is quite representative of a real life concept that I am trying to convey to you but that you seem to be evading. You seem to think that 1+ (-1) should not be something, but clearly it is something. If I have debt and income which total zero, then would you still say I have no debt and no income?\n \n\n This is a great interpretation! I agree with you here that if you have the money, and you still haven't paid off the debt, then both the debt and the money are real and the relationship that can be drawn between your debt and your money income is accurately represented by the mathematical equation 1(debt) - 1(money) = 0. \n \n\n Maybe you should look into the implications of what this equation means and maybe do a little research into what exactly totals zero before you tell me I'm saying 1 = 0 (I have no idea where this came from, but you did say it).\n \n\n Well, you seemed to think that something = nothing. Something is basically some thing or a thing. Nothing is basically no thing or not a thing; non-thing. When you say something = nothing, you're saying 'a thing is not a thing' or 'thing = non-thing'. If 1 represents something (anything at all really) and 0 represents nothing, then you are saying 1 = 0. I disagree with this of course, but if you look up the definitions of the words 'nothing' and 'something' you will find that they are mutually exclusive, just like 1 and 0 are mutually exclusive. Saying something = nothing is just as contradictory as saying 1 = 0. \n \n Alright Databed, I'm gonna level with you here. I will now be willing to say that all matter and energy of the physical universe came from nothing, but it came BY something. That is, it came out of nothing, but it was caused to, by something else.

I still don't demand a cause - but I do agree that some form of causality is a more satisfactory scenario. \n \n As far as referring to a timeless existence as infinite and unchanging, I still stand behind the idea that there must be time for it to be infinite and there must be time to call it unchanging. An example would be a single still within a movie reel - say the first frame of the movie. You certainly can't call it infinite. Could you call the movie unchanging at this particular frame?

   "This is perfectly reasonable. I still don't demand a cause - but I do agree that some form of causality is a more satisfactory scenario.\nYou may not demand a cause, but reason demands it. In any case I will let this go for now.\nAs far as referring to a timeless existence as infinite and unchanging, I still stand behind the idea that there must be time for it to be infinite and there must be time to call it unchanging.\nI would appreciate some formal reasoning as to why you stand behind this claim. If time is a measurement of change, then by definition, being outside of time would involve no change.\nAn example would be a single still within a movie reel - say the first frame of the movie. You certainly can't call it infinite.\nWell of course not, the single frame is itself composed of moving matter like molecules and particles at the microscopic level. The constantly changing state of matter that makes up this frame (and the entire reel) is why it is not infinite and thus will deteriorate.\nCould you call the movie unchanging at this particular frame?\nThat's like asking, \"Does time stand still at a particular point in time?\" I'm confused as to what you are getting at. If you are trying to set up a purely theoretical situation, where the movie frame is unchanging, then if it is TRULY unchanging, yes it would be infinite such that time = 0. But in reality, there is no such movie reel or movie frame because in the physical universe everything is made up of matter that is constantly changing states (i.e. positions, velocities, combinations, permutations etc.) The measurement of this change (aka time), will hold a value other than zero, and thus it is within time.",

I understand if you disagree with me, but please understand that in the scenario I am trying to get at, there is no matter, no energy, no radiation, no space and no time.\nWhat scenario is this? The movie reel scenario or \"prior\" to the physical universe scenario? If it is the movie reel scenario, then you are getting very very abstract. If there is no time, then the movie reel cannot change states, for if it did, you would have a point of reference by which to compare the second or third state in terms of time, that is, you could measure the amount of time that transpired for the reel to transition.\n \n\n There is literally nothing within the confines of our universe as we know it - it has not yet come to be. So, I have a hard time understanding why such a scenario where time and space do not exist should be considered infinite. \n\n When I say infinite, I mean in the sense that it never had a beginning. That makes sense right? Those things that are infinite have no beginning and no end; like the number scale. However, the temporal succession of one event after another in time (a.k.a change) must've had a beginning, because if there were an infinite number of states in the past that transitioned subsequently one right after the other, we would never reach the present state we are in now. If I said I would give you a candy bar in three days, you can expect the candy bar in three days. If I said I would give you the candy bar after an infinite number of days, you would never get the candy bar. Likewise, saying there is an infinite number of events or 24 hr days in the past would mean we would never reach the present day. This is because temporal succession through an infinite number of anything would mean you traversed infinity, this is contradictory. Infinity by definition cannot be traversed.\n \n \n\n Unchanging is also incorrect. To be unchanging, not only do you need something to apply the term to, you also need the passage of time to compare it to. In my scenario, there is neither.\n\n I already answered this; I am applying the term 'unchanging' to the thing that caused the physical universe, the first cause. And the reason I can understand and know in some sense what unchanging is is by comparison with the physical universe you and I are both in now. By this understanding, I understand that this 'something' is unchanging. In your scenario, you are doing the same thing; applying unchanging as compared to you're experience of changing.\n If however, you are saying that something needs to be unchanging and changing simultaneously for either one to exist, you are making an unwarranted claim. Something unchanging and something changing can coexist simultaneously, but something unchanging doesn't need something changing to exist with it simultaneously for it to exist.\n \n I'm sorry if I'm failing to communicate or to understand you. I am willing to forgo the cause being unchanging for now, but are we at least agreeing on the cause being infinite?",

You are preaching credulity, not science. I'm not trying to be rude, but you are asking me throw away logic and reason because of prominent cosmologists' opinions. No disrespect to the \"brightest minds\" but I wish you could display to me and show me exactly how any of these claims given by you or these cosmologists are true instead of simply believing them or having me believe them because they said so. After all, this is a debate forum, one should be held accountable to back up what one claims. I personally think you are making a huge mistake being so willing to believe in contradictions because someone with a Ph.D. told you to.",

   "What is this 'sense' you are talking about? Change is change! If something is changing in one sense, then it is changing. Your own argument (in post 471) therefore makes your god hypothesis impossible. \n \n\n God is unchanging in the sense of his being, his ontological status, his essence so to speak. The fact that he is infinite and has always existed demands that the \"stuff\" that makes him up is immutable. We are physical beings but the essence of God is not physical or malleable, it is immutable and thus unchanging. This makes perfect sense considering that he has existed always.\n The sense in which God does change is in the fact that he produces different effects; his actions are different (not his essence) or another way of saying it is his action changes (not his being). To go from timelessness to creating a temporal world is some kind of change in action, but not a change in his core being. There's a big difference there.\n \n\n Again, this doesn't make sense to me. If he wasn't \"acting\" (I take that to mean changing) for an infinite amount of time in the past how was he animate? What made him alive, or a god? \n \n\n God doesn't have to act to be alive, but the fact that he did act just proves that he was alive all along (even in his timeless state, even without the created world, he was alive). It is impossible for inanimate things to do that, so this thing must be animate, it must be alive.\n \n\n This seems to be a way for you to hand wave away the problem of infinite regression with God; to explain a 'birth' of god, but you still have explained nothing. What caused him to act? What caused that cause, ad infinitum. You're still left with a lot of turtles. \n\n I give a better description of causality in post #451 but just to remind you what the law of causality says: every effect has a cause. \n I have satisfied the law of causality by reasoning to one infinite being who caused the physical universe to exist. This being is infinite in the sense that this being has always existed, never began and never will end. To ask what caused this being to exist is a meaningless question because this being is not an effect, and only effects need causes. Thus causality is retained. \n However, you are now asking me \"What caused [this being] to act?\" Let me respond by saying that throughout this journey of reasoning, I have only ventured where reason demands it. I have not conjectured or tried postulating things that reason and logic have not lead to. If I started to answer this question of yours, I would be breaking that habit and conjecturing things that reason itself does not demand; it is the principle of Occam's razor that I am following. So in response I will only say to you that causality is satisfied in reasoning back to one God being the primary and sole cause of his own actions. How is that? Well, the action (of God) is caused by God himself (actions require actors). Here we see that causality is retained because the action is the effect and we have already found the cause of the action when we say God caused it himself. \n Going beyond that would be going beyond where reason demands, and postulating ideas that are without a foundation; to be making baseless conjecture. Asking questions can be fun, but it does not disprove any of the things we have reasoned to. In fact, for you to entertain the notion of other causes beyond this infinite cause (which is alone enough to satisfy reason and causality) would put the burden of proof on your shoulders.\n \n\n It's like you are defining all these things that are supposed to be impossible, then defining 'god' as the embodiment of the impossible, or the 'ultimate exception.'\n\n The qualities and attributes of this cause had to be such that reason and logic would not be violated, and doing this necessarily lead to a description of God. It was linear reasoning.\n \nI have to say mr. Micheal, reading back through your posts, it is obvious now that you have had an agenda with your \"logic and reason\" argument.\n\n This isn't my argument per se. This argument is just a rendition of the good ol' cosmological argument that has been around for centuries. It was reason and logic that had the agenda, not me. I was just convinced by it, and now I am showing it to you.\n \n\n Why would you push so hard for a cause of the Big Bang, but deny so readily that the same logic that requires a cause, does not require that whatever caused the Big Bang must also have a cause?\n\n It is quite simple and I have shown you time and time again; a bang is an action and a big bang is a big action, actions require actors (causes). Eventually, you will have to sooner or later admit that there is an infinite being that has always existed and thus needs no other cause for its explanation (because beings that have always existed are not effects). The alternatives lead to violations of reason and logic as you and I have already discussed.\n \n\n There was always the element of this in your argument, but why didn't you just come out and say it?\n\n Say what? That I was a theist?\n \nYou were just talking about how one cannot 'traverse infinity', I thought that was unfounded; but if you hold to it how did god's existance traverse an infinite past?\n\n God didn't traverse an infinitely temporal past because in a timeless state, nothing changes. God's creating the physical universe was the point of transition from timelessness (which requires animacy). His essence or being didn't change, just his action. This is why I say he started to act, but before that point it was time=0 and there is no temporal changing or transpiration of time at t=0. There was no traversal of infinity and hence no contradiction.",

   "This is getting ridiculous. How can you go from demanding absolute sound logic to spouting this conjecture?\n\n Conjecture?! I walked you through everystep without asking you to take any leaps of faith Databed. I kind of understand why everyone else thinks I'm making leaps because they are just walking in on this conversation just now, but I labored every point with you, being careful not to violate logic. You should be the last to accuse me of conjecture. (Very brief) recap:\n \n The physical universe as well as time and space was caused by something to exist, we came to this conclusion because you agreed with me that an infinity of changes or temporal succession through a temporal past is impossible. So there was 'something' that existed at t=0. \n This something is outside of time and so never began to exist hence it is infinite (in that sense). If this cause was finite and thus requires another cause for it's existence in temporality we run into the previous problem I just addressed. Occam's razor is satisifed, reason and logic are satisfied, causality is satisfied and looking for further causes would be the conjecture, which I did not do.\n \n You and I reasoned to this infinite 'something' that existed outside of time and had enough power to cause the physical universe to exist. \n I then stated that this something is either animate or inanimate (law of the excluded middle). This 'something' went from a state of not causing anything (timeless state) to causing the physical universe to exist and it is impossible for dead inanimate things to do that, so this 'something' must be animate (in the sense that it acted). It was then, and ONLY THEN, that I started calling this cause a 'living being' because of what the word 'animate' necessarily implies. All of this is familiar to you, all these objections everyone is giving have already been raised by you Databed, so please tell me where the conjecture is.\n \nThis is a logical fallacy called the Bifurcation Fallacy.\n Hear is an example of a Bifurcation Fallacy I found on the Internet.\n Sound familiar?\n\n \nThat's an assertion. Actions require causes, but actions are not always caused by an entity or being. My tea cup falls off my table due to gravity and the fact that one of my table has uneven legs. Since there's no way to prove, display or show evidence for an entity causing this action, it's assumed an entity DIDN'T cause this action. To give the assumption that someone must be causing gravity which caused the action of my tea cup falling when there is no evidence of such a being would be a fallacy.\n\n I only started calling \"it\" a \"living being\" after I showed it was animate, however when I use the word \"being\" to describe the distinction between different effects, I mean it in the sense that it is something that exists, as in accordance with 1 and 3 (not necessarily 2, but could be) of this definition from dictionary.com\n \n Being&#8211;noun\n 1.the fact of existing; existence (as opposed to nonexistence).\n 2.conscious, mortal existence; life: Our being is as an instantaneous flash of light in the midst of eternal night.\n 3.substance or nature\n \n Look the above post to Databed, (which is a brief overview of the argument) and you will see that I did not set up a false dilemma.

Let me just say that I did not set up a false dilemma because I did not ask you to choose between either 'no cause for the Big Bang or God for the Big Bang.' Rather I set up a mutually exclusive case where it HAS to be one or the other; there was a cause or there was not a cause. This is the law of the excluded middle, not a false dilemma; it is either one or the other. \n Then, I dealt with the scenario where this cause had to be infinite or finite; another mutually exclusive choice. Then proceeded to deal with the question of animate or inanimate; yet another scenario where one or the other has to be true, logically speaking. You see, I took logical steps to get to a God, I didn't ask anyone to believe in God at the outset; all the scenarios I dealt with proceeded logically using the law of excluded middle, not a false dilemma. \n I do appreciate it though that you are at least trying to find a logical fallacy to object to instead of just complaining that you don't like it, disagreeing for no good reason or baselessly leveling accusations at me.

   "t = 0 is not timelessness it's a point in time, there is no before or after time.\n\n Really? To say t=0 is to say time has no value, a.k.a there is no time or measurement of change. A \"point in time\" presupposes the presence of time in order to be at a point \"in time\", but at t=0 there is no value of time, it is timelessness. \n \n\n What I want to know is why you found a problem with causal existance being defined for all time but not a god... Further by moving the cause out of time you solve nothing. \n\n Every effect has a cause, something that has always existed doesn't need a cause because it is not an effect, causality is not violated in this and I think you would agree with me on that point. \n Now you are wondering why it is that this 'something' needs to be atemporal, why can't it just always be doing something or constantly changing in some sense? Why can't this something exist infinitely in temporality? Why can't time always have existed? Here's why not: if this thing was temporal, in that it was always traveling through time, then there would need to be an infinity of moments in the past that we traveled through to get to this present moment (or for the 'something' to get to it's present moment). But to say that we reached the present moment by traveling through an infinite number of moments in the past is to say one has traversed infinity, which is impossible. The alternative is to say that time had beginning, or that measurements of change began. Then, without the physical universe or without space and time, we have 'something' that exists at t=0. \n \n\n The cause of the big bang could be atemporal, but that does not imply consciousness in the least.\n\n The law of excluded middle demands that this 'something' is either animate or inanimate. You're right at this point, the fact that it exists at t=0 does not necessitate that is either one. BUT, when we see that this 'something' transitioned from a state of t=0 (in the sense that it acted) by causing space, time and the physical universe to exist, it automatically shows that this 'something' cannot be inanimate. Inanimate things are inactive and dead, if this something was inanimate, it would be \"stuck\" so to speak in timelessness, never moving and never causing anything, so the other choice (by necessity) wins out; it is animate.\n \n\n You insist that effects must have a cause, you rejected every postulation of an existance that was not caused except apparently an animate one, why?\n\n No, I accepted with open arms any possibility of an existence that was not caused, I only rejected the postulations that claimed 'things' that existed through traversal of a temporal infinity (for reasons I explained above). I also was very ambiguous (but accurate) in calling this cause a 'thing' because any further detail in describing it beyond what reason and logic necessitate would be baseless conjecture. If you look at post #502 you'll see that it was logic that necessitated those specific descriptions of \"infinite\" and \"animate\" (but in different senses).",

   "God is unchanging in the sense of his being, his ontological status, his essence so to speak. The fact that he is infinite and has always existed demands that the \"stuff\" that makes him up is immutable. We are physical beings but the essence of God is not physical or malleable, it is immutable and thus unchanging. This makes perfect sense considering that he has existed always.\n The sense in which God does change is in the fact that he produces different effects; his actions are different (not his essence) or another way of saying it is his action changes (not his being). To go from timelessness to creating a temporal world is some kind of change in action, but not a change in his core being. There's a big difference there.\n \n God doesn't have to act to be alive, but the fact that he did act just proves that he was alive all along (even in his timeless state, even without the created world, he was alive). It is impossible for inanimate things to do that, so this thing must be animate, it must be alive.\n \n I give a better description of causality in post #451 but just to remind you what the law of causality says: every effect has a cause. \n I have satisfied the law of causality by reasoning to one infinite being who caused the physical universe to exist. This being is infinite in the sense that this being has always existed, never began and never will end. To ask what caused this being to exist is a meaningless question because this being is not an effect, and only effects need causes. Thus causality is retained. \n However, you are now asking me \"What caused [this being] to act?\" Let me respond by saying that throughout this journey of reasoning, I have only ventured where reason demands it. I have not conjectured or tried postulating things that reason and logic have not lead to. If I started to answer this question of yours, I would be breaking that habit and conjecturing things that reason itself does not demand; it is the principle of Occam's razor that I am following. So in response I will only say to you that causality is satisfied in reasoning back to one God being the primary and sole cause of his own actions. How is that? Well, the action (of God) is caused by God himself (actions require actors). Here we see that causality is retained because the action is the effect and we have already found the cause of the action when we say God caused it himself. \n Going beyond that would be going beyond where reason demands, and postulating ideas that are without a foundation; to be making baseless conjecture. Asking questions can be fun, but it does not disprove any of the things we have reasoned to. In fact, for you to entertain the notion of other causes beyond this infinite cause (which is alone enough to satisfy reason and causality) would put the burden of proof on your shoulders.\n\n \n What makes the action of god immune to causality? To say God caused himself and caused his actions is nonsense. There has to be a cause to his actions, and cause to the cause, etc. Every action, every thought, decision, etc. requires a cause. And what is 'alive' if there was no action, no thought, no nothing? That's no 'life' that I've ever heard of. You are trying to justify life from nothingness; it's no more than a fancy something from nothing claim... a dressed up pig. If 'God' didn't ever act and was in a state of timelessness, that is absolutely no different than an inanimate object (or nothing at all). Your argument, that the action comes from God (who has been action-less in this timeless eternity), is no different from saying that a cosmic egg always existed and one day 'hatched,' and attributing the cause to the egg. It's nonsense. There is no animate object that is immune to cause, or that fits any of the other ideas that you have sprung forth. (I've already said that I don't think causality is absolutely necessary, but even with that assumption your argument falls apart under its own weight.) \n \n You have again just defined god to fill in a gap in understanding, and called it animate, and therefore living. But you are basically redefining 'animate' to mean an object capable of 'causing.' Take the cosmic egg... that could be your 'god' and there is no reason to believe that it needs a consciousness or anything. \n \n \nIt is quite simple and I have shown you time and time again; a bang is an action and a big bang is a big action, actions require actors (causes). Eventually, you will have to sooner or later admit that there is an infinite being that has always existed and thus needs no other cause for its explanation (because beings that have always existed are not effects). The alternatives lead to violations of reason and logic as you and I have already discussed.\n\n \n Maybe 'God' doesn't need an explanation, but his first action certainly does.\n \n \nGod didn't traverse an infinitely temporal past because in a timeless state, nothing changes. God's creating the physical universe was the point of transition from timelessness (which requires animacy). His essence or being didn't change, just his action. This is why I say he started to act, but before that point it was time=0 and there is no temporal changing or transpiration of time at t=0. There was no traversal of infinity and hence no contradiction.\n\n \n And as I've been saying, you still are left with something that is uncaused. If there is ever a beginning of time, then there can be no action before that. The chain of causality is necessarily broken. Defining God to be the exception is not an explanation.\n \n And this whole thing is still a false dichotomy, because you have yet to mention the possibility of any type of time loop, or looping/repeating/oscillating universe (or realm outside the universe which is not subject to the laws of thermodynamics.)",

Inanimate things never act or even have the capability of acting in the first place. The fact that God acted or caused the physical universe showed that he was capable of acting all along, he just didn't do it till he caused the physical universe. Just because a being doesn't act at any given moment, does not mean that that being HAS to be inanimate, it could just be that that being is animate but not acting at that moment. So, God had the capability to act but didn't actually act till he caused the physical universe. \n \n\n You have again just defined god to fill in a gap in understanding, and called it animate, and therefore living. But you are basically redefining 'animate' to mean an object capable of 'causing.' Take the cosmic egg... that could be your 'god' and there is no reason to believe that it needs a consciousness or anything. \n\n You are confused, I didn't say that this being caused something and immediately jumped to it being animate. What I said was, this being is either animate or inanimate (law of excluded middle). Dead, inactive, or inanimate things cannot cause anything because they don't have the capability to act. If this 'something' was inanimate, it would be \"stuck\" in timelessness and never cause anything to exist. Inanimacy lost and was ruled out. Therefore, by necessity of this, the 'something' being animate won by default, it was the only other alternative.\n \n\n Maybe 'God' doesn't need an explanation, but his first action certainly does.\n \n\n Yes, God's action was caused by God himself. Saying this, does not violate but rather satisfies causality, reason and logic, and Occam's razor.

You are led to this problem of something becoming animate, and the question of 'what caused that?'. \n \n \nIn this hypothetical case, I am attributing the cause to the baby duckling.\n\n \n No, there is no duckling. The cosmic egg is the extremely dense particle that encapsulated the entire universe before the big bang. The 'hatch' is the Big Bang... The 'duckling' in this case would be the universe itself, which brings up the idea that the universe itself caused the Big Bang. \n \n \nAnimate things have the capability to act, but that does not mean animate things ALWAYS have to be acting. Inanimate things never act or even have the capability of acting in the first place. The fact that God acted or caused the physical universe showed that he was capable of acting all along, he just didn't do it till he caused the physical universe. Just because a being doesn't act at any given moment, does not mean that that being HAS to be inanimate, it could just be that that being is animate but not acting at that moment. So, God had the capability to act but didn't actually act till he caused the physical universe. \n\n \n 'Animate' objects don't have these qualities, and they are always 'acting' or living or they are not animate (animate requires animation. timelessness requires no animation. These are not compatible ideas.). Strange cases like the tardigrade (a tiny bear-like creature) can be pointed to. The tardigrade can be completely dried out to a state of death, but can last for years (over 100 years I've heard). Once water is reapplied, they become reanimated; but during the time they didn't have water, they were not animate objects. Animate objects are always in a state of changing... thinking, breathing, cell activity, etc. For the object to go unchanging for an eternity in timelessness before acting would be to say that it was not animate. You then need to explain the cause of this animation (to say it was God would be to say that God animated himself). \n \n \nYou are confused, I didn't say that this being caused something and immediately jumped to it being animate. What I said was, this being is either animate or inanimate (law of excluded middle). Dead, inactive, or inanimate things cannot cause anything because they don't have the capability to act. If this 'something' was inanimate, it would be \"stuck\" in timelessness and never cause anything to exist. Inanimacy lost and was ruled out. Therefore, by necessity of this, the 'something' being animate won by default, it was the only other alternative.\n\n \n I'm not the confused one. You have hit this problem in your reasoning. An animate object, an animated, living, changing object, requires time. If there is no time, there can be no animate object. To say that the something was animate all along at the moment of time makes no sense, since it didn't fit the definition for an animate object. This hand-waving you are doing is explaining nothing.\n \n \nYes, God's action was caused by God himself. Saying this, does not violate but rather satisfies causality, reason and logic, and Occam's razor. Your the one who demands something beyond what is already satisfied, thus putting the burden of proof on you. \n\n \n You haven't shown how anything is satisfied. Stating something does not make it true. The existence of an object does not give its action a cause. A thought, a decision, or something is required to explain the action, and the thought, decision, or whatever requires its own cause. You are left with turtles. To say that the thought always existed simply means that thought wasn't the actual trigger of the action (since the thought existed when action did not) and therefore the question is still unanswered.\n \n \nThere's nothing wrong with something infinite being uncaused, but there is everything wrong with something finite being uncaused. I notice a lot of people on this thread keep on forgetting that.\n\n \n But there is a problem with uncaused action and animated timelessness, which are both needed for your hypothesis.\n \n \nCausality is violated!? Where?\n\n \n I've explained in the above responses.\n \n \nI didn't say God was the exception, I reasoned to something that satisfies all the laws of reason and logic and then recognized that this something is no different than a God.\n\n \n Except it doesn't satisfy it because you are still left with the problem of causality, action, and infinity, as shown above.\n \n \nHow many times would it have to loop? An infinity amount? Then we have traversal of infinity. A finite amount? Then it began looping and we have a similar scenario.\n\n \n The entire thing could just exist. [Flowing] time, from the view of a higher dimension or an outside realm might not exist. From the 'view' of a higher dimension, the entire history of the universe could just look like a 4 dimensional map, and our experience of time could just be unique, like a photon constantly moving around in an orbit... All moments of time could be viewed at once, and this 'existence' could be eternal. Time flowing as we know it could just be our way of experiencing and making sense of reality. There would be just this one existence (or many different ones that we are not a part of), and it's only our experience that repeats. The system as a whole (all of the dimensions together), therefore wouldn't ever actually change, it would just 'be'. \n \n You are just making assumptions of time and dimensions that likely are oversimplifications. The universe is an incredibly complex place, and there is very little that we actually know. \n \n (I'd also like to point out that I am only assuming that causality is always necessary. I don't think it is necessarily true, and things could possibly be completely random or probability based. Since we've had this argument before, it's necessary for me to make this assumption to show you the error even within your own limits). \n \n Also, I don't really buy into the 'traversal of infinity' thing anyway. To assume 'travel' you assume a beginning and end, you assume two points. We are finite beings, and it might just be impossible to imagine from our viewpoint of 3 dimension space and forward flowing time. You could similarly ask yourself if anything is actually discrete.\n \n \nLet me try putting it another way:\n To answer your question of \"What caused that being to act?\" I could postulate (without any necessary reason) that God acted because he wanted to; the desire he had caused him to act. But what caused him to have that desire? Nothing caused him to have that desire because the desires he has are the very essence of his being and nature, he has always existed and those desires have always been there so long as God has existed. \n \n Now, I cannot prove this. It is an opinion that I can defend in the sense that it is not illogical, and it does not violate causality, but I cannot defend it in the sense that reason and causality demand it be so. We can end up having lots of opinions that reason does not demand, and going further back into different causes, but what I do know is that causality and reason are satisified by saying \"God causes actions\" and \"Nothing created or caused God to exist.\" To say God is the primary cause of his own actions does not violate causality (there could be an antecedant cause, but causality does not demand it; causality is satisfied). \n \n Please remember, to ask \"What caused God to act?\" shouldn't confuse the two different kinds of effects: \"beings (or things)\" and \"actions.\" God's actions are an effect that are caused by God himself. God's being is not an effect because it has always existed. Is God's acting an effect? The action is, but the being is not. \n \n So, to ask, \"What caused God's being to act?\" needs to be put under the microscope of the law of causality: every effect needs a cause. What is the effect in this question which demands a cause? It isn't God's being, but it is God's action; not the being but the action of that being. Thus the action requires a cause; the being satisfies that cause. You COULD go further, but since causality is satisfied, it is not required or demanded. Going further would just put the burden of proof on your shoulders.\n\n \n I've shown that causality is not satisfied in the above responses. Thought is action, so thought violates timelessness. And if thought existed without action in the period of timelessness, it couldn't have been the actual spark to create the first action, so you are back to the original problem of attributing causality to the initial action.",

The only definition left was the one about life, and I showed that the god does not fit the definition of 'living.' \n \n In order to say that he is living or has knowledge, there has to be some change... to say otherwise is to invent a panacea that explains the inconsistencies without explaining anything. For the knowledge or a state of being to exist, for him to be alive, it has to be an active choice of inactivity. You are left with infinity. A state of being is a state of experience... bliss is something you experience... experience requires time.\n \n Saying 'incorrect definition' was wrong of me. I wasn't referring to the definition you posed, but your application of the word, which did not fit the definition you gave. I should have said \"your incorrect application of the word.\" I said this, because it ultimately doesn't matter, and seemed to be the only thing you were responding to, allowing you to ignore the more major problems I posed. \n \n You say the thought that 'caused' the initial action was always present, but if the thought was present at the same time as inaction, it cant be credited as causing the action. There has to be something else, which also requires a cause, ad infinitum. \n \n Although I say that the animate thing is of less importance, it still presents a flaw in your logic that I'm not sure I have made clear (when combined with the causality argument). The unchanging 'knowledge' you say that god has always had (and thus justifies the animate claim), would not be a requirement of the creator, because as I have shown cannot be the cause of the initial action without requiring you to deal with infinity. Your inability to attribute a cause to the initial action leaves your argument in the same place as an uncaused universe. Since there is no need for knowledge, there is no need for an animate object to be the cause (your justification was that only an animate object can cause an action, but this is not the case, as the cause needs further explanation regardless of whether it comes from animate or inanimate objects.)\n \n I am repeating myself because you keep ignoring and dodging the questions. \n \n \nLet me be real clear, I agree that animate could be defined as something relating to 'acting' or 'causing' something (which would involve a change). But I'm also saying (and so is the dictionary) that this is NOT a necessity for animacy to be in place. You seem to think that it is a necessity, and thus you part with the dictionary. Can I ask where you got your definition?\n\n \n I showed conclusively that definitions 2 and 3 of animate are directly contradicted, and definition 1 is contradicted when you look at the definitions of living, alive, or any variant:\n \n Alive \n \n 1. having life; living; existing; not dead or lifeless.\n 2. living (used for emphasis): the proudest man alive.\n 3. in a state of action; in force or operation; active: to keep hope alive. \n \n There is no example that you can give of life without action or change. It is an invention of yours to explain away the problems in your hypothesis, and it does a poor job. \n \n \nHere's another possible scenario, the timeless being could have knowledge; it knows something, it knows itself, it knows what it is capable of, it knows just about whatever you want it to. Lets just say it knows X. This being isn't learning or unlearning anything; it isn't gaining knowledge nor is it losing the knowledge it has, it just knows (present tense) X. Something that is aware of knowledge would not be inanimate, yet being in a constant state of just knowing X would involve no change (not learning X, just knowing X). Something that has any type of knowledge is 'aware' and would have to be classified as animate; dead things don't know anything. So, besides your quarrel with the dictionary, what's the problem with something outside the physical universe (outside of time) that is animate?\n\n \n I don't think it is possible. Thinking would necessarily be impossible (as it is an action), and I don't see how knowledge can exist without the ability to think or choose (as I have shown, if there was choice, he would be constantly choosing inaction, bringing up infinity, which is an important part of your 'reasoning.') Something external to this knowledge would have had to have come along to break the timelessness, to allow his choice to act, and you are left with a lot of problems.\n \n I've shown you the other problems with your use of animate.\n \n Now, stop ignoring the major problems here: \n \n The first being the problem of causality, and how you necessarily have to break the chain to establish timelessness, and the second being your false dichotomy. I showed you that time and dimensions may not be as simple as what you suggest, and that all moments in time could exist at once (making infinity not a problem for your reasoning, and allowing everything to exist without ever being created).\n \n If I seem to be coming across as hostile, it is not intentional. It's just that you have led a long, drawn out argument, then when faced with your own hypothesis' lapse in logic and failure to eliminate all other possibilities, you won't give any response.",

So everything, the 'beginning' of the universe and everything else, is just a product of the way we perceive time. It would mean that even though we perceive time as something that changes, in 'reality' it doesn't change (and so there really never was a beginning... never a time when the beginning didn't exist and never a time when the end, or really any moment, didn't exist). \n \n I don't know if that is how things are or if that is even reasonable, but there is a lot more to time than just what we see. Like the hypotheses out there (in higher dimensional theories like string theory) that suggest that there could be more (higher) time dimensions in a similar way to that there are multiple spatial dimensions. This is kind of like what I was describing. In the same way that you can view every aspect of a 2D object from the 3rd dimension, a higher time dimension could allow you to view all aspects of the 1 dimensional time that we experience.",

In order to go from the state of 'just knowledge' to a state of action requires a decision, which requires a thought, which requires some external input (which also requires a cause, and we're off to the races). \n \n It can't be simply 'not choosing' because what would change to give him the sudden power of choice if the free will wasn't a property he had all along?

   " \n It all stems from the causality thing.\n \n\n What caused God to act? \n To address this question I must first point out something about the law of causality. It states that every effect has a cause. Now, it doesn't take much analysis to realize that this law is formally true; it is true by definition. 'Effect' carries with it the very notion of being caused and 'cause' carries with it the very notion of producing effects. Realizing this doesn't prove anything quite yet. Stating this law doesn't prove that the physical world had a cause, because it would need to be demonstrated that the physical world was an effect first. Then, and only then, would causality DEMAND that there was a cause. \n For me to demonstrate this, it was suffice to say that effects are contingencies, anything that is contingent is dependent on something else for it to exist; derivations, finite things, actions, events, anything that doesn't have the explanation in and of itself for its own existence or happening. I don't have to go through the whole thing again for our discussion, and I don't even know if you would agree with it, but the point is that the burden of proof would be on me to demonstrate that the physical world was an effect first before demanding that there was a cause. I am willing to carry this burden, and Databed agreed that it was very reasonable that something could have caused the physical universe to exist, that is why we moved on to talk about that 'something.'\n Now, for me to ask, \"What caused the physical universe to exist?\" is somewhat of a loaded question if you think about it, for the very question presupposes in it already that there was some cause behind the universe. The question is only asking for a qualified description of that cause. The same is true for the question \"What caused God to act?\" It is assuming at the outset that there was some antecedant cause to God which made him act.\n IF and ONLY IF there was something else causing God to do actions, it would definitely be an effect because the 'causing' of the situation by definition would imply this. However, you cannot reason from 'cause' to the 'effect' because that would be taking a leap; skipping over the existence of an effect in order to show that a cause produced the effect (which was skipped) is somewhat circular. You would have to reason from 'effect' to 'cause,' you would have to demonstrate an effect first before you can demand a cause; the burden of proof would shift to be on you. \n You have already agreed with me that God is not a contingency yet his action is a contingency. So, only God's action requires a cause. But isn't that just a redundant statement? To say \"God's action\" puts the 'action' under the qualitative possessive noun that is 'God.' So the action is God's, and God caused the action. But this is also a redundant statement! For God to cause anything would already be an action, so to say God caused an action would be like saying 'I began to begin.' What about saying 'God started to act'? This is also redundant because the word 'start' is used as a verb in that sentence and is thus already an action. Action requires actors, so it would be non-redundant and suffice to say 'the actor of the action, is God' or to say 'God acted' or 'God caused'.\n You want to reason to another cause behind the God behind the action, but this is a very heavy burden to prove. You would start with the act and have to reason back to something causing the actor to act. But remember, only the act requires an actor (God) not a cause (actor) beyond that. Causality does not say \"every cause has another cause\" nor does it say \"every effect has two or more causes\" it is only \"every effect has a cause\" so causality is satisfied. You can try to prove that God's acting is an effect, but I think you will only run into redundant statements. \n To ask the question \"What caused the action of God?\" is to answer it in the same sentence.",

You want to attempt to go from a state of inanimateness and knowledge to a state of action without acknowledging the necessary state of thought and decision. As I have shown, this is just not possible, since a state of unchanging knowledge can't lead to change without some change in itself (some form of thinking). \n \n Your argument about the cause of the action coming from 'God' fails for this reason. Due to the limitations you have found yourself trapped in (that God cannot think or have any external inputs), the action can't be explained by your static, inanimate God. You have conceded that God was inanimate in order to achieve timelessness, and I have shown that the knowledge he had is irrelevant as it could not be the cause of the action on its own; so saying that God caused the action is no different than saying a tiny, intensely dense ball of energy caused the Big Bang.

If I just said \"causation is met, the Big Bang was caused by fluctutation; you are being redundant.\" Then I'm sure you wouldn't be convinced, just as I am not convinced by your argument.\n \n \nNo I don't deny it. I agree that the action requires an actor. Something acted. But you have not demonstrated that something else caused this something to act.\n\n \n I don't have to. I've never asserted that anything at all caused the act. I accept the possibility of an eternal form of a universe, the possibility of an uncaused universe, and the possibility of the universe being caused by something I don't know of, and more things that I might not be able to comprehend. You are the one who has established a false dichotomy and then launched into a thoroughly unconvincing argument that a specific type of God made an uncaused decision to cause it all. \n \n \nI don't deny that an action requires an actor, or that something was causing. But the fact that something was causing IS already an action of that something. To say something caused an action is merely redundancy, and not getting anywhere.\n\n \n Again, that's the chain of causality. It's a b****, ain't it?\n \n \nThinking is an action. You are basically demanding that \"you can't get change without change\", this is redundant and pointless. Causality does NOT say \"you can't get effects without effects.\" Rather it DOES says \"you can't get effects without causes.\"\n \n Everything your saying just boils down to \"acts always require previous acts.\" If you think causality demands that, you are wrong. Saying that \"acts require actors\" satisfies the conditions of causality \"an effect (an act) requires a cause (an actor)\"\n All you've proven is that IF and only IF acts always required previous acts, you run into absurdities. But I showed, causality does not demand that.\n\n \n You have yet to give a cause that doesn't need a cause itself. When you satisfactorily do this, I'll stop demanding you to satisfy the chain of causation. It's not my fault that the chain of causation leads to infinities (and thus what you state as absurdities). It's your problem.",

In other words, if I say \"This movie is an hour and a half\", I'm referencing a time frame. The movie is a relative 90 minutes long from beginning to end - starting from t=0 to t=90.

A relative distance is like saying \"I live 5 km from the grocery store - s=0 to s=5.\"\n \n So, as you can see, relative measurements always exist, but the beginning and thus the end of time and/or distance doesn't make sense out of our knowledge of relation.",

Just keep in mind the important point is what I said in the previous post (and it's restated in here in bold):\n \n Thinking makes a state of timelessness impossible because it is an action and requires external input. You have agreed with both of those things. But how can a decision occur without thinking? How can an actor act without without thinking or moving? He can't, which means something has to change between a state of static knowledge and a state of action. I've shown why this can't be internal, so you are stuck. \n \n You can stick to the cute 'actors/actions' thing all you want, and how other people accept that a god that has always existed could create everything. But those people don't deny the possibility of infinity as you have done. In the case of the actor, he is a sufficient explanation in the everyday sense, and while it is still not that specific (as a cause can be further broken down in terms of decisions and thoughts), it is understandable given that 'everyday life' is an open system complete with new ideas, thoughts, decisions, and movements.\n \n Most people who describe a creator god also don't see eternity as being static (most Christians for instance believe there was quite a bit of action before time with the angels and Satan, and they believe in an eternal heaven and hell which is anything but a static eternity), so they don't have to answer the question I am posing to you. They have no problems with the idea of thinking and deciding occurring in eternity... by taking your view, you have changed what it means to be an 'actor.' By taking away the action of thinking, you have made it impossible for your god, no matter whether you want to call him animate or not, to be an actor. You accuse me of changing definitions, but you are the one throwing around terms like animate, life, consciousness, acting, and awareness in a state where thinking, reacting, moving, or changing anything is impossible. You are acting as if the definitions that are used in our everyday lives are still valid when you make all these adjustments for timelessness. \n \n Knowledge by itself is little more than data. You have 'reasoned' yourself into a situation where your god is nothing more than a huge hard drive with no computer attached to allow it to be put to use.\n \n As soon as he makes the decision/begins to act, time has to start. Time has to start as soon as he starts thinking to make the decision, so the decision itself can't be the cause of time beginning. The reason the actor can be used to justify an action is because the actor is understood to be allowed to think, decide, etc. \n \n Saying that a person is the cause is a simplification that works in normal, everyday life. But when you break it down, it was a movement a person made, caused by a decision, caused by thinking, caused by some sort of input. Your situation can't involve external input, thought, a decision, or any of that.\n \n You said this:\n \n \nIf you want to demand that something else caused this being(God) to act (which means you are claiming a prior event or action to God's action) \n\n \n You are forced to acknowledge that the action was caused by a decision and some sort of thinking. These things are incompatible with the state of timelessness. There can not be a state of eternal decision, as that leads to a state of constant action (and thus infinity). Your god supposedly has a state of knowledge, meaning an 'infinite' number of thoughts. But all those thoughts must be simultaneous to achieve timelessness. A decision requires time. Since a decision requires time, time cannot be the result of a decision. (It could also be stated that since action requires time, time cannot be the result of action). \n \n Also, life and consciousness are synonyms? What about plants? Artificial intelligence?",

Just keep in mind the important point is what I said in the previous post (and it's restated in here in bold)\n \n\n Your two main points were:\n \n (1) In order to act, one first needs to decide, which requires one to think, which requires external output.\n (2) Actions require time.\n \n I could respond to everything you said, but I think you'd agree it would save time to stick to the core arguments.\n \n 1. You are just falling into the redundancy trap I warned you of earlier. Let's break it down. I say: \"Something acts.\" You say: \"NO, something needs to decide first and then act.\"\n But if something needs to decide first, isn't deciding already an action? To decide would be acting, and so you are saying something needs to act (decide) first and then act. But this just gets us right back where we started, to what I had already said: something acts. You then push it a step farther by saying: In order to decide (act) one needs to think. But again, to think is also an action, thinking is classified under the category of acting as well. You are again saying that in order for one to act (as in decide) one first needs to act (or think). You come full swing back to what I was already saying; something acts. All you're doing is trying to get into the details of what the acts specifically were, but you will have to admit, they are all acts in the end. After you chase your own tail around in a few circles and get nowhere, you conclude that external input is then necessary a.k.a something else caused the something to act. I think you are concluding this for one of two reasons, one may be that you are unaware that you have not proven an external cause, all you've done is gone in a circle (ending right back to what I was saying) and then asserting it with no proof. The other is that you still have a wrong view of causality. Your definition of causality would be something like \"every cause has a cause\" or \"all causes are also effects\" or \"everything has a cause.\" I would like you to pause for a second and reflect on the huge difference there is between those definitions and the definition that is \"every effect has a cause\"\n \n 2. I would like to know some more of your view on this before giving a response. Does time precede action chronologically? Which theory of time are you referring to, generally speaking is it Theory A series or Theory B series? Do you object to defining time as a measurement of change? If so, what is the definition you are using?",

   "Your two main points were:\n \n (1) In order to act, one first needs to decide, which requires one to think, which requires external output.\n (2) Actions require time.\n \n I could respond to everything you said, but I think you'd agree it would save time to stick to the core arguments.\n \n 1. You are just falling into the redundancy trap I warned you of earlier. Let's break it down. I say: \"Something acts.\" You say: \"NO, something needs to decide first and then act.\"\n But if something needs to decide first, isn't deciding already an action? To decide would be acting, and so you are saying something needs to act (decide) first and then act. But this just gets us right back where we started, to what I had already said: something acts. You then push it a step farther by saying: In order to decide (act) one needs to think. But again, to think is also an action, thinking is classified under the category of acting as well. You are again saying that in order for one to act (as in decide) one first needs to act (or think). You come full swing back to what I was already saying; something acts. All you're doing is trying to get into the details of what the acts specifically were, but you will have to admit, they are all acts in the end. After you chase your own tail around in a few circles and get nowhere, you conclude that external input is then necessary a.k.a something else caused the something to act. I think you are concluding this for one of two reasons, one may be that you are unaware that you have not proven an external cause, all you've done is gone in a circle (ending right back to what I was saying) and then asserting it with no proof. The other is that you still have a wrong view of causality. Your definition of causality would be something like \"every cause has a cause\" or \"all causes are also effects\" or \"everything has a cause.\" I would like you to pause for a second and reflect on the huge difference there is between those definitions and the definition that is \"every effect has a cause\"\n \n 2. I would like to know some more of your view on this before giving a response. Does time precede action chronologically? Which theory of time are you referring to, generally speaking is it Theory A series or Theory B series? Do you object to defining time as a measurement of change? If so, what is the definition you are using?\n\n \n 1. It's not chasing my tail around. I agree that all those things are actions (which I have previously said), but after admitting that thinking is impossible in a timeless state you still tried to pass off that God 'acted' when he created everything. I was just showing that the particular action of creating everything requires its own action to cause it, and that (thinking) was an action that you admitted wasn't possible in the state you put God into. \n \n \nI concede that thinking does not happen in a single state of consiousness or in a constant state of just knowing, because thinking would imply gaining knowledge or losing it or some action. But all I said was just \"knowing\" or having the knowledge (without the thinking). What's the contradiction in just that?\n\n \n Here you state that thinking requires something external (to gain knowledge). Even in this most recent post you concede that God must think, but that it doesn't change your original statement (that he must act). So in your own posts you agree that God needed something external to act (think/decide/create). \n \n 2. I'm not familiar with either 'theory,' I'm just going with what I know about time... that it is one of the dimensions of the universe (this is important as Einstein has shown that time and space are interwoven). If you only looked at time in a classical sense as a measure of change (which is true, but it doesn't give the whole picture of time), then you might argue that any change would necessarily 'start' time, but with the realization that time is a dimension not all that different from (and intimately connected to) the spatial dimensions, it has to also be created in the same way. My only other assumption (that I can think of) is that I took your view to be that a cause must precede the effect. \n \n So that all leads to the same point:\n \n An action is a change, and since change requires time, time can't be the result of action. To say otherwise isn't much different than saying time created itself, and knowing what we know about relativity, that would leave space in a very awkward position. So what caused time?",

Movement through time and space are 'shared.'). For time to exist separately, it wouldn't be time. The time required for your hypothesis to work is an archaic leftover from Newton's day. How would time even 'tick'? You can't say it would tick as it does in this universe in a state of 'rest,' because there is no such thing as a state of rest without space. Time itself is a property of space (and of mass/energy)... if those things don't exist, time doesn't exist. You are basically inventing an independent property that has never existed and basing your argument off of it.\n \n Time is treated as a separate dimension because of our perception. In our world of low speed, time seems like a completely steady thing, just marching on regardless of what we do. If we lived at speeds close to the speed of light or in hugely varying gravitational fields, we wouldn't view it that way (you can get a feel of it from the example of movement being 'shared').\n \n I accept the definition of time as a measure of change because that is our perception of it. That's not to say that it is an accurate depiction of the reality of time (science knows very little about the reality of time, and some think time doesn't exist at all in a 'flowing' sense). The problem is that you are asserting your hypothesis as the only possible explanation, while at the same time assuming that the reality of time, which is something science knows almost nothing about, is exactly as we perceive it, while also taking away what little we do know about it scientifically.\n \n If you are willing to change the nature of time (if you can even call it time), why should anyone accept your hypothesis as possible (let alone the only possibility)?

The question is how.\n\n \n I wasn't implying that there was nothing moving or nothing changing. I said if the person (not his heart or bodily functions, which would still be working) was completely at rest in space (which I admit is not possible, but this is a hypothetical situation), his body is traveling only through time and not space (and even if there is just a little bit of movement, the vast majority of his movement is through time... the point wasn't about complete motionless, it was just about how motion is shared due to relativity). This was in contrast to the [not hypothetical] photon, which does not age due to moving 100% through space. Another example of time depending on space is in black holes. If there is indeed a singularity (an infinite curl of space, which would mean 0-space) at its heart, time ends there. It has long been said that \"Time ends in a black hole\" for this reason (I'm not arguing that it is indeed a singularity, though, as I find singularities kind of unsatisfying, but this has long been the view). \n \n \nActually, Newton believed time was always &#8216;flowing&#8217; whereas I&#8217;m saying time only &#8216;flows&#8217; when change happens (the first thing you said).\n\n \n I was speaking of his view that time and space were independent.\n \n \nLike this: Tick, tock, tick, tock &#8230; etc.\n That is fine if you want space and time to start simultaneously, I&#8217;m not so sure you&#8217;ve proven that they have to, but I don&#8217;t see anything logically inconsistent with saying that God created spacetime and his creation of spacetime was coincidental with spacetime beginning.\n\n \n You have already agreed that space itself needs a cause, and if an action cannot exist without space-time, you are right back to the same dilemma: An action requires space-time, therefore space-time cannot be created by an action. As soon as God's \"action\" would start, space-time would have to exist, leaving it with no cause. \n \n \nBecause it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that spacetime&#8217;s had a beginning and thus was caused, and objecting to causality on the grounds that &#8216;causality cannot happen outside of time&#8217; has already been dealt with.\n\n \n No. You haven't shown how space-time could have been caused. You agreed that it needed creating (as opposed to you stating that time could just 'start'), but space-time now falls into the problem I originally stated for time. Action requires it to exist, so it can't be caused by an action.\n \n And you are again making these assumptions about the true nature of time. Why should I accept these assumptions? Why should I agree that our perception of time, which has constantly been shown to be wrong, be the true reality of time? Again, you are talking about a subject of which science knows very little, and you are making assumptions based on our perception... all of your arguments could be rendered invalid if time is not as we perceive.
