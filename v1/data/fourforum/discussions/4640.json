But I keep expecting to hear, as Paul Harvey would say, the rest of the story. \n \n The finger did not come from one of Wendy's employees at the store. So where did it come from?

   "It's bad news for Wendy's for certain, but regardless of who actually  made the chilli, Wendy's is the retailer.If they choose to subcontract part of their franchise to anothermanufacturer[and pretty much all fast-food franchises do], they still have the responsibility to ensure that the goods that they offer the public are of adequate quality.\n \n Rather than beat up Wendy's for this error, people should see it as a risk factor when purchasing ANY processed food. The more people handle your food between harvest and plate, the more chance there is that it could be contaminated, with evrything from a tiny bug to a stray digit. The simple act of adding a slice of processed cheese, for example, adds another 5 pairs of hands and 50 yards of production line to your hamburger.Plus all the exra pairs of hands that created the raw ingredients. It may take longer and cost more to make your burger from scratch at home, but it will most likely be better for you.When you have a process with many fingers in the pie, you inevitably end up with one finger left behind at the end.",
