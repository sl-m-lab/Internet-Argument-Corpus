   "British engineers have developed a new environmentally friendly cement that is carbon-negative | Environment | guardian.co.uk\n \n I'm sure most people are aware that, after transport and agriculture, construction, particularly concrete and cement, is one of the biggest sources of carbon emissions worldwide. The development of a carbon negative cement, if it is effective, could be a real boon. If nothing else it means that essential infrastructure improvements (railway construction, improved power plants, bases for turbines) are no longer going to mean CO2 emissions getting worse before they get better.",
