   "From the Wall Street Journal:\n \n All About Evo\n By MARY ANASTASIA O'GRADY\n December 23, 2005; Page A15\n Sunday's election of Evo Morales as president of Bolivia is more bad news for liberty in Latin America. Winning on an anti-market, anti-trade and anti-investment platform, Mr. Morales' victory does not bode well for a nation already impoverished, backward, isolated and desperately in need of economic growth.\n \n The role of Fidel Castro and his apprentice, Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, in Bolivian politics is no less discouraging. There is some concern that Mr. Morales may be coached to attempt a Ch\u00e1vez redux in Bolivia, consolidating power in a constitutional assembly set for July and destroying his political competition under the guise of legality. Whether what is left of Bolivia's fragile democracy can survive a Morales presidency with Ch\u00e1vez as the president's patron remains to be seen.\n \n Yet Mr. Morales won a strong, legitimate victory, and to focus on the Castro influence as the driver behind his win is to ignore the pillars of fear, anger and resentment on which his popularity is built.\n \n The fear was registered by a working class tired of the violence waged by Bolivia's left. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some Bolivians felt Mr. Morales had the best chance of bringing radicals -- many of whom are far more extreme than he is -- under control and ending repeated roadblocks that have paralyzed the economy in the last two years. The anger and resentment were reserved for the traditional political class and the war on drugs, both of which played crucial roles in enhancing Mr. Morales' popularity.\n \n To trace the Morales ascendance, travel back in time to the 1997 presidential elections, when the late Gen. Hugo Banzer placed first, but with only 22% of the vote. Needing a coalition partner to seal his victory in a congressional vote, he turned to the left-of-center MIR party led by Jaime Paz Zamora.\n \n That alliance set off alarm bells in Washington because the MIR party allegedly had drug trafficking ties and the U.S. had already pulled Mr. Paz Zamora's visa. The party's secretary general, Oscar Eid, was even jailed in Bolivia in 1996 on charges of links to drug trafficking. To alleviate gringo concerns and ensure the flow of foreign aid, Banzer pledged a scorched earth policy toward coca growers in Bolivia's Chapare region, promising to \"wipe out\" the cultivation of the ancient leaf during his tenure.\n \n Banzer and his vice president Jorge Quiroga -- who was the center-right candidate in the Sunday election -- waged war on coca in the Chapare in 1998 and 1999. Meeting their goal did nothing to alter America's cocaine habits but it did produce a sharp recession and a migration of poor, unemployed Bolivians to urban centers. One place they showed up was Bolivia's third-largest city, Cochabamba, where in 2000, according to the then-Minister of Information Ronald MacLean-Abraoa, they were easily mobilized in rioting against the privatization of water service.\n \n The Cochabamba water privatization was the perfect storm for Bolivia's hard left. But the center-right handed the Trotskyites the weapons they needed to kill modernity. In fact, the \"water war,\" as the tragedy became known, exemplified many of the misdeeds committed throughout the region during a period of supposed reform. The \"market\" got a black eye, but facts show that experiments in reform often fell far short of economic liberalism. Instead, special interests and politicians tried to use \"reform\" to get rich and carve out privileges. They endorsed half-measures and ignored the importance of competition.\n \n According to Fredrik Segerfeldt, in \"Water for Sale\" (Cato Institute, 2005), Cochabamba water prices, having been heavily subsidized, went up after the 1999 privatization, but not by the astronomical amount that enemies of the sale claimed. One reason bills were higher was that previous shortages were alleviated so consumption quickly climbed.\n \n However, there were other issues. \"The blame to be pinned on the local authorities has been disregarded,\" Mr. Segerfeldt writes. Cochabamba Mayor \"Manfred Reyes Villa, known as Bonbon, had connections with companies that would profit from the construction of a dam and he insisted against the advice of the World Bank that the dam be included in the [water] project, which incurred an extra cost of millions of dollars.\" Another plan, not requiring a new dam, had been tried in 1997, but \"Bonbon stopped it cold,\" notes Mr. Segerfeldt. \"The local political situation was a mess of patronage, populism and vanity projects.\"\n \n Bonbon's dam gave the real \"losers\" in the privatization -- Cochabamba's vested interests, including subsidized upper-income households and commercial actors -- what they needed to excite the masses. \"These groups cynically exploited poor urban dwellers as an excuse for safeguarding their own interests.\" The street violence grew so intense that Banzer had to declare a state of siege.\n \n The government reversed the water privatization but the damage was done. The \"p\" word became a bogeyman, despite the fact, as Mr. Segerfeldt points out, \"the poor of Cochabamba are still paying 10 times as much for their water as the rich, connected households and continue to indirectly subsidize water consumption of more well-to-do sector of the community. Water nowadays is available only four hours a day and no new households have been connected to the supply network.\"\n \n Lingering resentment transformed the displaced \"cocaleros\" into a radicalized political force, which broadened its agenda against all things American. Mr. Morales, who built his political career as a leader of the \"cocaleros,\" is riding that tiger to the presidential palace.\n \n Yet he will not have an easy job of it. The hard left will press him to nationalize gas reserves and has already promised violence if its wishes are not granted. Brazil will try to make him moderate his approach since its Petrobras is already a big player in the Bolivian gas market. It cannot be lost on Mr. Morales that most of the country's reserves are untapped and without foreign investment will remain so.\n \n The Morales economic platform doesn't promise a future to Bolivians, only revenge. That can't take him far and the opposition will have ample opportunity to challenge him. Whether it can compete will depend a lot on whether it has learned from its mistakes of warring against coca growers to satisfy Uncle Sam and abusing its power to deny Bolivians equality under the law.",

   "Up From the Coca Fields . . . A Charismatic Leader\n In regard to Mary O'Grady's analysis of Evo Morales in \"All About Evo\" (Americas, Dec. 23): Bolivia's new president is in some way the creation of an ill-conceived and executed U.S. policy of coca-leaves eradication by the current and past administrations; this and the so-called Cochabamba water war of 2000 (the water privatization issue lucidly summarized by Ms. O'Grady).\n \n Many of the displaced peasants on small plots in the Cochamba subtropical region found a new subsistence by cultivating coca leaves. It is a hardy crop that is easy to grow, harvest, transport and market. The peasants are hard-working entrepreneurs. No alternate crop can alleviate the loss of these peasants' income as a result of the cocoa-leaf eradication program. The angry peasants found a man who is one of them to fight back -- Evo Morales, a charismatic leader.\n \n Charles W. Arnade -- Distinguished Professor Emeritus\n International Studies -- University of South Florida -- Tampa, Fla.\n \n Ms. O'Grady is correct in suggesting that the citizen revolt against water privatization in 2000, in which the Bechtel Corp. was kicked out of the country, was the spark that ignited a string of events that led to the election of Evo Morales as president earlier this month.\n \n However, the reason that citizens revolted against Bechtel had nothing to do with coca farmers and everything to do with Bechtel raising water rates for the poor an average of nearly 50% overnight, and in many cases by much more. Also, it was not the citizens of Bolivia who rioted but the government. A former dictator, Hugo Banzer, responded to peaceful protests by sending 1,200 national police to take over the country's third-largest city. An army sharpshooter, caught on camera, shot an unarmed 17-year-old in the face and killed him.\n \n These events are a good part of the reason that Bolivians are justifiably skeptical of the suggested wonders of the Washington Consensus formula of privatization.\n \n Jim Shultz -- Executive Director\n The Democracy Center -- Cochabamba, Bolivia",
