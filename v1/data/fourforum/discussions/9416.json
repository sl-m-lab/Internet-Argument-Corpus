   "Robertson predicts 'mass killing' Tue Jan 2, 6:29 PM ET\n \n \n \n VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. - In what has become an annual tradition of prognostications, religious broadcaster Pat Robertson predicted Tuesday that a terrorist attack on the United States would result in \"mass killing\" late in 2007. \n \n \"I'm not necessarily saying it's going to be nuclear,\" he said during his news-and-talk television show \"The 700 Club\" on the Christian Broadcasting Network. \"The Lord didn't say nuclear. But I do believe it will be something like that.\"\n \n Robertson said God told him during a recent prayer retreat that major cities and possibly millions of people will be affected by the attack, which should take place sometime after September.\n \n Robertson said God also told him that the U.S. only feigns friendship with Israel and that U.S. policies are pushing Israel toward \"national suicide.\"\n \n Robertson suggested in January 2006 that God punished then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon with a stroke for ceding Israeli-controlled land to the Palestinians.\n \n The broadcaster predicted in January 2004 that President Bush would easily win re-election. Bush won 51 percent of the vote that fall, beating Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts. He also predicted Bush's victory for a second term in 2005.\n \n \"I have a relatively good track record,\" he said. \"Sometimes I miss.\"\n \n In May, Robertson said God told him that storms and possibly a tsunami were to crash into America's coastline in 2006. Even though the U.S. was not hit with a tsunami, Robertson on Tuesday cited last spring's heavy rains and flooding in New England as partly fulfilling the prediction.\n\n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070102/ap_on_re_us/robertson_prediction\n \n I'm really starting to think that Pat is a sick, sick man in need of serious medication and possible electro-shock therapy.",

As to what he claims to be his \"track record\" I'd say it's pretty poor. Predicting that Bush would win easily when he really won only with 51 percent? Doesn't sound easy to me. Then there is his squirming around trying to say after a claim of a tsunami that rains fulfilled his prediction. How laughable. I think he truly needs mental help.",
