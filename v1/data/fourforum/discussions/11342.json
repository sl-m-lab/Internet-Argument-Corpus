And many essentially homosexual men can persuade themselves that if they live the heterosexual lifestyle, it means they aren't homosexual.\n \n People can choose the labels they use to define themselves, and vary in the way they see themselves. Whether it's possible to develop some kind of objective test that unfailingly determines a person's \"real\" sexual orientation, despite what they themselves may think about it, is dubious. All one can really go on is observed behaviour and reported fantasy life (what turns them on). While it's probably possible to assign most people to some value on a gay-bi-straight spectrum (e.g. the Kinsey scale), there is always going to be a residue of cases with some ambiguity in category choice.

Bi people are sometimes considered to be \"just experimenting\" or fence sitting or trying to have the best of both worlds, or otherwise not \"really\" bi. They're thought to be in a transitional state while they figure out if they're gay or straight, and not really taken seriously until they \"make up their minds\".

So are you really asking about \"scientific classifications\", or are you asking about self knowledge? The two approaches are different, and need to be dealt with differently.\n\n I actually don't see them as separate issues. If someone can be born with a sexual identity which can be scientifically verified, then they should be able to easily identify that identity by objective means. Why would anyone even entertain the thought of being born gay if they know that being gay is not a permanent or inate characteristic. On the other hand, if it is, why is there so much evidence to the contrary. \n \n To me the sexual orientation thing could be under one of 2 models. Either people are born gay, with objective identifiers to demonstrate this, or people can be on different levels of the gay-straight scale at different times during their lives. Of course it could be also that some people are born either gay or straight and have permanent built-in sexual orientations, and others have the ability to experience fluctuations in their sexual attractions. \n \n In my specific case, from my personal observation, the lines become even blurrier when you consider the permutations of sexual attraction and identity. You have those who are gay but are submissive or dominant oriented. You have those with varying levels of effeminate personality traits that may not even be attracted to men. You have those who feel they are naturally oriented a certain way, and those who feel that they conciously chose their sexual identity. And you have those that struggle to maintain a sexual identity because of the social role they feel the need to fill even though they may secretly be attracted to members of the next gender as well and never confess it.\n \n So my question again is, can we really rely on scientific classifications and conclusions in exploring the causes of being gay?",

If we are to determine which sexual orientation is the permanent inate one, how can one know for sure?\n\n \n Well, what we have to understand that concepts of sexual orientation are human constructs, and are an attempt to shoehorn a complex psychological phenomenon into a dichotomous conceptual category. For all that sexual orientation is rooted in biological reality, it does have cultural connotations, and cannot be defined fully objectively, the way, say, you can define an electron or chemical.\n \n A sexual orientation is a human attempt to describe a poorly understood human experience derived from basic biology, and basic biology doesn't need to conform to human concepts. While it's understandable why we try to simplify by dichotomising -- it's either A or not-A, and don't bother me with complexities! -- that doesn't reflect biological reality faithfully. It's a convenient fiction for legal purposes, analogous to the age of majority.\n \n When you consider the age of majority, there really isn't any particular point in time when a child becomes an adult. They don't all of a sudden mature when they are 16, 18 or 21. There is no clear phase transition, as it were, when childhood tranforms into adulthood. It's a unitary growth and developmental process. Childhood and adulthood are arbitrary points in that growth process which are convenient to hold as true in legal terms, because law does not easily deal with fuzzy categories, at least not as easily as science and mathematics can. Perhaps discovering one's sexual nature is similar, and while it is tempting to think it always has to be simple, there is no real reason why it should be.\n \n So if someone isn't certain how to describe their sexual orientation, I'm not particularly worried. I would expect some people to experience more complex feelings, though others, maybe most, I don't know, might fit a dichotomous model more easily. The world's more complex than we like to imagine.",

Just because the labels we use aren't perfectly descriptive doesn't mean that they do not reflect some underlying biological reality, even if we tend to oversimplify it.\n \n Sexual orientation simply isn't as fluid for most people as you appear to think, and I've no idea where you got that notion. Certainly, it wasn't from reading anything remotely scientific. However, neither is it as simplistic as people find it convenient for various reasons to suppose.\n \n And in neither case does it make any sense to suppose that it isn't innate, as all the research that's been done leads to the conclusion that for virtually all people, there is no control over their sexual orientation.

If someone can be born with a sexual identity which can be scientifically verified, then they should be able to easily identify that identity by objective means.\n\n \n Why on earth would you suppose that to be true? Is it always easy to identify what is going on in your own noggin by objective means? When we are talking sexual orientation, we are discussing a psychological trait, not a physical secondary sexual characteristic. However, I do note that recent science may be pointing towards ways in which we CAN associate sexual orientation with physical structures in the brain. It's early days yet.\n \n \nWhy would anyone even entertain the thought of being born gay if they know that being gay is not a permanent or inate characteristic. On the other hand, if it is, why is there so much evidence to the contrary.\n \n \n Because ALL the SCIENTIFIC evidence shows that adult sexual orientation is NOT determined by childhood social environment or learning. It appears to be determined pre-natally, though there remains a lot of scientific discussion as to the mechanisms. Further, innate characteristics do not have to be instant or permanent (e.g. a full head of hair), nor are they necessarily expressed at fixed times during or after development. Many innate traits only appear relatively late in life (e.g. male pattern baldness).\n \n Moreover, you just have to ask any gay or straight person if they have any degree of control over it, or if they ever considered making a choice. It develops naturally, a result of biological development, hence we describe it as innate as opposed to learned.\n \n \nSo my question again is, can we really rely on scientific classifications and conclusions in exploring the causes of being gay?\n\n \n Look. Any scientific classification system is subject to revision, and maybe sexual psychology is far more complex than simplistic models have supposed. OK, fine, so what? However, the classifications are based on objective data and analysis. The first scientist to make this attempt statistically was, of course, Kinsey, and even he realised the limitations of his 7-point scale. That doesn't mean it has no biological base.",

The science here is in its infancy. Even if sexual orientiation is 100% biological in origin (which we don't know) we're no where near being able to determine someone's orientation just by doing some test.\n \n \n\n So my question again is, can we really rely on scientific classifications and conclusions in exploring the causes of being gay? \n\n Only to within the limits of the study in question. As i said, this field is a very young field. Scientists are still finding their way, and are having to shed misconceptions as they go. One limitation, as you have mentioned, is that self-identification is the only way to say if someone is gay or not, and that's not a perfect system. However, we know it isn't a perfect system, and the people doing the studies can take that into account. They can't eliminate the problem, but they can emiliorate it such that meaningful results can be obtained concerning homosexuality. So, can we 100% rely on conclusions being presented today? No, but then I know of no scientists that are claiming 100% reliable results. At this point they're merely pointing out correlations.",

This is your belief even though you admit that the studies that support this idea are preliminary at best. \n\n \n All the biological studies point in the same direction -- a genetic or prenatal biological influence.

One can do what Kinsey did, and set up classifications based on self-reported behaviour, whatever labels the interviewee might use or prefer. That has the virtue of being more objective than self-reported labelling, and is what most post-Kinsey studies have done. Still, there's no particular harm in using self-descriptions, so long as interviewees are clear what is meant by them. Then they can pick which lable seems to fit their own experience best.\n \n \nI don't know about you, but based on the discussion so far, I see a problem here. We are using a personal subjective labelling system as the premise of a study that should be based on objective and testable observable phenomenon.\n \n \n When you are dealing with human emotions, a degree of subjectivity is inevitable. However, we can compare that to actual behaviour whenever we need to. We can measure phsyiological responses to sexual stimuli. We can ask questions about what turns people on. In other words, we can do lots of things to objectively confirm or disconfirm an individual's self-description.\n \n I'm not claiming any method is perfect, but you are completely wrong in claiming it's all purely subjective, and therefore has no substance, as if you were wanting to make the phenomenon of sexual orientation disappear by claiming it's a figment of everyone's imagination.\n \n That just doesn't wash.\n \n \nHow can we determine if our study participants are permanently and verifiably gay to begin with? Can we?\n \n \n You can't, any more than you can determine whether any study subject is going to be permanently thin or permanently healthy. All you can do is determine behaviour up to that point in time, personal self-description, and correlate this to whatever physical parameter, say brain structure or genes, you happen to be interested in. It's a standard scientific method for establishing correlations, which is the first step in determining causes.\n \n \nAs for sexual orientation being uncontrolable and beyond one's choice, there are people that beg to differ. There is a sizable portion of the gay community that claim they chose to be gay. And then there's a large portion that claim they were gay all their lives. The issue is either way, we are relying on the word of the individual based on their subjective assessment of their sexuality. And while this is all well and good for social purposes, can we use this as the basis of scientific conclusions?\n\n \n They can beg whatever they want, but they usually have a political or religious agenda to push. There is not, for example, \"a sizable portion of the gay community that claim they chose to be gay\". I don't know where you got that notion from, but it's false. That's certainly not been my experience, nor the experience of any gay person I've talked to. I've never known any heterosexuals who \"chose\" their sexual orientation, either.\n \n Now, while I'm willing to be persuaded that for a small number of people, sexual orientation isn't immutable over a lifetime, I've never met any, nor have I seen or heard of any reputable studies of people who claim to have changed their sexual orientation. I don't claim such people don't exist, I merely suggest that IF they do, then they form a tiny proportion of the gay and straight populations.\n \n Finally, as I pointed out, the best scientific studies do not rely solely on anyone's word -- though why you think gay people would lie or dissemble about this, I've no idea. They check behaviour as well. \n \n You seem to be saying that if people say they are gay, then we should assume they are lying about their sexual orientation, unless scientists can identify exactly what makes them gay. But why would scientists investigate the phenomenon of sexual orientation at all if we were to assume that everyone who claims to have one is deluded? Are we to make the same assumption for every human emotion? If someone you love dies, should we assume you don't actually feel sorrow, because that is, after all, purely a subjective emotion?\n \n Just because a feeling is subjective and doesn't have instant external physiological identifying marks doesn't mean it isn't real, biological or worth investigating scientifically. I mean, are you expecting to see some lavender triangle to identify gay people beyond all shadow of any doubt? Scientists do take appropriate precautions to ensure they aren't chasing wild geese.",

This is pretty much a necessary feature for them to be published in reputable journals in the first place. Certainly, Kinsey discussed such issues extensively in his publications.\n \n Secondary publications discussing the primary literature may not be as scrupulous, but then, my advice to anyone wanting to know the worth of a study is to read the original publication, not subsequent discussions, and especially not in the popular press.\n \n \nI remember one of these studies in particular, broadcasted among gay websites all over as \"more evidence that people may be born gay\".

That study is still being touted as evidence for people being born gay. I can get the link for you if want.\n \n \n Well, I can't comment on a media article referring to a scientific study you haven't referenced. As I pointed out above, press reports are not necessarily as scrupulous or careful as the original work. I know of NO scientist in any field who has been reported in the popular press who has been unreservedly pleased with the treatment of his or her work. A lot gets left out.\n \n \nSexual orientation may not be subjective, but relying on personal labels is. I'd actually be very interested in the results of studies where the participants were classified solely on testable hypotheses such as measured arousal levels etc. Like I said in my opening post, the issue is how do we reliably and objectively tell whether a person is of a particular orientation without the label the person gives himself at the particular point in his or her life.\n \n \n I've already answered this extensively, so there is little point in repeating the question. There ARE ways of testing subjective evaluations, and usually, there is little need to doubt a person's word in this case. If it appears there there IS a need -- say because test subjects are being paid so there is a financial incentive to say one is something one is not -- then again there are objective ways of testing. However, it is difficult to guard against outright and deliberate attempts to fool researchers. They do tend to assume their respondents are being honest with them. \n \n However, do you seriously suppose there is any reason why people should be dishonest when they say they are gay? There may occasionally be room for doubt, but frequently, not a whole lot. If someone tells me they're gay, I'll tend to take them at face value, unless there is observable reason to doubt their veracity. It's rare that everyone in a study is conspiring to fool the researcher -- that usually only happens on the ex-gay side of the debate.\n \n \nwww.queerbychoice.com\n \n Its not a huge site or massive community, but apparently there are gays out there who believe that they chose to be gay. How could this even exist if being of a particular sexual orientation is inate and permanent? Unless all the references and quotes on the entire sites and the sites linked from it are all lies...\n\n \n Look, just because a handful of people claim they are gay by choice, and who knows what motivation they might have to say that, or why they might feel that, that doesn't mean it's common among gays. I repeat, there may well be few like that. I never said it was impossible. I just don't think it's very common, because all the evidence I'm aware of says it isn't. The vast majority of gays report a fixed orientation for life. Why do you insist that everyone be the same here? Why is it impossible for the sexual orientation of MOST gay people to be fixed and innate, even if the sexual orientation of SOME turns out not to be?\n \n \nI never implied that everyone lies or is deluded about their sexual orientation, or that we should assume that people are wrong about the labels they give their identity. But like I said above, I'd like to see studies based on factors independent of the label premise. \n\n \n There are plenty of them. Start reading Kinsey's, and there have been many similar since. None have suggested that there is a significant proportion of gay people who choose to be gay.\n \n \nWhy aren't there studies that seek to link genetics or prenatal conditions to other forms of sexual orientation, such as cross dressing or foot fetishes? Could people be born gay yet choose other aspects of their sexual orientation? Or are all aspects of sexual orientation predetermined at birth.\n\n \n Because funding research into human sexuality is difficult. People don't like to pay for it, especially public officials, ever since Proxmire's Golden Fleece awards. I've no idea whether fetishes are the same in nature as homo-hetero sexual orientation -- there does seem to be evidence some (that doesn't mean all) can be influenced by experience, but there is no evidence -- and believe me, the studies here have been extensive -- to suggest that sexual orientation is based on experience or learning. Quite the contrary. Again, that is not to say sexual orientation can never be influenced in anyone under any circumstances by experience, but it does not appear to be the principal factor by which it is established. This is a pretty solid scientific conclusion by now.",
