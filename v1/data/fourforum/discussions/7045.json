But if you want to continue to think this is a hate crime then why dont you compare it to real hate crimes and see where yours truely fall right into place........First off the definition;\n What is a hate crime?\n A hate crime is committed to intimidate, harm or terrify not only a person, but an entire group of people to which the victim belongs. The victims are targeted for who they are, not because of anything they have done.\n Hate crimes involve intimidation, harassment, physical force or threat of physical force against a person, a family or a property\n \n Matthew Shepard\n On October 6, 1998, 21-year-old college student Matthew Shepard was tied to a fence in Laramie, Wyoming, pistol-whipped, then left for dead in the freezing night. He died six days later.\n \n Brandon Teena\n Born Teena Brandon and raised as a girl, he was living as a man known as Brandon Teena in Falls City, Nebraska, when he was murdered at age 21. In December of 1993, two men who discovered his gender raped him. His attackers later shot and killed him after learning Brandon had reported the rape and was to help police in the investigation. \n \n Teens charged in Toronto with anti-Semitic graffiti \n The charges relate to a series of incidents this month in which headstones were knocked down in a Jewish cemetery and anti-Semitic graffiti were painted on a school, a mosque and homes. \n \n these are a few examples of \"hate\" crimes.
