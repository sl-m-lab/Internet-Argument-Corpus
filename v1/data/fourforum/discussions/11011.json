   "I's put stupid quote. Noboody unerstand. Can u tail me wat is rong wit my posts? U is no understain or is u understain? Is no clear or is ok? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd? This doesn't mean I want to give it to the poor. That is silly and a strawman.\n \n Inherently, people who contribute the least to the system use more of its resources. People who pay the most taxes aren't elegible for most govt. programs.\n \n That is inherently unfair and the point I am making. I argue for a progressive tax structure.\n \n \n That's fine. But if you are going to ask someone to pay every increasing % of their income, you'd better be spending it correctly. Giving people free health care while requiring them to contribute nothing in return is not a proper reason to seize someone property.\n \n I never said this. In fact, if you read the economic forum from time to time you'd see I'm for increasing taxes and cutting entitlements. It's a strawman to assume increase in taxes means I wish to pay for entitlement programs. I'd prefer we pay down the debt and invest in our countries infrastructure before we go belly up. The problem is you really can't raise the taxes on the poor as it nets you no money. The progression on the current tax structure is not progressive enough in my opinion.\n \n The poor and lower middle class pay Zero taxes, absolutely none. They make money off of taxes (earned income tax credit anyone?). \n \n I'm for cutting spending, cutting entitlements, cutting govt., increasing responsibility, and we sure as hell don't need to expand medicare to the whole population (which is what the hillery plan would do!)\n \n This is only true at a certain point and it is clear that we aren't there yet. The rich have a lot of control and they will stop the tax rate from getting too high...don't you worry. \n \n Already the top 10% pay 70% of the taxes. That's more than enough. Cut spending. Cut entitlements. Don't create new welfare programs (healthcare). Hillary wants to take profits. Punish the successful. Robin Hood with highlights!\n \n \n What needs to be realized is that these costs are already to the point where we need to raise taxes to pay the debt they have created. David Walker, the former comptroller of the US, has pretty much been saying the same thing I have been saying for years. It isn't complicated, just good fiscal policy to protect our country.\n\n \n Cut spending and don't create new bureaucracies. That's the way to pay down the debt. Now if you cut the budget to the bone, you won't need to increase taxes. If you do cut it to the bone and still need to come to the trough, we'll talk then!",
