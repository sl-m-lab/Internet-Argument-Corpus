I have always been fascinated by parliamentary procedure (choreographed chaos, I call it), so I don't particularly like the free-for-all atmosphere that you find on internet message boards. Does anyone have any ideas for procedural rules for an online political convention?",

   "One problem is that this forum is not \"live\" enough to have a parliamentarian intervene in a timely manner.\n\n \n Not being live would also make it difficult to do anything because the participants would be spread out geographically, i.e., spread out over different time zones. But you might be able to compensate for this by restricting debate enough to give everyone time to read what has been posted and then reply.\n \n You could do a quorum call by posting a resolution and then waiting a certain amount of time while asking the participants to post a note (or send an email to the moderator/chairman) saying they have read the resolution and want to debate it. If a majority of the participants do not respond within the set time period, the resolution would have to be removed from the order of business- or it could be sent to a committee so it can be discussed by a number of participants that is less than a majority. Then once the resolution has been refined by the committee it can re-introduced for another quorum call.",
