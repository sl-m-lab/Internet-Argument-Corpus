   "B.P. executives are getting picked apart for their irresponsible decisions.\n \n It seems that millions of people nationwide (and several congress members) are very concerned about a choice that B.P. has made.\n \n It seems as though a simple safety valve costing $500,000 could have prevented this entire oil spill catastrophe, but B.P. decided not to spend the money because they figured the likelyhood of actually having an emergency was extremely slim.\n \n Yup. Probably wouldn't need it. Kinda' expensive. Why spend all that money on something that will probably not even be used?\n \n Yet, I'm sure many of those same millions of people outraged at B.P.'s failure to have a safety valve just in case that highly unlikely situation should arise are the very same people snidely looking down their nose at me for carrying a firearm because I'll never need it. I'm just carrying it to be cool. \n \n \"Why do you feel the need to carry a gun in coffee shop/church/wherever?\" You crazy gun nuts. Those big scary guns make you feel macho, huh?\n \n I wonder: If B.P. would have installed a safety valve, would they ask the Big oil execs in front of congress if buying $500,000 saftey valves made them feel macho?\n \n Yeah. The outrage at Big Oil for not taking precautions even though the probablility of needing it was very small.\n \n Yet I carry my own personal \"safety valve\" and I'm a crazy paranoiac because the probability of needing it is very small.\n \n Oh, the irony.",

   "Transocean could do with being checked out more closely.\n \n \" ..... \"In the interest of safety, the D3 joint venture has decided to suspend the W1 well and bring in a replacement rig,\" Hardy boss Yogeshwar Sharma told UpstreamOnline.\n \n \"The problems were associated with one of the two control systems for the BOP. The main control system was working, but there were issues with the back-up.\n \n \"In the current environment of safety both the operator and the service provider want to ensure all systems are fully working.\"\n \n Transocean was not immediately available for comment.\n \n Earlier this month, Transocean boss Steven Newman said the drillship Discoverer Seven Seas experienced an unspecified \"BOP issue\" during the first quarter this year while working off India for state-owned Oil & National Gas Corporation.\n \n A third rig, Transocean drillship Discoverer 534, also working off India, had a dynamic positioning \"issue\", he added during a conference call.\n \n Transocean has since set up a team to review the performance of its deep-water fleet in a bid to address the equipment reliability issues.\n \n The review follows the apparent failure of a BOP to prevent an explosion and fire that destroyed the company's semi-submersible Deepwater Horizon, killing 11 people and triggering a massive oil leak from BP's Macondo well. ..... \"\n \n Transocean rig problem halts India well - Upstream Online",
