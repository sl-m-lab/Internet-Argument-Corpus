   "I can't say what the law of self defense is where this happened, but I can show you what the law would be in my home state of Virginia. The law may be similar, since Virginia's law of self defense comes from Common Law.\n \n If (as one of the \"victim's\" relatives seems to demand) she were charged with murder, then in Virginia the prosecution would have to show she acted with malice when she shot him.\n \n Here is the jury instruction defining malice:\n \n \"THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT malice is the state of mind which results in the intentional doing of a wrongful act to another without legal excuse or justification, at a time when the mind of the actor is under the control of reason. Malice may result from any unlawful or unjustifiable motive including anger, hatred or revenge. Malice may be inferred from any deliberate willful and cruel act against another, however sudden.\"\n \n All I know about this is what I have read here. Based upon that, I don't think her actions could be defined as malicious. She could possibly face a charge and conviction of the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter. Manslaughter does not require malice. In this case, manslaughter would require proof that she either used excessive force when defending herself or that she was not defending herself when she shot him.\n \n Here are the two Virginia self-defense instructions that would apply to her case: \n \n \"THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT if you believe that the defendant was without fault in provoking or bringing on the difficulty, and that the defendant reasonably feared, under the circumstances as they appeared to him, that he was in danger of harm, then the defendant had the right to use such force as was reasonably necessary to protect himself from the threatened harm. If you further believe that the defendant used no more force that was reasonably necessary to protect himself from the threatened harm, then you shall find the defendant not guilty.\"\n \n \"THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT the amount of force used in self-defense must be reasonable in relation to the harm threatened, and that the defendant is not allowed to use deadly force in self defense unless he reasonably feared, under the circumstances as they appeared to him, that he was in danger of being killed or that he was in danger of great bodily harm.\"\n \n If I were going to defend her in a manslaughter case, I would demand a jury trial. Claims of self-defense in response to an unprovoked attack create a lot of emotions with jurors. You typically start a case like this with a portrayal of a very unsympathetic \"victim\" (referring here to the man who was killed), and a very sympathetic defendant who acted (in her belief) in justifiable self-defense when brutally attacked. It appears that a much stronger man attacking a woman in this case, which also creates problems for a prosecutor. Jurors tend to believe that women are weaker and are therefore allowed more latitude in using a weapon for self defense (women also have a very real additional fear that men don't experience when attacked like this, the fear of possible sexual assault). I would point out that while the jurors have the luxury of sitting in a nice, safe room and taking all the time they need to conclude whether our security guard acted in self defense, to get a true measure of what happened you have to put yourself into the shoes of our guard when she was attacked. This was probably a women who was in the middle of thinking about any number of mundane things (like what she was going to eat when she got home, or whether she needed to stop at the store and get some more milk) when her calm night was shattered by an attack. I would point out the sudden fear and adrenaline rush she would have experienced as this man was trying to crush her skull, etc.--\"Did she reasonably fear, under these circumstances, that she was in danger of being killed or of suffering further great bodily harm? You bet she did.\"-This would be the argument. In these circumstances, it becomes hard for a jury to conclude that she acted improperly. \n \n The real difficulty for her is the man was shot after he got into his car, and the claim could be made she was just acting in revenge or acting to get the money back. I have personally seen a case like this. A man came into a convenience market and put a candy bar on the counter. When the cashier opened the register as a part of the sale the man suddenly reached into the drawer and grabbed a handful of money. The cashier grabbed his arm and they struggled for a moment before the unarmed thief broke free with a handful of cash. He ran outside. The cashier grabbed his pistol and chased him. As the man was running away across the lot the cashier shot him in the back. This is clearly a crime in Virginia, because you have no right to use deadly force to recover stolen property. A grand jury indicted the cashier for malicious wounding (our thief survived). At a jury trial, the jury found the cashier not guilty. They took about 5 min. to reach that verdict. It probably didn't help the Commonwealth's case when the \"victim\" testified in a jail orange jumpsuit with leg shackles. It also didn't help for him to be asked what he was in for and have to say he was in jail for stealing the money from the store. Once the jurors see and hear this, it doesn't take much for them to return a not guilty verdict. In the end, you want the jurors thinking along these lines: \"If you're going to be stupid, then you've got to be tough. If you're going to be stupid enough to attack a women security guard then you've got to be tough enough to take a bullet for it.\" \n \n It is true that our security guard might get convicted of illegal possession of the weapon, but in Virginia that would have no bearing on her self defense claim for shooting her attacker. Possessing the weapon might lead to a separate crime, but the only issue involving her self defense claim is whether she reasonably believed that she was justified in using deadly force at the time she used it.",

   "It sounds like you are asking what the punishment is for a felon to possess a firearm. It has always been a felony offense for convicted felons to possess a firearm, and the maximum punishment has always been 5 years. In 1999 the Gilmore administration's project exile program changed the law to require that when a person who was convicted of a prior non-violent felony gets caught with gun he must receive a minimum mandatory 2 year prison sentence, which cannot be suspended. For a person who has a prior violent felony conviction, the sentence is a mandatory 5 years which cannot be suspended. So you get either a 2 or 5 year mandatory sentence if you are a felon and get caught with a gun, depending on the nature of your prior felony conviction. \n \n The significance of this change in the law was that it removed the ability of a judge to \"suspend\" all or a part of the sentence. Let me give you an example of how \"suspended\" sentences work. If you get caught selling any amount of cocaine in Virginia (crack or powder, it makes no difference), the punishment is not less than 5 years nor more than 40 years, plus a fine of up to $500,000.00. Because the law requires it, a judge must give at least 5 years for the offense. Prior to 1995, judges used to average giving 7 years in prison for selling cocaine. However, the parole guidelines were so lax that a defendant would average serving only 18 months of that sentence before being released on parole. In 1995, parole was \"abolished,\" which means that for sentences of 1 year or more the defendant must pull a minimum of 85% of his sentence before he could be released on parole. This has had zero effect of cocaine distribution, however, for this reason: Judges have adjusted their sentences to account for the parole guidelines. The judge must still give a minimum sentence of 5 years for the sale, but he then suspends all but 18 months of that sentence to serve. The net result is the dealer serves the same amount of time. Project exile took away the ability of the judge to suspend the 2 or 5 year punishment, and the result is felons who get caught with guns get hammered. \n \n However, Virginia recognizes that the right of self-defense is the first law of nature, and convicted felons are permitted to use a firearm in self defense just like anyone else. An example would be a felon riding in my truck (where I frequently tote my gun). I rear-end somebody, and the guy gets out with a knife and attacks us. My friend could grab my gun and use it to defend himself or me without violating the felon in possession law. This does NOT mean that felons can tote a gun because they fear an attack! It is merely a necessary exception to the felon in possession law which permits a felon to grab a firearm if available during a deadly assault and use it to defend himself. \n \n If you are asking for the punishment ranges and alternatives for murder and manslaughter in Virginia, then the crimes are as follows (in descending order of severity):\n \n Capital Murder (1st. degree murder + one of 13 possible aggravators, like in the commission of a rape or robbery): The punishment is death or life without parole.\n \n 1st. degree murder (Willful, deliberate, malicious, premeditated murder): The punishment is not less than 20 years nor more than life (parole eligible life, meaning he could qualify for parole at age 65).\n \n 2nd. Degree murder (Willful, deliberate, malicious murder without premeditation): Not less than 5 years nor more than 40 years.\n \n Manslaughter: (A voluntary or involuntary homicide that did not involve malice) Not less than 1 year nor more than 10 years, OR confinement in jail from 1 day to 12 months, OR a fine of up to $2,500.00, OR confinement in jail from one day to 12 months and a fine of up to $2,500.00. \n \n Finally, if the conviction is for one of the grades of murder (not manslaughter) and a firearm was used to commit the crime, then a separate charge of using a firearm in the commission of that violent crime can be added which has a mandatory 3 year sentence which cannot be suspended by a judge.",
