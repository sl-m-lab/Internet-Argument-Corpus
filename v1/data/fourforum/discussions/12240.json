   "There is a strong basis for believing that, had it not been for the sexual indiscretions of Bill Clinton, George Bush, a man of meager accomplishment and intelligence, would not have ascended to the presidency. The corollary to that theory is that had it not been for eight years of disaster perpetrated by Bush, the voting public would not have been so willing to elect a man of color to the office. And for me, that is the only positive aspect of his legacy.\n \n Yes - he ignored the briefing on Aug. 6, 2001, titled \"Bin Laden determined to attack U.S.\" prior to the Sept. 11, 2001, attack.\n \n Yes - after taking our country to war on the premise that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans and Iraqis, he merely expressed \"disappointment\" that WMDs could not be found.\n \n Yes - he took the budget surplus of $127 billion, when he entered office, and produced a trillion-dollar deficit when he walks out the door.\n \n Yes - he appointed incompetent Republican cronies to major government offices resulting in the Katrina disaster, judiciary malfeasance and environmental pollution.\n \n Yes - he approved torture techniques for interrogating war prisoners and illegal wiretaps of American citizens.\n \n Yes - his \"wanna be\" cowboy diplomacy has turned our allies in the world against us.\n \n Yes - his support of deregulation and his failure to monitor the regulators is resulting in the greatest depression since 1928 - and perhaps worse.\n \n BUT - here is the good news.\n \n By 2008, Bush was finally recognized by the American public as being so destructive that voters were determined to elect an individual of superior quality to the office. The capability of Barack Obama is so great that the majority of the voters were willing to elect him and to overlook unimportant superficial characteristics, such as a foreign-sounding name and skin color, that they otherwise might have considered important had Bush not preceded him in office.",

History will record the changes brought by Clinton, Bush and Obama in a fashion to be understood only by those intelligent enough to know that the media and their biased reporting (or lack of reporting) is all that drug Bush down and lifted Obama to near sainthood. The liberal media will destroy this country.\n \n I think more people voted for the image created by the media than for a real man. Obama is simply a polished product of the corrupt Illinois political machine. He cannot escape his origins.

We are about to witness the true Barack Obama.\nIt's interesting that the republicans, in particular, invariably blame the liberal media when anything goes wrong on their watch. To me, it's simple. The credible media, by-and-large, report news. Believe it or not, they don' make it up (nor the slant. . .news is news)! The problem is that in many cases the news just isn't that good for the man in office. So, let's blame the messenger, not the message. Limbaugh, Hannity, et. al. of the same ilk couldn't even give it a rest for one day. Why? Their livelyhoods depend on bashing the \"libs\". If they didn't do that, they'd be out of business. Sometime go to Youtube or google Limbaugh's and Hannity's diggs? Then you'll see who the gullible really are.\n \n And yes my friend, we are about to witness the true Barack Obama.\n \n By the way, if and when you get around to it. . . . . . . .tell me where I messed up in my news facts and what Bush has done for 8 years. I think history can judge right now what he's done. We don't have to wait. Not only did we want him gone, the WORLD wanted him gone. On top of that, the facts are the facts. Sorry but don't poke at the messenger. This country and the world is in one sad shape because of that human being. It doesn't take a historical perspective to see where we are now.",
