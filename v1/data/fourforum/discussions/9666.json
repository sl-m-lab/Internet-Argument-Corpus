   "How do you see God\n\n \n Hi Matthew,\n I voted for #1 because that's who my heavenly Father is, unconditional Love. But He is also a Holy God and a Jealous God who wants the relationship with us that He created us for. God wont compromise and requires obedience from His children. Have you read where it say's that \"God chastens those whom He Loves\" ? That means that as a parent will punish and correct a child they love, so will our heavenly Father. I know I have been corrected by Him on many occassions. \n \n God is a personal God who is interested in and actively involved in my life. He is with me every moment of every day and cares about the smallest decision I must make in life. Before I received jesus as my Savior I couldn't even read the bible because it made no sense to me. Immediately after receiving Him, I understood the Word of God clearly because apart from Christ, we are blind and deaf to the truths of God. I felt the Holy Spirit come into me and I was filled with new life which is what being born again means. From that moment on I have been an alien in this World and alive in Christ with the ability to understand and comprehend spiritual insights that never even existed to me prior to being born again.\n \n I knew that all my sins were forgiven and that I had received the free gift of salvation that jesus died on the Cross for. This is real, it is life and it is why we are here. And it doesn't matter what sins we have commited Matt, because Jesus died for ALL of them. \"For all have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God, not one is worthy, not even one\". \"It is by Grace that we are saved and not by works, so that no man should boast, it is a free gift of God\".",

Look at the panic taking place in Russia and Europe where the birth to death ratio is reaching zero.

That is why we demonize certain religious sects because they would make us something God did not intend us to be heterosexual.\n\n \n You assume much my friend. If being gay was God given then He never would have condemned it in the bible. And it isn't the Church that is asking people to give up being gay, it is just upholding what it believes God's will is pertaining to sinful acts of the flesh. Just like the church condemns adultery for straight people. It's no different to God.\n \n \nWhat kind of God creates His children a certain way then punishes them for who He created them to be.

Did God make Mentally Retarded Children as they are ? Or Mongoloids ? Or the Physically Handicapped ? Or Children born with diseases that devalue the quality of their lives ? Or are these handicaps the result of our fallen natures. And most importantly, doesn't God love each of these people equally in spite of the physical maladies that afflict them ? So I dont believe it was Gods will that a small percentage of humanity should be gay, approximately 5%. But neither did he choose that I should be born with a deviated septum. Either way He still loves us equally in spite of our flaws. But that doesn't mean He created us this way. It means He allowed us to live in spite of our flaws.\n \n \n \nWell then you will understand that I too have had a \"prophetic utterance\" when He showed me that my gayness was His gift to me to be cherished and celebrated.

That gayness is a gift and not a sin or curse.\n\n \n If you are right and aren't deceiving yourself then I applaud your epiphany.

   "Jyoshu, I'm not jabbing at you by any means. In no way do I consider you a radical. The point is we can't assign blame to God for the carnal aspects of our lives. There is a reason God made the earth and all the physical laws that we have to abide by. We are here to overcome whatever it is, and those things that we can't overcome, we have to ask for help from Him, which He already promised to take care of. Just because I fell off a building and died, doesn't mean God did it or allowed it. I just didn't watch where I was going.\n \n The \"radical religionist\" part stems from all the \"God made me this way\" nonsense, which is not so. We are the ones that shape our lives by the choices we make. Just like the retarded boy next door, for example - God didn't do that horrible thing, which not only affects him, but also his parents, siblings, other family members in a detrimental fashion. That retarded boy will never overcome that, but God uses that natural occurrence for those of us that do understand the way of things. Christ said He couldn't spare us from these things, but that He has a way out through Him because He has already overcome the world (John 16:33). When that boy's parents understand that their son's troubles will spare a soul from the tribulations of this world, and that Christ can spare theirs, then they can have peace. So many - too many - people point a finger at God for the natural occurrences of life. A kid suffers at the hand of a child predator, not the wishes, wants, or allowances of God. A husband cheats on his wife not because God allows that behavior, but because of His power to grant us the freedom to choose right and wrong, good and evil.",

   "Jyoshu, I'm not jabbing at you by any means. In no way do I consider you a radical. The point is we can't assign blame to God for the carnal aspects of our lives. There is a reason God made the earth and all the physical laws that we have to abide by. We are here to overcome whatever it is, and those things that we can't overcome, we have to ask for help from Him, which He already promised to take care of. Just because I fell off a building and died, doesn't mean God did it or allowed it. I just didn't watch where I was going.\n\n \n So then am I correct in perceiving that your concern here is that God is being \"blamed\" more so than simply acknowledging God is behind it?\n \n I'm not really saying we should be 'blaming' God in the sense of saying he did something immoral.\n \n Your analogy about 'avoiding' and 'overcoming' the physical laws that God set in place falls pretty short, because there are too many things that cannot be avoided.

People who are not christian and do not believe in God do loving things. But that is not the same thing, doctrinely or theologically that we are talking about. There are a number of greek words for love. The kind of love where we do loving things for others is called Philadelpia. Translated brotherly love. (yes that is why the city is named that way. There are lots of biblical named cities in PA, bethlehem for instance). The kind of love we are discussing the greeks used the word AGAPE for. Unconditional love. Love completely without regard to self. Love for ones enemies.\n \n The christian doctrine is that Jesus said \"love your enemies.\" He asked what profit is there if a person loves their friends. His words were \"Don't even the gentiles do this?\" His point being that non believers do that. They Philadelphia their friends. Jesus also said, a good man would die for his friends. But Jesus died while people were still his enemy (that is somewhere in the bible but I cannot locate it at the moment). For those who hated them. His words at the cross, \"Father forgive them for they know not what they do.\" This was for those that were nailing his hands to the crossbeam and his feet to the longer part. Imagine that for yourself if you can?\n \n Imagine the person that you dislike the very most in this world. Imagine a molester or rapist or murder and saying, \"I will gladly take their punishment so that they can go free. And oh, by the way, I am going to do it whether or not they accept it, so it all may be in vain.\"\n \n When you see all the rules and laws of the old testament you clearly see a god that was \"perfect\".\n \n Next we get into the things god commanded including killing women and children. God is not only love, he is also justice. Would you want a God that did not act justly? No one would say, I want a god who will let anyone in at anytime no matter what they did. It does not matter. \n \n God does not just save everyone according to the christian doctrine. He made for payment of the necessary penalty so that those that accept it can receive it freely. However, some may choose not to accept it and then they will be held to the standard the christian god has defined.\n \n Others who are more trained in this may feel free to correct me where I am wrong.

   "Admittedly this is where you lose me Matt, because that homophobe you refer to is the Holy Spirit himself who inspired the writer(s) of the very books of the bible you struggle with. So once again, your problem isn't with me, or even with the writers of the bible but the God who has outlined what is right and wrong according to HIS PERFECT WILL for His Creation. You seem to believe you can question and reject His will while claiming to being accepted by Him at the same time. I've been around long enough to understand how that is a waste of time and energy. Not to mention an excercise in futility.\n \n Let me just ask you this question to consider. If I insisted that I'm a spirit filled Christian who was receiving Prophetic Words of Knowledge from God while at the same time openly having an adulterous affair which is clearly against Gods will, would you encourage my walk with Christ as it stands, or would you call me a flaming hypocrite ? You'd call me an obvious hypocrite.\n \n Then why do you insist that just because you're gay you deserve a pass on Gods standing statutes regarding morality and submission to His Holiness and Perfect Will for us ?\n\n \n :xbanghead :xbanghead :xbanghead :xbanghead",

Who is us? Maybe you are referring to you? For gay people submission to his holiness is celebacy. You are welcomed and encouraged to experience sex and romance within the confines of your blessed marriage. Why wouldn't someone who is gay insist on a pass, you got one did you not? Why is that? Does your attraction and/or marriage to a member of the opposite sex cure cancer or create jobs? Does it stop wars or global warming?\n Will it help you to realize that your god is blatantly unfair to those who are homosexual? The answer is no to all of the above. Matthew has said repeatedly that his sexuality is a gift from god. Should Matthew disregard the voice of god, simply because you believe conflicting scripture that was penned by sinful humans of a fallen world?",

   "If you read, it is more than that. Abram's faith had an action assocated with it. It is the action of being willing to sacrifice his child. There is the action of \n replacing that sacrifice of a child with a ram. It isn't merely belief. It is the actions that went along with the belief.\n\n \n Actually, I did read. The declaration of righteousness comes far before the action. Only after belief. There is no where in this section that shows that abram did anything other than believe god. In particluar see verse 6In fact, the entire section shows clearly that this was initiated and completed by God:\n \n \n1 After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, \"Do not fear, Abram, I am a shield to you; Your reward shall be very great.\" 2 Abram said, \"O Lord GOD , what will You give me, since I am childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?\" 3 And Abram said, \"Since You have given no offspring to me, one born in my house is my heir.\" 4 Then behold, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, \"This man will not be your heir; but one who will come forth from your own body,he shall be your heir.\" 5 And He took him outside and said, \"Now look toward the heavens, and count the stars, if you are able to count them.\" And He said to him, \"So shall your descendants be.\" 6 Then he believed in the LORD; and He reckoned it to him as righteousness. 7 And He said to him, \"I am the LORD who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess it.\" 8 He said, \"O Lord GOD , how may I know that I will possess it?\" 9 So He said to him, \"Bring Me a three year old heifer, and a three year old female goat, and a three year old ram, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.\" 10 Then he brought all these to Him and cut them in two, and laid each half opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds. 11 The birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away. \n\n \n In fact the hebrew word for \"believed\" is (transliterated because I cannot put in the actual hebrew text) aman. This word means to \"trust or believe\" and has the connotation of a baby being carried by a nurse. It is completely independent of any action. Please note that the \"He\" in verse six is capitalized and therefore refers to God and the word \"lord\" is the actual name of God (tansliterated Yahweh) or spelled YHWY.\n \n This cannot be a more clear example of God's action without requirement of human response. It is pure graciousness.\n \n This sectino comes after Abram's first child is born through Hagar. God is telling him that child will not be his heir but rather another. I believe abram was already well into his nineties at this time.\n \n Huck",
