   "I can understand your point that, in the absolute, metaphysical sense, we can never be 100.00% sure of any of our knowledge. Just because all humans always have experienced the existence of the world, doesn't mean that it is 100.00% certain, just that the probability that it is true approaches 100.00% (say, 99.9999999%). The greater the amount of evidence, the closer that certainty is to 100.00%. That 0.0000001% leaves room for obsurd scenarios - such as that an omnicient being is causing us all to merely imagine our reality, or the scenario of the movie \"The Matrix\". These can be fun to ponder (especially in a social situation after a few drinks ;) ), but no one takes them seriously. If anyone did seriously live by the idea that the world may not exist, they would quickly do something stupid and die, or change their minds. \nNo-one experiences the existence of an outside world. Explanations such as the Matrix can explain sense impressions as well as some concept of 'external reality'. We have no more evidence for one than the other.\n \n The fact no-one takes them seriously is a psychological point about human beings, nothing to do with reality per se.\n \n \n \nI, and most people, have a firm assumption, based on all of our and all human's experience, that the world that we live in exists and that our experiences of the moment are real.\nHow is that based on experience? We have no data that says 'an outside world exists'. The assumption that such a world exists is made before we can use the data. \nAll the knowledge from Science has come from trusting mutual experience. It has gotten us far and will continue to (as long as we don't destroy ourselves in misusing that knowledge).\nBut the belief that 'its gotten us far' is itself a 'scientific' type belief, in fact it has less proof on the empirical assumptions than the science itself. Justifying the validity of experience by experience is the intellectual equivalent of saying\n \n 'God must exist, because God is good and would not allow a world without God'.",

   "1) the theories and laws constantly change, so it's not like there's one standard that's benn kept to. At best the 'theories and laws of science' are statements that fit with as many experiences and events as possible\nTheories change since they are just that - theories. Once time and sufficient investigation has given them sufficient weight, they become laws. Newton's laws were derived to explain direct human experiences (we deal with relatively large objects going at slow speeds relative to the speed of light) and for that regime, they remain true. Since there were still a multitude of basic unanswered questions at the time in Science (about light, the nature of matter, etc.), investigation continued and found, in the 20th century, the laws of relativity and quantum mechanics to explain occurrences outside of the range of the large and slow that we experience. At the beginning of science (say ~17th century), there were a lot more questions than answers. Now, it's the other way around - at least when it comes to the essential theoretical basis behind things that human's experience.\n2) If someone reports something against science, it's rejected as 'unscientific'\nAre you saying that an argument that is inconsistent with science should not be called unscientific, or are you saying that it should not be rejected because it is unscientific?\n3) I'm rejecting the certainty of experience, so using experience to prove it is circular\nI also reject the *certainty* of experience, but it is the only way the we humans can learn about the world. If all humans always have experienced something, then there is a high probability that that something is true. \n \n What are you suggesting as another means of finding out the truth - revelation? That is far more unreliable than experience since, if it does happen, it happens to extremely few individuals who cannot then prove it to others since those others cannot have the same experience of revelation (and yes, revelation is also a type of experience, if it happens). Meanwhile, there are far, far more people who have emotional experiences that seem to them like revelation but are purely imagination - just look at the enormous variety of religious belief in the world. Since any hypothetical revelation cannot be a shared mutual experience (as can all aspects of science), and since such a revelation experience can easily be misidentified or faked, revelation is far, far more unreliable than mutual experience in finding out about our reality.\nOne of these aspects of existence which we arbitarily believe in is cause and effect. Another is the external world. A third is the consciousness of others. A fourth is the past etc. etc.\nThey originally might have been an arbitrary guess, but experience of all humans always has given them a very high probability of being true (at least the existence of the outside world, the others are abstract logical concepts that don't have a physical reality, just an abstract one).\nAnd in any case, saying 'it hasn't happened yet' is hardly logical proof.\nIt hasn't happened yet is not absolute proof, just that it makes the probability of it being wrong quite small. \n \n By the way, if you are in the least bit intellectually honest, I challenge you to actually act on any of those doubts about the reality of existence and any other reality that we understand from all human experience.

Secondly, If a researcher truly believes that an unsafe vaccine is safe and simply lacks the objectivity to correctly determine the risk (where emotional attachment to their vaccine project makes them overlook the risks) then that researcher should not be fully trusted with such an important task. Lastly, as for those researchers who simply were too lasy or financially limited to do the safety checks and just assume safety, asking them to take their own vaccine is a very strong motivating point to make those safety checks.",

   "Socrates paradigm implies that we cannot know, that all questions do not have answers that the human mind can comprehend, in fact, there are questions that the human mind cannot even formulate.\nYes, we do not have all the answers and there are questions and answers that we may not be even able to comprehend, but that does not mean that we do not know anything. Science and mutual human experience in general has answered the great majority of questions that plagued early man. These include questions ranging from: 'What causes lightning, earthquakes, storms, etc?\" to 'Where did humans come from?\" to \"What is the nature of matter?\". Yes, there still are question such as the beginning of the universe or the search for the unified theory. However, for the great majority of events that humans experience, we now know the basic theoretical basis behind them. We may lack the computational power to solve in detail a lot of problems but our advances in science and technology have shown that our estimates have generally been very good.\nI don't quite understand what you mean here - particularly the phrase \"in its manifestation of Science...\" It seems that you are saying that our mutual experience manifests as science. I don't quite grasp that concept.\nAll I am saying is that the Scientific Method (which forms the basis of all science) is an organized way of analyzing mutual human experience. Mutual experiences need to be repeateable and thoroughly analyzed before they are trusted. \n \n I will grant that the one limitation in Science is that it can only claim knowledge in those things that are measureable by humans - usually meaning those experiences that are repeateable. If there is some very rare quirk of nature that manifests itself for a brief instant every thousand years, then Science would probably not be able to pick up on that. Also, we cannot look beyond the reach of our measurements, except purely in theory. So, for example, we have no idea what might lie beyond the edge of the universe. Nevertheless, we humans have no reliable means to gain the truth on such matters. If you are lucky enough to experience such a hypothetical rare occurence, then you cannot prove it to anyone unless they can experience it as well. \nReally? A lot of people say that every answer makes more questions. In some ways we seem to know less now than we did at the time of Newton, in that we are less certain.\nJust because we are less confident that we know or can know everything doesn't mean that we know less than in Newtons day. There were many more unanswered questions about everyday occurrences in Newton's day than today. Most of the unanswered questions of today do not refer to everyday occurrences.\n \nAnd Newton's laws deal with what happens in a vacuum with no resistance, not direct human experience\nNewton's laws are valid (for a certain range of sizes and speeds) even when you are in air - you simply need to add the force imposed by that air. \n \n However, I am guessing that your point was to say that science is an estimation and I would agree that the great majority of scientific predictions are approximations. This is mostly becuase we do not have infinite computational power and do not have an infinite number of measuring tools to describe the particular situation exactly. However, proper scientific investigation is able to simplify the problem by subtracting those effects which are negligeable and concentrate on those effects that give the main contribution. For example, the orbit of the earth around the sun can, in its roughest estimate, be calculated simply from simple models of a point-source earth and a point-source sun. To add accuracy to the prediction, you can add in the mass of the moon, the volume and non-uniform density of the earth and sun, gravitational influence of the other planets, etc. However, there comes a point where a particular influence is so tiny that you really don't think its worth including it (such as the gravitational influence of a distant galaxy on earth's orbit). All of this does not mean that we do not have a theoretical basis for knowing earth's orbit, just that we cannot have an exact calculation but just one that is far more exact than we will probably ever need.",

If you want more detail than that, then I would suggest looking in a physics text-book or ask a more specific expert (This not being my field.)\nMy point is that we have no access to the 'nature' of matter, only how it acts etc. String theory, quantam theory, atomic theory are all models to explain events, not a description of substance itself.\nThough Newton could not observe the forces imposed by air, others were able to later and still found Newton's laws valid in those situations. As for the mathematics, a lot of the jist of science comes down to mathematical models, but those models are based on basic concepts - such as forces, mass, specific types of particles (ex. electrons), etc.\nI'm not attacking Newton. If anything, I'm saying that he was able to take a step beyond the direct evidence to see underlying patterns, and that was very succesful. But the patterns and 'laws' are only human models imposed on a series of events.",

   "Yes, we do not have all the answers and there are questions and answers that we may not be even able to comprehend, but that does not mean that we do not know anything. Science and mutual human experience in general has answered the great majority of questions that plagued early man. These include questions ranging from: 'What causes lightning, earthquakes, storms, etc?\" to 'Where did humans come from?\" to \"What is the nature of matter?\". Yes, there still are question such as the beginning of the universe or the search for the unified theory. However, for the great majority of events that humans experience, we now know the basic theoretical basis behind them. We may lack the computational power to solve in detail a lot of problems but our advances in science and technology have shown that our estimates have generally been very good.\nI think there is a misunderstanding. I am not saying we don't know anything. I may have said we \"don't really know anything\" which is completely different statement because it is meaningless. \"Really knowing\" is one of those arrogant turns of phrase that I dislike and then catch myself using. It would have been clearer had I said we don't \"fully\" know anything. We know something to the degree that we know it and there is always more to know about it. Sorry for the glib word choice.\n \n \nAll I am saying is that the Scientific Method (which forms the basis of all science) is an organized way of analyzing mutual human experience. Mutual experiences need to be repeateable and thoroughly analyzed before they are trusted. \nThe scientific method deals with natural phenomena and attempts to discover natural explanations. As such it is a useful tool as you say. However when it comes to grasping our mutual shared experience that is not physical or material in nature, the scientific method as a tool is useless. It is like trying to repair your watch with a sledge hammer. The tool was not made for the job.\n \n \nI will grant that the one limitation in Science is that it can only claim knowledge in those things that are measureable by humans - usually meaning those experiences that are repeateable. If there is some very rare quirk of nature that manifests itself for a brief instant every thousand years, then Science would probably not be able to pick up on that. Also, we cannot look beyond the reach of our measurements, except purely in theory. So, for example, we have no idea what might lie beyond the edge of the universe. Nevertheless, we humans have no reliable means to gain the truth on such matters. If you are lucky enough to experience such a hypothetical rare occurence, then you cannot prove it to anyone unless they can experience it as well.\nThere is a school of thought that says, \"You can't learn anything you don't already know\" - that the knowledge is within us and it is a matter of allowing it expression. If you read the works of some great scientists or inventors, they proceeded on instinct and hunches and intuition - even in the physical realm of the sciences. It may very well be that in the non-physical realm, intuition and instinct and hunches are better tools than the scientific method.\n \n \nJust because we are less confident that we know or can know everything doesn't mean that we know less than in Newtons day. There were many more unanswered questions about everyday occurrences in Newton's day than today. Most of the unanswered questions of today do not refer to everyday occurrences.\nI beg to differ. We have gathered more facts, information and knowledge, but they have created more questions - ask any research biologist. Meanwhile, we have little if any understanding of the answers to everyday questions like, \"Why do people kill other people?\" \"Why does one society declare war and blow up another society?\" \"Why will a mother sacrifice her life for her child?\" \"Why will a father work two or three jobs to by his son a bicycle?\" We don't even have answers to the simplest questions like \"Why do you laugh at one joke and I laugh at another?\" I think that the more we know the more we realize we do not know -- the more questions we have.",

Meanwhile, I have a lot of respect for the multiple generations of scientists and general thinkers who have already answered so many of the questions which mankind has posed.\n \nThere is a school of thought that says, \"You can't learn anything you don't already know\" - that the knowledge is within us and it is a matter of allowing it expression. If you read the works of some great scientists or inventors, they proceeded on instinct and hunches and intuition - even in the physical realm of the sciences. It may very well be that in the non-physical realm, intuition and instinct and hunches are better tools than the scientific method.\nInstinct can be very useful, for scientists as well, but I would say that there are two types of instict or intuition - the type that is inherent in us and the type that comes from learning and practice. Someone who is playing soccer for the first time, even with the same skill in maneuvering a ball, will probably not have the intuition in how to maneuver past all of those opponents than someone with lots of practice. That is learned intuition. The types of intuition that seem to be inherent in us (and, if I have my philosophers right, were suggested by Kant) include such things as a sense of space and time and a sense of cause and effect. These seem to be part of the template that we were born with. Where the non-physical realm is concerned, I would agree that intuition and instinct can play a role, but only where are own mental selves are concerned and any generalization we make about others based on assumptions of similarity to ourselves (such as empathy). Ultimately, we cannot project our intuitions at a distance to \"see\" the unseeable or unmeasureable. We can only guess based on a combination of experience and intuition.\n \n \nI beg to differ.

Psychology is not a \"hard\" science as is physics. I must admit - when I was referring to Science I was mainly thinking of the \"hard\" sciences such as Chemistry and Physics, so I should have been more specific. We do know much less about these \"soft\"(?) sciences such as psychology, partly because of the limitations of their very natures. The human mind is an extremely complex thing and, even if one assumes that all of our thoughts and emotions are governed by our physical brains, fully predicting human behavior would require our full understanding of the function of the human brain. We currently lack such understanding. We can understand how a single neuron or cluster of a few neurons work and we can understand how certain areas of the brain correspond to certain types of thoughts or senses, but we do not understand the vast realm in between. I once heard a brain scientist (neurologist?) refer to the brain as the \"mother of all reverse engineering problems\". The only other means we have of decifering human behavior is through observation and experimentation. We are obviously limited for moral reasons with controlled experimentation (Gee, lets see what happens when we take that part of the brain out...). However, the psychological understanding we can get from observation is limited by the fact that it is extremely difficult to account for ALL variables. So, we ultimately have no really good tools to attack psychological questions in the same way that we can attack questions of physics.",

For our experience to be consistent with a model such as mass demonic dillusion, then there would have to be not only the experience of the dillusions themselves but some hint that our experiences are a dillusion.\nMy point on mutual experience is not one of absolute truth, it's that your access to mutual experience cannot be higher grade evidence than your own experience, as it is via your own experience. If I trust scientific study more than reports of a lunatic, if the lunatic assures me that a scientific study claims something, then my trust of that is my percentage of trusting the study (say 80%) times my percentage of trusting the lunatic (say 5%)\nThe advantage of science and other such methods which organize and analyze mutual experience is that the answers given by science and mutual experience can be tested by you and, if they have been analyzed correctly, you will find the same results. This is not true for those things said by a lunatic (unless that lunatic is lucky enough to stumble upon the truth). I ultimately trust my own experience but I also trust that, if I were to repeat the experiments of good scientists, then I would get the same results that they would. It is a trust in the method of science that says: \"You can do it too and see for yourself. If you don't get the same results, then we might be wrong - let's analyze it.\".

   "I recently thought of an analogy that is relevant in this situation. Namely, in a criminal trial (ex. murder trial), evidence is presented and, if there is no reasonable doubt, the suspect is found guilty. It is still possible that, despite having been found guilty, the suspect is actually innocent but had been framed (i.e. all the evidence had been made to appear to make him guilty when he really wasn't). However, in the trial, when there is nothing that suggests a framing or if there is nothing that discredits the evidence, then there will be no reasonable doubt and the suspect is found guilty.\n \n The analogy is that we have tremendous amounts of evidence which show that the world is real and follows the laws of physics and science that we expect it to follow and no evidence that shows otherwise. Therefore, there is no cause for reasonable doubt, and we need to proceed as if the world is indeed real and does indeed follow the laws of science.",

It is not enough to say that a theory is true since you have no evidence against it. You also need to have some evidence for it if you want to claim it is true.

Thinking about the issue, I might agree that showing B always following A might not be enough evidence to strongly support a cause/effect relationship. (Ex. If C causes both A and B then B might always follow A). One probably also needs to show some mechanism by which A can cause B - not just the order in time - in order to show convinceable evidence of a cause/effect relationship. So, to be convincing, we would probably have to show some evidence of the mechanism as well. We could keep adding such pieces of evidence to show a cause/effect relationship until we gain a high degree of confidence.\n \n I believe the probability of something being true does increase with increasing amount of evidence - especially if there is no evidence to show that thing not being true.",

The systematic analysis of our mutual experience, especially through science, has yielded an understanding of our world that is fully consistent with our experiences and requires no unsupported claim (such as deceiptful God) to explain those experiences. All methods of seeking truth which need to make such an assumption have the very distinct disadvantage that their assumptions have no support in mutual experience and are therefore completely arbitrary and have a negligeable chance of being true.\nThey seem correct in experience because experience is seen through them. It's like looking through green glasses and then saying you know everything's green. It is also interesting that others have had complete world views (often more complete in terms of covering consciousness etc.) based on an idea of God, rebirth etc.\n \n \nWe have NO way of knowing the absolute truth so, if it is absolute truth we are seeking, then we probably should just give up trying.\nHow can you be absolutely certain we cannot know absolute truth? \nThe only thing we CAN gain understanding in is understanding of the world we experience and, in that quest, science and organized mutual experience is by far the best means to get us there.\nCan't we know the contents of our minds, the inner workings of morality and aesthetics that can't be shared? \n \n \nSo far, I have spent many posts defending my approach to our gaining knowledge about our world. However, you have never clearly stated what your approach is for how we humans can gain understanding about our experienced world. It is only fair for me to ask you to now present your point of view about such matters.\nFor 'our experienced world' there is a sense in which experience is by definiton the best means: as maths is within mathematical theory.\n \n If you are asking for my general theory of how to attain knowledge, then I don't know. If I knew a way, I'd tell you. All I can do so far is try to understand the limits of various claims of different groups to avoid dogma.",

   "This seems to be an unsubstantiated assertion\n What other inputs about an external world do you claim that we humans have?\nThey seem correct in experience because experience is seen through them. It's like looking through green glasses and then saying you know everything's green. It is also interesting that others have had complete world views (often more complete in terms of covering consciousness etc.) based on an idea of God, rebirth etc.\nIf the only thing people ever experienced was a green world, then they would not have any idea about any other colors - they could only randomly guess and have a miniscule change of being right. The world would be defined in terms of green since that is the only thing they would know of. Similarly, we define our world based on mutual experience since that is the only thing we have access to which doesn't intale a random guess.

How can we when there is always a chance, no matter how tiny, that we are being deceived. Just as with the reality of the experienced world, if there was an omnipotent deceiver tricking us all, then we wouldn't know the difference. I think the chance of that is quite small, but not zero. Do you claim that there exists a means by which we can know absolute truth?\n Can't we know the contents of our minds, the inner workings of morality and aesthetics that can't be shared? \nThat is part of what we experience. Those are not sense experiences of an external world but experiences which are own minds generate. However, since we all have very similar capabilities of mind/brain, our experiences there are comparable and analyzeable (especially through the means of psychology). Such experiences can be shared through communication. Generally speaking, most experiences we have are not shared simultaneously but experienced separately by different individuals and then shared by being mutually discussed and analyzed. For example, most scientists run the same experiments independently and confirm through communication that they have the same results - i.e. same experience. Similarly, we each experience our own internal thoughts and mental processes separately, but we can compare, contrast and generally analyze them through communication.\nIf you are asking for my general theory of how to attain knowledge, then I don't know. If I knew a way, I'd tell you. All I can do so far is try to understand the limits of various claims of different groups to avoid dogma.\nI claim that the scientific method is by far the best means of gaining knowledge in those areas which it covers - i.e. those things that are measureable. Do you claim that there is a better method? \n \n I suspect that part of your hesitancy about Science is that you might have encountered some bad examples of closed-minded arrogant scientists that claimed to know the truth just because they were scientists, independent of any oposing arguement that was presented. That is the trouble with getting into a mindset of dogma and there certainly are scientists that get into that mindset. \n \n Everyone is fallable - including scientists. My PhD advisor once told me a very liberating point (partially a joke but there is a lot of truth behind it). He said that \"When you finish your Bachelor degree, you think you know everything about your field. When you finish your Masters, you realize you know nothing. When you finish your PhD, you realize that nobody else does either.\" I once attended a scientific conference where a Nobel prize winning Physicist openly stated something that most of us knew was wrong.

So far, the scientific method has shown itself to be the best means of discovering it (at least of discovering the structure and understanding of our experienced world).

In interpretting others' thoughts and emotions, we generally look for both verbal and non-verbal communication. The reactions that people show in their non-verbal communication (frowns, smiles, twitchiness when nervous, etc.) are so very similar to our own that the assumption usually seems justified. Of course, people can fake their emotions (including non-verbal communication) so that we really have no sure way to figure our other people's inner thoughts if they are not honestly communicating them.\nI don't know how you can state with certainty that there is 'no correct or incorrect ethics'. You seem to equate immeasurability, or unscientificness with not really having an answer.\n\n As with morality, the merit of a particular ethical system depends on whether it is consistent with certain chosen goals for that ethical system. However, those goals can vary. For example, one can imagine an ethical system where the goals would be to maximize the efficiency and utility of a group of individuals - where the work ethic is paramount compared to everything else. Another group may have an ethical system which tries to maximize the happiness that a particular group experiences - so people pursue pleasure, as long as it does not interfere with other's pleasure. Certain religious groups might have ethical systems designed around a goal of following religious rules that are perceived to be divinely ordained. None of these ethical systems are uniquely correct or right. They simply are judged based on their consistency or inconsistency with the goals they are trying to pursue.",

My point is that the people who report such experiences tend to connect at a point which transcends their traditions.[\n \n \nI suppose that we ultimately cannot know exactly what the other person is sensing and do have to make certain assumptions about their feelings being similar in type to our own. In interpretting others' thoughts and emotions, we generally look for both verbal and non-verbal communication. The reactions that people show in their non-verbal communication (frowns, smiles, twitchiness when nervous, etc.) are so very similar to our own that the assumption usually seems justified. Of course, people can fake their emotions (including non-verbal communication) so that we really have no sure way to figure our other people's inner thoughts if they are not honestly communicating them.\nThe point is not simply honesty: we have to assume that outer corresponds with inner. Problem is, I know several people who have believed they're in love multiple times, and each time said the previous one 'wasn't really love'. I have no way of knowing if the feeling fades with time, or if they are actually experiencing more intense or qualitatively different feelings each time.\n \nAs with morality, the merit of a particular ethical system depends on whether it is consistent with certain chosen goals for that ethical system. However, those goals can vary. For example, one can imagine an ethical system where the goals would be to maximize the efficiency and utility of a group of individuals - where the work ethic is paramount compared to everything else. Another group may have an ethical system which tries to maximize the happiness that a particular group experiences - so people pursue pleasure, as long as it does not interfere with other's pleasure. Certain religious groups might have ethical systems designed around a goal of following religious rules that are perceived to be divinely ordained. None of these ethical systems are uniquely correct or right. They simply are judged based on their consistency or inconsistency with the goals they are trying to pursue.\nAll of this is simply an assumption that all ethics are utterly relative.

   "This would be interesting, but we cannot assume identity between brain impulses and subjective thoughts.\n\n Science seems to assume that eventually all thoughts and emotions could be explained purely through the working of the brain. However, there is not enough evidence and not enough understanding of the intricate workings of the brain to conclusively proove this, though all the evidence neurologists have found so far points to this. There is also no reliable evidence that there is a supernatural side to ourselves. I have to admit that this is an area where I have conflicting thoughts. Emotionally, I would love to believe that we are not only our physical selves and that some part of us continues on. Scientifically, I have no reason to suspect this. A person who gets a lobotomy has his personality and thoughts completely transformed. If such basic aspects of personality seem to be defined by our physical selves, then what exactly would be left under the category of the soul? This is a case where scientific conclusions run counter to what we would emotionally crave. \n \nI cannot see how we could test the influence of a supernatural reality. The point is, people who do this are led to believe this, just as people are led to believe in the external world, cause and effect and free will (despite the seeming contradiction). \n\n But imagining something is true is not the same as it being true. There has to be some objectively verifiable evidence (i.e. something one could show others not just tell them or teach them) if we are to claim that the theory that a supernatural world exists is true. Without any objective evidence, then it remains an unsupported theory - i.e. faith.\n \n I would say that the existence of the material world and cause and effect at least have objective evidence one can point to. Both an existence of a supernatural world and a true sense of free will are things that we take on faith.\n \nAs for the projection: I am very sceptical about such claims, but have myself been shocked by cases where people under deep anaesthetic in operations described the room that they were operated in, despite being taken there after being anaethitized, and could report what the doctors said, word for word. But I'm no expert, and Dan Brown tricks me, so I don't 'believe it' as such.\n\n I have also heard the stories of people under deep anasthesia describing the room they were in, what was said, etc. These are tantalizing anecdotes but have not been reliably investigated. This is where the trouble comes in with there being taboo subjects in Science. I keep expecting there to be a scientific explanation behind those stories, or simply an explanation that the stories were false, but I haven't heard of any responsible investigation being conducted by a scientifically respectable institution and this is probably mostly due to its being a scientifically taboo subject. If there really was some truth behind it, then that truth might never be discovered because it is discredited even before being investigated. If such investigations weren't taboo and if such accounts could reliably be investigated, then we could have more confidence one way or the other.\n \nBut Kant claims to work regardless of preference: a moral decision is not taken from compassion, but simply from a moral imperative.\n\n But the moral imperative assumes that we care what happens to other people or that we should care. That is true with most of us and seems to have a biological basis, but there are unfortunately many people who lack such a sense of compassion. To them, a dog-eat-dog world is fine. They will fight to stay on top and accept the fact that they may lose. As another example, the moral imperative, as stated to a masochist, would turn him into a sadist - treating others as badly as he would have himself be treated. It is not a final objective answer since it makes certain assumptions.\n \n By the way, I am not claiming that, since ethics are relative, we should allow all systems of ethics to be pursued. As a society, we need to set certain ethical goals and define those as a balance of rights and responsibilities. That is a reason why people made laws to begin with. However, when making laws, it is a very useful task to understand the ethical goals we are striving for in making the law.

   "Science seems to assume that eventually all thoughts and emotions could be explained purely through the working of the brain. However, there is not enough evidence and not enough understanding of the intricate workings of the brain to conclusively proove this, though all the evidence neurologists have found so far points to this. There is also no reliable evidence that there is a supernatural side to ourselves. I have to admit that this is an area where I have conflicting thoughts. Emotionally, I would love to believe that we are not only our physical selves and that some part of us continues on. Scientifically, I have no reason to suspect this. A person who gets a lobotomy has his personality and thoughts completely transformed. If such basic aspects of personality seem to be defined by our physical selves, then what exactly would be left under the category of the soul? This is a case where scientific conclusions run counter to what we would emotionally crave. \nAs we cannot have evidence of the subjective, we will never be able to show brain-mind identity. The fact that mind seemingly is damaged or goes when the brain is damaged means that the mind may in some sense rely on the brain, but that doesn't make them identical. Similarly, the wavelength of light we see as red is not red in itself, only to our minds, but without the light the red cannot be seen.\n \n \nBut imagining something is true is not the same as it being true. There has to be some objectively verifiable evidence (i.e. something one could show others not just tell them or teach them) if we are to claim that the theory that a supernatural world exists is true. Without any objective evidence, then it remains an unsupported theory - i.e. faith.\n \n I would say that the existence of the material world and cause and effect at least have objective evidence one can point to. Both an existence of a supernatural world and a true sense of free will are things that we take on faith.\nFirstly, you are assuming that you can't show others the supernatural truth: you reject the idea of 'teaching' them, but teaching is also required in science. If you can guide someone to a point where supernatural truths are self-evident at the level of maths, or even at the lower level of cause and effect or the physical world, is that not objective?\n \n There is no absolute evidence for the world: the only difference is that almost everyone intuits the existence of the world and cause and effect, while only some intuit the supernatural. But similarly, some can intuitively understand complex maths while others cannot.\n \n \nI have also heard the stories of people under deep anasthesia describing the room they were in, what was said, etc. These are tantalizing anecdotes but have not been reliably investigated. This is where the trouble comes in with there being taboo subjects in Science. I keep expecting there to be a scientific explanation behind those stories, or simply an explanation that the stories were false, but I haven't heard of any responsible investigation being conducted by a scientifically respectable institution and this is probably mostly due to its being a scientifically taboo subject. If there really was some truth behind it, then that truth might never be discovered because it is discredited even before being investigated. If such investigations weren't taboo and if such accounts could reliably be investigated, then we could have more confidence one way or the other.\nThis is indeed a problem. I have seen a program with some investigations and the doctors at the time being convinced, but no peer reviewed articles.\n \n \nBut the moral imperative assumes that we care what happens to other people or that we should care. That is true with most of us and seems to have a biological basis, but there are unfortunately many people who lack such a sense of compassion. To them, a dog-eat-dog world is fine. They will fight to stay on top and accept the fact that they may lose. As another example, the moral imperative, as stated to a masochist, would turn him into a sadist - treating others as badly as he would have himself be treated. It is not a final objective answer since it makes certain assumptions.\nIt doesn't assume that for Kant. As I said, if you do it because you care, it isn't truly moral.\n As for the masochist: we seek ends (happiness), not means. An ignorant masochist would be morally correct to hurt others if he thought that made them happy. But the masochist values pain towards another end (usually sexual pleasure), not simply in itself.\n \n \nBy the way, I am not claiming that, since ethics are relative, we should allow all systems of ethics to be pursued. As a society, we need to set certain ethical goals and define those as a balance of rights and responsibilities. That is a reason why people made laws to begin with. However, when making laws, it is a very useful task to understand the ethical goals we are striving for in making the law. The societies which are more free tend to allow for a wider range of ethical goals - ex. they do not force all people to follow ethical goals defined by fixed religious codes.\nIf there are no ethics, why should we balance rights and responsibilities?\n \n \nThere certainly may be other types of life forms that we have never imagined. However, someday we may understand enough about our own development and about the environments that exist in other star systems and galaxies, enough to make a reasonable estimate whether or not there could be similar intelligent species in the universe. The possibility of other types of lifeforms would only increase those chances of other intelligent life existing.\nI really don't see how we can make an estimate from a single case. We have tried before, claiming that all life needs an oxygen-rich atmosphere, before discovering life arose in a very low-oxygen atmosphere. Or all life needs water, or light, which again have been wrong. A brilliant expose of this sort of narrow-mindedness (as well being a brilliant short story generally) is Asimov's 'Nightfall'.",

That doesn't make it true. If you convince a group to believe something because you taught them - that is not evidence, just skill in teaching.

   "Given the subjective nature of mind, I don't know if scientifically viable evidence is possible.\n\n We may not ever get the final answer but there are many more things that we can learn about the brain to get evidence on that side. For example, we could learn the local 'circuitry' of various areas or even reproduce them in simulations or models to make an artificial intelligence that appears to think similarly to the way we do. On the opposite side, if there really would be a mind separate of body then perhaps there would be some way to detect that mind external to the body, etc. That hasn't been done yet, but if the theory that it exists (i.e. the external mind) is true, then it certainly is possible that evidence could be found.\n \nSome religious principles die away, even when the external system remains. The fundamental transcendent concepts of Buddhism and Hinduism have survived longer intact than those, say, of the Catholic Church, because they find support in every generation from those with similar, but fresh, experience.\nBuddhism and Hindiusm simply started earlier than Christianity, so of course they have lasted longer. Most religions are spread through either representatives (to teach others the religion) or through warfare or both. Many religions die out (as in South America or much of Africa) since invading forces either force a conversion or make it advantageous to make a conversion. Sometimes the new religion does offer things that their native religion does not. However, even in such situation, politics does play a role. Essentially, religions typically don't die out because they were proven wrong but because of other reasons. Which religions do you claim died out because they were proven wrong?\n \nWell, you define evidence as 'experiences which any of us have that make it appear that something is true'. People often have religious experiences that make it seem the supernatural is true.\n\n Two points:\n 1) What makes it seem to them that it is the supernatural? Are they getting information passed to them that would not be otherwise possible? Are they getting powers that would not otherwise be possible?\n 2) The religious experiences of different groups are very different - ex. Buddhism vs. Christianity. Besides the very vague notion that they both believe that there is something external, where exactly do you think they overlap?\n \nWhat convinces someone within constant conjunction that it is cause and effect? The fact we attribute pure experience to cause and effect, a material world, or indeed God, is outside of that experience itself.\nAs I mentioned earlier, conjunction would not be enough. You would have to have a mechanism to be convincing. Evidence is what convinces people and the more evidence there is, the more convinced they are. Without any evidence, it is hard to convince people since any joker can make an unsupported claim. Both Christians and Buddhists believe that they are right. However, they can't both be right - one or both have to be wrong. How would you go about investigating that?\n \nSo what is 'right' is what works? Would it be wrong to choose a system which doesn't work (such as the cultures that name people after animals and objects, and then taboo the names of the dead, making language constantly changing and civilisation impossible)?\n\n What works means that it is consistent with their goals, they are content with it, etc. \n \n If all humans were identical in needs and psychological outlooks then we might all be sattisfied with one ethical outlook. Perhaps one could even keep tailoring that ethical system until it had no more flaws. Even then, it is not inconceivable that there would be another one that would also sit will with all people.\n \n The difficulty with groups is that we are not all the same and don't have the same psychological outlooks. So, it would be difficult to define a group ethical system very tightly since you are bound to be unsattisfying to large sub-groups of people. That is why we generally have loosely defined group ethical systems by consensus in the form of laws (ex. Don't kill or steal from others, etc.) and leave enough room for people to follow their own personal ethics within the framework of the loose group ethical system. \n \nI'm claiming that we can't rule out the possibility.\n\n Does that mean that you accept the possibility that ethics are relative?\n \nOnce again, you are saying there is ethical value in what 'works well for people'. This seems to be the underlying objectivity to your relative ethics.\n\n What works well for people is what people are content with. This may attempt to be objective but it does not point to only one system. It is relative to the group of people under discussion.\n \nI am saying that it is astronomically unlikely that we can have such a degree of certainty about how life arose on this planet that we can know that we haven't missed out any critical factors of which we were unaware. Without other examples it is almost impossible to seperate out incidental from vital.\n\n We have a wide range of environments even here on earth where life exists and we have also made experiments to investigate other environments (such as verifying that bacteria can survive the conditions of Jupiter). So far, life has proven itself pretty resilient and flexible. The more we investigate, the more we understand the limitations of life, the better estimate we can make as to the range of probabilities of life and intelligent life existing elsewhere. I am not saying that we will ever have an exact estimate to say, ex. there must be 12 intelligent species out there. It is enough to have a theory that there would be any (anywhere from 1 to billions). We may not have enough understanding yet to even make that estimate, but that does not mean that we never will. Even once we make an estimate, then it will remain merely a theory until we get some evidence.",

   "We may not ever get the final answer but there are many more things that we can learn about the brain to get evidence on that side. For example, we could learn the local 'circuitry' of various areas or even reproduce them in simulations or models to make an artificial intelligence that appears to think similarly to the way we do. On the opposite side, if there really would be a mind separate of body then perhaps there would be some way to detect that mind external to the body, etc. That hasn't been done yet, but if the theory that it exists (i.e. the external mind) is true, then it certainly is possible that evidence could be found.\nMy question is: what sort of evidence can we have of a non-physical existence?\n \nBuddhism and Hindiusm simply started earlier than Christianity, so of course they have lasted longer. Most religions are spread through either representatives (to teach others the religion) or through warfare or both. Many religions die out (as in South America or much of Africa) since invading forces either force a conversion or make it advantageous to make a conversion. Sometimes the new religion does offer things that their native religion does not. However, even in such situation, politics does play a role. Essentially, religions typically don't die out because they were proven wrong but because of other reasons. Which religions do you claim died out because they were proven wrong?\nI didn't say that the outside structure of the religion dies because it's proved wrong, and my point wasn't simply that Buddhism and Hinduism lasted longer per se.\n \n If you read the basic principles of Buddhism, they have very clear significance to people today. The same can be true of Christianity, but only because the system of myth is sufficiently broad that it allows people to unlock different truths at different times. In Buddhism, there is a straightforward method taught and the vast majority of it is just as applicable now as then.\n \n \nTwo points:\n 1) What makes it seem to them that it is the supernatural? Are they getting information passed to them that would not be otherwise possible? Are they getting powers that would not otherwise be possible?\nIt seems the supernatural, just as our sense experiences seem to reflect an external world. It's not a question of powers or insight necessarily, and it's not proof. It's just a similar level to a more worldly's person awareness that the world exists.\n \n2) The religious experiences of different groups are very different - ex. Buddhism vs. Christianity. Besides the very vague notion that they both believe that there is something external, where exactly do you think they overlap?\nHow are the religious experiences 'very different'? If you read the Sufi or Christian mystics when they write of their experiences of God, it is like the Buddhist's experience of the transcendent: love, bliss, timelessness, demolition of the ego, and a sort of joy that transcends all earthly joy.\n \nAs I mentioned earlier, conjunction would not be enough. You would have to have a mechanism to be convincing. Evidence is what convinces people and the more evidence there is, the more convinced they are. Without any evidence, it is hard to convince people since any joker can make an unsupported claim. Both Christians and Buddhists believe that they are right. However, they can't both be right - one or both have to be wrong. How would you go about investigating that?\nThe mechanism behind one cause and effect is based on another cause and effect, ultimately resting on simple conjunction. We never directly observe cause and effect.\n As for Christians and Buddhists: they may both be approaching the same truth in different ways. One may be more efficient than the other: just as Leibniz's calculus was more efficient than Newton's. But the two reflected the same truth. Similarly, if someone asks me to multiply 99 and 32 I can go:\n \n (100 x 32) - (1 x 32)\n (90 x 32) + (9 x 32)\n or simply (99 x 32) or 32+32+32.... \n \n \n \nWhat works means that it is consistent with their goals, they are content with it, etc. \n \n If all humans were identical in needs and psychological outlooks then we might all be sattisfied with one ethical outlook. Perhaps one could even keep tailoring that ethical system until it had no more flaws. Even then, it is not inconceivable that there would be another one that would also sit will with all people.\n \n The difficulty with groups is that we are not all the same and don't have the same psychological outlooks. So, it would be difficult to define a group ethical system very tightly since you are bound to be unsattisfying to large sub-groups of people. That is why we generally have loosely defined group ethical systems by consensus in the form of laws (ex. Don't kill or steal from others, etc.) and leave enough room for people to follow their own personal ethics within the framework of the loose group ethical system. \nI know what you mean by 'works'. But you say that it is 'right' to have an ethical system which works. Surely this is an ethical judgement that transcends the situations themselves?\n \n \nDoes that mean that you accept the possibility that ethics are relative?\nOf course\n \n \nWhat works well for people is what people are content with. This may attempt to be objective but it does not point to only one system. It is relative to the group of people under discussion.\nSo contentedness is the guide, but people reach it in different ways. A Utilitarian perspective, perhaps?\n \n \nWe have a wide range of environments even here on earth where life exists and we have also made experiments to investigate other environments (such as verifying that bacteria can survive the conditions of Jupiter). So far, life has proven itself pretty resilient and flexible. The more we investigate, the more we understand the limitations of life, the better estimate we can make as to the range of probabilities of life and intelligent life existing elsewhere. I am not saying that we will ever have an exact estimate to say, ex. there must be 12 intelligent species out there. It is enough to have a theory that there would be any (anywhere from 1 to billions). We may not have enough understanding yet to even make that estimate, but that does not mean that we never will. Even once we make an estimate, then it will remain merely a theory until we get some evidence.\nShowing that bacteria can survive somewhere doesn't mean they can arise there. And if bacteria can't survive somewhere, that doesn't mean that place couldn't form its own life. Our outlook on this is inevitably held to one example, and so it is unscientific to extrapolate further.",

   "My question is: what sort of evidence can we have of a non-physical existence?\n\n Well, a few things come to mind. Since I am quite skeptical of these, I personally doubt that they could be proven but if a group would shock us with reliable evidence (reliable recordings, repeatedly demonstrated events) then it could constitute evidence of a non-physical mental existence. I am talking about the otherwise taboo subjects of ghosts and out-of-body experiences - both of which would indicate a non-physical existence.\n \nI didn't say that the outside structure of the religion dies because it's proved wrong, and my point wasn't simply that Buddhism and Hinduism lasted longer per se.\n \n If you read the basic principles of Buddhism, they have very clear significance to people today. The same can be true of Christianity, but only because the system of myth is sufficiently broad that it allows people to unlock different truths at different times. In Buddhism, there is a straightforward method taught and the vast majority of it is just as applicable now as then.\n\n I have no doubt that many of the Asian religions have, through thousands of years of experience, unlocked effective methods of meditation and mental practice which can help people control their emotions, open-their minds and imaginations and, in general, expand their mental abilities. This is not evidence of the supernatural. Indeed, I don't remember Budhism (at least in theory) having much of a sense of the supernatural - there is no God or sense of a soul that lives on after death. It almost seems like more of a technique of mind expansion than a religion. \n \n As for the apparent non-changing nature of Budhist beliefs, I would also expect that, since there seems to be much less of a religious heirarchy in Budhism, there was less of a reason for competing priestly factions to change people's beliefs. This is quite unlike Chrisitanity. In the first few centuries A.D., there were quite a wide range of beliefs - ranging from the proto-orthodox (i.e. closest to Roman Catholicism) to Gnosticism. The restriction of that range of beliefs to the one Catholic belief in the fourth century had a lot of political influence at play. The split in the church in the Reformation period also was greatly influenced by politics. Politics follows power - priests of Christianity had it and fought over it, it appears that Budhist priests did not or had much less. \n \nIt seems the supernatural, just as our sense experiences seem to reflect an external world. It's not a question of powers or insight necessarily, and it's not proof. It's just a similar level to a more worldly's person awareness that the world exists.\n\n What is it that makes it seem to be supernatural? As a comparison, the physical world appears real since it is consistent with our expectations of reality. An object we see should be manipulatable as if it is real - we can touch it, see it, it can be dropped, etc. Objects do not appear because we want them to appear or will them into appearing. Experiences of the physical world impose themselves on us (not the other way around), and we recognize that they stay consistent with our expectations of a real physical world.\n \n With supernatural experiences, what experience do you claim impose themselves on people and what structure of understanding about the supernatural world are they staying consistent to?\n \nHow are the religious experiences 'very different'? If you read the Sufi or Christian mystics when they write of their experiences of God, it is like the Buddhist's experience of the transcendent: love, bliss, timelessness, demolition of the ego, and a sort of joy that transcends all earthly joy.\n\n One (Christianity) assumes a being or beings (God, the Father and Jesus) behind the experience. The other (Budhism) does not. There are also all the stories about the life of Jesus, beliefs in the prophets, and all the miriad of structure of dogma that surrounds the belief system. Budhism has a very different structure of Dogma.\n \nThe mechanism behind one cause and effect is based on another cause and effect, ultimately resting on simple conjunction. We never directly observe cause and effect.\n\n Well, cause and effect in the physical world eventually comes down to forces you impose - they are the direct actors. If someone hits a billiard ball with a billiard stick, the ball will move. One generally speaks of that as cause and effect but, yes, it can be further disected. The person is simply moving the billiard stick and this moves the atoms of the billiard stick very close to atoms of the billiard ball so electrical forces come into play to cause the atoms of the billiard ball to move away - transfering electrical energy into kinetic energy. One could even start disecting it mathematically by calculating those electrical forces. Ultimately, the interaction of forces is the most direct cause-effect relationship but we cannot \"see\" forces, just see the effects of their actions. All this simply goes into the details of the cause effect relationship and serves to convince us all the more of the existence of such a cause-effect relationship. Evidence and understanding derived from that evidence is what convinces us of the cause-effect relationship.\n \nAs for Christians and Buddhists: they may both be approaching the same truth in different ways. One may be more efficient than the other: just as Leibniz's calculus was more efficient than Newton's. But the two reflected the same truth. Similarly, if someone asks me to multiply 99 and 32 I can go:\n \n (100 x 32) - (1 x 32)\n (90 x 32) + (9 x 32)\n or simply (99 x 32) or 32+32+32.... \n\n What truth is it that you claim that they are approaching? If you don't know but just vaguely say that you believe there is some truth, then that is merely an unsubstantiated guess - worth only as much as all the other thousands of unsubstantiated guesses that people make.\n \nI know what you mean by 'works'. But you say that it is 'right' to have an ethical system which works. Surely this is an ethical judgement that transcends the situations themselves?\n ...\n So contentedness is the guide, but people reach it in different ways. A Utilitarian perspective, perhaps?\n\n By contentedness, I do not mean happiness and perhaps \"content\" gives too much of a conatation of that. More explicitly, if a group or individual finds that their ethics are fitting the goals that they set for themselves and they see no reason to change those goals, then I would say that that ethical system is right for them. Sometimes people realize that they have to change their ethical system - ex. people who spend all their inherited money pursuing pleasure to maximize happiness eventually running out of money (which limits them pursuing their happiness goal) and realizing that they have to add some utilitarian goals to the mix. Also, there are people or groups whose ethics conflict with the ethics of a larger group - ex. criminals and the like who feel justified to prey on those who are weaker. That is why aspects of cilivization arose to begin with to define a minimal set of group ethics or laws to make life liveable for most people. As to what ethical restrictions one group can claim right to impose on another - that is another discussion all together.\n \nShowing that bacteria can survive somewhere doesn't mean they can arise there. And if bacteria can't survive somewhere, that doesn't mean that place couldn't form its own life. Our outlook on this is inevitably held to one example, and so it is unscientific to extrapolate further.\nWe cannot extrapolate to say that all life should arise in a particular way - I never claimed such an extrapolation.

The difficulty with giving evidence of the supernatural and comparing hypothetical supernatural experiences involves a limitation in language to describe such experiences.\n \nBut this is my point: sources aside, some statements appeal to something deep within us and others don't. The demarcation between the two is stronger in Buddhism: the 'eternal truth' vs. 'parochial mythology' is a clearer divide. This may be because Buddhism is purer, or because there is something so potent in Xianity it causes a sort of overflow of meaning.\n\n Just because a particular belief system \"appeals to something deep within us\" doesn't mean that it was the original message. Among other things, what appeals to us also often depends on how we were mentally conditioned - ex. conditioned to love individuality vs. collective mentality, etc. \n \nIf you ask people what seems like heaven to them, they want to keep their personalities and existence like it is, just better. Meditation seems not to lead to this.\n\n The comparison I had in mind here is that, in observing what we consider the real physical world, we have thousands if not millions of miniscule surprises that confront our senses daily. The cloud formation we see is not one we envisioned beforehand, we don't expect that particular car to pass at that particular time - thousands of such unexpected mundane miniscule occurences. If an external supernatural world exists, then one would expect similar types of unexpected experiences. What types of such unexpected occurences would you claim that people experience in hypothetically connecting with the supernatural realm? \n \nIt is inevitably a personal quest, although religious methods that produce many people who seem to have found spiritual and ethical improvement seem to be more reliable.\n\n I generally would agree that various religions do lead many people to be more spiritual and ethical and that is a positive aspect. That could be a good way to decide, from a social point of view, which religions are positive and which are negative (at least from the point of view of our own cultural preferences). However, it doesn't really address the veracity of the supernatural story which they tell.\n \nThe 'mechanism' is just another conjunction at a more basic level.\n\n Lets use Newtons law as an example (assuming that we are staying in the realm of the large and slow). If you apply a force F = 1 Newton on a 1kg mass, you will see an acceleration of 1m/s2. If you apply F = 2 Newtons to that same mass, the acceleration would be 2m/s2, etc. If there is a detailed mathematically predictable relationship between two events where the first event is initiated by our (hopefully) free will, then that suggests a mechanism of how event A can cause event B. As for whether there is an intermediate player, does it really matter? If A always causes B, and B always causes C, then A will always cause C - just not directly. There is still a cause/effect relationship between A and C - just not direct - so we don't even have to know the intermediate player B to describe a cause/effect relationship.\n \nOnly if sense data is assumed to have a solid basis. \n \n How can people 'appear' to be having their own subjective experiences? \n\n Regarding the nearly-solid basis of sense data, we once again come to mutual experience. If the world appears real in the same detailed way to everyone, then that evidence gives a high probability that our mutually recognized sense experiences are right.\n \n As for people appearing to have their own subjective experiences, we all see others who appear to think, feel and act very similar to ourselves. We cannot get into their internal minds, but make certain assumptions that the external signs (actions + language) suggest similar internal minds. There are people who have false images of someone that doesn't really exist, but then others would not see him (i.e. no mutual experience). Of course, there are also semi-humorous philosophical arguements that all other people are just figments of our particular imaginations with the whole world being designed around us (I teased my brother a few times as a kid with that arguement). \n \nNope. But I am not attempting to 'defend' any dogmatic view, merely a suspension of judgement. Therefore I don't have to show something to be true, merely possible.\n\n You seemed to claim that the assumption of the reality of our world which Science makes is the same level of assumption as faith in the supernatural. If this was indeed your claim, then you need to defend that claim by giving merit via convincing evidence (physical or otherwise) about the assumptions of faith.\n \nOK. So you don't think that there is any sense in which a person 'should' have a suitable ethical system, just that it would work for them.\n\n Yes, if it works for them then it is suitable for them. Whether or not a particular individual's ethics suite the society in which he/she lives is another issue. I have in mind the ethics of criminals which cause havoc in the larger societies by causing avoidable harm to others, as well as the ethics based on youth and ignorance of many children and young adults. I would think that societies do have certain rights to impose minimal ethical rules (ex. do not kill, steal, etc.) on all members of their populace. The details of the limits of states rights over individuals can get quite complicated and murky.\n \nI don't see how we could without multiple instances of life starting.\n\n We could get to know all we can about the beginnings of life on this planet and its evolution into at least our type of intelligent species. We could also make experiments which duplicate the original conditions (we would have to learn more about those conditions) and see if we could combine chemicals in such a way as to produce the precursors to DNA, etc. Not being a biologist, I am limited in what experiments I can envision but we have gained so much knowledge already within the last century. We are bound to learn more. It is possible that we might never have all the information that we need, but, I will take on your role this time in telling you that we should never say never.",

   "'Shared trips' are when several people taking a mind-altering substance such as magic mushrooms or LSD find themselves having the same hallucinations, and having a common experience of the world at the same distorted angle as each other.\n\n Are you suggesting that drugs in a 'shared trip' can make a false mutual experience about the real physical world? If so, then I would argue that the power of suggestion under mind-altering drugs can make people see things commonly that aren't there. However, that is pure individual imagination. If one drugged person says, for ex., \"Look at how that chair is changing colors\" then the others might start imagining a color-changing chair too, but it will be changing very differently because they are each imagining it differently. Now, if they would all imagine it in exactly the same way, then that could be an arguement against mutual experience. That is not the case so that cannot be used as an arguement against mutual experience.\n \nThe first does happen: as I've said, there are shared mystical experiences in very different religions. As for the latter: they exist to some degree, but inevitably less so because the supernatural can't be assumed to be a world full of random stuff in the way the physical is.\n\n Can you go more into these shared mystical experiences. Whether or not these would be drug-induced, my main question is the degree to which they are similar. If these experiences show a common detailed supernatural experience that can later be compared detail for detail where the details match, then there could be some evidence there. However, these cannot just be vague notions such as feeling a disappearance of personal ego and a sense of one-ness with the universe and still be claimed as evidence for the supernatural.\n \nIf it puts people in touch with their spiritual side, it works.\n\n By spiritual side, do you mean simply the emotional feeling of connection to God or the supernatural or some actual connection to God or the supernatural. If the later, then how would you investigate whether a particular religion makes a true connection and another simply imagines one. In other words, would you have a method of testing the veracity of the supernatural underpinning to the religion.\n \nThe case you give is something considered 'just conjunction' within an acceptance of cause and effect. The thing is, even if changing B changes C, all we ever see is that when B changes, C changes. We don't see the former cause the latter.\n \n I might not be massively clear: try the section on this in Hume's Enquiries if you've got access to a decent library.\n\n Indeed, I am remaining unclear as to what exactly you are looking for. If conjunction and a detailed dependence is not enough to show a cause effect relationship, what WOULD be enough?\n \nI didn't say externally controlled, I said harmonised. Why should the physical world be rational, and not the mental world: why can't order be something imposed on a series of ideas rather than objects.\n\n I'm not really following you here. Could you elaborate?\n \nYou seem to be working on the basis we must pronounce something authoritative. I disagree. And even if we accept mutual experience, it denotes that we share experiences, not that there is a physical world that causes them. As I've said, the mental could be naturally harmonious.\n\n I never claimed that we can know anything 100%. I do, however, claim that we can trust something with a lot of evidence more than we can trust something with no evidence. You seem to be saying that, as long as there is an imagined explanation that invalidates a particular type of evidence (even if there is no evidence for that explanation), then that type of evidence is useless. Then, since you don't know of any other useful type of evidence, you believe all ideas are equally valid - no matter how wild. Is that your view?\n \nYou disown any ethics, and then say that 'far too often' things are decided by force. You simply can't escape making ethical judgements, any more than I can escape the everyday assumption of a physical world and cause and effect.\n\n I do not disown ethics. I simply claim that there doesn't seem to be only one set of ethics that all people should have - i.e. ethics are relative to the people in question. I make ethical judgements but those are simply my own opinion. I do not claim that my opinion or my sense of ethics are \"right\" in some metaphysically unique way. I will sometimes try to impose myself on the ethics of others by, for example, condemning crime or speaking out against certain oppresive regimes, etc. I have no metaphysical right to oppose these ethical systems - I oppose them without having such a metaphysical right. I am simply stating my opinion. Other people can express their opinion about my ethics as well. It makes for yet another interesting topic of discussion between people.\n \nThe thing is, any science or study is very unreliable if it can't be tested against counter-examples, and they would not be available.\n\n Science working from one example is only bad if you are trying to extrapolate from that example to generalize about it. I am not trying to make a statement that \"all potential life would be like ours\". However, we can learn a lot about our particular type of life - hopefully even enough someday to make a reasonable guess about possibilities of similar extraterrestrial life.",
