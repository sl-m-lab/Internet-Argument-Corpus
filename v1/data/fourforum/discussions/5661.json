   "It might be a bit premature to announce its \"death\", but I think for many complicated historical reasons it's getting increasingly difficult to defend the values of \"conservatism\" whether in political practice or in economic policy. At the same time, the intellectual authority assumed by its liberal critics, makes the task of getting an impartial hearing for social and cultural conservatism almost like climbing a mental face of the Eiger. \n \n Some fair-minded members of this forum might agree that anyone attempting an unsophisticated defense of a conservative point of view, is quite likely to attract a queue of liberal commentators waiting in line to ridicule and plaster in ordure the unfortunate oaf who sticks his neck out.\n \n However, I'm going to put my head above the parapet for a while and claim that there is something to be said in favour of political conservatism. I'll begin by saying that what attracts me to conservatism is its pragmatism and its skepticism. This political outlook obviously springs from a desire to conserve existing things as either being good in themselves, or better than the likely alternatives. What's more, I want to argue that conservative politics is not based upon and does not seek to propagate a coherent set of principles and dogmas. Conservative opinion emerges from a personal disposition or an attitude towards change and innovation; therefore conservatism has no social program which might bring about a \"better society\". I'm not sure I could dignify what I'm talking about as a \"political philosophy\" - it's a response to what is, and not to what might be. \n \n If there's any sense in what I'm saying here, then it should be self-evident that conservatism is not doctrinaire; it does not seek to impose a \"vision\" of a model state of affairs for which it would worth overturning the status quo.\n \n OK. I'm ready now for the first salvo, if any, from the liberal artillery !",

If we would salvage liberty from this deadening left/right fusion on the center, this needs be done through a counter-fusion of old right and new left.\n\n \n \nThere are millions of Americans, I am convinced, who are still devoted to individual liberty and opposition to the leviathan state at home and abroad, Americans who call themselves \"conservatives\" but feel that something has gone very wrong with the old anti-New Deal and anti-Fair Deal cause.\n \n Something has gone wrong: the right wing has been captured and transformed by elitists and devotees of the European conservative ideals of order and militarism, by witch hunters and global crusaders, by statists who wish to coerce \"morality\" and suppress \"sedition.\"\n\n \n So really, what I mean to say mostly through these quotes, is that when someone calls themselves a \"conservative\", what exactly do they mean? Or do they mean all these things at once - tradition, enforced morality, free markets, slow change - and if so, can these things possibly form a coherent vision, or must some elements dominate over others? And which elements dominate over which?\n \n We have \"conservative\" posters on this board for example, who profess there desire for \"small government\" and then laud Roosevelt, on the grounds that he was a wartime president, and pursued national greatness programs.\n \n If someone holds two contradictory principles, and one negates the other, they really only hold one principle, and the rest is just lip service.",

Count the number of Republicans who voted aganist the Schiavo bill. Even worse you just highlighted why there are so few conservatives in Congress. \n \n How is one who \"considers it an order without questioning the rationality of any policy or ramifications involved in a policy\" not a fool?",

   "No the question is about how you judge particular cases. For example: do you analyse policies on cost-effectiveness and conservatism as two equal considerations? Or do you just believe conservative policies tend to be cost-effective. \n \n I think it would involve an initiation into thought generally. I don't see why it would be culture-specific. The Conservatives in Britain want history to be compulsory and focus on 'great British heroes'. I would rather it focused on actually teaching history, not jingoism.\n \n If by conservatism you just mean you're against accepting things on the basis of their new-fangledness, then that's the second interpretation of what you said that I gave in my first post. Why didn't you just agree with that rather than latching onto the simplistic version I called stupid?\n\n \n Your question seems to assume an ideological fixity of response. But conservatism is not an ideology, so it could be answered only if the particulars of the case are explained. From a conservative perspective, any \"case\" would be approached on the hypothesis that government should be a specific and limited activity, and that it is wise to maintain a sceptical attitude towards the idea that the power of positive law can solve all the problems of humanity. \n \n The analysis of cost-effectiveness (which I usually associate with economic matters) would proceed from the conservative assumption that all change or innovation is equivocal and has a price. Whether the price would be worth paying depends on the balance struck between costs and benefits. Some changes present no difficulty and are easily assimilable; but in any case, a conservative would expect the innovators to assume the burden of \"proof\" that a change would produce a situation which is \"better\" that it would be by leaving things as they are.\n \n In a previous contribution, you gave your opinion that much of our \"cultural heritage\" is less than worthy of preservation. I did not challenge you and ask why you held that opinion. Perhaps I should do so now after reading that you wish to expand the scope of education into the study of \"thought generally\". (That requirement is rather vague and wants sharpening up.)\n \n The intellectual legacy of Western civilisation is immensely rich and complicated. We can't know everything, so it's not unreasonable to be \"culture-specific\" since we must start somewhere. (Before you accuse me of cultural vanity, I'm well aware that non-Western sources have enriched our version of civilised life). It's shallow to pretend that engaging with this legacy boils down to a focus on \"great British heroes\" and parroting their virtues etc. Your choice of the pejorative word \"jingoism\" is also rather glib - it tends to damn the conservative disposition by word association instead of subjecting it to critical examination. Isn't this just a little superficial ?\n \n Conservatism is of course disposed to resist change and to make certain kinds of choices. It appeals to people who are acutely aware of having something to lose that is worth caring for. I wouldn't define it simply as thoughtless opposition to \"new-fangledism\" - which would indeed be stupid. The fundamental conviction, perhaps, in those of a conservative cast of mind is that there is no such thing as an unqualified improvement, and in whatever changes are proposed or imposed there will be loss as well as gain. The losses and gains are unlikely to be equally distributed among the people affected.",

(That requirement is rather vague and wants sharpening up.)\nMy cultural heritage here in Britain is a divisive class structure, Puritanical tendencies, power of unelected officials, animal cruelty, damaging extremes of free-market principles, widespread double-think and hypocrisy on empire... we have great literature, but then so do many other cultures. There are advantages in reading things in English for understanding, but many of the books that have most influenced and interested me are in translation: Camus 'the Outsider', Kafka, Milan Kunderava etc. Not to mention poets like Ovid (though poetry often relies on understanding the language well. \n \n Actually, the cultural heritage is very valuable as abstract interest and often provides surprising results: fox-hunting is not really traditional, legalised prostitution is, for example.

I am aware of the interdependence of cultures.\n \n Almost any change can be interpreted as undesirable from the point of view of some group or other: a conservative wants to moderate the pace and sometimes the direction of change.\n \n You believe in equality - in what respect ?",
