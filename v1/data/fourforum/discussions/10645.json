   "Here it goes;\n \n The South has been vilified by the Northern victor since before she seceded from the Union. It has been said they were \"racists\" and fought for the preservation of slavery or that they were \"traitors.\" These claims are based on nothing but propaganda issued from the printing press of the aggressor. I will prove that the South had the right to secede, the South's so-called \"racism\" was never as bad as the North's, and the South fought fought for the preservation of her self-determination.\n \n Secession and states' rights are two controversial subjects in American politics and government. Although they are now contentious, these were some of the guiding principles in the early days of the Union. The people of the states believed that a government closer to home, such as those in the states, had the true interest of the people in their heart. The document that declared our independence from the crown declares us to be \"free and sovereign states\" and have all the rights of a sovereign state. Why would the founding document of the states say the states are sovereign if a central government had the authority to push them back into line? The assertion to any casual observer that a document that is itself is declaring independence, forbids it to others. \n \n The next document important to the development of the United States is the Articles of Confederation. In article two of the said document it states:\n \n II. Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated to the United States, in Congress assembled.\n\n If the Articles of Confederation didn't state it was perpetual, that would be enough. Explanation of the perpetuity clause; it was meant to say that the Articles didn't end just because it was passed a certain date, and need I mention that the Articles ended in 1788, after starting in 1781.\n \n Then the Constitution is the structure of the current government. In the Constitution it never declares that the states lost their sovereignty by ratifying, if that was the case I guarantee you that it wouldn't be ratified by any of the states. Many opponents of secession would say that the supremacy clause trumps this argument. This is ridiculous, the clause means that the states by ratifying are guaranteeing that they will uphold their end of the bargain, not that the federal government is supreme in all laws it passes, no matter what their contents. Otherwise Article I Section 8 is nothing but a waste of ink and parchment.\n \n The claims issued forth from Northern presses are also false when they claim that the South was motivated by \"racism.\" If that is the case, so was the North the following is a quote from the much admired Northern general William Tecumseh Sherman: \n \nAs long as a doubtful contest for supremacy exists between the two races they cannot control their choice; but as soon as we demonstrate equal courage, equal skill, superior resources, and superior tenacity of purpose, they will gradually relax and finally submit to men who profess, like myself, to fight for but one single purpose, viz, to sustain a Government capable of vindicating its just and rightful authority, independent of niggers, cotton, money, or any earthly interest.\n (O.R., Series I, Volume XXX, p. 234-235)\n \n If you don't believe he said this, go look it up in Official Record, Cornell University has it on their website. It looks like at least Sherman believes this. It is also widely acknowledged that Lincoln believed in \"colonization\" of the blacks, sending them back to Africa. This sounds like a policy of 19th century ethnic cleansing to me, hardly a policy of tolerance. The South on the other hand gave a plan to the European powers to recognize them in late 1864 on the basis of gradual emancipation. Why would a person fight for something it was willing to get rid of? That is a question the aggressor rarely likes to be faced with.\n \n My last point concerns the South's cause in seceding. Given the facts from the previous paragraph I feel that no significant argument is needed as to her cause. If her cause was not slavery or racism, how could anyone dispute her reason for her secession, it is a moot point. So we may philosophize about her reasons but they are really not of any note, other than to try to prevent future instances of secession.\n \n The South not only had the right to secede but wasn't motivated by \"racism\" or any other such cause. If you still wish to contend her cause, please elaborate on why you believe that she seceded from the Union for that purpose.",

The South was an agrarian culture that relied on cash crops to make money, while the North was an industrialized culture, that relied on Southern purchase of their products. In order to assure Northern dominance in Southern markets, they instituted the tariff that strangled Southern agriculture because of a sharp increase in the price of goods. One of Lincoln's campaign platforms was a raise in the tariff to even higher than that set in the Tariff of Abominations, which almost lead to South Carolina seceding. Since the North held a large majority in both the House and Senate, the South feared that they would take the opportunity to raise the tariff to such an extent that the Southern economy would collapse. \n \n Most European thinkers of the time believed that this was the case.

Each country was a monarchy, and a monarchy does not ordinarily like to see a rebellion succeed in any land. (The example may prove contagious.) Yet the war had not progressed very far before it was clear that the ruling classes in each of these two countries sympathized strongly with the Confederacy-so strongly that with just a little prodding they might be moved to intervene and bring about Southern independence by force of arms. The South was, after all, an aristocracy, and the fact that it had a broad democratic base was easily overlooked at a distance of three thousand miles. Europe's aristocracies had never been happy about the prodigious success of the Yankee democracy. If the nation now broke into halves, proving that democracy did not contain the stuff of survival, the rulers of Europe would be well pleased.\n To be sure, the Southern nation was based on the institution of chattel slavery-a completely repugnant anachronism by the middle of the nineteenth century. Neither the British nor the French people would go along with any policy that involved fighting to preserve slavery. But up to the fall of 1862 slavery was not an issue in the war. The Federal government had explicitly declared that it was fighting solely to save the Union. If a Southern emissary wanted to convince Europeans that they could aid the South without thereby aiding slavery, he could prove his case by citing the words of the Federal President and Congress.

So, those in power in Europe did have reason to support the cause of the South for political reasons but there were initially practical considerations restraining them (miltary support of the South would mean war with the North and the secession of trade with the North, among other things), and later the Emancipation Proclamation made it politically unfeasable.\n \n As for slavery being the core cause of the Civil War, very few historians would argue that the South would have seceded even if there had been no threat to slavery. Of those Confederate states that stated their reasons for secession, the threat to slavery was listed as the main cause.

The Civil War was indeed fought because of the secession of the South and not initially to directly outlaw slavery, but the South seceded mainly because of the threat to slavery posed by Lincoln's election.

I don't think that there are too many people disputing that there might not have been other causes. Indeed, I could understand that the issue of tarriffs might also have been influencial. However, my understanding is that the great majority of scholars agree that, without the issue of slavery, the other issues would not have been strong enough to cause Cessession. After all, if the tarriff issue was the main one then why wasn't that listed as the main cause of cessession for those states that did declare their causes? I have heard arguements that they used the issue of slavery as the main cause for cessession to rally their own internal support for cessession since tarriff's did not generate the public anger that would have been necessary. That, however, just confirms the arguement that, without the threat to slavery, cessession would not happen since the public of the South would not have supported cessession for other less compelling reasons.\n \n I would also be curious about the Vatican's official reasons for supporting the South. One cannot just jump to assumptions that Vatican support of the Southern cause justifies it. After all, the Vatican kept an appeasing stance toward Nazi aggression toward the Jews during World War II and there were certainly a wide range of corrupt popes and high bishops and cardinals in Vatican history.",

   "It seems that there are two questions that are being addressed here:\n 1. Was the issue of slavery the core cause of the American Civil War? As you know, my posts and Steeeeve's have argued that it was.\n \n 2. Did the South have the right to cessede? This is a trickier question and I personally admit that I am not sufficiently familiar with the political / legal history of the US from the time of the Revolution to the time of the Civil War to give a definitive answer. My general understanding is that, at the founding of the US, the federal government and the Union of states in general was much looser - with States having the main political power. However, as time went on, things changed so that the power of the federal government and the strength of the union increased. So, by the time of the Civil War, there might have been enough legal / political statutes against Cessession to give the North its justification for war. However, I will leave that arguement for others who are more familiar with US political history of those times.\n \n However, it does raise an interesting general question. Namely, our political rhethoric generally does support self-determination of peoples. However, how far does this go?

   "Of those Confederate states that outline the reasons for cessesion, the issue of slavery is listed as the main cause. I don't think that there are too many people disputing that there might not have been other causes. Indeed, I could understand that the issue of tarriffs might also have been influencial. However, my understanding is that the great majority of scholars agree that, without the issue of slavery, the other issues would not have been strong enough to cause Cessession. After all, if the tarriff issue was the main one then why wasn't that listed as the main cause of cessession for those states that did declare their causes? I have heard arguements that they used the issue of slavery as the main cause for cessession to rally their own internal support for cessession since tarriff's did not generate the public anger that would have been necessary. That, however, just confirms the arguement that, without the threat to slavery, cessession would not happen since the public of the South would not have supported cessession for other less compelling reasons.\n \n I would also be curious about the Vatican's official reasons for supporting the South. One cannot just jump to assumptions that Vatican support of the Southern cause justifies it. After all, the Vatican kept an appeasing stance toward Nazi aggression toward the Jews during World War II and there were certainly a wide range of corrupt popes and high bishops and cardinals in Vatican history.\n\n \n I believe that slavery and tariffs were catalysts to secession, not the root cause in itself. As I have stated, the North and South were, and to a great extent sill are, two different peoples with two different interests. The combination was always seen as unnatural, with the Northern culture being one of work and work to become successful, and the South is one of work the fields, but try to get out of it if at all possible. The two sections were, and are, different in many other ways, the music has always been different, the language is slightly different, and the sections roots are entirely different. Southern Culture is based on the Scottish, Irish, and some African cultures, the North's was more puritan and English, now they are much more multicultural. \n \n The Vatican never officially declared support, what they did was publish pro-Confederate newspapers, and they had friendly relations with the South, while they were generally neutral toward the North. You cannot compare the situation with the Nazis for two reasons:\n 1) The Vatican was surrounded by either fascists or Nazis during the entire war, the South might have had a cruiser dock at Rome once, but I don't know.\n 2) The Vatican never actually declared support for what the Nazis did, they only didn't say that it was wrong.",

   "It seems that there are two questions that are being addressed here:\n 1. Was the issue of slavery the core cause of the American Civil War? As you know, my posts and Steeeeve's have argued that it was.\n \n 2. Did the South have the right to cessede? This is a trickier question and I personally admit that I am not sufficiently familiar with the political / legal history of the US from the time of the Revolution to the time of the Civil War to give a definitive answer. My general understanding is that, at the founding of the US, the federal government and the Union of states in general was much looser - with States having the main political power. However, as time went on, things changed so that the power of the federal government and the strength of the union increased. So, by the time of the Civil War, there might have been enough legal / political statutes against Cessession to give the North its justification for war. However, I will leave that arguement for others who are more familiar with US political history of those times.\n \n However, it does raise an interesting general question. Namely, our political rhethoric generally does support self-determination of peoples. However, how far does this go? If a town wanted to declare itself independent of the US based on local referendum, could it? If not, why not? Some arguements concentrate on the idea that a nation's resources belong to the nation in general, not only to the local area where the resources are located (ex. the case of oil or mineral mines).

That is a harder question and one worth pondering.\n\n \n You must look at the legality of secession as definitive from each point of Constitutional change, and what the Constitutional change was. The states were sovereign before the Articles of Confederation, as the Articles say that each state retained their sovereignty. Then the Constitution was adopted, with no giving up of sovereignty, either explicit or implicit that can be told. You cannot say that secession became illegal over a matter of time without a Constitutional amendment saying that the states must give up their sovereignty (which I doubt they would do so). \n \n There is a way that an area with 60000 or more residents can secede without the act becoming a revolutionary one. If a city with 70000 people in it wants to leave the country, they can follow this process;\n 1) secede from their county\n 2) secede from their state, with the state legislature approving\n 3) apply for statehood\n 4) hope and pray Congress accepts them\n 5) once a state, secede",

The program would start by making ways for slaves to become free, like Virginia's law where if you bring in a slave for more than a year, and it becomes free, unless you change citizenship to Virginia (Virginians would have to free their slaves, it was created to combat the slave trade). Then I would make it so slaves could receive the basic education needed to live in the world of the 1800s, like what Jefferson Davis did with his slaves. He taught them the basics of law and politics by having trials where he was the judge, the \"prosecutor\" was elected, and the defense attorney was selected by the defendant. Davis could only sentence (he could only lower the sentence the jury recommended), regulate evidence, or throw out convictions.

   "What I would have suggested would be a program that would abolish slavery over a period of time. The program would start by making ways for slaves to become free, like Virginia's law where if you bring in a slave for more than a year, and it becomes free, unless you change citizenship to Virginia (Virginians would have to free their slaves, it was created to combat the slave trade). Then I would make it so slaves could receive the basic education needed to live in the world of the 1800s, like what Jefferson Davis did with his slaves. He taught them the basics of law and politics by having trials where he was the judge, the \"prosecutor\" was elected, and the defense attorney was selected by the defendant. Davis could only sentence (he could only lower the sentence the jury recommended), regulate evidence, or throw out convictions. The program would see all slaves freed in 40 years, at the rate of apx. 1 million a decade, and probably more in the later decades. There would also be a program so that there would not be a labor shortage on the fields.\n\n Sure, there are many ways in which slavery could have been slowly and peacefully phased out but the trouble was that there was apparently no motivation in local Southern populations to do so - it would have had to be done through external influence. \n \n In England and other countries where slavery was eventually voted out, the voting population learned about and then acknowledged the evils of slavery and eventually overcame the influence of the money (that slavery generated) on politics to vote it out. If there had been no large internal drive to stop slavery, and no external factors making it too difficult to keep, then slavery might have continued in perpituity. In the South, I have never heard of any significant popular movement to end slavery - except perhaps a small insignificant minority of protesters. That would leave external influence and internal threat of rebellion as the only options for ending slavery.

It is understandable that some in the South, particularly in the state where the rebellion happened, might have wondered whether it was worth ther risk - spurring on a short-lived abolition movement. However, the conclusion that was apparently drawn both in Virginia and in the other Southern states was not to end slavery but to introduce far more stringent control of their slaves (in outlawing teaching slaves to read and write, etc.) in order to limit the threat of rebellion. So, instead of a growing abolition movement, slavery became even more entrenched in the South. If you deny this, then please point out some prominent abolition movements that were in force in the South at least into the 1850s.",

   "Here it goes;\n ...I will prove that the South had the right to secede, the South's so-called \"racism\" was never as bad as the North's, and the South fought fought for the preservation of her self-determination.\nI am a little late to this debate, but I just ran across it today. Lots of tangent issues have been discussed, too.\n \n... The document that declared our independence from the crown declares us to be \"free and sovereign states\" and have all the rights of a sovereign state....\n The next document important to the development of the United States is the Articles of Confederation....\n Then the Constitution is the structure of the current government. In the Constitution it never declares that the states lost their sovereignty by ratifying, if that was the case I guarantee you that it wouldn't be ratified by any of the states.\nSince the Constitution was made from the ground up, rather than amending the Articles of Confederation, I believe it became the sole governing document. It superceded all that came before it (though it contained many of the same ideas). Do the Articles of Confederation or the Declaration of Independence have standing for intepreting our laws in court? I get the idea that we agree on the Constitution being the defining document - though I think you try to use some of the language of the previous documents to, um, expand the meaning of the Constitution. I think the Constitution was a change in direction from the previous documents, toward a bigger commitment by the States. More like marriage than cohabitation. \n \n It does not explicitly declare a loss of sovereignty, but it does place certain limits upon the States. Ratifying the Constitution was an agreement to those limits.\n \n I think these clauses do bind the States in a Union and/or prohibit secession in the manner attempted by the CSA: \n \n \"...no new State shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or Parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress.\" (We could argue about whether the word \"State\" would be applied to a nation state such as the CSA. The Constitution does not have a Glossary to define each term.)\n \n \"No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation...\" \n \n Secession violates the terms of this contract with all the other States. Secession as an allied group of States violates even more terms. Was the Constitution a non-binding contract that anyone could ignore at will?\n \n And I am not convinced that you can guarantee how all States would have behaved. \n \n \nMany opponents of secession would say that the supremacy clause trumps this argument. This is ridiculous, the clause means that the states by ratifying are guaranteeing that they will uphold their end of the bargain, not that the federal government is supreme in all laws it passes, no matter what their contents. \n\n \n This clause? \"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\"\n \n I think it says that the US Constitution and US Laws trump State Constitution and State Law. It does not say \"no matter what their contents\", it says those laws must abide by the Constitution. Has it been legally interpreted otherwise?\n \n If that is not enough, the supremacy clause is followed by a clause that applies to every legislator, governor and judge in each of the States: \"The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; \" Wasn't that Oath broken in every CSA state?\n \n \nOtherwise Article I Section 8 is nothing but a waste of ink and parchment.\n\n \n Are you saying that the Section that enumerates powers of Congress somehow trumps another section that calls US laws the supreme law of the land? The powers of Congress are broadly written, and it is hard to believe that they somehow negate another part of this same document.\n \n BTW, among those powers: \"To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions;\" Every State ratified this document.\n \n I cut out the \"the South's so-called \"racism\" was never as bad as the North's\" arguments. This \"he did it worse than I did it\" should have been countered quite simply by your Mother: \"Two wrongs don't make a right\".\n \n In the eyes of the public, the war was about slavery. In the eyes of the public, slavery was racist - because most slaves were black. (I think that only blacks were considered property.) In the eyes of the public, the South was more racist because of more-recent publicized history - the Jim Crow laws, one-drop laws, lynchings, school segregation and other overt, widely-publicized activities. People forget that there were slave states that did not move to secede (and were the last to abolish slavery). \n \n I assume this issue - racism - is mentioned here in an attempt to prove that the South was right in its desire to secede, since that is part of your resolution. \n \n \nMy last point concerns the South's cause in seceding.\n\n Excerpted from \"A Declaration of the Immediate Causes which Induce and Justify the Secession of the State of Mississippi from the Federal Union\":\n \"Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin. \n ...\n [The hostility to the institution of slavery] advocates negro equality, socially and politically, and promotes insurrection and incendiarism in our midst.\"\n \n Please read the Declarations of Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas at \n ht tp://sunsite.utk.edu/civil-war/reasons.html, \n and tell me again that slavery was not a reason for secession. (Sorry, I am too new here to post a live URL.) Some searching should find the declarations of the other states, too.\n \n I am no Civil War scholar, but from what I have learned it appears that slavery was only one factor. After years of tariffs (that protected Northern manufacturers of goods, but also kept prices of those goods high) and taxes (that somehow hit Southern agriculture harder than Norther industry), the South was unhappy with their economic lot. (With so many of our Presidents having been from the South, and the rural bias that is inherent in the structure of Congress, I do not know how this situation came to be. I also think it was probably unconstitutional in structure.)\n \n However, I think that the Missouri Compromise - which had to do with slave ownership - was the spark that lit the tinder, because the South could see that their power base would only diminish. (One expected effect of this would be more pressure to abolish slavery.) Lincoln's election fanned the tinder to flames.\n \n Slavery was an economic issue for the South, and the South was already slowly moving toward abolition. (I think the rest of the Western World had eliminated slavery in the sense of ownership of a human. Ownership of another human was already an anachronism.)\n \n It appears that the Emancipation Proclamation was a tactic to prevent European aristocracy from supporting the CSA. Though Lincoln could not state that slavery was the reason for the war (for fear of losing more states to the secession attempt), by the end of the war slavery had become a major issue for the North. That is another reason that slavery sticks in people's minds as the reason for the war.",
