Your rant belies the statistical facts in the real world. \n Each year, one in four teens contracts an STD/STI. [6]\n \n One in two sexually active persons will contact an STD/STI by age 25. [7]\n \n About half of all new STDs/STIs in 2000 occurred among youth ages 15 to 24. [8] The total estimated costs of these nine million new cases of these STDs/STIs was $6.5 billion, with HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV) accounting for 90% of the total burden. [9]\n \n Of the STDs/STIs that are diagnosed, only some (gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, hepatitis A and B) are required to be reported to state health departments and the CDC.\n One out of 20 people in the United States will get infected with hepatitis B (HBV) some time during their lives. [10] Hepatitis B is 100 times more infectious than HIV. [11]\n Approximately half of HBV infections are transmitted sexually. [12] HBV is linked to chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer.\n Hepatitis A, hepatitis B and HPV are the only vaccine-preventable STDs/STIs. (Not all HPV types are covered by the vaccine, so women who receive it still need Pap tests.) \n It is estimated that as many as one in five Americans have genital herpes, a lifelong (but manageable) infection, yet up to 90 percent of those with herpes are unaware they have it. [13] \n With more than 50 million adults in the US with genital herpes and up to 1.6 million new infections each year, some estimates suggest that by 2025 up to 40% of all men and half of all women could be infected. [14,15,16]\n Over 6 million people acquire HPV each year, and by age 50, at least 80 percent of women will have acquired genital HPV infection. [17] Most people with HPV do not develop symptoms.

Now even though the moral will suffer the same fate as the immoral when God withdraws His grace and allows the enemy to attack our Nation, He will never forsake the faithful.

One of the things that strikes me about people who say civil law is morality put into law is that they oppose morality put into law in other cases, but have no problem with it when it's a moral issue they consider important. \n \n \n \n I would say the most you can say is, that is your morality. Others emphasize different things, and more importantly, people differ on how that should play out and what is truly in peoples' best interests and what is not, or what is a more important or better use of living that out.\n \n Also, FWIW, if AA insulted you here, I've seen far worse than that from people who side with you on these issues, and you rarely if ever speak up when they do so. I think there is a difference between moral and civil issues, and that seems to be what AA is saying.\n\n \n I have no problem discusing what Archangel is saying about civil law and morals. When he resorts to putting me down personally, I will call him on it and urge him to focus on the issue at hand, not on me. I don't respond, usually, to put-downs and insults directed at other people in other threads, mostly because I don't read them. I try to skip over these posts as much as I can. \n \n Please do not assume that I agree with what other posters may say. I find myself often agreeing with you, and disagreeing with posters whose views on gay rights may be similar to mine but whose views on, say, religion, may be different from mine. When posts degenerate into personal attacks, in arguments in which I am not involved, I usually manage to avoid getting involved.\n \n I agree with you that not everyone shares the same views about morality. That's the source of the disagreement between Archangel and myself; his beliefs about morality are not my beliefs. His effort to make society \"moral\" is based on his religious beliefs, which are not my religious beliefs. \n \n I also agree with you that not all civil laws are efforts to secure morality. But many civil laws are based in morality or are efforts to secure morality. Moral and civil issues overlap. A central argument of those who oppose same-sex civil marriage is that it's immoral, and therefore it should not be legal. A central argument of those who support same-sex civil marriage is that denying equal treatment under the law to gay people is immoral, and same-sex marriage should be legal. \n \n I agree with most of what you write in your post. And yes, my argument about what is moral is my view. That's what I present here: my view of things. I do not argue that my view of morality is universal or is handed to us by God. I do not believe that God has handed us morality; we have to make that decision for ourselves.",

The question that everyone wanted answered is \"WHAT ARE PEOPLE DOING THAT MAKES THEM SUSCEPTIBLE TO CATCHING THIS DEADLY DISEASE THAT HAD NO CURE.\" No matter how much you deny it, my post below explains what the doctors found when they tracked the personal lives of the victims. \n \n Regarding the order of the posts, just remember that mine came first, and yours does nothing to respond to it at all. And just to keep the record straight, here is the post I was responding to by Op:\n \n\n Sexual behavior becomes immoral when it is done without care and compassion for another and for oneself, when it harms another or oneself.

People who engage in risky behavior with an infected person ALSO get infected.\n If a Haitan shared a drug needle with a gay man, that could be a precursor.\n If a Haitan had sex with a gay man, that could be a precursor.\n \n You try to use science to identify a difference in HIV strains, but then refuse to acknowledge what else science has observed about the different HIV strains...\n \n \n \nIn fact, I would have no problem with that articles version of events at all if it admitted that the explanation for American HIV exploding within the homosexual community, was because that Haitian was most probably gay and introduced the virus into that community.\n\n Archie, science doesn't do the whole \"Christian apologetics\" thing where they make up stuff with no evidence.\n While what you describe are viable possibilities, it is pointless to try to pretend it is \"scientific\" when it isn't.\n science: knowledge or a system of knowledge covering general truths or the operation of general laws especially as obtained and tested through scientific method\n \n Furthermore, the HIV in Haiti is not a \"gay\" problem like it is in the U.S.\n 53%: Estimated percentage of HIV cases that occured among women (ages 15-49) by the end of 2005\n http://www.globalhealthreporting.org/countries/haiti.asp?collID=16&id=47&malID=158&tbID=157&hivIC=159&malIC=161&tbIC=160&map=162&con=Haiti&p=1\n Heterosexual intercourse is the predominant mode of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission worldwide [1, 2]. In Haiti, more than 90% of patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were infected with HIV by this route [3].\n http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/125/4/324\n \n \n \nThat would at least explain how it was found in that specific population and not in the straight or Haitian neighborhoods anywhere in the American population.\n\n Why the heck would you think that a disease that originated in HAITI would somehow have to jump directly to \"Haitian neighborhoods\" when it reached the U.S.?\n \n \n \nI am fighting against the rewrite of history and the attempt to deny that the American strain of AIDS was found solely within the homosexual community. And any denial of that is a lie and a distortion of the path it took into the American populace. Nobody believes, much less me that this was a considered or purposeful thing that this community did.\n\n I find it hilarious that YOU YOURSELF gave an explanation for how the disease could have gone from \"Haiti\" to \"U.S. gay\", but now you call the whole idea a \"lie\"...\n \n \n \nAgain, This wasn't a gay conspiracy, just stop denying that the American strain of AIDS was born out of the homosexual community.\n\n \"born out of\"?\n It developed quite vigorously in the gay community, but \"born\" is entirely the wrong word.\n The origins of the specific strain in question were tracked.\n \n \n \nMy link is clear regarding the difference between the African strains and the American strain. http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/African-HIV-strains-more-resistant-to-anti-HIV-drugs-192-1/ Your link doesn't deal with that.\n\n It deals directly with the U.S. straight that your article mentioned.Based on the analysis, the researchers reported last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that there is a 99.8 percent certainty that the virus moved first from Africa to Haiti and then leapt to the United States. \n Because the mutations accumulate at a predictable rate, the researchers were able to use them as a kind of molecular clock to calculate when the virus arrived in each location. The results indicated that it appeared in Haiti in about 1966 and the United States in about 1969, before traveling to Europe, Canada, Latin America, Australia, Japan and other parts of the world. \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/04/AR2007110400959_2.html?sid=ST2007110401205\n \n \n \nAnd it is an objective medical source which is NOT attempting to make any specific implications at all regarding the homosexual community.\n\n That's the closest you've come to admitting your REAL problem with the article.\n There is nothing factually wrong with it.\n It just doesn't talk about gays like you want it to...\n \n \n \nAll I'm doing is stating the actual undeniable community within the USA that the first victims of HIV/AIDS were members of.\n\n The article previously given doesn't even argue against that.\n If that is \"all you are doing\", then why are you raising such a fuss with an article that doesn't argue against that?",

   "don't ask that question because everyone has different views of the world and the people in it. what may not effect someone could effect someone else. if no one cared about anything today, we'd live in an even more lonely and crazy times. caring is part of our humanity. the most murderous person in the world has to care about something, even if its theirself. \n \n some people may not pay wheiter or not gay people get married or have kids or even have sex, some probably pay very close attention to it. \n \n some people care because they feel like gay people should be accepted among everyone else.\n \n some people care because they find gay people grose or disgusting or like many, sinners.\n \n and don't even say you don't care otherwise you would never have bothered to ask us that question.\n \n so that's my response and believe me, i'm waiting for the angry relgious responses and the negitive feedback from how i put this so bring it.",
