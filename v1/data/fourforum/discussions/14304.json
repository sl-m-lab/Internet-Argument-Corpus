   "Meanwhile and seemingly true to form, Every time the courts are about to protect gun rights, California believes it MUST stick their thumb in the eye of our Constitution! Or, at least it just seems that way to me. \n  California Assembly approves bill to expand rifle record-keeping  \n California would keep a permanent record of anyone buying a shotgun or rifle under legislation passed Thursday by the Assembly.\n \n The measure would expand state law by adding long-gun buyers to a state Justice Department database that currently can identify only handgun purchasers.\n \n Opponents contend the bill is the latest in a long line of bureaucratic hurdles designed to discourage gun ownership. \n \n \"It's none of government's flippin' business what guns I own, or why I own them,\" said Sam Paredes, executive director of Gun Owners of California. \n",
