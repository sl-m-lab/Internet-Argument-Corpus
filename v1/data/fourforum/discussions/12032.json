   "Political suicide?\n \n More like physical suicide...\n As I think some people who wuv their guns would just blow the ignorant politician away with their newly illegal gun.\n \n I'd also like to see how the gov't would collect said illegal weapons. Gun buy back? Seriously, the gov't thinks it could buy the items from the people...I'm not selling mine at a loss...nor trading it for '$50 vouchers'.\n And, at my age...I'd just shoot a lot of people and go spend the rest of my days living in the pen...on the tax payers dime.\n \n 'What ya in fer?'\n \"I voted 9 people out of office...and I think I got a couple of their appointees too.\"\n 'What'd they do?'\n \"They sought to take my rights away or stood idly by as others did.\"\n emoticon_xkill",
