   "This program sounded bad the second I heard it. \n So in an attempt to give everyone a fair chance, everyone is dragged to the same level? Sounds fair enough. Or not.\n They are starting to focus too much on the students who are having trouble learning. They offer advanced placement classes, sure. (Same stuff, more busy work. Where is the actual learning?) In my experince, if you are having trouble, they (the guidance counselors or whatnot) come to you. If you are bored out of your mind, you have to go to them. \n All of the foreign students that have attended my high school think it's the easiest thing they've ever done. What Bush's plan is doing, is making everything easier, because schools are afraid to challenge students who are just in it to get by. \n This plan only focuses on stuff that isn't really going to get you anywhere in the real world. Our grandparents -with only 17 years of education, were more prepared for the 'real world' than we are today. WHY?? \n We don't focus on what's important. \n I have yet to find something in this plan that is going to do our society any good.\n I guess this is mainly only affecting the public schools.\n However, I think the main problem with this issue, is that no one is publically speaking out for it. If you write in to people in office, you'd be surprised at some of the responses. Not everyone supports these stupid policies. They are looking for support. Some of the responses I have gotten back are stunning. Some think it's one of the largest steps to our downfall that we could possibly take. \n Another problem is: parents don't know about it. They hear about it, sure, but many don't really know how bad it is. Parents need to be told. Have your parents take stuff to the work place and pass it around. It has an effect, even if small at first. They are voting power.\n I think we need to bring these kind of systems down. They are hurting us students more than they are helping.",
