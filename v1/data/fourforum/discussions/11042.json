   "www.m-w.com\n bigot:\n a person obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices; especially : one who regards or treats the members of a group (as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance\n \n In the past, discussing this topic has resulted in some people neutering the definition to the degree that Martin Luther King Jr could have been called a \"bigot\" cause he was obstinately devoted to his opinion...\n \n My personal definition of bigotry involves tangible measures. If a person advocates for discrimination against a group, then that person is discriminated against that group. Advocating for discrimination against a group is a clear sign of \"intolerance\".\n \n Another example obviously involves a person advocating condemnation against a group, utilizing typical tools of prejudice.\n For example, Archie's recent attempts to condemn the ENTIRE group of gays, based on the actions of a few isolated cases. Such negative stereo-typing is a clear tool of prejudice.\n Also, sweeping generalizations like Archie's *bitchy like a gay* comment are another sign of bigotry.\n \n I offer up this thread as a real discussion on the topic, to refute the mindless claims of some that bigotry is claimed *just because you don't agree*.\n \n Bigotry is real, and most people don't take it lightly.\n Claims of *just because you don't agree* are simply grossly dishonest strawman arguments, attempting to ignore the REAL reasons why \"bigotry\" is claimed.\n \n For those who think \"bigotry\" is used too often, perhaps you can take this thread as a place where YOU YOURSELF can define what you think \"bigotry\" is. What would a person have to do in order for YOU to assess that the person had anti-gay bigotry?",

Either I'm indicting all gays or I'm not. By exposing a problem that exists within the gay community isn't saying that all gays agree with it at all.

To expect less would be to allow you to make even more unfounded statements that you have already made against me.\n \n Here is what I have shown in my thread. First, that the gay community has a real problem of discriminating against black members of their own community. I was never even aware that the problem existed before coming across a gay website dedicated to exposing the problem within the community. After being attacked and lambasted for unfairly attacking the gay community because it was an insignificant occurrence that was being dealt with internally;\n \n I then posted the link about the gay comedian who's act is a white comic dressed in black face who made a good living on the gay bar circuit. And the excuses, justifications of the gay community continued, and the attacks on my bigotry ensued.\n \n Then I posted about the Gay retirement community that supported segregation by not wanting to allow even gay friendly straight people to buy there and be there neighbors. Of course it still never occurred to you that this is a larger issue than you had previously thought, but that surely I was just a bigger bigot than previously known. And the personal attacks ensued as you insisted that this was just an isolated issue and I was trying to make a mountain out of a mole hill due to my inchecked prejudice and hatred for all gay people.\n \n So finally, I post the story about blatant racism, and institutional prejudice and bigotry taking place in the very epicenter of Americas Gay World, the Castro, in San Francisco; and lo and behold, I'm still the evil hate monger who is so bent on demonizing the homosexual community that i would again refer to such an isolated case as one of the most popular clubs in the Castro that is proven guilty of racism and discrimination. You also deny that an organization has been founded for the express purpose of watching for racism and discrimination in the Castro which is evidenced by them having cards with their numbers on it in every single business in the Castro District.\n \n So yes foundit, since that thread has more than a hundred posts on it now, surely you can find at least ONE post where I condemn and indict every single white gay person and accuse them all of supporting racism? Surely you can support the uncountable numbers of times you have accused me of this personal hatred, bigotry and prejudice for all gays with even one post of me including ALL GAYS in this scandal? Can't you foundit? Or are you once again making one of those sweeping generalizations that so easily can be used to define you as an anti christian bigot.",

I think that in practice the definition of \"intolerant\" is quite subjective. You will never find me arguing that words do not have any meaning. My experience is that there is a mantra in the culture that says, \"such and such is an intolerant view, and therefore it is a view that ought to be dismissed out of hand.\" I.e., that intolerance cannot be tolerated (for whatever reason). I do not subscribe to that view.\n As a relevant example, let's suppose we have a poster who argues that gay marriage is not a right required by the Constitution. Suppose further that a different poster retorts that, \"Sure it is. The only reason you would say otherwise is because you are bigoted against gays.\"\n\n < yawn <\n If you're going to indulge in strawman antics, you're not going to get a reply from me to your strawman antics.\n \n \n \nI would suggest that the latter calls the former a bigot in order to have the former's argument dismissed out of hand\n\n And here-in lies the problem I discussed when I started this thread.\n SOME people use the ACCUSATION of bigotry as a \"get out of arguing the point free\" card.\n I remember once I had somebody complain about me using the word \"homophobe\" in that I called anybody who disagreed with me by that term.\n By doing a little research on the board's search engine, I found that the person MAKING the claim was USING the term more often than I was.\n And in fact, the MAJORITY of the posts with the person complaining about \"homophobe\" involved them BRINGING UP THE SUBJECT ON THEIR OWN.\n They were not quoting anybody calling them a homophobe.\n Instead, they were using the argument as a means to ignore the argument and change the subject.\n \n Quite frankly, we BOTH know that there have been a LOT better responses to the \"I don't believe in gay marriage\" position than \"you're a bigot\".\n But the \"you're a bigot\" line gets a LOT more attention, simply because people like you can make the complaint as above.\n And in the mean-time, the other LEGITIMATE arguments which are actually being made in court get ignored...\n \n Much like here, where I have brought up some LEGITIMATE points about \"bigotry\", and they are being ignored so that you can complain about something that isn't even present in this thread!",
