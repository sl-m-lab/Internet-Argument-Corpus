First off, the background you should know is that:\n \n Since we use base 10, multiplying a number by 10 moves the decimal point one to the right. So 5.0 times 10 is 50 (this should be pretty obvious). This is true because the nature of place values in a decimal (base 10) system is that each place to the left is 10 times the value of the place directly to the right. The first place is the units place, than the 10s, than the 100s, and so on. If you go to the right however, you are dividing by 10.\n \n You should also know that any number to the power of a negative number is equal to 1 over the number to the power of the positive. So 10 to the power of -2 is 1/(10^2) or 1/1000.\n \n So multiplying a number by 10 to the power of any number moves the decimal to the right that many because you are essentially multiplying by 10 that many times, and earlier I showed how multiplying by 10 moves the decimal point one to the right.\n \n Multiplying the number by 10 to a negative power moves it to the left the amount of the number made positive. 10^-2 is really 10^-1 done twice and since multiplying by 10^-1 moves the decimal place over to the left one, multiplying by 10^-2 moves the decimal place over to the left two.\n \n Now the convention is to have one number on the left of the decimal place. So to make a number scientific notation you have to move the decimal point to the left or right a certain amount. First figure out that amount and figure out what power to raise 10 to and multiply by it. So 2594.3 would need the decimal place moved 3 to the left, now you multiplied the number by 10^-3 since moving it to the left is multiplying by a negative power of 10. Now you need to do something to balance that out. You can't just arbitrarily multiply numbers by another number and keep them equivelant. So you have to do the reverse to keep the number the same. \n \n You should know that any number times a number divided by that same number equals the original number. That is convinient because we multiplied by 10^-3 so to keep the number the same we have to divide by 10^-3. You should recall that 10^-3=1/10^3 and 1/1/10^3 equals simply 10^3. So dividing by 10^-3 is the same as multiplying by 10^3. So the final result would be 2.5943 *10^3. If you work that out mathematically you should find you get 2594.3, or your original number.\n \n I hope this helped explain the reasoning behind it. If you don't understand just ask, I have no idea what your math background is so I may have over-simplified concepts you already know or left out something you don't know. If you are completely confused and just want to be able to do it and don't care why, just read Unkerpaulie's post, it adequately explains it. I usually prefer to know why, so I thought I'd explain why.",
