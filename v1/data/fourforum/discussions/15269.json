   "A great discovery or another disappointment?\n \n An Italian inventor, Andrea Rossi claims to develop a new kind of a nuclear reactor. Each unit contains about 100 grams of powdered nickel fuel mixed with a secret catalyst, inside of a sealed container. The container is filled with compressed hydrogen. The unit uses electric energy at the rate of 0.4 kW but it generates thermal energy at the rate of 12.4 kW. The released energy is said to be due to nuclear reactions resulting from turning nickel into copper. In one case Rossi's reactor operated for six month[, heating several rooms. During this time 30% of nickel was converted into copper. Three demonstrations were performed in 2011, at the University of Bologna.\n \n References:\n 1) A. Rossi, Journal of Nuclear Physics\n 2) A.
