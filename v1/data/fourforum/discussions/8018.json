   "Here, let me lay it down for you.\n \n Let's say that you were living 2000 years ago and nothing made sense. Things like the world were flat, and we were living at the center of the universe.\n \n Is it small wonder too ANYONE that people grasp at any belief that gave them hope and purpose?\n \n People were stricken with poverty and death and disease and were told they had a way out if they took on the word of GOD.... (heaven).\n Now I myself would fricken love this idea and be all over it IF i lived back then. However I know better, I am smart, I can think for myself.\n \n I believe that RELIGION is a product of evolution, back then it brought us together, set down rules like no sex before marriage in order to preserve our species from chaos. It promoted us as made in god's image too give hope in a time of pure naivety.\n \n When one thinks about what evolution really means (evolving to deal with new situations). Then believing in something in order to preserve our early sanity in the face of pure misunderstanding and lack of knowledge makes perfect sense.\n \n However, while I actually do think that religion was VERY necessary back then in order for humans to survive.\n I do not believe that religion holds the same sort of meaning in this day of age when we have much less poverty and understand so much more about the world than we did.\n \n What i think is very un-neccessary is the fact that religion has caused so much death and destruction in the name of god. I don't have to be religious to know killing is wrong, i'm smart. But tell that to the knights in the crusades or blasphemers who were burned at the stake.\n \n That is not understanding as preached by most religious of any faith.\n \n Think about it like this, if I was raised at birth to believe that god was created in 6 days then I probably would believe so.\n However what if the same cristian child was instead raised by a muslim at birth.. Would he still turn into a christian? I believe that same child would instead become a devote muslim. Which is right? neither or both, who cares.\n Does it make the child evil? NO\n Does it make him less than human? NO\n Does this mean that allah is less superior than christ? most certainly not, they both have their time and place for different cultures.\n \n Does a book that has been written 2000 years ago make it any more believable? Considering the time it was written... most certainly not.\n \n My point is that if there is a god, he most certainly doesnt care what religion you are at all, in fact he probably doesnt care that your even human.\n \n Just because we can speak and have emotions doesnt make us better than the animals and plants that make up our world. We are just farther along than them and more evolved. (Besides I think animals have emotions).\n We live in simbiosis with the whole planet and I believe that if there was a creator, thinking it created us in his image is just far too short sighted.\n \n Whether you creationists want to admit itemoticon_xgood or not, evolution did happen. There is not even a shred of doubt in my mind. Unfortunately it's scary and new and has unfortunate side effects because it means we might be alone. HOWEVER we are alot smarter than we were 2000 years ago. Grow up and smell the scientific era. THIS IS NOT THE BRONZE AGE ANYMORE, we don't burn witches, and we certainly should not completely ignore scientific facts which ANY of you can actually PROVE FOR YOURSELF IN A LAB. you just don't want to try.\n \n Sorry to burst your bubble creationists, but Religion is part of lifes grand scheme to make sense in a time when people were both naive and hopeless.\n \n Feel free to blast me, i got PLENTY more where this came from.",

   "However I know better, I am smart, I can think for myself.\n\n Wow, good for you. Too bad everyone here isn't as good and smart as you emoticon_rolleyes \n \nI do not believe that religion holds the same sort of meaning in this day of age when we have much less poverty and understand so much more about the world than we did.\n\n These are relative terms. There are still 1 billion people in this world living on less than a dollar a day. And that's just the beginning.\n So when did the threshold occur of number of people living in poverty becoming low enough to make us not need religion anymore? Same question when it comes to our understanding. There is still so much that we don't know, so when did that theshold happen?\n \nWhat i think is very un-neccessary is the fact that religion has caused so much death and destruction in the name of god. I don't have to be religious to know killing is wrong, i'm smart. But tell that to the knights in the crusades or blasphemers who were burned at the stake.\n\n It's not like this hasn't and isn't being discussed in 600 other threads here, but you know as well as I do that people will and have been killing other people regardless of religion. Religion may be a stated excuse in a situation and so may be many other things, but it's all about power.\n \nThink about it like this, if I was raised at birth to believe that god was created in 6 days then I probably would believe so.\n However what if the same cristian child was instead raised by a muslim at birth.. Would he still turn into a christian? I believe that same child would instead become a devote muslim. Which is right? neither or both, who cares.\n Does it make the child evil? NO\n Does it make him less than human? NO\n Does this mean that allah is less superior than christ? most certainly not, they both have their time and place for different cultures.\n\n This is an absurd question. The child wouldn't have been Christian at birth. We all know that. What's your point?\n \nMy point is that if there is a god, he most certainly doesnt care what religion you are at all, in fact he probably doesnt care that your even human.\n\n Doesn't care that you're human? Again, what's your point here?\n \nJust because we can speak and have emotions doesnt make us better than the animals and plants that make up our world. We are just farther along than them and more evolved. (Besides I think animals have emotions).\n\n I hate when people make such ignorant statements like this. We are not \"farther along,\" we are not \"more evolved.\" We just evolved to suit our environment. Evolution does not have some grand end point.\n \nWe live in simbiosis with the whole planet and I believe that if there was a creator, thinking it created us in his image is just far too short sighted.\n\n What does \"created in God's image\" mean to you?\n \nWhether you creationists want to admit itemoticon_xgood or not, evolution did happen. There is not even a shred of doubt in my mind. Unfortunately it's scary and new and has unfortunate side effects because it means we might be alone. HOWEVER we are alot smarter than we were 2000 years ago. Grow up and smell the scientific era. THIS IS NOT THE BRONZE AGE ANYMORE, we don't burn witches, and we certainly should not completely ignore scientific facts which ANY of you can actually PROVE FOR YOURSELF IN A LAB. you just don't want to try.\n\n I hate this kind of XXXX too. Evolution and belief are not oppositional. Both athiests and YECs are bent on saying it is. You guys have more in common than you'd like to think in other ways too, but that's for another thread that I was actually planning on starting soon, so let's leave that part out of the discussion here.",

This is the fabric that keeps society from turning on itself. It is not perfect, but I think it does a better job than religion.\n \n In the past, religion filled this role. Man and Women were married in the eyes of religion. They had to follow religious rules about how they conducted their lives. This included rules preventing theft, the spread of disease, keeping families together by limiting adultery, limiting when young people were accepted as adults (to avoid creating children in disadvantaged situations), preventing unnecessary killing, and forcing respect for authority.\n \n Since people lacked proper reasoning, religion had the brilliant property of begin able to exist completely outside people ability to criticize it. God knows your mind... he is everywhere... he knows all... you can't hide your \"sins\" (or break from the rules).\n \n Most of us today can operate by following the rule of Law... because we can see outside our tiny sphere's of influence, and how Rules keep us from harming each other.\n \n Religion is a relic, from a time when a more brute force approach was necessary. I do not hold any contempt for how far religion has brought us, but I do think that it is time to let it go. It was a useful tool, but it had become outdated.\n \n However, by virtue of religions greatest srength (operating outside reason) I don't think it will die quickly... people will hold onto it for as long as they can.",

However, I have spent some time studying religion, and your analysis is problematic.

I don't have to be religious to know killing is wrong, i'm smart. But tell that to the knights in the crusades or blasphemers who were burned at the stake.\n \n That is not understanding as preached by most religious of any faith.\nWell, exactly. The point is that where culture has moved on, so has religion: the Catholic Church is notable now for not burning people. You could similarly argue against government, on the grounds that governments used to take part in Crusades, execute people for the smallest offense etc.\n \n \nThink about it like this, if I was raised at birth to believe that god was created in 6 days then I probably would believe so.\n However what if the same cristian child was instead raised by a muslim at birth..

NO\n Does it make him less than human? NO\n Does this mean that allah is less superior than christ? most certainly not, they both have their time and place for different cultures.\nYou are arguing here against denominations, not belief in God. I would point out that the same child could be raised as an atheist: do you agree that this would also be no more good, human, and no more superior an idea? (I also think you mean God created the world: I know of no sect that says God was created ;))\n \n \nDoes a book that has been written 2000 years ago make it any more believable? Considering the time it was written... most certainly not.\nA little less than 2000, but I broadly agree with this. However, religions often have arguments that convince their believers for the validity of the holy text, and for the validity of their beliefs.\n \n \nMy point is that if there is a god, he most certainly doesnt care what religion you are at all, in fact he probably doesnt care that your even human.\n \n Just because we can speak and have emotions doesnt make us better than the animals and plants that make up our world. We are just farther along than them and more evolved. (Besides I think animals have emotions).\n We live in simbiosis with the whole planet and I believe that if there was a creator, thinking it created us in his image is just far too short sighted.\nMost sophisticated thinkers in Christianity will believe that everything is in the image of God, but to a lesser extent than us. God is not meant to be like us simplistically, but we are supposed to reflect God's nature.\n \n BTW, the idea of 'more evolved' is a case of mistaking evolution for a Hegelian-type system: we may think some things are more advanced, but that is from our viewpoint, not a question of evolution.\n \n \nWhether you creationists want to admit itemoticon_xgood or not, evolution did happen. There is not even a shred of doubt in my mind. Unfortunately it's scary and new and has unfortunate side effects because it means we might be alone. HOWEVER we are alot smarter than we were 2000 years ago. Grow up and smell the scientific era. THIS IS NOT THE BRONZE AGE ANYMORE, we don't burn witches, and we certainly should not completely ignore scientific facts which ANY of you can actually PROVE FOR YOURSELF IN A LAB. you just don't want to try.\nOK, well having no doubt is always dangerous. And I know of no evidence we're smarter than 2000 years ago, although we have accumulated more culture and knowledge. However, evolution does not disprove God.\n \n \nSorry to burst your bubble creationists, but Religion is part of lifes grand scheme to make sense in a time when people were both naive and hopeless.\n \n Feel free to blast me, i got PLENTY more where this came from.\nOK, now you sound like you do think that evolution is a case of classic biological evolution...\n \n I would repeat that you're oversimplifying: try reading a book called 'Seven Theories of Religion': all seven theories are essentially secular, but range from the psychological to the sociological to the ritual etc.\n \n You will notice that supergrunt has already brought up another popular prima facie explanation. They tend to be:\n \n 1) to explain the mysterious\n 2) to feel better\n 3) for the sake of public morality\n 4) so the priests can control people and get power\n \n There are far more subtle secular explanations in Jung, Frazer etc.",

   "Richard Dawkins isn't far off having a stab at destroying religion.....\n\n \n \n Richard Dawkins posited his theory of memes suggesting that cultural information is passed from one mind to another via a replicator. Using the biological metaphor of genes, Dawkins says that memes (beliefs, practices, morals, tastes, etc) propigate in society like genes. They are often bundled into packages with other ideas (memeplexes) and passed on through language and demonstration.\n \n The theory is attractive because of its creative speculation and because Dawkins offers his own meme in a way that is accessible to the general populace. Dawkins idea is epistemically encompassing. Memes include all information used to form philosophical ideas (like metaphysics, epistemology, empericism, ethics, etc.) as well as cultural ideas (esthetics, language, sociology, etc.) as well as any other idea that the mind can generate.\n \n To read the title of this strand (\"Religion is a product of evolution\") through Dawkins' spectacles one would acknowledge that the title represents a meme which resides in a memeplex of associated information. We could call the title (\"Religion is a product of evolution\") a memeplex, but for simplicities sake I will refer to it here as a meme. For each person the memeplex within which this meme is located will be unique. However, we might postulate that other people identifying with this meme may have certain general similarities between memeplexes (ie: nature is fascinating, faith is subjective, the world is accessible through reason and perception, etc.). \n \n What is genuinely curious is that people who share this same meme (\"Religion is a product of evolution\") might also have opposing memes within their memeplex. For example, the woman who thinks, \"Religion is a product of evolution\" might also possess the meme, \"The natural world that we percieve is the sum and substance of reality.\" While another woman who thinks \"Religion is a product of evolution\" might also possess the meme, \"The natural world that we percieve is only a part of reality.\" One memeplex would deny religious revelation and the other would be open to religious revelation. Both contain the meme \"Religion is a product of evolution,\" and might therefore identify themselves with the basics of Dawkins meme theory. I might add that the later woman would identify with Dawkins without disassociating herself from the plausibility of religious revelation.\n \n Maybe Dawkins thesis has less potential to destroy religion memes than your statement suggests.",

It's difficult (I'd even say impossible) to know if we would be as advanced as we are, for instance, without wars to fight. War provides the reason to invent things that after their military use can help the everyday citizen. Likewise, I think it's impossible to know if we would have such a fine-tuned way of scientific thinking without the framework, conflict, and motivation set by religious thinking.",

Is he a philosopher?\n\n \n In the Greek sense of the word (one who loves truth philio sopher (sp?)), yes he was. He was a palaeontologist who wrote hundreds of essays (later released as compendiums), and held the Aggaziz chair at Harvard. You may have heard the name in connection with punctuated equilibrium theory. Well worth a read. I recommend Bully for Brontosaurus (Penguin Science, 1992, ISBN 0-14-015985-1)\n \n \nMight I turn this strand title on its heals and posit the assertion, \"Evolution is the product of religion?\" Any takers?\n\n \n I doubt this, for it seems likely that evolutionary theory would have been arrived at whether religion had existed or not. As theories seek to describe the world around us in natural testible terms, it seems likely that evolutionary theory would have appeared at some point (though wether it was called evolutionary theory is a matter of conjecture). Science itself has far more basis in the Stoic and Logical forms of thought devised by the Greeks in 250BC and is therefore not really tied to religion (particularly the Christian version). However it is impossible to predict the course of history removing something small (such as a battle or some notable single action), let alone altering something on the scale of the Catholic church",

Did you know that many people who have tried to prove that have actually converted to Christianity in the process? There is actually more scientific evidence to prove religion than there is to deny it. If you think that every Christian alive today, or Jew, or Muslim for that matter, has only inherited their belief, you are wrong. The scientists who wanted to prove religion wrong sure didn't just look for a way to explain everything and turn to a Supreme Being. They must have had to overcome multitudes of pride to accept it. If it was worth that to them, they must have sincerely believed it.\n\n \n I dont blame you. Humans by nature are religious animals. If you believe in religion, you cant think outside the box.

   "\n \n I hate when people make such ignorant statements like this. We are not \"farther along,\" we are not \"more evolved.\" We just evolved to suit our environment. Evolution does not have some grand end point.\n \n \n\n \n For the most part, this can be generally applied to anyone making this statement. The statement is usually ignorant, so you can hate when it happens. However, a grand end point can be defined by the person making such a statement.\n For instance, if I stated that the end point of evolution is when an organism/species actively or consciously controls its evolution, and eventually stops evolving because it comprehensively controls its environment, I can then determine a criteria which will measure \"how far along\" an organism is by how close it is to this grand end point.\n Right now, humans are getting closer to actively controlling their DNA. Decades from now, it may be commonplace. Centuries from now, people may assimilate with technology in a way that can't be described as human. With virtually unlimited intelligence, this organism can control the universal environment in a way we can't comprehend. Since the grand end point was defined, I can say this organism is father along than say, E Coli.\n But, like I said before, people aren't usually taking this perspective when they make statements about being \"more evolved\" than something else. So it's usually okay to hate when it happens.",
