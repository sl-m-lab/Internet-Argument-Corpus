   "If you want to know why some of our \"allies\" were against the Iraq war...this may answer some of those questions. get ready to get angry\n \n \n THE FRENCH WAR FOR OIL \n \n By KENNETH R. TIMMERMAN \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Email Archives \n Print Reprint \n \n \n \n March 16, 2004 -- MANY Americans are convinced even today that the war in Iraq was all about oil. And they're right - but oil was the key for French President Jacques Chirac, not for the United States. \n In documents I obtained during an investigation of the French relationship to Saddam Hussein, the French interest in maintaining Saddam Hussein in power was spelled out in excruciating detail. The price tag: close to $100 billion. That was what French oil companies stood to profit in the first seven years of their exclusive oil arrangements - had Saddam remained in power. \n \n The French claimed their opposition to the U.S.-led war to oust Saddam Hussein was all about policy. The editor of the Paris daily Le Monde, Jean-Marie Colombani, just resuscitated those arguments in an editorial that singled out George W. Bush as \"a threat to the very foundation of the historical alliance between the U.S. and Europe,\" and called fervently for the election of John F. Kerry. (I guess that F now stands for France.) \n \n But Colombani, whose paper's coverage of the war in Iraq was noteworthy for its wanton disregard for the truth, had not a word to say about his country's war for oil. Indeed, the secret deals the French state-owned oil companies negotiated in the 1990s with Saddam Hussein went widely unreported in France. \n \n Almost as soon as the guns went silent after the first Gulf war in 1991, French oil giants Total SA and Elf Aquitaine - who have now merged and expanded to become TotalFinaElf - sought a competitive advantage over their rivals in Iraq by negotiating exclusive production-sharing contracts with Saddam's regime that were intended to give them a stranglehold on Iraq's future oil production for decades to come. \n \n The first of two massive deals was announced in June 1994 by then-Iraqi Oil Minister Safa al-Habobi - a well-known figure whose name had surfaced in numerous procurement schemes in the 1980s in association with the Ministry of Industry and Military Industrialization, which supervised Saddam's chemical, biological, missile and nuclear-weapons programs. \n \n Speaking in Vienna, al-Habobi confirmed that his government was awarding Total SA rights to the future production of the Nahr Umar oil field in southern Iraq, and that Elf was well-placed to be awarded similar terms in the Majnoon oil fields on the border with Iran. \n \n \n \n Those two deals, which I detail in \"The French Betrayal of America,\" would have been worth an estimated $100 billion over a seven-year period - but were conditioned on the lifting of U.N. sanctions on Iraq. Simply put, analyst Gerald Hillman told me, the French were saying: \"We will help you get the sanctions lifted, and when we do that, you give us this.\" \n \n The Total contract, a copy of which I obtained, was \"very one-sided,\" says Hillman. (Hillman, a political economist and a managing partner at Trireme Investments in New York, did a detailed analysis of the contract.) An ordinary production agreement typically grants the foreign partner a maximum of 50 percent of the gross proceeds of the oil produced at the field they develop. But this deal gave Total 75 percent of the total production. \"This is highly unusual,\" he said. Indeed, it was extortion. \n \n But Saddam willingly agreed: He saw the Total deal, and a similar one with Elf, as the price he had to pay to secure French political support at the United Nations. \n \n Much has been written in recent weeks about the corruption of the U.N. Oil-for-Food program. Documents uncovered in Iraq's oil ministry and published by the Baghdad daily al Mada list several cronies of French President Chirac among those who had received special oil allocations as a political payoff from Saddam. \n \n But the amounts attributed to these individuals - in the tens of millions of barrels, on which they stood to earn between 25 to 40 cents per barrel - pale in comparison to the $100 billion payoff orchestrated by Chirac and Saddam. \n \n No, oil wasn't the only reason France opposed the United States at the United Nations in the lead-up to the war. The megalomania of Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin (who lied to Secretary of State Colin Powell repeatedly and later boasted about it to visiting U.S. congressional delegations) certainly entered into the mix. So did French pride, wounded at the realization that France is no longer the great power it once was. \n \n But the French did not merely disagree with the United States over Iraq, as did a certain number of our allies: They actively sought to rally world leaders and public opinion to treat the United States - not Saddam Hussein - as the enemy. \n \n The enormous difference between those two positions - legitimate dissent and active subversion of America's right to self-defense - is why America is right to treat France as a former ally. Under Chirac's stewardship, France has shown the world that it cared more about propping up a murderous dictator than it valued its 225-year alliance with America.",

   "this is what i found on that company....not really on topic.\n \n \n Hollinger investments are linked to Board's Perle and Kissinger\n \n 03-12-2003\n \n By ROBERT FRANK and ELENA CHERNEY \n \n WALL STREET JOURNAL: \n \n Hollinger International Inc. invested in a venture-capital fund and a conservative magazine linked to outside directors Richard N. Perle and Henry A. Kissinger, raising new questions about the board's independence in the wake of a widening financial scandal. \n \n According to company filings and people familiar with the situation, Hollinger invested $2.5 million in a venture-capital firm that was co-managed by Mr. Perle and listed Mr. Kissinger as a board member. \n \n Hollinger, a Chicago-based media company that owns the U.K.'s Telegraph Group, the Chicago Sun-Times and the Jerusalem Post, also invested $14 million in a British technology company that includes Mr. Perle and his business partner as shareholders. In addition, Hollinger gave $200,000 a year to the National Interest, a conservative publication that includes Mr. Perle, Mr. Kissinger and Hollinger's former chief executive, Conrad Black, as advisers. \n \n There isn't any indication that any of the directors, including Messrs. Perle and Kissinger, did anything illegal. And neither Mr. Perle nor Mr. Kissinger served on Hollinger's audit or compensation committees. But the payments highlight the subtle financial relationships between companies and otherwise independent directors. And the payments take on a starker light in the wake of investor accusations that the board stood by while Hollinger made large payments to Lord Black, who resigned as CEO last month, despite the company's flagging share price. \n \n \n Mr. Perle didn't return calls or e-mail messages seeking comment. Mr. Kissinger's office didn't return repeated calls for comment. Through a spokesman, Lord Black declined to comment. \n \n Gordon Paris, the company's interim CEO and chairman of a special board committee looking into the dealings, said through a spokeswoman: \"A primary focus of the special committee's investigation is related-party transactions.\" He added: \"We will be reviewing the appropriateness of such transactions as well as processes undertaken by the board in reviewing and approving them.\" \n \n As part of the special-committee inquiry, Hollinger has hired outside attorneys to conduct a wide-ranging examination of the company's finances. The investigation uncovered $32.15 million in unauthorized payments to Lord Black and other executives. The Securities and Exchange Commission also is investigating. Lord Black, a high-profile press baron known for his plush lifestyle and conservative politics, has agreed to pay back $7.2 million. \n \n According to the special committee investigators, the independent directors of the board didn't authorize $15.6 million paid by Hollinger to Lord Black and other executives and didn't authorize a separate $16.6 million payment to the Toronto holding company, Hollinger Inc. \n \n Yet investigators are looking at a number of transactions that posed potential conflicts for the company's board members, who were expected to be the company's watchdogs. While the board says it didn't approve the $15.6 million payment, the fee was disclosed in a March 2002 SEC filing that said the payment had been approved by the board. The board didn't dispute that until investigators started looking into the payments. \n \n What's more, investigators are looking into the role played by independent board members in approving $53 million in noncompete payments to Lord Black and others related to the sale of Hollinger's Canadian papers in 2000. Shareholders say the financial dealings between the board members and Hollinger raise questions about their independence. \n \n \n \"This board has ties that were never disclosed,\" said Laura Jereski, an analyst with Tweedy Browne Co., a minority shareholder that spurred the special committee investigation. Tweedy Browne might have taken a different tack in its campaign for reform at the company had it known the extent of Mr. Kissinger's ties to the company. Said Ms. Jereski: \"If we had known this, we would have said a preponderance of the board was not independent.\" \n \n At the center of the business dealings are Messrs. Perle and Kissinger, both prominent conservative strategists in Washington. Mr. Perle, a former assistant defense secretary, serves on the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board, but resigned as the group's chairman in March after a controversy surrounding his consulting work for Global Crossing Ltd. Mr. Kissinger, who served as secretary of state under President Nixon, chose to resign last year from the commission investigating the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks rather than disclose his list of consulting clients. \n \n According to company SEC filings, Hollinger made an investment of $2.5 million in Trireme Associates LLC. The company is the general partner of Trireme Partners LP, a venture-capital fund co-managed by Mr. Perle and Gerald P. Hillman, who also served on the Defense Policy Board. Mr. Hillman says Trireme invests mainly in electronic-security and encryption technology. Mr. Perle holds a 5% stake in Trireme LLC and Lord Black is a member of Trireme's strategic advisory board. Mr. Kissinger served on the advisory board until this year, when he resigned because he reached the firm's mandatory retirement age, according to Mr. Hillman. \n \n Mr. Black, through a spokesman, says the investment was appropriate and fully disclosed. In the past, Mr. Kissinger has said he has no financial interest in Trireme and has never received any payment from it. He has also stressed that the Trireme board had never met. \n \n Hollinger's internal investigators are also looking at an investment by Hollinger's digital unit in a company that included Mr. Perle as a shareholder. According to people familiar with the matter, Hollinger Digital invested $14 million in a U.K. based technology firm called Cambridge Display Technology. Mr. Perle was a co-chairman of Hollinger Digital and was paid a salary by the company to help find investments. \n \n The investment was part of a syndicate led by Kelso Co. and Hillman Capital that acquired control of Cambridge for about $130 million. Mr. Hillman confirmed that Mr. Perle also bought a stake in Cambridge Technology. \n \n \n Hollinger took a $48 million write-down in 2001 and a $40.5 million write-down the following year, according to filings. A portion of the write-downs was related to investments in the technology sector, according to a person familiar with the matter. The 2002 write-down included $6 million on the Cambridge Display investment, which Lord Black told shareholders at the May meeting was \"a straight case of the accounting profession overreacting. ... We didn't judge it appropriate to fight these [write-down] issues with them.\" \n \n Lord Black assured shareholders that Mr. Perle believed \"this was a quite unjustified write-down on the venture-capital side of an asset that, in fact, we are very confident we're going to have a very sizable gain on.\" Mr. Perle's salary as Hollinger Digital chairman wasn't disclosed. \n \n Mr. Hillman said the investments weren't a conflict and were part of Lord Black's strategic effort to bring Hollinger into the digital age. He said Lord Black has strong interest in security and digital displays because they both related to the future of newspapers and advertising. The Cambridge investment, he said, \"gave him a window into everything that's changing in ubiquitous displays.\" \n \n Along with the financial investments, Hollinger also made contributions to political causes linked to directors. Hollinger contributed $200,000 annually for an undisclosed number of years to National Interest, a foreign affairs quarterly that's produced jointly by Hollinger and the Nixon Center, a think tank that's a division of the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace Foundation. The Nixon Center lists Mr. Kissinger as its honorary chairman and Lord Black as a board member. Lord Black and Mr. Kissinger are co-chairmen of the editorial board of the National Interest, which is described on its masthead as a \"nonprofit partnership between Hollinger International Inc. and the Nixon Center.\" Hollinger has never disclosed its role in publishing the National Interest or its annual funding of the periodical. \n \n In addition to supporting the National Interest, Hollinger also gave up to $375,000 a year to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank of which Lord Black is a member. Hollinger also sponsored a library at Arundel House, where the Institute's offices are housed, called the Hollinger-Telegraph Library. \n \n Hollinger is no longer donating annually to the institute. The company is reviewing its support for the National Interest as part of a review of all corporate costs to \"ensure that all expenditures have an appropriate and valid business purpose,\" Mr. Paris said through a spokeswoman. \n \n http://online.wsj.com/article_email/0,,SB107040693288079500-H9jeoNllal2oZumZ4GGcKiCm4,00.html",

   "Chirac's Saddam Connection\n By Thomas W. Murphy\n \n French President Jacques Chirac's special relationship with Saddam Hussein goes back almost 30 years. As the French Prime Minister in 1974, Chirac was instrumental in boosting France's diplomatic and economic ties with oil-rich Iraq. Chirac called Saddam Hussein \"a personal friend\" after Chirac and Hussein finalized the agreement for the construction of a French-built nuclear reactor near Baghdad; the reactor that was later bombed by Israel.\n \n Chirac's long-standing relationship with Saddam Hussein and France's vast financial interests with the current Iraqi Government goes a long way in explaining France's seemingly inexplicable passion to keep Saddam Hussein in power.\n \n France has historically been Iraq's best friend in the West. The French-Iraqi connection started shortly after France pulled out of NATO in 1966.\n \n Prior to the Arab-Israeli war of 1967, France was the chief supplier of military equipment to Israel. In fact, France helped Israel build its nuclear reactor at Dimona, supplied Israel with enriched uranium, and actively helped Israel develop nuclear weapons.\n \n In the days leading up to the Arab-Israeli War, France abandoned Israel and threw its hat in with the Arabs nations. De Gaulle doubted the Israeli's could defeat the combined Arab nations and saw the coming war as an opportunity to extend French influence and cultivate relationships with the oil-rich Arab nations.\n \n By the end of the 1970s France was second only to the Soviet Union as a supplier of both military and civilian equipment to the Iraqis. The trend continued throughout the 1980s. France strongly backed Iraq during its war with Iran. Unlike other western governments who gave minimal help to Iraq hoping to stave off an Iraqi defeat and maintain the status quo; France supplied Iraq with Mirage Fighters, Super Etendard aircraft with Exocet missiles, and sophisticated munitions.\n \n The Gulf War of 1991 provided little more than a hiccup in French-Iraqi relations. By 1994, France was calling for a loosening of UN sanctions and along with Russia attempting to short-circuit UNSCOM at every step. France pushed to allow Iraq to sell more oil. When the U.S. and Britain demanded tough controls to ensure the increased oil revenues would not be used to buy arms, the French objected saying such controls would undermine Iraqi sovereignty. From 1997 on, France fought to get the UN sanctions lifted entirely.\n \n Last year, under intense pressure from France and Russia, the UN loosened restrictions on high-tech equipment, enabling Iraq to obtain a broad range of equipment with potential military applications; ranging from agricultural sprayers that can be used to disperse chemical and biological weapons to neutron generators that can be used as crude nuclear triggers and are compatible with a known Iraqi design for a gun-implosion type nuclear device.\n \n Hundreds of French firms do business with Iraq. France sold $1.5 billion worth of goods to Iraq last year under the oil-for-food program; the most of any nation. French giants Alcatel and Renault do a booming business in Iraq, and French oil firms hold contracts with Saddam Hussein's government estimated at over $60 billion for oil exploration and development; oil contracts that cannot be worked until UN sanctions are lifted.\n \n In light of France's financial interests and longstanding ties to Saddam Hussein's Iraq, its hardly surprising that France opposes military action to depose Saddam Hussein. A new Iraqi government might not be inclined to honor oil contracts with Saddam's old buddies.\n \n And then again, as one U.S. intelligence expert somewhat facetiously put it, \"France will jump on board with the U.S. the minute their agents in Baghdad get done shredding all evidence of their illicit arms sales to Iraq.\"",

   "From the Washington Times:\n \n Iraqi govt. papers: Saddam bribed Chirac\n \n \n \n BAGHDAD, Iraq, Jan. 28 (UPI) -- Documents from Saddam Hussein's oil ministry reveal he used oil to bribe top French officials into opposing the imminent U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.\n \n The oil ministry papers, described by the independent Baghdad newspaper al-Mada, are apparently authentic and will become the basis of an official investigation by the new Iraqi Governing Council, the Independent reported Wednesday.\n \n \"I think the list is true,\" Naseer Chaderji, a governing council member, said. \"I will demand an investigation. These people must be prosecuted.\"\n \n Such evidence would undermine the French position before the war when President Jacques Chirac sought to couch his opposition to the invasion on a moral high ground.\n \n A senior Bush administration official said Washington was aware of the reports but refused further comment.\n \n French diplomats have dismissed any suggestion their foreign policy was influenced by payments from Saddam, but some European diplomats have long suspected France's steadfast opposition to the war was less moral than monetary.\n \n \"Oil runs thicker than blood,\" is how one former ambassador put his suspicions about the French motives for opposing action against Saddam.\n \n Al-Mada's list cites a total of 46 individuals, companies and organizations inside and outside Iraq as receiving Saddam's oil bribes, including officials in Egypt, Jordan, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Sudan, China, Austria and France, as well as the Russian Orthodox Church, the Russian Communist Party, India's Congress Party and the Palestine Liberation Organization.",

And while I would give the oil some credit, I would do it from a completly different persepctive than mere resourxe confiscation (that would be stupid from an economic point of view). But rather to increase the supply of oil on the world market to diminish the economic power of the OPEC countries (which would have national security implications as well).
