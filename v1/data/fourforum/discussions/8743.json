   "i just recently got this dvd from my job at umg called Land Of The Blind.it was an amazing political movie about a revolution and terrorism. it depicts it very well and it really makes you think. i havent seen a movie this good in a long time. the star of the film is Ralph Fiennes which made me like it even more because im a big fan of his too. he always chooses really good movies. I definitely recommend it. heres a link to the trailer if you want to check it out- http://boss.streamos.com/wmedia/umvdve/landoftheblind_trailer.wvx",
