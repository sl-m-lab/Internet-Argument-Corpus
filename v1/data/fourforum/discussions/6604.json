They left town because AIPAC told them to.\n Where were their protests against Bush' tax cuts for the rich? They weren't there because those tax cuts also benefitted the Democrats because they're rich too.\n \n Republicans and Democrats alike don't give a rats XXX about the American people, the elite never cares about the little people.\n \n I feel sorry for the American people, because each election they only get to choose between two evils and are being told that this is democracy.",
