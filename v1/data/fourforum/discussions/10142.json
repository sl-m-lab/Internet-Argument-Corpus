   "Did he become \"straight\"? He describes controlling his desire for sex through some variant on meditation.. he doesn't seem to have become attracted to women, just celibate..\n\n \n Healing takes time Symbiote.\n \n Every time I was tempted to lust, I noticed it, caught it, dealt with it. I called it what it was, and then just let it disappear on its own. A huge and vital difference exists between superficial admiration - of yourself, or others - and integral admiration. In loving ourselves fully, we no longer need anything from the \"outside\" world of lustful desire, recognition from others, or physical satisfaction. Our drives become intrinsic to our very essence, unbridled by neurotic distractions.\n \n Homosexuality allows us to avoid digging deeper, through superficiality and lust-inspired attractions - at least, as long as it remains \"accepted\" by law. As a result, countless miss out on their truest self, their God-given Christ-self.\n \n Homosexuality, for me, began at age 13 and ended - once I \"cut myself off\" from outside influences and intensely focused on inner truth - when I discovered the depths of my God-given self at age 30.\n \n God is regarded as an enemy by many in the grip of homosexuality or other lustful behavior, because He reminds them of who and what they truly are meant to be. People caught in the act would rather stay \"blissfully ignorant\" by silencing truth and those who speak it, through antagonism, condemnation and calling them words like \"racist,\" \"insensitive,\" \"evil\" and \"discriminatory.\"\n \n Healing from the wounds caused by homosexuality is not easy - there's little obvious support. What support remains is shamed, ridiculed, silenced by rhetoric or made illegal by twisting of laws. I had to sift through my own embarrassment and the disapproving \"voices\" of all I'd ever known to find it. Part of the homosexual agenda is getting people to stop considering that conversion is even a viable question to be asked, let alone whether or not it works.\n \n In my experience, \"coming out\" from under the influence of the homosexual mindset was the most liberating, beautiful and astonishing thing I've ever experienced in my entire life.\n \n Lust takes us out of our bodies, \"attaching\" our psyche onto someone else's physical form. That's why homosexual sex - and all other lust-based sex - is never satisfactory: It's a neurotic process rather than a natural, normal one. Normal is normal - and has been called normal for a reason.\n \n Abnormal means \"that which hurts us, hurts normal.\" Homosexuality takes us out of our normal state, of being perfectly united in all things, and divides us, causing us to forever pine for an outside physical object that we can never possess. Homosexual people - like all people - yearn for the mythical true love, which does actually exist. The problem with homosexuality is that true love only comes when we have nothing preventing us from letting it shine forth from within. We cannot fully be ourselves when our minds are trapped in a cycle and group-mentality of sanctioned, protected and celebrated lust.",

   "Here is a well written response to Michael Glatze. \n \n http://www.teambio.org/2007/07/an-open-letter-to-michael-glatze/\n \n Today, Michael Glatze, a well known figure in the gay world and a former proponent of gay rights, wrote of his rejection of homosexuality in an essay posted at World Net Daily. I think Michael should be whoever he want's to be...but his choice to do so by attaching negative judgments to the lifestyle of other well-adjusted gays warrants a response.\n \n Dear Michael,\n \n I read your posting at World Net Daily and I wanted to share some of my own thoughts on your thoughts and the larger subjects of sexuality, religion, and authenticity .\n \n First, let me say that your words express an inner anguish that seems to have been your companion for many years. I have great sympathy for your heartache. Your attempt to resolve that anguish is noble, however your efforts to extrapolate your own journey as a tonic for all that ails others within the gay community is sadly misguided.\n \n I don't know you so I hesitate to offer my observations without one important caveat. Your life has been lived by and large in the public sphere...first when you embraced homosexuality through YGA and your many other activities...a nd now as you embrace an alternate reality that you have chosen to share through World Net Daily. Therefore, I make the assumption that both then and now, it has been your choice to submit yourself to the scrutiny of others. If I'm wrong, my apologies.\n \n You note that YGA \"was meant to fill a void\" for young gay Americans...so mething not so \"pornographic\". Is it possible that YGA was meant to first and foremost fill your own void and to combat your own issues with pornography? Let me elaborate. You see pornography is not the unique domain of homosexuals... it is available to virtually all sexual persuasions and curiosities... and one has the free will to partake or to pass.\n \n I've read gay newspapers and periodicals for many years and I've always known I had the discretion to read and view those articles, advertisements, and photographs of my choosing. When you speak of homosexuality as being \"by its very nature pornographic \" isn't it plausible that what you are actually explaining is how you elected to define your own affiliation with homosexuality? Keep in mind that one can affiliate with heterosexuality in the very same manner...maybe you have yet to discover that prerogative.\n \n You also state that \"homosexuality is not exactly 'virtuous'\". Clearly, virtue is not innate to any sexual preference...j ust as it isn't innate to Italians, Caucasians, tall people, people near the equator, or people who drive yellow cars. Virtue is a chosen state of being that is available to all humans. Your proximity to virtue during your homosexuality was a function of your actions as a human being with free will...not something one can definitively obtain or be denied as a result of some affiliation. If you lacked virtue, YOU lacked virtue...being gay need not separate one from virtue.\n \n You indicate that \"homosexuality prevents US from finding our true self within. We cannot see the truth when we're blinded by homosexuality.\" The quest to find ones self should never be sought through affiliations . The fact that you couldn't find communion with your self while you identified as a homosexual is not an indictment of homosexuality...it is an indication of your own internal conflicts...conflicts you played out in the public arena then and conflicts you now purport to have resolved in an alternate reality...once again seeking to air your process on the public stage. Unfortunately, your process now is not necessarily any more authentic than your process then.\n \n What remains consistent is your need for others to affirm who and what you are whenever and wherever you tell us what you are. Don't take this wrong, but I recall a time when I would fret about eating in a restaurant by myself...all I could think about was what others may be thinking it said about me. In a conversation with a wise friend, I mentioned my hesitation and she offered this observation, \"Daniel, what makes you think you're that important or that relevant in the minds of other diners? Why you are there eating alone is only meaningful to you.\"\n \n You see it was my perception that was flawed, not my situation. I was living outside of myself and relying on outside feedback to affirm myself...an exercise in futility. May I suggest you remain in the same predicament though you've altered your scenery? You proceed to state that you became aware of your homosexuality when you \"noticed that I looked at other guys\" and that you resolved your desires by paying attention to yourself. You continue by stating, \"Every time I was tempted to lust, I noticed it.\" Your words are clues to your own flawed perception. How you see other men...lustfully...is of your making...it is the perception you brought to your experience with homosexuality. The men you lusted after were not the issue...it was what you carried within.\n \n Unfortunately, you attempt to apply your reality to all other homosexuals... once again illuminating your need for external affirmation... and in your current circumstance s you need to vilify that which you no longer want to inhabit your psyche. Sadly, electing to announce your heterosexual affiliation is not the equivalent of extinguishing your flawed perceptions nor does it mean you will approach your heterosexuality any differently than you did your homosexuality. The healing of the heart is not an external event that is subject too, or a function of, ones proximity to any particular societal construct...in this instance heterosexuality.\n \n You then pivot towards religion and your search for, and discovery of, your \"God-given self\". Lacking in that observation is the realization that others may already be in harmony with their god-given selves. You see, may I regrettably suggest that you suffer the belief held by so many who identify as born again...you presume that everyone else must have lost sight of their god-given identities and is therefore in need of rebirth. May I posit that this is once again demonstrativ e of your need for external validation of your processes, your identity, and all that you experience? In other words, you are still a victim of your inability to embrace an identity of your own volition absent reinforcing feedback.\n \n Your words provide further insight into your struggle. You state, \"Lust takes us out of our bodies, \"attaching \" our psyche onto someone else's physical form\". More telling words may have never been uttered. What you describe is your own persistent psychic wound that manifests itself in the objectificat ion of others in order to fill an internal void...one you must believe to be insatiable and outside your capacity to repair. You see, your demons are just that...your demons. While you may find comfort in believing that every other homosexual has the same demons...that belief is merely a defense mechanism your ego employs to assuage the pain.\n \n I would also speculate that the mindset you held put you in contact with people suffering similar struggles... thereby allowing you to reach your misguided conclusion that all homosexuals were like you. As difficult as this may be to hear, the friends I have would have little difficulty identifying you and your particular perceptions and the flawed judgments that they foster. That reality likely limited your exposure...b ut it certainly did not serve as a legitimate basis for your current hypothesis. You see, all that you have identified in your diatribe against homosexuality is that portion of your identity that you subconscious ly find detestable. I'm sorry for your dilemma but I reject your conclusion.\n \n Near the end of your essay, you state that \"homosexuality took almost 16 years of my life and compromised them with one lie or another\". Shame on you. That statement is an affront to everything else you ask us to embrace. At what point will you take personal responsibility for your own behavior? The pursuit of truth is not a construct you get to strap on when it serves you and pine for when you lack the wherewithal to seek it.\n \n What you need to strive for is authenticity . Your persona as a cheerleader in the latest and greatest uniform of your liking is simply the measure of your inauthentic self. Your predicament is sad and I feel for you...but your carelessness and your cavalier capacity to tear down whatever no longer serves your fragile identity is indefensible and unacceptable .\n \n The fact that you now wrap yourself in the glorious guise of god may once again serve your masked and manipulative inner master but it puts you no closer to truth. You contend that god wins in the end because you have chosen to co-opt god to augment your own disenfranchi sement from self-truth. While you have hitched your wagon to this particular iteration of truth, it doesn't mean you have found truth. You have simply found a new mechanism of certainty that can be substituted for the ever elusive identity that in the end has ironically come to define who you are and who you aren't.\n \n Michael, I hope you're able to find peace...but I have to implore you to do so without attacking those who have journeyed much further along the path.\n \n Regards,\n \n Daniel",

But there is no homosexual \"desire\" that is apart from lust.\n\n \n One could believe this under the influence of heterosexuality as well. Geeze, ever heard of bikini calendars and pinups? Naturally there is homosexual desire that is apart from lust. Not every gay couple is young and good looking.\n \n \nIn denial of this fact, I'd fought to erase such truth at all costs, and participated in the various popular ways of taking responsibility out of human hands for challenging the temptations of lust and other behaviors.

I practice it, and neither myself nor anyone I know is damaged by it.\n \n \nWe have already discussed the negative self image issues within the community and I tried to point out it was a result of concsousness of guilt on the part of the practitioners but you all responded that NO, it's the persecution from Society that is the cause of your self image problems.\n \n So it is our fault, your saying, for your guilt over your unnatural lifestyle. That is one of the major delusions within the gay community.\n\n \n People would not feel guilt if they were not taught that. Not everyone does feel guilt. Those who do, feel it because they are not conforming to the expectations of family, religion or some segments of society, as faulty as those expectations are oftentimes. Many overcome guilt.\n \n \nHe is protesting the self deception necessary for one to continue to participate in this self destructive lifestyle and is attempting to show that the ONLY way to overcome homosexuality is through the healing power of Jesus Christ as He can overcome all sin and the bondage that comes with it. He also proves that deliverance doesn't come from any human built organization but from God Himself through whom all blessings flow. \n \n If any testimony should speak to you it is this one that shows that this all happened within him, apart from the guidance of any human being. God Himself dealt with Michaels heart and soul according to his turning to God in his pain and anguish. I relate to his experience because as all salvation journeys it was between the person and God and no man gets the credit with saving anyones soul as only the Lord can do it based on each individuals search for His Truth and submission to His Authority.\n\n \n Yes, well, there are many ways to not be destructive and to be constructive, without accepting your religious ideology, Archangel. In your practice of religious zealotry and bigotry you would not understand this of course.",

But the homosexual lifestyle you participate in will destroy you. I know this as surely as I breathe. If I truly care about you and every gay I meet then i must tell you the truth as I know it to be. So don't take my adversarial role as one of hate in any way. I don't hate anyone but seek to share the greatest truth known to man.\n \n \n \n I can only speak for myself and I'm sorry if my bluntness hurts but I only say it out of love and an eternal concern for you all. Not to demonize or condemn out of any sense of superiority because as sinners go, I am the greatest among you.\n\n \n Archie,\n \n I did not turn on this man. He turned on us (gay people) and is trying to project all of his self inflicted problems on all of us when he only has himself and his lack of self control to blame. Of course you ignored the fact that he is now making money claiming to be an ex-gay. He is simply saying what you want to hear. The man is a loser. He has no self control and messed up his life...totally his fault. So stop with the demonizing again. Most of us are nothing like this loser. Losers are people that blame their own short comings and problems on others. I don't know why, but all of the so called 'ex gays' say the same stuff and they all appear to have addiction/control problems. That is what their problem is. Why can't he just be happy for himself, shut up and enjoy his life rather than instantly becoming a born again that attacks and demonizes gay people (and making money while he's doing it).\n \n You act as if you've given something up to be born again. You've given up nothing other than being promiscuous. Yeah, that's real tough!! NOT! Do the preachers in church harp on divorce and point at the divorced people in the pews and call them adulterers? Well of course not because they would never come back (and not donate money any longer) so the adulterer/divorce thing is never discussed. But it's real easy for straight people to condemn gay people because they can feel self righteous, and the biggest point is it takes NO sacrafice from them at all because their not gay! \n \n Truth=something provable. Religion=belief/faith, not truth. Calling it truth is arrogant (just like saying there absolutely is no god is arrogant, nobody really knows). The Bible was written by men. The faith/belief part comes in when you say that those men were inspired by god (god was talking through them) when they wrote the bible. So there is no way to ever prove that they were inspired by god.",

   "I never heard of this Glatze guy. He was apparently an editor of some gay magazine. I found the following response to Michael's letter that was the opening post.\n Found at  this site.\n \n \n \nMy open letter to Michael:\n \n Dear Michael,\n \n I read your posting at World Net Daily and I wanted to share some of my own thoughts on your thoughts and the larger subjects of sexuality, religion, and authenticity.\n \n First, let me say that your words express an inner anguish that seems to have been your companion for many years. I have great sympathy for your heartache. Your attempt to resolve that anguish is noble, however your efforts to extrapolate your own journey as a tonic for all that ails others within the gay community is sadly misguided.\n \n I don't know you so I hesitate to offer my observations without one important caveat. Your life has been lived by and large in the public sphere...first when you embraced homosexuality through YGA and your many other activities...and now as you embrace an alternate reality that you have chosen to share through World Net Daily. Therefore, I make the assumption that both then and now, it has been your choice to submit yourself to the scrutiny of others. If I'm wrong, my apologies.\n \n You note that YGA \"was meant to fill a void\" for young gay Americans...something not so \"pornographic\". Is it possible that YGA was meant to first and foremost fill your own void and to combat your own issues with pornography? Let me elaborate. You see pornography is not the unique domain of homosexuals...it is available to virtually all sexual persuasions and curiosities...and one has the free will to partake or to pass.\n \n I've read gay newspapers and periodicals for many years and I've always known I had the discretion to read and view those articles, advertisements, and photographs of my choosing. When you speak of homosexuality as being \"by its very nature pornographic\" isn't it plausible that what you are actually explaining is how you elected to define your own affiliation with homosexuality? Keep in mind that one can affiliate with heterosexuality in the very same manner...maybe you have yet to discover that prerogative. \n \n You also state that \"homosexuality is not exactly 'virtuous'\". Clearly, virtue is not innate to any sexual preference...just as it isn't innate to Italians, Caucasians, tall people, people near the equator, or people who drive yellow cars. Virtue is a chosen state of being that is available to all humans. Your proximity to virtue during your homosexuality was a function of your actions as a human being with free will...not something one can definitively obtain or be denied as a result of some affiliation. If you lacked virtue, YOU lacked virtue...being gay need not separate one from virtue.\n \n You indicate that \"homosexuality prevents US from finding our true self within. We cannot see the truth when we're blinded by homosexuality.\" The quest to find ones self should never be sought through affiliations. The fact that you couldn't find communion with your self while you identified as a homosexual is not an indictment of homosexuality...it is an indication of your own internal conflicts...conflicts you played out in the public arena then and conflicts you now purport to have resolved in an alternate reality...once again seeking to air your process on the public stage. Unfortunately, your process now is not necessarily any more authentic than your process then. \n \n What remains consistent is your need for others to affirm who and what you are whenever and wherever you tell us what you are. Don't take this wrong, but I recall a time when I would fret about eating in a restaurant by myself...all I could think about was what others may be thinking it said about me. In a conversation with a wise friend, I mentioned my hesitation and she offered this observation, \"Daniel, what makes you think you're that important or that relevant in the minds of other diners? Why you are there eating alone is only meaningful to you.\"\n \n You see it was my perception that was flawed, not my situation. I was living outside of myself and relying on outside feedback to affirm myself...an exercise in futility. May I suggest you remain in the same predicament though you've altered your scenery? You proceed to state that you became aware of your homosexuality when you \"noticed that I looked at other guys\" and that you resolved your desires by paying attention to yourself. You continue by stating, \"Every time I was tempted to lust, I noticed it.\" Your words are clues to your own flawed perception. How you see other men...lustfully...is of your making...it is the perception you brought to your experience with homosexuality. The men you lusted after were not the issue...it was what you carried within.\n \n Unfortunately, you attempt to apply your reality to all other homosexuals...once again illuminating your need for external affirmation...and in your current circumstances you need to vilify that which you no longer want to inhabit your psyche. Sadly, electing to announce your heterosexual affiliation is not the equivalent of extinguishing your flawed perceptions nor does it mean you will approach your heterosexuality any differently than you did your homosexuality. The healing of the heart is not an external event that is subject too, or a function of, ones proximity to any particular societal construct...in this instance heterosexuality.\n \n You then pivot towards religion and your search for, and discovery of, your \"God-given self\". Lacking in that observation is the realization that others may already be in harmony with their god-given selves. You see, may I regrettably suggest that you suffer the belief held by so many who identify as born again...you presume that everyone else must have lost sight of their god-given identities and is therefore in need of rebirth. May I posit that this is once again demonstrative of your need for external validation of your processes, your identity, and all that you experience? In other words, you are still a victim of your inability to embrace an identity of your own volition absent reinforcing feedback.\n \n Your words provide further insight into your struggle. You state, \"Lust takes us out of our bodies, \"attaching\" our psyche onto someone else's physical form\". More telling words may have never been uttered. What you describe is your own persistent psychic wound that manifests itself in the objectification of others in order to fill an internal void...one you must believe to be insatiable and outside your capacity to repair. You see, your demons are just that...your demons. While you may find comfort in believing that every other homosexual has the same demons...that belief is merely a defense mechanism your ego employs to assuage the pain.\n \n I would also speculate that the mindset you held put you in contact with people suffering similar struggles...thereby allowing you to reach your misguided conclusion that all homosexuals were like you. As difficult as this may be to hear, the friends I have would have little difficulty identifying you and your particular perceptions and the flawed judgments that they foster. That reality likely limited your exposure...but it certainly did not serve as a legitimate basis for your current hypothesis. You see, all that you have identified in your diatribe against homosexuality is that portion of your identity that you subconsciously find detestable. I'm sorry for your dilemma but I reject your conclusion.\n \n Near the end of your essay, you state that \"homosexuality took almost 16 years of my life and compromised them with one lie or another\". Shame on you. That statement is an affront to everything else you ask us to embrace. At what point will you take personal responsibility for your own behavior? The pursuit of truth is not a construct you get to strap on when it serves you and pine for when you lack the wherewithal to seek it.\n \n What you need to strive for is authenticity. Your persona as a cheerleader in the latest and greatest uniform of your liking is simply the measure of your inauthentic self. Your predicament is sad and I feel for you...but your carelessness and your cavalier capacity to tear down whatever no longer serves your fragile identity is indefensible and unacceptable.\n \n The fact that you now wrap yourself in the glorious guise of god may once again serve your masked and manipulative inner master but it puts you no closer to truth. You contend that god wins in the end because you have chosen to co-opt god to augment your own disenfranchisement from self-truth. While you have hitched your wagon to this particular iteration of truth, it doesn't mean you have found truth. You have simply found a new mechanism of certainty that can be substituted for the ever elusive identity that in the end has ironically come to define who you are and who you aren't.\n \n Michael, I hope you're able to find peace...but I have to implore you to do so without attacking those who have journeyed much further along the path.\n \n Regards,\n \n Daniel\n",

   "In other words AA is right everyone else is wrong. \n \n If God wanted to declare Homosexuality as a sin I think he would have chosen his words a bit more carefully so that they could not be interpreted to mean different things. You would think an Omnipotent God would have picked words that would have stood through all the ages which could be clearly understood by us mere mortals. I guess that is why in a secular society we don't solely base our Laws on what is written in the Holy Texts of any religion.\n\n \n God is perfect Scot, He doesn't make mistakes, and neither did he use innacurate terms to describe homosexuality or His feelings about it. What you fail to consider is that the determined and willful mind of man can manipulate and distort any truth to suit his warped and sinful needs. So don't blame God for the corrupt agenda of immoral men of low esteem.\n \n \nI actually believe that every Christian interprets the Bible to suit their own needs, be it the Fundie who ignores the commandment 'Thou shall not kill' when it comes to State sponsored killing (capital punishment etc) or the liberal Christian who ignores passages on how women should be subservient to men.\n \n \n Scriptural BALANCE is required, and speaking only for myself, that is my main goal in interpreting the Word. We must not have a personal agenda in interpreting any part of the bible or we will inject our personal desires into our interpretation. I have no axe to grind with gays or homosexuality at all. If I truly believed that the bible translated to accept homosexuality, I would be screaming it from the housetops. I don't care what the Church or men thought of my claims. I would prove it from the translations of the original languages it was written in. But much more learned language experts, Theologians and translators than me have been studying these terms in the original Greek, Aramaic and Hebrew going back 4000 years now, and I firmly believe that they too had no personal axe to grind with homosexuality. If the same could only be said for the gay community who seeks to justify their sin rather than seek the truth according to Gods intent. \n \n \nAt least the liberal Christian is honest when he says the Bible is up for the interpretation, the Fundie declares that you must read the Bible literally. I think that is what you call a hypocrite.\n\n \n There is nothing honest about that proclamation at all. It is the lie of satan to justify manipulating Gods Word for his corrupted agenda to get mens eyes off of God and on themselves. When you promote interpreting the bible according to the personal whims and comfort zones of men you support the prince of darkness and betray the God who's truth is being corrupted, and you prove that Gods truth is not in you. Remember that He say's, \"You are either for me, or against me. You either love me or you hate me.\" You can't have it both ways with the living God and claim to know His truth. It's impossible to call Him a liar and then claim to believe Him. But hypocrites attempt to do it every day in their futile attempts to justify their own sins.",
