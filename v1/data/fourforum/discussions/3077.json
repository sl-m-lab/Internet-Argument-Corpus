   "Hi Lady:\n \n \nLady << Professing Christians and Christians? I don't know if there is a difference. Do professing christians believe something different than the other Christians?\n\n \n Most certainly. This is my term, and I apologize for not clarifying this sooner. Christ gives many warnings to His disciples about false prophets and false Christs. \n \n \n\"Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many.\" Matthew 24:11.\n \n \"For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect.\" Matthew 24:24.\n\n \n The Apostle Paul warns about false apostles, false brethren, deceitful workers and the servants of Satan that work in our midst. He writes, \n \n \n\"But {it was} because of the false brethren secretly brought in, who had sneaked in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, in order to bring us into bondage.\" Galatians 2:4.\n\n \n \n\"For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their deeds.\" 2Cor. 11:15.\n\n \n The biggest problem in Paul's day was with false prophets. It is through the Apostles and the prophets that we received God's Living Word in the form of the Scriptures. Which ones were to be believed? Since we now have our Bible, then the problem today is with 'false brethren.' Those are people who believe they are saved, but indeed are not. Christ Himself dwells inside the 'real deal' Christian. Colossians 1:27 (Romans 8:10-15). The Satan sets up residence inside those deceived by the 'deluding influence.' (See 2Thes. 2:7-12). Can we look at 100 people and pick out the one gay person in the crowd? How about the single Christian? Looks are often deceiving. Christ says, \n \n \n\"Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide  and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. \"For the gate is small  and the way is narrow  that leads to life, and there are few who find it. \"Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves. \"You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn {bushes} nor figs from thistles, are they? \"So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. \"A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit. \"Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.\" Matt. 7:13-19.\n\n \n Paul warns us, saying,\n \n \n\"But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits  and doctrines of demons, by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience  as with a branding iron, who forbid marriage  {and advocate} abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth.\" 1Tim. 4:1-3.\n\n \n Think about it Lady, there are well over 2000 denominations of professing Christians in this country, but there is only one truth. Therefore, Paul writes, \n \n \n\"For there must also be factions among you, so that those who are approved may become evident among you.\" 1Cor. 11:19. \n \n \n And,\n \n \n\"Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?\" 1Cor. 1:20.\n\n \n Then he says, \n \n \n\"Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.\" 2Timothy 2:15.\n\n \n The 'Word of God is what?\n \n \n\"In addition to all, taking up the shield of faith  with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil {one.} And take THE HELMET OF SALVATION, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.\" Eph. 6:16+17.\n\n \n So we come here to the religious section to determine who among us is approved before God. Each side has his sword of the spirit, helmet and shield. The third party reader is then placed into the position of those Corinthians up there, and they decide for themselves who is really approved. After all, \n \n \n\"For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.\" Hebrews 4:12.\n\n \n Who is the real Christian, and who is just professing to be one? \n \n In Christ,\n \n Terral",

   "I think terral's reply is not relevant and didn't answer the question at hand. It isn't about which christian denomination is the right one. She is asking about the differencess between their beliefs. Some take things literal, some don't think Jesus was the son of god, but do think he was the Messiah talked about in the Torah. Many people who post on here claim to be christian and I feel what Ladywolf is asking is how can their opinions differ so much and why!\n \n So Terral, get off your soapbox and answer the real question!",
