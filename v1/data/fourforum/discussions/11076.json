   "In an offensive new piece that Focus on the Family has headlined, \"Anthropologists Agree on Traditional Definition of Marriage,\" FOF staffers and friends try and make the argument that the study of humankind automatically discriminates against same-sex marriage. In said piece, FOF's Glenn Stanton makes the following assertion: Glenn Stanton, director of global family formation studies at Focus on the Family, said there's a clear consensus among anthropologists. \n \n \"A family is a unit that draws from the two types of humanity, male and female,\" he said. \"Those two parts of humanity join together, create new life and they both cooperate in the legitimization of the child, if you will, and the development of the child.\" Only problem for Glenn and anyone who would try to find an anthropological basis for denying us our portion of humanity? Well, to be frank and direct: TRAINED ANTHROPOLOGISTS DON'T AGREE WITH THEM!!!!! Check out any of the following posts on the American Anthropological Association's website for the myriad of reasons why noted anthropologists are, in many instances, speaking out against the religious rights' unfair and unfounded monopoly on marriage, not gay and lesbian couples' attempts to take part: \n \n http://www.aaanet.org/press/an/0405if-comm4.htm\n http://www.aaanet.org/press/an/0405if-comm3.htm\n \n Or wait, want more? Well, just check out the AAA's officail statement in regards to marriage and the attempts to ban gay people from it: \n \"The results of more than a century of anthropological research on households, kinship relationships, and families, across cultures and through time, provide no support whatsoever for the view that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon marriage as an exclusively heterosexual institution. Rather, anthropological research supports the conclusion that a vast array of family types, including families built upon same-sex partnerships, can contribute to stable and humane societies. \n \n The Executive Board of the American Anthropological Association strongly opposes a constitutional amendment limiting marriage to heterosexual couples.\" http://www.goodasyou.org/good_as_you/2008/03/is-there-an-ant.html\n So the FOF want to form a \"Anthropological\" conclusion, but completely fail to note the ACTUAL AAA position on the issue. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Quoting a \"clear consensus among Anthropologists\", while failing to note that \"consensus\" doesn't really agree with your stance? :xbanghead",
