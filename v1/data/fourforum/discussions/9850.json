   "God's Holiness and justice demand that sin be punished. That does not necessarily mean that God does not love His creation, but when mankind chooses to reject God, then he (man) suffers the consequences thereto.\n\n But how would God have reacted if there was no sacrifice/atonement made? If He would have punished all humanity equally, then how would that be just since people sin to various degrees? Otherwise, would each persons punishment be based on his propensity to sin?\n \nTwo things you overlook is God's grace and mercy. IOW, doing something for us or giving something to us we do not deserve.\n\n By this, do you mean that we do not deserve to not be punished for sinning? I can agree that this would be a gift from God due to His grace or mercy. However, why would the sacrifice of Jesus be also necessary? Certainly, the sacrifice of Jesus did not directly benefit humanity. Did it benefit God in some way? God's grace meant letting humanity off the hook from sin. I just don't see the necessity of the sacrifice of Jesus.\n \nOK, Jesus, being both God and Man, without sin, is the only one capable of bridging the gap that developed when mankind rejects God.\n\n I don't really understand what that means. Could you clarify?\n \n This is more of a relational concept. IOW, three \"whos\" in one \"what\" God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit. All three being God, yet each having distinctive roles.\n\n But in what way are they one besides in name? Do they share a common mind - so the thoughts of one are the thoughts of the other? What do they have in common that makes them unified as one?\n \n Actually, no. As you may recall, Satan was named Lucifer and filled with pride. so even though he may still be powerful, he is not all powerful.\n\n Does that mean that you think that his power was independent from God? If his power was independent from God but his power was limited, that would still make him a diety - just a lesser one (as there were many lesser dieties and spirits in the ancient Greek pantheon). If that is the case, that would mean that Christianity is polytheistic - at least two dieties. Otherwise, do you think that a being can have independent spiritual powers but only be called deity or god if those powers are infinite?",

Namely, is it a being (as God, Jesus, the angels, etc. are) or is it a force?\n\n \n To be totally candid with you, you're getting deeper than the bible gets in its explanations of how the Trinity splits up. But consider John 1:1-5\n \n \nJhn 1:1 \n IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\n Jhn 1:2 \n He was in the beginning with God.\n Jhn 1:3 \n All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made.\n Jhn 1:4 \n In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.\n Jhn 1:5 \n And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend[fn1] it.\n\n \n See in 1:1 how in the beginning was the Word. Jesus referred to himself as the Word of God. The Word was with God, and was God. In order to have been in the beginning with God He had to actually be God Himself. All things were made through Him and without him, nothing was made. In Him is life and His life is the light of men And His light shines in the darkness(World), and the World cannot comprehend Him.\n \n So this brings me back to my original analogy which is the only way I can comprehend God in His natural state. He is Spirit, flesh and soul just as He created us. But being God He can encompass all of time and space. He is omnipotent. So if this is believable, and it is hard for me to comprehend even though I am a recipient of what I'm about to say.\n \n As a believer who possesses the Holy Spirit of God, it is the truth and safe to say that not a separate spirit but God's own spirit indwells every believer who is redeemed by the blood of the Lamb. Notice that John said \"In the beginning,\" The beginning of Time and Space. Way before He ever decided to create us. And here are some verses that explain that before the World existed He knew us.\n \n Jhn 17:5 And now, O Father, glorify me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.\n 1Cr 2:7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, [even] the hidden [wisdom], which God ordained before the world unto our glory:\n 2Ti 1:9 Who hath saved us, and called [us] with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,\n Tts 1:2 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;\n \n The first verse above is Jesus in a prayer to the Father before His crucifixion. So in His human state He understood at that time from where he came and who He was. He understood why He had to die and who He was dying for. That His sacrifice was a worthy one which means we are worth the sacrifice He made for us. Imagine that God Himself deemed us worthy of Him taking on the lowly life of a human being in order to be a perfect example for us and then to become a blood sacrifice to redeem us from our own sinful nature.",

   "[QUOTE=Archangel;261804][QUOTE=gaetano;261791]\nI like your post and interpretation of Gods love but what bothers me about this is it implies need on Gods part. And God needs nothing. \n \n \n \n Who said He had no wishes, wants or desires gaetano ? And what do those traits have to do with having needs ? \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n By your assumption that he is perfect and/or complete he would have no needs, etc. It is a contradiction of his being described as perfect. That's all.\n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n And why would you assume that He must be needy because He is actively interested in humanity which He made in His image and in fact does take issue with being denied the Glory and honor that comes with being ignored by that Creation ? \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n I will make reference to my mother and father who created my sister and I. They never expected to be honored or glorified because they created us. They never expected to be honored or glorified because they devoted their lives to making sure we were taken care of. They did not lust for honor or glory from their children or anyone else in their lives. Love and respect were more their style. However they never assumed it was automatically given because they took an interest in somebody. As for your god being ignored by \"that creation\" it has alot to do with his textbook like personna. If he wants to be noticed then he needs to pull his head out of the clouds, so to speak, and greet humanity in a way that clarifies his existence. For a god who created a universe and all it's inhabitants that shouldn't be a problem.\n \n Archangel:\n God is complete within Himself and if God IS love then He is evidence that LOVE can exist by itself. Now God may choose not to exist by Himself which explains His desire to create us for fellowship, which is why He created Man in His image with free will, for fellowship by willing, responding, loving children who freely choose to respond to Him. \n \n \n \n Oh really ? So a welder who welds a bead to seam two pieces of steel together, and realizes the bead is flawed so he destroys his work and rewelds a new seam has no dignity ? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n I would have no problem with a god who made mistakes. I have a problem with a god who does make mistakes and has the balls to claim perfection. That's all.\n \n \n \n Archangel:\n Or is he in fact a perfectionist and it's just you who has no concept of what dignity is ?\n \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n A perfectionist implies someone who is striving for perfection. Your god is suppossedly already there, so it would be impossible for him to create anything imperfect unless that was his intention. I think dignity to you and I are two different things. Yes I do feel that a god that has no reverence or respect for the lives he created is lacking in dignity. Human life is not a metal beam that one melts down because of a bad weld. \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n Based on you lashing out as you are against God, I sense your conviction is angering you.\n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n If you are looking for \"lashing out\" read your bible again and watch your god from an objective point of view. If you're looking for angry conviction read the posts you direct at those who don't agree with your politics or your religious beliefs.\n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n But everything God does He does for Love and concern, not hate and malice.\n\n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n As a believer, you have lost the ability to see it any other way. As one who doesn't believe I read what is written. I find your god a very uptight and all around unpleasant entity. But being a single parent with millions of children who ignore you is a tough job. Dr. Dobson tells us that children need two parents, male and female in order to grow up right. Maybe if god had taken a wife and raised Adam and Eve the right way in a proper Christian home they wouldn't have sinned.",

As you claim to understand the Lord, you don't even have a clue. When Israel started to worship Idols, practice all types of sexual deviency and ignore the God who made them a Nation is when the God of Israel, My God withdrew His spirit of Grace and protection on them as a Nation and allowed them to again be destroyed and taken into bondage.
