Maybe then I can have an opinion.\n \n So, What's your opinion on the Martha Stewart trial? emoticon_xbouncer\n\n \n She was found guilty of insider trading. This cheats the \"little people\", like the ones she sells her overpriced products to, and the ones who shop at K-Mart (where she would never stoop to go). She did not even stand to lose much money if the stock nose-dived with her money. It would have been a drop in the bucket of her fortune. I personally could care less if it was ten dollars, it is the principle of the thing. Any one of the \"regular\" people would be placed on the chopping block for what she did, I guess she thinks her celebrity entitles her to cheat. So I say, Sleep well Martha, in your gorgeous 7x9 cinderblock cell, complete with stainless steel open air toilet and heavy chain link door. Those of us little people on the outside will sleep well on our non-Martha-brand sheets that we got at Wallmart or K-Mart in our own beds, where we are free to leave the house in the morning and can use the toilet in privacy. emoticon_xbye",
