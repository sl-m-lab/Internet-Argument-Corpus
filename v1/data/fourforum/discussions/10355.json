   "A positive approach to life is always more rewarding and motivating than a negative outlook. People have an individual choice to embrace either the positive or the negative, regardless of their situation. By choosing and dwelling on the negative, people often paralyze themselves. It seems one depressing and negative thought spawns two or three more. It soon becomes an endless and apparently overwhelming negative cycle. I believe the Christian mind-set that is so eager to accept guilt and original sin, as well as the additional unnatural idea of redemption by proxy, is much to blame for the suffering of millions of people who allow themselves to be victims of negativity. \n \n The unreasonable ideas which abound in Christianity and Judaism are effectively neutralized and eliminated by the reason-friendly openness which permeates Deism. In place of Christianity's vacillating god of the Old and New Testaments, Deism offers an idea of a Creator as unchangeable as the laws of Nature. A Creator incapable of such misery producing acts as the extermination of men, women, children and even of unborn babies by drowning. Deism happily rejects the Passover horror story which depicts God killing the first-born of all the Egyptians, and even the first born of their animals, because Pharaoh did not do what the Bible god allegedly (according to Exodus 11:10) made impossible for him to do (releasing the Jews). \n \n THE DEISTIC IDEA OF GOD \n \n In contrast to the ideas of God endorsed and promoted by the various revealed religions, ranging anywhere from killing babies in the Old Testament to suggesting the practice of \"turning the other cheek\" in the New Testament, Deism offers a very simple non-dogmatic concept of God: an eternal entity whose power is equal to his/her will. \n \n With the quality of being eternal, the entity of God obviously would have no beginning or end. Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity predicted places in the universe void of time, so the idea of eternalness is not unreasonable. As humanity learns more about science and the universe, our concepts of the Creator will correspondingly grow. This is the only way we can learn more about God: through the honest study of the Creator's creation, not through contradictory books written by men claiming inspiration and revelation from God. \n \n The antiquated practice of forming an idea of God based on purely past material experience, such as referring to God as \"King\", is also rejected by Deism. The extremely limited picture of God as the jealous and paranoid king of kings sitting on his throne upset that his subjects were going to reach \"heaven\" by building a brick tower is due to the limited vision which the Bible writers had of both the Creator and of the universe. This fear the Bible god had of the Tower of Babel is based on fear of humanities acquisition of knowledge. The Creator the Deist venerates invites all of us to learn as much as possible about absolutely everything, for this is the best way to learn about God. \n \n Another problem with the idea of God as promoted by the revealed religions of Christianity, Judaism and Islam is its depiction of God as a man. By limiting God to the status of a man, women are consciously and subconsciously relegated to a lesser standing in society. After all, if God is characterized as a man, then men are closer to God then women. Perhaps this accounts for the multiple instances of women bashing found throughout the various \"holy books.\" By limiting the advancement of women through their subjugation to men, revealed religion has limited the advancement and progress of all of society. And a very sad element of this anti-progress mind-set, advanced by revealed religion, is that it claims God as its author. \n \n DEISM REJECTS VIOLENCE \n \n All religions claim they reject violence. History, of course, proves them wrong. From the grotesque horror stories of slaughter and rape at the alleged command of God found throughout the Old Testament, to the claimed words of Jesus regarding bringing not peace but a sword, to the blood soaked Inquisition through religiously approved contemporary wars, revealed religion goes happily hand in hand with violence and war. \n \n Deism's rejection of divine revelation excludes it from falling into the same violence promoting business that the revealed religions are in. There are no written words from the Almighty that can be twisted to sanctify one human being killing another. This makes Deism less useful to the ambitions of the power-elites. Could this be why very few people are aware of Deism and of the Deistic influence of the Enlightenment and the American Revolution? \n \n Nuclear realities have made the waging of war an unacceptable proposition. War was never justifiable, it only exposed man's mental limitations at being able to formulate a workable solution to a problem. However, in the nuclear age humanities ignorance can lead to the extermination of civilization and life itself on our planet. The shallow chauvinism of the various revealed religions take us all one step closer to that irreversible catastrophe. Deism, by its reliance on reason and rejection of violence, serves as a block to the apocalyptic nightmare that is so central to the major revealed religions. \n \n DEISM'S APPRECIATION OF LIFE AND BEAUTY \n \n One of the best roads to happiness is to greatly appreciate the positive things in life. In spite of many obstacles that everyone has in their lives that need to be overcome, the fact remains there is much to be thankful for. To quote Thomas Paine: \"But if objects for gratitude and admiration are our desire, do they not present themselves every hour to our eyes? Do we not see a fair creation prepared to receive us the instant we are born - a world furnished to our hands, that cost us nothing? Is it we that light up the sun, that pour down the rain, and fill the earth with abundance? Whether we sleep or wake, the vast machinery of the universe still goes on.\" \n \n From personal experience I know if my problems seem overwhelming, all I need to do is force myself to only think of the positive things in life and my spirits are soon picked up and fortified. I not only feel better, but my mind is cleared and solutions to the problems flow much smoother. And the more often I use this method the easier it becomes. \n \n Many people express anger at God for disease, natural disasters and war. Yet it is within humanities power to eliminate and/or neutralize all of these. By studying the principles of Nature we have already eradicated many diseases and protected ourselves from much of Nature's fury. If we didn't let our egos, selfishness and fear get in the way, just think of how far we could be by now. Every invention and discovery we have today, could have been in effect 1,000 years ago. For the fact is, the principles those inventions and discoveries are based on were in effect from before the evolution of mankind. We could be enjoying a virtually disease free, peaceful progressive society extending well beyond our planet Earth. It still isn't too late. As we generate a peaceful worldwide religious revolution through Deism and the World Union of Deists we will bring about the emancipation of the individual's mind and spirit. The soul of society will then be lifted to a new level, never before thought possible. A level of progress and international cooperation that will make warfare just an archaic oddity of the dark, superstitious past.",

   "I've touched on this before, but I think it's interesting (if not odd) that quite a few atheists don't seem to have any problem with deism and even seem to respect it somewhat more that other religious perspectives. Often they will use deism as retort when answering the charge that the U.S. founding fathers were Christian, as if deism does not ALSO violate the perspective of atheism (that there is no god). The genuinely atheistic perspective would be just as adamant against deism as Christianity, because deism involves belief in God, and that there IS a God. The difference between deism and other, more \"fervent\" religions is mainly in their view of the way God does things and deals with the universe and humanity. You can't be a real atheist and be accepting of deism. For any atheist, if deism is acceptable as a perspective to them from an intellectual standpoint, then there is a glaring inconsistency there.",

   "I understand your perspective but you have been misled. The opening lines in the Declaraton of Independence \n \n When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n \n This speaks for itself.\n \n Also on the pretexts of Deism. The following indicates the basis and beliefs of Deism including the \"Natural God\" mentioned above.\n [*]Deism is the recognition of a universal creative force greater than that demonstrated by mankind, supported by personal observation of laws and designs in nature and the universe, perpetuated and validated by the innate ability of human reason coupled with the rejection of claims made by individuals and organized religions of having received special divine revelation.\n [*]Faith: This word has been so terribly abused by \"revealed\" religions that it has come to really mean the suspension of an individual's God-given reason in order to accept, or at least to tolerate, an unreasonable claim made by a \"revealed\" religion. It is the only way \"revealed\" religions can get people to accept such insane and unreasonable claims and ideas as original sin, walking on water, healing the sick without medical care, splitting the Red Sea, etc. Deists prefer to use the word \"trust\" instead of faith due to the twisted meaning the word \"faith\" has acquired after centuries of abuse from the \"revealed\" religions.\n [*]One key difference between Deism and the \"revealed\" religions is that Deists don't believe faith is required to believe in God. This quote from Voltaire sums it up, \"What is faith? Is it to believe that which is evident? No. It is perfectly evident to my mind that there exists a necessary, eternal, supreme, and intelligent being. This is no matter of faith, but of reason.\" (A long way from Atheism wouldn't you agree?\n [*]God: The universal creative force which is the source of the laws and designs found throughout Nature.\n [*]Intelligent Design: Intelligent Design refers to the structures in Nature, such as that of DNA, which can be observed and the complexity of which required an intelligent Designer. In this context \"structure\" means something arranged in a definite pattern of organization. In Deism, Intelligent Design has absolutely nothing to do with the unreasonable Biblical myth of creation.\n [*]Natural Religion: Belief in God based on the application of reason on the laws/designs of Nature as opposed to revealed religion which is based on alleged revelations.\n [*]Philosophy: The study of the truths and principles of being, knowledge, or conduct.\n [*]Reason: The mental powers used with forming conclusions or inferences based on facts. Deists look at reason as the second greatest gift from Nature's God to humanity, second only to life itself.\n [*]Religion: A set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature and purpose of the universe. \n [*]Revelation: The act of revealing or of making known. In the religious sense, revelation usually means divine revelation. This is meaningless, since revelation can only be revelation in the first instance. For example, if God revealed something to me, that would be a divine revelation to me. If I then told someone else what God told me it would be mere hearsay to the person I tell. If that person believed what I said, they would not be putting their trust in God, but in me, believing what I told them was actually true. \n [*]Revealed Religion: An organized system of belief in and worship of God based on the belief that God communicated/communicates with certain individual founders/members of the particular revealed religion. As mentioned above, by believing in any of the revealed religions a believer is not putting their trust in God, but in the person/people making the claim of receiving the divine revelation.\n [*]Trust: Trust is confidence in a person or thing based on reason and experience.So, the essence is that framers of the Constitution and Declaration of Independence had an entirely different attitude toward theism than it has evolved into today.\n \n When you have a chance read Thomas Paine's, \"Age of Reason.\"\n \n Many non-Christians and \"Atheists\" can't put words to their reasons for not being \"religious puppets, lemmings\". It is difficult to believe the premises of hate, killings, and love all tied into one God figure. This isn't reasonable. It's a matter of what people believed way back then. Many today aren't really atheists, they are more than likely Deists and don't know how to express it.",

Nowhere in the Gospels do we find a precept for Creeds, Confessions, Oaths, Doctrines, and whole cartloads of other foolish trumpery that we find in Christianity.\" \n \n Abraham Lincoln, although not a Founding Father, was an extremely influential and important U.S. President. \n \n At times religious wording was written into Lincoln's speeches, but such public soothes were brought at the insistence of White House staff members. In 1843, after he lost a campaign for Congress, he wrote to his supporters: \"It was everywhere contended that no Christian ought to vote for me because I belonged to no church, and was suspected of being a Deist.\" \n \n Interviewer Opie Read once asked Lincoln about his conception of God, to which he replied: \"The same as my conception of nature.\" When he was asked what he meant by that, he said: \"That it is impossible for either to be personal.\" \n \n George Washington Historian Barry Schwartz writes: \"George Washington's practice of Christianity was limited and superficial because he was not himself a Christian... He repeatedly declined the church's sacraments. Never did he take communion, and when his wife, Martha, did, he waited for her outside the sanctuary... Even on his deathbed, Washington asked for no ritual, uttered no prayer to Christ, and expressed no wish to be attended by His representative.\" [New York Press, 1987, pp. 174-175] \n \n \"Gouverneur Morris had often told me that General Washington believed no more of that system (Christianity) than did he himself.\" \n -Thomas Jefferson, in his private journal, Feb. 1800",

   "Deism, Atheism, Buddhism, and Agnosticism are all very intelligent beliefs on my list. Even though they are different, all of them seem to have been formulated by intelligent people, unlike their cousins Christianity, Islam, and ancient mythology, who demonstrate a closed minded know-it-all approach to God (or gods). \n \n What I like about Deism, Buddhism, and Agnosticism is that they are all religions that are not entirely sure about what god is. Deism believes in a passive god, a god without a personality.

And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that 'except the Lord build the House, they labor in vain that build it.\" - Benjamin Franklin at the Constitutional Convention\n \n \n\n James Madison\n\n \n Please review the info in the following link:\n \n http://www.wallbuilders.com/LIBissuesArticles.asp?id=105\n \n \n\n John Adams \n\n \n In a letter to Thomas Jefferson dated June 28, 1813, John Adams wrote: \"The general principles on which the (founding) fathers achieved independence were...the general principles of Christianity.\"\n \n \n\n Abraham Lincoln, although not a Founding Father, was an extremely influential and important U.S. President. \n\n \n Lincoln did not receive Christ until the dedication of Gettysburg Memorial Cemetery.\n \n \"Dr. Francis Vinton, rector of Trinity Church, came down to Washington from New York. He was a friend of the family, and was allowed in to see the President. Not wanting to beat around the bush, he told him it was not right to mourn thus over his son. He said, \"Your son is alive in paradise with Christ, and you must not continue.\" Lincoln sat there as though he were in a stupor, and then his mind caught on to the words that Dr. Vinton had said, and he exclaimed, \"Alive! Alive! Surely, sir, you mock me.\" \"No, Mr. President, it is a great doctrine of the church. Jesus himself said that God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.\" Lincoln leaped to his feet and threw his arms around this pastor. He wept openly and sobbed, saying, \"Alive! Alive! My boy is alive!\" From that day there began a change in Lincoln that even his wife Mary noticed. His religious views began to dramatically change. There is a remarkable letter that comes to us from an Illinois clergyman who talked to Lincoln after this time. He said this to Mr. Lincoln (Again, I commend him for his boldness): \"Mr. President, do you love Jesus?\" After a long pause, Mr. Lincoln solemnly replied: \"When I left Springfield I asked the people to pray for me. I was not a Christian. When I buried my son, the severest trial of my life, I was not a Christian. But when I went to Gettysburg and saw the graves of thousands of our soldiers, I then and there consecrated myself to Christ. Yes, I do love Jesus.\" - The Lincoln Memorial: Album-Immortelles in the O.H. Oldroyd Collection. The book was published in 1883.\n \n \nGeorge Washington \n\n \n He (Washington) was an open promoter of Christianity. For example, in his speech on May 12, 1779, he claimed that what children needed to learn \"above all\" was the \"religion of Jesus Christ,\" and that to learn this would make them \"greater and happier than they already are\"; on May 2, 1778, he charged his soldiers at Valley Forge that \"To the distinguished character of patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian\"; and when he resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the military on June 8, 1783, he reminded the nation that \"without a humble imitation\" of \"the Divine Author of our blessed religion\" we \"can never hope to be a happy nation.\" Washington's own adopted daughter declared of Washington that you might as well question his patriotism as to question his Christianity.\n \n In addition, the inscription on Washington's tomb at Mount Vernon is this:\n \n WITHIN THIS ENCLOSURE REST THE REMAINS OF GENL. GEORGE WASHINGTON.\" Over the door of the inner tomb is inscribed: \"I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE.\"\n \n George Washington's adopted daughter (Nelly Custis-Lewis), having spent twenty years of her life in his presence, declared that one might as well question Washington's patriotism as question his Christianity.\n \n http://www.christiananswers.net/q-wall/wal-g011.html\n \n Being in communion with the Anglican Church, and serving for over twenty-three years as a vestryman, and on at least three different occasions serving as a churchwarden, George Washington would have regularly recited the Apostle's Creed, which begins:\n \n \"I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord.\" \n \n John Marshall, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who had previously fought with Washington in the Revolutionary War and served with him at Valley Forge, said of George Washington:\n \n \"Without making ostentatious professions of religions, he was a sincere believer in the Christian faith, and a truly devout man.\"\n \n So, you might have 1, but we still need 4 more.",

   "Church Services in Government Buildings\n \n Reserved Seats at Capitol Services\n \n Here is a description, by an early Washington \"insider,\" Margaret Bayard Smith (1778-1844), a writer and social critic and wife of Samuel Harrison Smith, publisher of the National Intelligencer, of Jefferson's attendance at church services in the House of Representatives: \"Jefferson during his whole administration was a most regular attendant. The seat he chose the first day sabbath, and the adjoining one, which his private secretary occupied, were ever afterwards by the courtesy of the congregation, left for him.\"\n \n The Old House of Representatives\n \n Church services were held in what is now called Statuary Hall from 1807 to 1857. The first services in the Capitol, held when the government moved to Washington in the fall of 1800, were conducted in the \"hall\" of the House in the north wing of the building. In 1801 the House moved to temporary quarters in the south wing, called the \"Oven,\" which it vacated in 1804, returning to the north wing for three years. Services were conducted in the House until after the Civil War. The Speaker's podium was used as the preacher's pulpit. \n \n A Millennialist Sermon Preached in Congress\n \n This sermon on the millennium was preached by the Baltimore Swedenborgian minister, John Hargrove (1750-1839) in the House of Representatives. One of the earliest millennialist sermons preached before Congress was offered on July 4, 1801, by the Reverend David Austin (1759-1831), who at the time considered himself \"struck in prophesy under the style of the Joshua of the American Temple.\" Having proclaimed to his Congressional audience the imminence of the Second Coming of Christ, Austin took up a collection on the floor of the House to support services at \"Lady Washington's Chapel\" in a nearby hotel where he was teaching that \"the seed of the Millennial estate is found in the backbone of the American Revolution.\"\n \n First Catholic Sermon in the House\n \n On January 8, 1826, Bishop John England (1786-1842) of Charleston, South Carolina, became the first Catholic clergyman to preach in the House of Representatives. The overflow audience included President John Quincy Adams, whose July 4, 1821, speech England rebutted in his sermon. \n \n Woman Preacher in the House (and call for revival!)\n \n In 1827, Harriet Livermore (1788-1868), the daughter and granddaughter of Congressmen, became the second woman to preach in the House of Representatives. The first woman to preach before the House (and probably the first woman to speak officially in Congress under any circumstances) was the English evangelist, Dorothy Ripley (1767-1832), who conducted a service on January 12, 1806. Jefferson and Vice President Aaron Burr were among those in a \"crowded audience.\" Sizing up the congregation, Ripley concluded that \"very few\" had been born again and broke into an urgent, camp meeting style exhortation, insisting that \"Christ's Body was the Bread of Life and His Blood the drink of the righteous.\"\n \n Communion Service in the Treasury Building\n \n Manasseh Cutler here describes a four-hour communion service in the Treasury Building, conducted by a Presbyterian minister, the Reverend James Laurie: \"Attended worship at the Treasury. Mr. Laurie alone. Sacrament. Full assembly. Three tables; service very solemn; nearly four hours.\" \n \n Adams's Description of a Church Service in the Supreme Court\n \n John Quincy Adams here describes the Reverend James Laurie, pastor of a Presbyterian Church that had settled into the Treasury Building, preaching to an overflow audience in the Supreme Court Chamber, which in 1806 was located on the ground floor of the Capitol. \n \n The Old Supreme Court Chamber\n \n Description of church services in the Supreme Court chamber by Manasseh Cutler (1804) and John Quincy Adams (1806) indicate that services were held in the Court soon after the government moved to Washington in 1800.\n \n Church Services in Congress after the Civil War\n \n Charles Boynton (1806-1883) was in 1867 chaplain of the House of Representatives and organizing pastor of the First Congregational Church in Washington, which was trying at that time to build its own sanctuary. In the meantime the church, as Boynton informed potential donors, was holding services \"at the Hall of Representatives\" where \"the audience is the largest in town. . . .nearly 2000 assembled every Sabbath\" for services, making the congregation in the House the \"largest Protestant Sabbath audience then in the United States.\" The First Congregational Church met in the House from 1865 to 1868. \n \n House of Representatives, After the Civil War\n \n The House moved to its current location on the south side of the Capitol in 1857. It contained the \"largest Protestant Sabbath audience\" in the United States when the First Congregational Church of Washington held services there from 1865 to 1868. \n \n Compliments: U.S. Library of Congress\n \n http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel06-2.html",

   "Ten Prominent Founders\n \n # George Washington was nominally an Episcopalian. Because he seldom attended church and was not a communicant, he was accused of being an agnostic and even an atheist. He denounced the Calvinist doctrine of original sin, he never mentioned Jesus in his writings, and he used the term Providence as synonymous with destiny or fate. His prayer at Valley Forge (kneeling in the snow) is now acknowledged to be a fabrication. He was a Deist.\n \n # John Adams studied for the ministry at Harvard. Doubts about his Christian convictions led him to shift to the law. Although he wrote favorably of Christianity and Jesus throughout his life, he rejected orthodox Christian dogma. He was a Unitarian.\n \n # Thomas Jefferson authored the Declaration of Independence, wrote the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, and coined the oft-repeated phrase, \"the wall of separation between church and state.\" Political opponents called him a \"champion of atheism and immorality\" because he denied the deity of Jesus, he did not think the bible was God's word, and he rejected the Christian concept of hell as a state of everlasting punishment. Yet, he greatly admired Jesus' moral teachings and assembled them into a booklet referred to as Jefferson's Bible. He was a Deist.\n \n # James Madison is known as the father of the U.S. Constitution. He did not attend church, but he spoke out repeatedly on behalf of freedom of conscience, which he believed was a basic right of citizenship. He opposed any form of government support for religion, because history demonstrates that established churches tend to produce \"superstition, bigotry, and persecution.\" He opposed the appointment of a chaplain for the U.S. Congress. In his writings, he used the terms Governor of the Universe and Universal Sovereign. He was a Deist.\n \n # James Monroe attended an Episcopal church, but never talked about his religious beliefs because he considered religion to be a private matter. A reference to the Divine Author of All Good in his second annual message to Congress suggests that he may have been a Deist.\n \n # John Quincy Adams was not a regular church-goer, causing some religious people to call him an atheist. Ironically. he read at least three chapters of the bible each day and read through the entire bible every year. A lifelong opponent of slavery, he severely criticized clergy and parishioners for not condemning slavery on religious and moral grounds. Like his father, he was a Unitarian.\n \n # Benjamin Franklin rejected nearly all doctrinal aspects of Christianity. While he doubted Jesus' divinity, he applauded his ethical teachings. He considered morality to be independent of religion and stressed the cultivation of civic virtue in his writings. He opposed oaths and religious tests for public office. He was a Deist.\n \n # Ethan Allen was a military hero of the American Revolution, best known for conquering the British stronghold at Fort Ticonderoga. He formulated a Deistic philosophy based on reason, disavowing revelation and miracles. His treatise, Reason the Only Oracle of Man, was the first openly anti-Christian book published in the U.S. He was a Deist.\n \n # Thomas Paine is best known for his immensely popular book, Common Sense, which developed the argument for independence from England. In another persuasive volume, The Age of Reason, he demonstrated that the bible's claims could not be true and he ridiculed Christianity, which he regarded as an obstacle to social and political reform. The charge that he was an atheist is false; he believed in God and an afterlife. He was a Deist.\n \n # Joel Barlow was a revolutionary political writer and diplomat. As U.S. Consul to Algiers, he negotiated the Treaty of Tripoli which assures that \"the government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.\" The treaty was approved by the U.S. Senate and signed by President John Adams, thus making it the supreme law of the land. He was later U.S. minister to France, where he died during Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. He was a Deist.",
