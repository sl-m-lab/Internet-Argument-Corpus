   "The notion of gay marriage should be the primary motif of society. Human civilization has expanded to the point where we find it difficult for the land to support us any longer. we have become so demanding of Earth's resources, that so many in our cities starve and live in poverty. \n In the past, poverty could be solved, as humans could literally pull wealth from the soil. Continental migration, crossing the Siberian Strait, the westward movement, people moved on to new lands and obtained new natural riches. Nomads migrated, obtained new resources, and allowed old lands to regenerate. Nowadays, our population has become so vast, there is no more land to migrate towards.\n One of the fundamental purpose of the union of a man and a woman is to create progeny. But in this age, can you truly believe it good to bring more progeny unto this world? I beg to differ. \n Thereby, gay unions should be the main motif of today's society. We humans shall no longer spread like the disease we are; in a distant day becoming so vast as to devour the entire galaxy's resources. We have to end it now. What of the deer which lives in your backyard? the squirrel, the mice, the rats? Where is their right to live? We shall voluntary reduce numbers, and share the natural riches with all life which live around us.\n \n Gay marriages now. emoticon_xchicken The life of this chick is a worthy cause.",

Reproduction occurs outside of marriage and has done so long before man became civilized. \n \n Permitting only gay marriages won't decrease numbers. Increased family planning and birth control will.",
