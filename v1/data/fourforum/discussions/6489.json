This, at least as far back as the time of Paul.\n \n 1 Thess. 4:16-17 - For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.\n \n Notice the \"we\" as opposed to \"they\". Paul was talking about his generation.\n \n Rev. 1:1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; \n \n Rev. 22:12 And, behold, I come quickly; \n \n Hebrews 10:37 - For in just a very little while, He who is coming will come and will not delay. \n \n James 5:7-9 - Be patient, then, brothers, until the Lord's coming. . . You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord's coming is near. \n \n 1 Peter 1:20 - He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake. \n \n 1 Peter 4:7 - The end of all things is near.\n \n They were wrong - all of them - spectacularly wrong. Later Christian writers, quite reasonably, attempted to dance around the problem...\n \n 2pet 3:8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.\n \n Quoting the NRSV Study Bible...\n \n The best clue to the date of 2 Peter lies in 3.3-4.

   "Funny, there's a hell of a lot of Jewish scholars who disagree that the OT prophecies point to Jesus. That's kind of why they're still Jews and not Christians.\n\n \n The Book of Daniel (9:24-27) foretells when the Messiah would appear (at the time of Christ), and Genesis 49:10-11 provides a major clue also. Quite a few ancient Jewish Rabbis were aware of this timeframe for the coming of the Messiah.\n \n But for the record, were the Jews often shallow and callous regarding listening to God and his prophets? Sure they were (examples below). Why then should we expect that they would recognize and receive their own Messiah when they killed and persecuted the prophets who told them about him?\n \n Jeremiah 25:4 And though the LORD has sent all his servants the prophets to you again and again, you have not listened or paid any attention.\n \n Numbers 14:10 But the whole assembly talked about stoning them (Moses and Aaron). Then the glory of the LORD appeared at the Tent of Meeting to all the Israelites. 11 The LORD said to Moses, \"How long will these people treat me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the miraculous signs I have performed among them? \n \n 2 Chronicles 36: 15 The LORD, the God of their fathers, sent word to them through his messengers again and again, because he had pity on his people and on his dwelling place. 16 But they mocked God's messengers, despised his words and scoffed at his prophets until the wrath of the LORD was aroused against his people and there was no remedy. \n \n And there's many more examples.\n \n I also recommend they read Answering Jewish Objections about Jesus, by Dr. Michael Brown (so far a 3 work series with another due out after the first of the year).

   "I recommend people not waste their time with Trebor's intellectually dishonest website, i.e case in point:\n \n \nThe Jewish rejection of \"virgin birth\" is based on at least ten\n reasons: 1) Betulah definitely means \"virgin\" (see Leviticus 21:14- the High Priest can marry only a virgin; Deuteronomy 22:14- a groom claims he did not find betulim, signs of virginity, in his bride). Isaiah 7:14 does not use the word betulah. 2) Almah, mentioned in Isaiah 7:14, means \"young woman.\" It does not mean virgin (Proverbs 30:18-20 speaks of an adulterous almah!).\n\n \n Well first, the Hebrew word \"almah\" is used in the Old Testament a number of times, and it is evident that when this word is used, in context it always refers to a virgin. For instance, in Genesis 24:16, when Abraham's servant went to Haran in search of a bride for Isaac, the verse says, \"And the damsel was fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her..\" The word \"damsel\" is the Hebrew word \"naarah,\" meaning \"young woman.\" But that she was a virgin was also clearly stated, for in Genesis 24:43 it reads, \"Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass that when the virgin comes forth to draw water....\" Here, the Hebrew word for virgin is our word, \"almah.\" This same lady Rebekah, who was a young woman, had never intimately \"known\" any man. Therefore, she was also referred to as a virgin (\"almah\"). \"Almah,\" therefore, must refer to a young woman who is also a virgin.\n \n Second, Jewish Rabbi Radak, in his commentary on Isaiah 7:14, believes that the word almah could mean virgin: \"Elem means young boy, the male, and almah means young girl [naarah]. Could be a virgin...\" Even the Jewish Rabbi Rashi acknowledges that some Jewish translators interpret the passage to signify a highly unusual birth of some sort.\n \n Now, regarding your \"betulah\" always meaning virgin: Seems to me King Xerxes slept with your betulah's in Esther chapter 2, and they were still called \"betulah's\" even after shacking up with the king.\n \n In addition, out of the fifty or so times the word betulah occurs in the Tanakh, the NJPSV traslates it as maiden 31 times, so you have the same situation with betulah that you rant against with almah. Moreso, a betulah can be fifty or sixty years old, so you can't use that word in describing a young virgin maiden and not have it be ambiguous\n \n \n Nice try, Trebor.",

   "Trebor's Follies\n \n \n \n This is great. First you say, \"no one ever said that almah could NOT be virgin,\" and then you say, \"it does not MEAN virgin.\" Congratulations on your own contradictory mess, Trebor.\n \n \n \n So it's not the best choice for trying to convey the notion of a YOUNG MAIDEN / VIRGIN being with child (Isaiah 7:14, and the story of Rebekah). \n \n \n \n Nope, but you just learned a lesson if you can admit it.\n\n \n No, you seem to be attempting to twist the words. After all, the 'young maiden' in isaiah 7:14 is revealed in Isaiah 8:3. \n \n \n\n 8:3 And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. \n \n\n \n This is confirmed in Isaiah 8:18 in which was written\n \n\n Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion.\n \n\n \n I don't see why you can't read things in context at all? Why do you have to go skipping all over the place to try to justify your interpretation. You go anyplace BUT the surrounding text.",

My argument is that nowhere in the entire New Testament does anyone question the virgin birth. That quite impressive, IMO.

Call it whatever you want but sin is a big time topic in your religion. Salvation is mentioned over and over and over. God says, \"I will show him my salvation.\" I'm not buying your notion that it's just for physical salvation. And is there a hell? What place is it that Daniel says in your Tanakh that people will arise from their \"sleep\" in the earth - some to everlasting life and some to everlasting shame and contempt (Daniel 12:2)? What place is it where this everlasting shame and contempt occur?\n\n When Yeshua gave the account of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31) He spoke of the great gulf that divides Abraham's Bosom and hell.",
