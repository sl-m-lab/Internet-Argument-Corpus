Justanotherguy is very confusing. When I talk about cars and guns, he claims I'm going off topic, so when I try to post something about the topic, he says I'm not saying anything about cars. I'm confused what exactly I can talk about now.\n \n Daewoo, in that case the person has shown that he cannot be responsible enough to drive a car without endangering other people. Regardless of how necessary something is, if a person shows he is endangering other people, society takes away rights.\n \n What you say about schools is true, as far as it goes. I agree that school shootings were virtually unknown in the past, however they seem to be becoming more prevalent, wouldn't you agree? I have no idea why, and perhaps keeping guns out of schools will do no good whatsoever, but I would rather make getting a gun that much harder for a student who wants to gun other people down. I would deem restricting gun clubs the lesser of two evils if it means less of a risk of having a highschooler (I remember high school and can easily imagine bad feelings going overboard) having access in a disturbed frame of mind. Perhaps Jr. High to High school have become too unstable nowadays to run the risk.\n \n Personally, I'm not \"against guns\". I favor control, not outright banning. I enjoy going out into the desert and shooting at cans; it's fun. I don't really understand why people want to carry them around, concealed, but hey to each their own I guess. I just want things to be safe. That's what safety locks are for, right? ;)",

   "[QUOTE=JustAnotherGuy]\nHvozdany, I was saying that, thank you. Justanotherguy is very confusing. QUOTE]\n \n This post question is why no one is demanding that cars are banned form schools because of the many kids killed every day while driving to and from schools. Cars are not even vilified by the anti gun/gun control advocate people. This anti gun/gun control advocate person must vilify people defending guns with words like confusing. Which is confusing banning guns as the \"the lesser of two evils\" and not banning cars as \"the lesser of two evil\" because cars kill more kids then guns?\n\n \n A partial answer would be that cars are necessary for people to even get to school. Guns are not necessary for... anything, really, except killing someone.\n \n \n\n Even though gun clubs at school are not the problem this anti gun/gun control advocate defends no guns at school. This anti gun/gun control advocate does not even demand that cars be banned from schools because cars kill more kids then guns. This anti gun/gun control advocate person defends no guns at schools as \"the lesser of two evils.\" Would not \"the lesser of two evils\" be keeping kids from cars since cars kill many more kids then guns?\n \n Cars are not a necessity. The anti gun/gun control advocate defends cars because they like cars. The anti gun/gun control advocate people will overlook the high death rates of kids from cars because they like cars.\n\n \n Who says I like cars? I happen to think we should all use public transportation, but that just isn't a very viable option in our society. To do anything in our culture requires the use of a car, pretty much. \n \n Look at it this way. I favor gun control like I favor safety features in cars. I want security systems (gun locked up in the house so kids can't get at it), I want police to patrol (background checks), and various safety features on the car like airbags so no one is killed (safety locks, fingerprint ID), and I want speed limits (Gun free zones). Other misc. features as well that I can't think of right now ;)\n \n Cars are banned from schools, anyway. When was the last time someone was driving down the halls in their new Hummer?\n \n \n\n This demonstrates the absurdness of an anti gun/gun control advocate crowd when it comes to as they like to call it \"common sense.\"\n\n \n You don't like common sense? I'm sorry.",

That being said...\n \n \n \n\n \n Would not \"the lesser of two evils\" be keeping kids from cars since cars kill many more kids then guns?\n \n\n \n No, I don't think so, because the the two evils would be a lot of kids not being able to go to school or some kids getting killed in their cars. So to me, it is better to allow kids to drive, and have some deaths in cars rather than not allowing many kids to get to school.\n \n That being said, if the amount of kids being killed in cars on the way to school was completetly out of control, then perhaps such a ban should be considered..(raising the driving age, etc...)\n \n \n\n \n Cars are not a necessity.

   "AK isn't used for vermin, they're used for deer. The 7.62x39mm cartridge is a ballistic match to the old 30-30 Winchester. As for the reason of use- both ammo and firearm are relatively cheap compared to most hunting rifles. EAA even sales Saiga's (modified AKs) for sale as hunting/defense rifles here in the US. Many people take and add the pistol grips to them and even turn them into some wild custom firearms. Fact is, they're cheap ($150) and effective. The .308 model can shoot 1-2\" groups at 100 yards, perfect for large game. Something I guess Kerry can't comprehend, with his $2k over-under shotgun and all. As for ARs, they are unbelievably accurate. You should go look a some of the heavy-barrel setups, expensive (not when compared to other rifles of equal quality) but better than a lot of bolt actions accuracy wise.\n \n As for schools, I think designated and trained people should be allowed guns there for those SHTF situtations. Colleges/Universities should allow anyone who has the proper legalities sorted out to do whatever they want, since they are private institutions where people choose to go and pay money for that right. Here in KY, firearms are illegal on public school grounds, unless someone is transporting it on their way to hunt. :) Two students (ex-military) at a college in Ohio I believe, stopped a shooting because they had rifles in their vehicles and came back to hold the shooter at gun point until police arrived. Despite this, all the media reported they had 'held the shooter until police arrived'. No mention that they had used guns, yet we wonder why no one ever hears about the times firearms are used to stop crimes instead of commit them.",

So, I think that people view the gun rights advocates as uncomproming no matter what the consequences.\n I tried to keep that really brief; I hope that it makes sense. Interested in your thoughts...\n\n \n My biggest problem with the assault weapons ban is that we have spent millions of dollars on enforcement for a law that basically does nothing at all. There are still hi-cap magazines available (they are just imported rather than made in the USA), and it doesn;t seem worth it to me to spend that kind of money chasing after bayonet lugs and flash supressors (which don;t really supress flash, they just redirect it, in many cases making the shooter MORE visible). So far, there has not been any kind of evidence that the assault weapon ban has saved any lives. \n \n The other problem I have with ANY kind of anti gun legislation is that it seems like you give a little, then a little more, until there is nothing left to give. At one time, we gave away poland, and we all saw how that went.\n \n It seems to me that the way to fight crime in America is to fight the causes of crime, and I am all for this. First we need to isolate exactly WHAT the causes of crime are. There is something seriously wrong in this country. We have a BIG problem with crime, and nobody seems to be able to actually DO anything about it. I don;t think anybody really believes that gun control is going to have a significant impact on crime in this country. This flies in the face of logic. As somebody is fond of pointing out over and over again, whether it is pertinent or not, criminals do not obey gun control laws. Gun control is used so politicians can look like they are doing something, when really they are not.\n \n Until we DO address the real issues related to crime, I think it is important that Americans be able to defend themselves against criminals. I have an Uzi under my bed in a lockbox for just this purpose. It has a 32 rd magazine (there are 3 of them in the box). This is pretty serious self defense. I live in the coutry, if I call the sheriffs department in the middle of the night and they happen to have somebody on my side of the county, they can usually get to my house in about 10 minutes. The one time I called them and it was actually an emergency, it took them over a half hour to get here. During that time I held a guy at gunpoint who had broken into my shop and was attempting to steal a car. It turned out that the guy was a wanted felon.\n \n I may be a little old fashioned, but I believe that as man of the house it is my responsibility to protect my wife and my children. I take that responsibility very seriously. Over the course of the last couple huindred years, the US military has decided that the best way to win a gun battle is with some serious firepower. They have vast amounts of experience when it comes to gun battles. I am willing to take their determination at face value. Therefore, I am going to make certain that I have cnsiderable firepower should I ever have the need to defend my family against an armed intruder or intruders. It may very well be overkill, but it is better to have it and not neet it than to need it and not have it.\n \n \n As far as the whole accidental shooting thing goes, the answer to this is pretty clear. Education. Get them young and teach them well. Like I said before, I live in the country. Pretty much everybody around me is a farmer, and as far as I know every farmer in America has a gun, most have more than one. Strangly enough, the majority of accidental shootings happen in the city, not in the country where a larger maority of people own firearms. I believe this is because farm kids learn early how to handle guns. I see guys out there with 8 and 9 yr old kids all the time and the old .22. These kids know beyond the shadow of a doubt how to hadle guns safely. Many of the kids around here get their first rifle when they turn 12. \n \n People need to stop making the gun in the closet a dirty secret if they REALLY care about what is good for children. Drag that thing out and teach your kids how to handle it. Teach them how to make sure it is unloaded, let them handle it, take them out an let them shoot it. Teach them to always keep it pointed in a safe direction. You never hear about country kids playing with guns and accidentaly shooting people. It just doesn't happen. Thy see guns around at home. They have used them. They are no more interesting than the tractor, and why would you want to play with the tractor? Guns here aren't hidden, they aren't a secret. They are treated as they should be, ust like a bailer or a manure spreader. They are something that you use that is potentially dangerous (though most of the kids around here would probably argue that a bailer is more dangerous ust based on the fact that thye have most likely heard of more poeple injured or killed by a bailer than by guns).",

   "People that want gun control laws that infringe on a right have proven just to what length they will go because they cannot win the debate. Not one of the following sigma, rook, hvozdany and daewoo can answer the question this post is about so they try to change the topic.\n \n The question asked by this post is:\n This is one of the heated topics the anti gun/gun control advocates foam at the mouth about. \n \n In the past high schools had shooting clubs. In the past the R.O.T.C. programs had guns at the high schools. Did the shootings that took place at schools in the past have something to do with these programs? \n \n Of the shooting crimes at the schools that I have read about the problem was with school bullies and peer pressure from kids. Not shooting clubs and R.O.T.C. programs. \n \n Anti gun/gun control advocates have made a great effort to vilify guns and nothing to deal with this problem. In one eastern state we have seen victories by gun right defenders to get both sides of the gun issue heard. The gun right people demand that they be allowed to hand out pamphlets defending the right to have guns if the school allowed anti gun/gun control advocates to pass out pamphlets vilifying guns. The courts ruled in the gun rights favor on this issue. The anti gun/gun control advocates demanded that just their side of the issue be heard. This is typical of the hatred for a right the anti gun/gun control advocates people have for the right to bear arms.\n Not once in this question is the topic of AWs mentioned. This question was asked why do the safety Nazis use the logic of banning guns at schools because kids are killed by them. Now more kids die every day while traveling to and from schools in cars and still the safety Nazis do not demand we ban cars from schools. \n The safety Nazis cannot even argue that fact that the gun clubs once on school grounds were the problem. Still, these gun clubs were removed from the schools.\n \n The safety Nazis still have not dealt with the real problem of guns at school. The safety Nazis are the problem because they are a real example of people bulling other people when they cannot win a debate. The safety Nazis try to change the topic of the debate. Typical actions of people that bully others!",

   "People that want gun control laws that infringe on a right have proven just to what length they will go because they cannot win the debate. Not one of the following sigma, rook, hvozdany and daewoo can answer the question this post is about so they try to change the topic.\n \n\n \n I agree that we have gotten off topic, though I disagree that it is because we are all safety nazis. (half the people in this debate lately are pro-gun).\n You have to understand that these debates often to get off track, though I do thank you for bringing us back on.\n \n \n\n In the past high schools had shooting clubs. In the past the R.O.T.C. programs had guns at the high schools. Did the shootings that took place at schools in the past have something to do with these programs? \n \n\n \n No, to my knowlege they didn't. If that is your only point, then I admit that you are right. If, however, you want to debate if it is a good idea to have guns around schools, then I think that it a slightly different debate...\n \n \n \n\n Of the shooting crimes at the schools that I have read about the problem was with school bullies and peer pressure from kids. Not shooting clubs and R.O.T.C. programs. \n \n\n \n Like I said, if all that you are saying is that shooting clubs did not CAUSE Columbine, then I agree with you. I think that everyone does.\n \n \n \n\n This question was asked why do the safety Nazis use the logic of banning guns at schools because kids are killed by them. Now more kids die every day while traveling to and from schools in cars and still the safety Nazis do not demand we ban cars from schools. \n\n \n I thought that I answered this, but perhaps I didn't make my point clear. I think that comparing guns and cars is unfair because cars are necessary in our society, while shooting clubs probably are not (perhaps you disagree).\n As I thought that I said above, if it is shown that allowing kids to drive to school causes a lot of deaths, and this outweighs the benefits of allowing kids to drive to school, then yes, perhaps we shouldn't allow kids to drive to school. I thought I had talked about the cost/benefit thing before, but if I am unclear, please post, and I will try to explain myslelf in a different way.\n \n \n \n \n\n not even argue that fact that the gun clubs once on school grounds were the problem. Still, these gun clubs were removed from the schools.\n \n\n \n Again, I dont' think that anyone is saying that the gun clubs caused the shootings. I think that some fear allowing kids to access guns readily.\n \n \n\n The safety Nazis still have not dealt with the real problem of guns at school. The safety Nazis are the problem because they are a real example of people bulling other people when they cannot win a debate. The safety Nazis try to change the topic of the debate. Typical actions of people that bully others!\n\n \n :) I am sorry if you felt bullied... :)\n I apologize if you think that I was trying to change the topic on you or something...I just try to answer all the aspects of what people post, so sometimes I do probably get off track. That is, I suppose, a legitimate criticism, and I will try to stay on track more.",

In one eastern state we have seen victories by gun right defenders to get both sides of the gun issue heard. The gun right people demand that they be allowed to hand out pamphlets defending the right to have guns if the school allowed anti gun/gun control advocates to pass out pamphlets vilifying guns. The courts ruled in the gun rights favor on this issue. The anti gun/gun control advocates demanded that just their side of the issue be heard.

How many shootings occurred at how many schools that had these programs with guns? You can't just ask questions like this and call it your side of the debate. Publish some statistics.\n \n Programs like this are usually very well supervised, there is little chance of someone taking one of the weapons and going on a rampage. Even so, with the growing problem of school violence, I think it is probably best for shooting clubs to be held away from school. Actually, my school had a shooting club that met every Sat. morning at a local shooting range. It was still a school activity, however it was not held at school. The problem with this analogy is that this is really not what we are talking about in the first place. This is not the pattern of these school shootings. (and I doubt that there have been many schools within the past 10 years thay have had ROTC or shooting clubs with guns on school grounds) The most important question about school shootings is what can we do immediately to stop them from occurring, or to at least mitigate the risk as much as possible. Second, we can deal with the \"why\" are they occurring. This is when and where you deal with the bully and peer pressure issues. And one other thing about your opening lines...school shootings were not nearly as prevelent 30 years ago as they are today. Perhaps in the past it would have been perfectly fine to have guns in schools for shooting clubs and ROTC programs. Today, times are much different. \n \n Lastly, I have asked you repeatedly to stop using the phrase \"safety nazi\" when reffering to myself or anyone else on this board.

HIs definition of \"epidemic\" must be MUCH different than mine. \n \n If people want to \"protect the children\" their time would be much better spent putting bumpers on coffee tables, lids on 5 gallon buckets, child guards on ladders, and ligtning rods on their buildings, because all of these things are FAR more likly to hurt your kid than somebody bringing a gun to a school.\n \n If these folks would spend half the time they do arguing that we need to restrict guns putting those little plastic outlet guards (you know, the ones that cost $1 for a pack of ten at wal mart and less than 17% of parents can be bothered to install) into outlets, we could save some kids lives.

   "Here is a story from Freerepublic.com about airbags killing more kids then guns. Airbags are in cars and still we will not hear a demand to ban cars from schools to save just one kids life!\n \n Airbags kill more kids than school shootings. \n 1. PATRICK BEDARD\n Life with airbags has turned out very differently from the one promised by Joan Claybrook back in 1977. That's when she told Congress that those friendly balloons in every car would pillow away 40 percent of crash deaths each year. \n Last year, Dwight Childs, 29, of Broadview Heights, Ohio, screwed up. He ran a red light, resulting in a 10-mph crash. It was exactly the sort of mistake airbag supporters have always said \"you shouldn't have to die for.\" Childs's two-month-old son, Jacob Andrew, strapped into a rear-facing child seat on the passenger side of a 1997 Ford F-150 pickup, was killed by the airbag, and Childs himself was charged with vehicular homicide. \n The man's crime? He didn't switch off the airbag. \n Judge Kenneth Spanagel piled on the punishment: 180 days in jail, suspended except for two cruel and unusual days; Childs must check in to jail on Jacob's first birthday and on the first anniversary of the crash. Childs was ordered to make radio and TV ads about airbag safety for the Ohio Department of Public Safety. He was also placed on probation for three years, his license was suspended, and he had to pay $500 in fines and court costs. \n I'll boil it down for you. First, government forced this man to buy airbags, because bureaucrats in Washington know better than he what's needed for his well-being. Then, when he failed to deactivate the safety feature he was compelled to buy, it sent him to jail. Airbags have turned America's sense of justice on its head. \n Judge Spanagel and the rest of society are groping now that we've bought fully into Claybrook's promise-about $40 billion worth of airbags on the road-only to discover that it defies common sense. Remember that airbags were sold as \"passive restraints\" for Beavis and Butt-head, that layer of society so brain dead it runs red lights and can't be bothered to buckle up. \n We always knew whom we were dealing with; Beavis and Butt-head are the type who just don't get it, and they still don't. So we're making things better for them now by killing their kids? \n Of course, you and I and the folks who listen to NPR and read the Washington Post all know that kids are supposed to go in the back seat, or if you're driving a Miata or an F-150 with no back seat, then switch off the airbag. But why are we expecting Beavis and Butt-head to get it when they never got the far simpler buckle-up message? \n Dwight Childs is no Butt-head. He did almost perfectly what caring parents are supposed to do. His son was in a child seat. That seat was properly buckled into the only spot available; the truck had no back seat. His killer mistake was leaving Claybrook's friendly pillow switched on, and for that small omission, he lost his son in a low-speed crash that would have been easily survivable without an airbag. The Cleveland Plain Dealer account of the trial said Childs \"was visibly upset\" and \"unable to speak when prompted by the judge.\" \n \"I think they sentenced the wrong person,\" says Sam Kazman, general counsel at the Competitive Enterprise Institute whose first case, back in Reagan times, tried to overturn the airbag mandate then being pushed by Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole. But blaming the victim is the only defense left for a government that insists these child killers be standard equipment in every car and truck. \n Doesn't anyone notice the irony here? We live in an era in which the lowest political hacks grab for sainthood by pushing programs for \"our children.\" In his state-of-the-union address this year, President Clinton hauled out the C-word 22 times to show how caring he is. \"In memory of all the children who lost their lives to school violence, I ask you to strengthen the Safe and Drug-Free School Act, to pass legislation to require child trigger locks, to do everything possible to keep our children safe.\" \n Just a few months later, the massacre at Columbine High School pushed to the redline our national anxiety about guns. Never mind that at least 17 weapons-control laws were broken by the cold-blooded killers-anti-gunners called for still more laws. I understand their alarm. Since 1993, 82 students have been murdered in shootings at schools, according to the National School Safety Center. \n But here's a greater tragedy. During that same period, 99 children have been killed by airbag deployments, including 21 yet to be \"confirmed\" by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (one of the unconfirmed is Jacob Andrew Childs). \n You'd think a President eager \"to do everything possible to keep our children safe\" would have noticed this looming body count from a child killer more lethal than guns. Unless, that is, our society has done the unspeakable and made a deal with itself to trade off the lives of these kids to save a few adults. \n Will future generations look back at this airbag deal in embarrassment, just as President Clinton two years ago looked back from the White House at the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, which ran for 40 years starting in 1932? Black men with syphilis, 399 of them, were left untreated so that medical observations about the disease could benefit the rest of society. \n \"We can look at you in the eye,\" Clinton said in a formal apology to survivors, \"and finally say on behalf of the American people, what the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry.\" \n How many black men should society trade off to gain a syphilis cure for the rest of us? That's the shame of Tuskegee. \n How many children should we trade off so that a few adults can escape crash deaths? That's the shame of airbags. \n In his apology, Clinton made a point of saying that the Tuskegee men were used \"without their knowledge and consent.\" \n NHTSA and the safety establishment have never leveled with us about airbags, either, and they're not coming clean in the case of Jacob Andrew Childs. As part of his sentence, Dwight Childs must do airbag-safety ads on radio and TV. The script thrust on him by the Ohio Department of Public Safety has him saying, \"I made the fatal mistake of strapping my son's car seat, rear-faced, in the front seat of a vehicle equipped with a passenger-side airbag . . . don't make my mistake.\" \n No, that's not his mistake. His truck had no other seat. The trial clearly establishes not switching off the airbag as his mistake. But the script never mentions switching off. That would crack open the door to choice. Why have an airbag in the first place if it makes that seat too dangerous? No, the airbag deal has already been made by our government, and it doesn't want Beavis, Butt-head, and the rest of us to be thinking about opting out.",

   "The newspaper stories say these accidents happen when the kids are leaving or coming to school. Most if not all involve speeding.

   "Here is a story from Freerepublic.com about airbags killing more kids then guns. Airbags are in cars and still we will not hear a demand to ban cars from schools to save just one kids life!\n \n Airbags kill more kids than school shootings. \n\n \n You do realize that in your story the parent did not use the air bag correctly, correct? It is sad that he lost his child, it very definetly should not have happened. I'm willing to bet all deaths from airbags are from doing something incorrectly, despite many warnings. \n \n My car even has a sticker that cannot be removed saying that children under a certain age should not be in the front seat.\n \n And what was the point of the article? That airbags are to save those too stupid to buckleup? What a crock. They are supposed to be used in conjunction with seatbelts so you don't hit your head on the steering wheel and passengers don't hit their head on the dashboard.\n \n Let me ask you this. If they did go ahead and ban cars like you said, would you be in favor of banning guns? After all, once all those car deaths go away, your \"argument\" (I use the term loosely) falls apart.

I thought you were talking about drag racing. I was kind of going \"I didn;t think kids did that any more\"/\n \n \n \nI never said I contacted them. I just pointed out we could clear up what a &#8220;class II AND III manufacturing license.&#8221; is by contacting them and also clear up what makes a person gun dealer.\n\n \n One is for manufacturing, one for dealing. I have actually been over this with a BATF agent. He mumbled something about \"intent\". Apparently there is no really clear guideline. IMHO this is a pretty major failing of the BATF. When I contacted them originally baout his issue I simply wanted to know if I could sell a pistol I had made from scratch. THe answer I got was more or less a bug maybe. If I built it specifically to sell then NO. If I built it for personal use but later decided to sell it, then YES. IF I built 50 of them for personal use, but then ended up selling them b/c I decided I no longer wantd to keep guns, or to make some extra room in my gun vault, I would be fine. If I made a single one with the sole intention of selling it, I was looking at a trip to a federal prison. \n \n The answer to the \"owq many can you sell\" question ws mch te same, though they do allow you to buy and sell a few guns strictly as an investment or for profit. They don;t have any difinitive number in mind. THe answer I got was \"within reason\". I was unaware that \"eason\" ntered into legal matters anywhere.",
