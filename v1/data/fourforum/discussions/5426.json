The important part of your success is that you won't be in a retirement situation where looking for discounted meals, TV and cheap hotels (or a camper on on a pickup) dictate lifestyle. People say money can't buy happiness, but I still say they're not shopping at the right places. \n \n You'll soon tire of the regular business world; you know the formula, have made your mark and the actual mechanics quickly become repetition. Now that you've taken care of that, personal interests and hobbies will become far more important because you have the time and money to indulge them. And unlike business, they can be pursued or neglected at will. \n \n My wife is also my best friend and we do everything together. Retirement makes it even better as we can pursue our individual interests on a supporting basis without compromising our common interests. Truly a personal win-win situation.",

   "\n \n Either you love your wife very much, or you don't value your sanity at all. :p\n\n \n Believe me, retiring from commerce without the aid of a pension plan, government subsidy or inheritance means one left conventional definitions of sanity and structure in the dust a long time ago. Developing close, personal friendships normally isn't in that game plan as they're distractions, time consumers and quite often turn into competition. A good lover/confident/best friend to enjoy the fruits of a victory of that scope with makes it even sweeter.",

   "A actually look forward to spending more time with my wife. wE have diverse enough interests to stay out of each others hair. When our kids were born, she took 3 months maternity leave after each birth. Those 6 months (2 kids now) were the best in our marriage. She came to work with me, or I took extra time off, and we had a good time. I would not have made it far in life without my wife. She is always there, the silent majority, who keeps me from engaging in sleazy business deals and reminds me that there are more important things in life than work and money.\n \n I married my best friend, which is nice. It is equally nice that my best firned turned out to be a woman.",
