   "I've started other threads over this issue but I've never managed to get a discussion. I challenge anyone interested to discuss wether or not hardcore metal bands are misogynist. I'm talking about hardcore bands with violent themed lyrics that sometimes depict rape and mutilation, bands such as Cannibal Corpse, Slayer, one or two songs by Nile, etc.\n \n If you search the internet you will find songs by these bands that depict violence against women, along with times where their lyrics got them into legal trouble. For example, I remember an incident when Slayer was sued by a family who lost their daughter to a group of teenage boys, supposedly influenced by Slayer's lyrics. Also, until 2006 Cannibal Corpse could not play anything from their first three albums due to violent lyrics. In fact, the commercial sale of Butchered at Birth is completely banned in Australia to this day.\n \n Once again, I welcome anyone interested to try to prove that bands such as these are misogynist.",

   "Honestly, I'd say slut-pop like Kesha or the Millionaires is more degrading to women than metal is. It's one thing when a guys sings about violence against women to an audience of guys. It's different when a half-naked women prances around on stage orally advertising herself. I also find slut-pop more problematic, since it's targeted towards a younger, generally more impressionable audience.\n \n BTW, virtually all slut-pop stars are utterly talentless.\n\n \n Certainly that type of performance glorifies sex and objectification to impressionable girls, but whether this is a 'good' thing or 'bad' thing is not really something I'm able to say. It just is.",

   "I'm not sure you understand what a strawman argument is :-\\\n\n \n Intentionally twisting what your opponent says to make it sound like they're making a point that they're not trying to make.\n \n \nSo now it's no longer that \"hardcore metal bands aren't misogynist\", and is instead \"only some hardcore metal bands are misogynist\"?\n \n \n It was always \"Metal bands aren't misogynist in general.\" The majority of bands in Black Metal, Power Metal, and Folk Metal for example, don't put much of an emphasis on violent lyrics. In those genres, if violence is mentioned, it's normally not elaborated on too much and is often abstract. Alot of Blackened Death Metal bands and Death Metal bands don't have violent lyrics. Melodic Death Metal bands normally mention much graphic violence. Alot of Grindcore and Deathgrind sing about political issues, or evil. The part of Metal that has more of a tendency to make violent lyrics would be some Brutal Death Metal and Goregrind. That's only a small part of Metal.\n \n To say that Metal in general is misogynist because of a few Goregrind lyrics is absolutely retarded, and to say that violent lyrics prove that the band members themselves are misogynist is very questionable, at best.\n \n \nNot really honest to try to downplay what they're doing now that you see that the logical conclusion is that the band members are misogynist.\n\n \n You're claiming victory already? I suppose you could also conclude they're misandrist, using the same logic. Once again, they're so misogynist that they have wives and families. I guess by looking at most Black Metal bands, you could also conclude that Metal in general is Satanist. In fact, here's a list of things that you could conclude metal in general is, based on lyrics: \n [*]Satanist[*]Misogynist[*]Misandrist[*]Anarchist[*]Odinist[*]Anti-Christian[*]Liberal[*]Conservative\n \nI caught your words fairly. You said: That's exactly what alot of it is. A middle finger to feminists\n\n \n No s***, Sherlock. Alot doesn't mean \"most\" or \"the majority.\"\n \n \nAnd that's really not the only evidence. The callusness inherent in using rape and violence against women as entertainment is callusness toward the plight of women.\n\n \n It's not evidence of misogyny at all, unless we assume that musicians don't have a life off-stage.\n \n \nThis is very anti-woman in nature and can entitle them to be called misogynist.\n\n \n See the list above.\n \n \nYou're putting words in my mouth. \"Supports\" or \"advocates\" is not part of my argument.\n\n \n If the band members are misogynist, then they would have to have negative opinions towards women.\n \n \nCertainly Leno seeks to trivialize when he makes jokes about something. You can't make something funny and take it seriously at the same time, generally. If the oil leak were killing hundreds of thousands of people he would likely see some backlash. If you'll notice, there are not a whole lot of jokes about rape and violence against women.\n \n\n \n So Jay Leno doesn't take the oil leak seriously then, in his personal life? Because for a band member to really be misogynist, they would have to have some sort of anti-woman attitude they express on stage. They're so misogynist that they have wives and families. XD\n \n \nYou're saying that these bands have to sing about rape and violence against women to be taken seriously as metal bands.\n\n \n Now you're putting words in my mouth. Just look at Nile, Suffocation, Brutal Truth, Rotten Sound, Agoraphobic Nosebleed, Goatwhore, a good number of songs by Deicide, etc. They normally (with a few exceptions) don't mention violence against women or violence in general. Yet they're serious bands.\n \n \nThen I say you have to be a certain type of person to want to get into that scene, as a band or a listener, if you have to sing about rape and violence against women. The evidence suggests that everyone involved have a negative view of women.\n\n \n See above. I also notice you keep changing your point.\n First it's \"some Metal has misogynist content.\"\n Then it's \"Metal in general has misogynist content.\"\n \"Metal bands are misogynist.\"\n \"Metal musicians are misogynist.\"\n \"Anyone who listens to Metal is misogynist.\"\n \n BTW, does that include women who listen to Metal? XD\n \n Make up your mind already.\n \n \nThe point I was making, however, was that songs that glorify drugs and violence exists, even if I don't know whether the bands you cite glorfies these things. Existence trancends genre boundaries.\n\n \n So violent rap lyrics help to prove that Metal is misogynist? emoticon_confused",
