   "WASHINGTON - The dispute over Indiana's voter ID law that is headed to the Supreme Court in January is as much a partisan political drama as a legal tussle. \n \n On one side are mainly Republican backers of the law, including the Bush administration, who say state-produced photo identification is a prudent measure intended to cut down on vote fraud. Yet there have been no Indiana prosecutions of in-person voter fraud - the kind the law is supposed to prevent.\n \n On the other side are mainly Democratic opponents who call voter ID a modern-day poll tax that will disproportionately affect poor, minority and elderly voters - who tend to back Democrats. Yet, a federal judge found that opponents of the law were unable to produce evidence of a single, individual Indiana resident who had been barred from voting because of the law.\n\n \n In Georgia, one need only contact the county registrar's office to receive a free voter ID card.\n \n Seems to me that this is a reasonable measure to prevent voter fraud. \n \n Your thoughts?",

   "In Georgia, one need only contact the county registrar's office to receive a free voter ID card.\n \n Seems to me that this is a reasonable measure to prevent voter fraud. \n \n Your thoughts?\n\n I largely agree. Voter ID cards should be the easiest way to reduce fraud, but they'd have to be free.\n \n How does one confirm their identity to the registrar's office in order to receive said card? Is there a reasonable and free system in place for this, or would this just relocate the fraud from the polls to the ID requests?\n \n The biggest legal problem I can see is that people who are less responsible might misplace their cards and then be deprived of their right to vote. While I personally think that people irresponsible enough to lose their voter ID cards should simply suffer that consequence (after all, if they don't keep up with their cards, why should I believe they've kept up with the race?), I don't think the Constitution works that way.",
