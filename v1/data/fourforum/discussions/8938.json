   "Julia Timoshenko is more of an ageing star celebrity doing her best to stay popular with the public. Following the failure at the parliamentarian elections she is definitely not a popular female politician celebrity in Europe. She needed huge PR action badly. And she did it on the sponsor money of longstanding buddy Boris Berezovsky (former Russian tycoon). The opening performance of a new theatre in Potsdam was named just this way 'Julia Timoshenko'. \n One more play political this time was set by creative Julia in Ukraine itself under the title of 'Shadow Government' (the sponsor is rhe same I guess). The aim was again PR clearly. It is meant to prepare cadre to lead Ukraininas to the radiant future. If they trust Ukraine's fate to Timoshenko they will live up to see it but only on the scene again I'm scary. Real politics and life is not Youlia's domain.",
