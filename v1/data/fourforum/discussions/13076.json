Notwithstanding the ethics of running ads against private citizens on national TV, lets look at it from the standpoint of CNN's Legal Dept., I'm sure they told the powers that be to be prepared for a hefty lawsuit. What's interesting though is that the left now needs to 'attack' the insurance companies (of course, Congress and the like won't be switching their coverage out of the private sector). What's wrong? Is the plan unable to stand on its own merits? Actually, who knows since no one's going to take the time to read it.....\n \n Christ, they're giving Obama unlimited time to have his, UNOPPOSED, town meetings (the town meetings for the rest of congress will have opposition and I think I can hear the wheels in their heads turning as they're confronted with the reality of the electorate's mood. I think healthcare isn't gonna make it on this go around. Maybe during his second term he could try again.",
