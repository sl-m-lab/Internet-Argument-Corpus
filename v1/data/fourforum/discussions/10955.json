So they aren't going to allow government to \"get out of the marriage business\", though government was in it long before Christian churches butted in.\n \n I'd prefer the churches to butt out, but in the end, I only care that secular government treats its citizens without favoritism for religious faith. If everyone agreed on that redefinition of \"marriage\" to mean exclusively a religious as opposed to secular partnership, and government did not give such a religious ceremony special status, then while I'd sniff and sneer at the religious homophobia that made such shenanigans necessary, ultimately it would be no skin off my nose.\n \n So if we can, let's sell marriage to the churches!

   "Whatever. emoticon_rolleyes I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill here, but that's up to you.\n\n \n I never implied it was an earth-shattering observation.\n But quite frankly, it's just as much of a mole-hill as the \"but they really believe that\" riff you got going on...\n \n \n \nI don't quite understand your point here. Care to elaborate? Why would you start with the idea that people aren't being honest with their intentions?\n\n Quite frankly, from just plain experience.\n \n How many bigots have you met who will actually state \"I'm a bigot!\"?\n Most will detail why they don't believe in Group X having equal rights, or explain why they are inferior...\n \n I can't tell you how many people I've come across who CLAIM they are for equality for _____, but then they have a TON of qualifiers for areas where their \"beliefs\" are just plain not living up to their claim.\n Like the legality of sodomy for example. I have run across a variety of people who want it to be illegal, but they will REFUSE to realize where that opinion places them. emoticon_wow \n \n And furthermore, quit with the pretense that we are \"starting\" with the idea that somebody isn't being honest.\n \n \n \nI see no reason to think all these people don't really believe what they're saying about gay people. Are you telling me you think these anti-gay people that say gays are evil and bad actually believe gays are good and NOT bad?\n\n Speaking of \"being honest\"...\n Were we talking ANYTHING about the hyperbolic strawman you just threw out there?\n No.\n \n This issue is more about people who say \"We want to protect marriage\", but then their actions do NOTHING to protect marriage, but rather fixate on being anti-gay.\n I saw a picture of a bunch of people holding up signs that said \"Protect the Children\".\n Do you know where they were? They were sitting in a town meeting regarding EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION PROTECTION based on sexual orientation.\n What the %@#$ does that have to do with \"protecting the children\"?\n \n Whether they are consciously lying to others, or unwittingly lying to themselves, they are just plain wrong.\n And the fact that they may \"believe\" only separates them between lying and foolishness.\n If you want to quibble that they should be considered more as fools than liars, then I guess that's your molehill. emoticon_xagree",
