Casinos like them because of the predictability of cash flow and earnings. All revenue in a casino is based on square footage and no table game can compare to slot per square foot revenue. \n \n The big table game is baccarat. Even the largest casinos can have quarterly earnings spiked up or destroyed by baccarat play. To provide an example, $100,000 USD baccarat plaques (chips) are common, as are $1,000,000+ bets. $25,000,000 losses and winnings by a single player are not uncommon. I haven't been to Macao since the large casinos were constructed, but I've been told bets made there by newly wealthy mainland Chinese boggle the mind.

Video poker is the most common local addiction, a $1 machine bets from $1-50 USD at each push of a button, with a $5/bet being the most common default. Assume 20-seconds a bet to play the hand and a loser is quickly in big trouble at $900/hr. $.025 machines are the most common, but that's still $1.25/hand every 20-seconds, $225/hr. Few retirees on fixed incomes or working people can absorb much of that. Remember that one is in a desert where summer temps are in excess of 110-degrees and outdoor pursuits including golf aren't all that attractive. Throw in air conditioned comfort, free drinks, free food (and whatever other diversion, all are readily available) and the gambler's dream of 'hitting the big one' for a recipe guaranteed to influence many people to part with their money. \n \n Equity loans are very popular in Las Vegas as a means to gambling destruction. And loan sharking is still an honored profession, complete with collection agents who show little mercy. Seemingly every corner has 'loans on vehicles or paycheck' at interest rates which defy ever repaying the principal. Due to the nature of the primary Las Vegas industry, passing a bad check, any amount, is an instant felony. All the merchant has to do is deliver a returned check to the district attorney's office where a warrant is immediately issued and criminal charges actively pursued. Not a place for the weak or idealism.",

   "The \"4-2\" rule is a decent rule of thumb.\n \n First estimate your \"outs\" or cards that you think will assure you the best hand (this is actually pretty variable on how many player there are remaining as well as the weight of there bets etc., but thats a different post.)\n \n For example. You are playing KJs hearts\n \n The flop is\n \n Ad Qs 5c\n \n With a few people in, its reasonable to say you have 4 outs. On the turn a K or J isn't that grand considering the high odds that somebody has an A (or Q) granted they've called the big blind. Also, the odds that you'll get running spades are pretty small. Your 4 outs are the four 10's presumably in the deck that would give you a straight (they might be in your opponents hands, but you can only work off what you know). \n \n The odds determination is the tricky part... the 4-2 rule is extremely simple. For your chances of getting your out on the turn or the river... just multiply your outs by 4. Once the turn card is down (possibly giving you more outs) multiple them by 2 for your chance of landing one on the river. After the flop you have about a 4*4 = 16% chance of hitting any 10. Or an 8% chance of getting one on the river if you haven't seen it yet.\n \n The 4-2 rule will but you within a few percentage points of the actual odds.",
