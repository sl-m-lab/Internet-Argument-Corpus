Many people from different views, religions, sexual orientations, nationalities, economic levels, and educational backgrounds. No one should be asking anyone to leave.

Anyway, you missed my MAIN point, and that is that the Lefties only want to be here when it goes THEIR way...don't you think that childish? Do you really think that's Patriotic? When your country needs you most, you run because it doesn't go YOUR way? Maybe in the PC world Patriotism fits into your neat, convenient definition, but not in reality. Oh, and don't give me this \"diversity makes us stronger BS\"! What REALLY makes us strong is people from other countries coming here who want to be AMERICAN, no hyphenations...THAT is what made us strong in the early 1900's, immigrants who made their kids speak English and didn't demand another language in the school, among many other things",

These far-left people are saying that if they can't have things their way (which many gays like you sound like), they will go to Canada. I just extend the offer to them to please move. We really don't need people in this country who feel like they deserve anything they want, and if they can't get it they will move.

You can't win every election or get everything you want, and threatening to commit suicide or move somewhere else is childish and uncalled for.\n \n Sometimes your gayness supercedes any of your logic.",
