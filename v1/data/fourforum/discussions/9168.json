Since she seems to be against my family I am against her. Since she wants to use her religious beliefs against me I want to do away with her religious freedom.",

I want them to have a taste of their own medicine. I want justice. I want them to realize that their actions effect other people. If they are going to use their religious beliefs to define my life then I want a say in whether those religious beliefs should exist or how they should be implemented. I see and hear them talk as if we gay people don't exist. That we are not americans. That their religious beliefs are the only ones that matter. I am sick of hearing statements like the one that sick evil women I quoted made.",
