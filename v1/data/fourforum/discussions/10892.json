   "OK, I've got one that I think everyone can hate for one reason or another. However, in addition to being universally hated, I also happen to think that this plan for fixing the Illegal Immigration problem could actually work.\n First, to prevent the issue from having to be addressed again in the future, a border fence both physical and technological with patrols and monitors to prevent ingress from both above and below. \n After the fence is in place, an offer is made to those that are here in the country illegally. They can chose two options.\n \n 1. Volunteer to go back to their country of origin and they will receive a one time payment of $6000.00 per adult and $1500.00 for child. Many of them come here to save up this kind of money and it is their goal to leave after saving this anyway.\n 2. If they don't want to leave, they can register to stay provided they\n a. pay back taxes.\n b. pay a fine\n c. learn English and serve a probationary period to show they can support themselves and commit no crimes.\n \n I believe this will help address the problem of integration, prevent the US from spending scads of money in future entitlements and chain migration, bring people into the system and make them part of the economy and tax base. \n What do you think?",

I'm not sure what the loophole is but I'd like to read the discussion....\n\n \n \n Here.\n \n Was a side discussion in economics about 3 days ago.\n \n It's not really a loophole but can be exploited if you know how to manipulate the system.\n For example, Mr and Mrs John Doe have 4+ kids and each make about 16K each. Not a whole lot. \n If they are 'married' and file together, they get a return on 32k with deductions. The EIC tops out at 2 kids. If they are seperated or not legally married or even divorced. They could file as such and claim 2 kids each...at the ~$16k figure...each claiming the 2 kid max for EIC.\n From the forms I'm looking at, that could net them close to 3* as much return in freebies (close to $10k total). Plus, being poor, they'd get all their FICA back or have a 0 liability.\n So, rather than truely rewarding the good ole fashioned nuclear family for the poor, the system rewards the seperation of such. \n This pretty much works only for large families...but, the sterotype of the Hispanic is often such.\n I'm sure you could sit down and figure out exactly what the perameters are for this.\n \n The jist of my arguement in the economics thread was to dispell the notion that illegals have to pay FICA and the only reason they do is often because of ignorance of how it works. Adding on to the premis that if the illegals were ever to file legal tax returns they'd be taking massive amounts of money out of the 'system' many supporters claim they put into.\n \n If they think pulling out medical and school 'resources' from the US system is bad, I wonder if they have thought about them giving 0 fica and taking $3k+ a year per adult from the pot too.\n \n I'm 100% in favor of increasing the numbers of legal immigrants here. An advanced worker visa program or similar would be okay.\n I'm NOT in favor of amnesty as most would become the above working poor and a further drain on the system.",

I found information on one. Just One. And he was killed by drug smugglers, not your average Jose and Maria looking to find some work. \n \n How much time have you spent on the border? How many illegals do you know? I lived for years in Santa Fe, NM and I went through the immigration process when bringing my now ex-husband here. It took three years and some strong arm tactics from my state senator to make it happen - and we had a son. My dad married a woman from Finland and it took three weeks - no kids involved. \n \n Yes - they need to come over legally. But we need to clean up the way we operate at our southern border and they way we treat those who are trying to get here legally. The reason there are so many illegals is that we make near impossible to get here legally. We also need to practice what we preach. We break as many laws in Mexico as illegals break here - only in our case its entire corporations that do it. We have no moral high ground.\n \n Most illegal immigrants come here because they are in poverty, living under a corrupt government and they want a better life.

It's not the 'poor huddled masses' that shoot at the agents. That is true. But it is the coyotes that bring them across, the drug cartels, AND corrupt elements of the Mexican Army! There have been many stand offs and even some fire fights. They also set wildfires to draw attention away from certain areas. \n \n You also talked about human rights abuses, 117 from 88-90. Let me PROMISE you, that is about the DAILY amount of abuses perpetrated by the coyotes and others against there own people. And that's not even scratching the surface of what the Mex. Army, Police, and other officials do, both at the border and on the routes bringing people through Mexico. As far as I'm concerned, we are Awesome in that regard.\n I don't blame them for wanting a better life. Not one bit. And there are many who come and contribute beautifully to our country. However, there are S. Loads that come, believing everyone here has three BMW's in the garage, and swimming pools in there back yards. They have NO qualms about ripping off the tax payers and citizens anyway possible. Though my wife, I see it a lot. She gets SOOOO Mad :xbanghead :xcensored at the people who come here and give the rest a bad name. I wish they were all like my wife, but the sad fact is that many aren't. As long as there are large groups of people who don't care one wit about our country except for what they can 'get out of it', without giving anything back, there will be citizens who are upset about it.\n Nobody is going to believe this but I picked up a hitch hiker on the way over here (to the coffee shop I'm at. He said that he can't get work like he used to because a lot of 'undocumented worker' have flooded the job market. His name is Carl and he does house framing (or just framing, I'm not knowledgeable about the construction industry. He called himself a framer). Anyway, I gave him my card and told him if he and his wife need to pick up some hours this summer I'd see what I can do by giving him some condos to clean. His wife and kids are still I'm MD living with his brother, because he can't make enough to bring them down here and get their own place because the job market is flooded and wages when he does get work are suppressed....",

When PAN wins an election they fire almost 100% of the gov. workers and replace them with PAN workers. If PRI wins next time, they do the same thing. Very few people are willing to sacrifice for the country. Hell, very few are willing to NOT defraud the country. When people say they are 'Victims' of the corrupt govt., well it's hard to feel sorry, since the same 'Victims' from this year will be the perpetrators after the next election...\n\n \n I am not here to defend their government.\n \n \nBY THE WAY JITOBEAR;I just got home and according to my wife and sister in law, both Mexicans, Your quote\n \n Tiene una esposa de Mexico y viviste alla y nunca anprendo la lengua? Camine en Mexico despues 8 an la noche sin problemas. Posible eres un cabron?\n \n Is not correct Spanish-emoticon_xgood emoticon_xdonno LOL\n\n \n I believe it. I am seriously out of practice.

They can chose two options. \nA fence would not solve the problem or keep it from returning.\n \n First we need to clearly understand why we have such a problem at our Mexican border...a problem that does not exist...to near the extent that it does here...anywhere else in the world. There are few fences between other countries. They do not need them either.\n \n We have a country full of poverty-stricken people (Mexico), just across the river from a country of great wealth and opportunity to escape poverty (U.S.A.).\n \n For the poor of Mexico, there is no escape within their country. There is a great divide between the masses and the ruling rich that will never go away because of the corruption and illegalities that are permitted and even backed by their government. I don't blame the poor Mexican's for wanting to come to the U.S.A.\n \n However, you build fences, you will be wasting money. They will tunnel under, they will die in the unventilated trailers they are told will take them to the promised land for a few thousand dollars each, they will still find a way to cross the fence and trek across desert areas only to die of exposure.\n \n The fence idea is not good.\n \n What they do in other countries is to arrest people and deal with them through legal processes including deportation, fines, etc. Why, they even do that in dear old Mexico.\n \n \n\n 1. Volunteer to go back to their country of origin and they will receive a one time payment of $6000.00 per adult and $1500.00 for child. Many of them come here to save up this kind of money and it is their goal to leave after saving this anyway.\nThat's about as stupid a thing as I've heard all day...pay them to go home?!? They'd only return for another handout.

It's not against the law to not speak English. It's not required of legal immigrants to learn English (that I know of)...being able to support one's family and remaining crime free are not required for existing citizen's to remain here...why should it be required of illegals?\n \n \n Your plan is greatly flawed.\n \n We've let this Mexican border/illegal alien problem go ignored for so long now that we have a tremendous problem in dealing with the ones that are already here. There are MILLIONS of them. Many of them are hard working honest people who truly want to make a better life for themselves. Many of them are worthless, alcholics, criminals and in general UNDESIRABLE people who do nothing more than terrify others.\n \n I think it's been mentioned here already that 25 people PER DAY die in the US at the hands of ILLEGAL ALIENS. That's about 9000 people per year...(and Hillary wants to give them all driver's licenses (SO THEY CAN VOTE FOR HER AND OTHER WORTHLESS LIBERALS).\n \n The criminals should be deported. The borders should be sealed to the extent possible and all new \"crossers\" caught should be sent right back home.\n Those that have been here for years and worked hard and stayed out of legal trouble should be allowed to stay and apply for citizenship just like the MILLIONS of other people who have successfully gone through that process.\n \n A short-cut to citizenship should not exist.\n \n Whatever is done should be within the law. If the laws are not to be observed, they should be removed from the books.\n \n There are some local law enforcement agencies who have developed the skills and procedures required to start deportation proceedings against illiegal alien criminals and they are doing just that....sending them back! The Mexican government is complaining about it. Praise the Lord for the Cobb County Sheriff.\n \n All you bleeding hearts who take up universally for the illegal aliens should listen to the stories of the people who live in neighborhoods that have been torn apart by the worthless bastards who choose to obey no laws. Talk to women who have been raped by them...talk to people who have lost family members to a drunk driving illegal alien. I'm sure your can understand why these people might wonder what the hell we're doing just letting these ILLEGAL aliens continue to stream across the border AND STAY HERE!!",

Whatever method you choose to identify the ones who've been here once, they will figure out how to defeat...even if it means burning off their fingerprints.\"\n \n There would be a DNA data base as well as a reward system for those that chose to 'pay to stay'. The penalties would be made clear when they signed the agreement to receive the money in the first place, loss of property here and in Mexico, jail, deportation of the offender and family, etc... You must give them a reason to go home--I'm talking solutions not \"the stupidest thing I ever heard...\" How are you going to get them to volunteer Einstein? The reason MOST of them come here is to make enough money to go home, buy land, build a house or start a business. A one time payment from us is MUCH cheaper than welfare, earned income tax credits, E.R. visits, car accidents, overburdened schools etc... So I'm sorry for being so freakin stupid. Just TRYING to come up with a solution...\n \n \n As far as the fence not stopping all of them..\n \n That is true. However, it would make things very much harder. Coyotes used to cost under $1000, now it is sometimes over $5K. The harder it is, the more prohibitively expensive... and BTW- when the Mex. army finds illegals in their country they rape and sometimes even enslave them for years on end. Its a picnic here compared to the torture that happens to Guatemalans and Salvadorians and etc...\n \n \n Einstein Jim then said,\n \"a.

We could figure out a good average. One condition of their probation would be not lying on this kind of thing. If they got caught, they'd put their visa in jeopardy.\n B. So what, if you can't get them to follow the law.....Duh.\n \n C. They are under NO obligation to follow the rules. If they don't want to they can take the money and go HOME. We should only let people in that are beneficial to our country i.e. can support themselves and be crime free. WHO's the idiot now. You want us to let in anyone? Your MIND is FLAWED! It should be required because THEY want something from US, you smarty! They must be willing to follow the rules or they shouldn't be allowed to come.\n DO YOU WANT TO FIND A SOLUTION OR NOT? DO YOU THINK YOU'LL EVER GET AGREEMENT TO LET IN ANYONE TO BE CRIMINALS ON WELFARE. USE YOUR BRAIN.\n MY Plan allows those who don't give a S#@T about this country to take some money and go home (good riddance). Those that truly want to stay and ADD something and are willing to put their money and hard work where their mouth is can stay and we get the best ones. The other's can go rot.

Didn't expect that did ya? Are you always this right about every subject you tackle? Why would you assume I want to see people get shot? And why the personal attacks, Jimbo? From your first post here you insulted me. Why not stick with the plan. YOU don't like the wall. Fine say so. But...\n \n The wall is part of the plan because that is a caveat made necessary by the about 55-60% of the population that demands it as part of ANY comprehensive immigration plan. Tell me, how do you expect to get anything done, Psychic Jim, if you have 55% of the against it from the get go because it doesn't include some sort of wall or fence? Well? Status Quo? How do you get anything done if over half won't support it without one certain stipulation? You see Jimbo, to get anything done requires that people support it. I plainly stated in the beginning that there are elements that both sides will \n \n Well? Status Quo? I don't think so cause Jimbo says...\n We need a legal wall that keeps illegal aliens from earning any money to send back home. \n \n We have that now, brother. How's it workin'?\n \n Jim then said.....\n We need a legal wall to keep them from driving in the US. \n We have that now buddy. When they get caught they get a ticket or a bit of jail time. How's that working, Jim? \n As long as they are HERE they will drive. What's your plan for getting them to leave? \n Let's find out what Jim said next, shall we...\n We need a legal wall to deport criminals speedily so that their financial burden is shifted back to Mexico where it belongs. \n \n Well, what could possibly be faster than them volunteering. (Normally I'd capitalize that, but I'll try to give you credit for understanding its importance)\n \n OK, Jim give me another....\n \"We need a legal wall top prevent anchor babies and payments to their parents being made out of our funds.\" \n \n Again, if they've left the country on there own, where will the Anchor babies come from, Jim???\n \n This is fun, what's Jim got for me now?\n We need a legal wall to pressure the Mexican government into discouraging instead of encouraging illegal border crossings. \n Not gonna happen brother. The money that comes back from here is the only reason they haven't risen up in revolt against the corrupt govt.\n \n Next.....\n \"We need a legal wall to allow guest workers to cross the border, report to authorities and go back to Mexico on a regular basis without citizenship and voting privileges.\"\n \n Well, we've got that Jim. There are lots of guest worker programs. But do you really think most people will be willing to discuss this before the rest of the problems are sorted out?\n \n Hit me one more time...........\n \"We don't need a block wall like the Soviets used to squash freedoms within what used to be a perfectly beautiful city.\"\n I too,wish it wasn't so. But I also live in the real world and anyway I think I addressed this earlier.\n \n And finally Jim closes with....\n \"We don't need your petty, adhominem, adolescent attacks.\" \n \n I believe it was you who started with how stupid I am and etc... in your first post in this thread and finished with me wanting to see my wife shot in the back, so I don't know what to tell ya on that one, buddy....\n \n Any other questions?emoticon_cool",

I'm not even disturbed.\n \n China built a great wall for keeping out hordes of invading soldiers. It worked for them. They were isolationist and relatively unadulterated from hundreds of years.\n \n The Soviets built a short wall to keep people from leaving their failing socialistic area...one that was given them in the spoils of war. They were being oppressive.\n \n We are not isolationists and we accept immigrants, assimilate (sp) them into our society and make attempts at protecting them from unlawful things. Our mistake has been permitting the southern border to be a passageway for hordes of people who have no intention of obeying our laws or paying taxes to enjoy the services of our goverment. Building a wall will not solve that problem. Building a wall is a negative thing to do and would create more animosity between the fine people of two countries.\n \n We can slow the flow of illegals to a miniscule rate compared to what it is now and we can enforce laws against criminal illegals and we can send their asses back...the criminal ones that is. We don't need to worry as much about those who are not breaking the laws. They are productive people and should be candidates for citizenship...to be obtained in a legal, prescribed manner that does not include amnesty.\n \n My first step in fighting the illegal immigrant problem would be to streamline the deportation of those who break the law. The only glitch I see so far is the necessity to suspend the right to trial and proof of guilt for those arrested. However, I do believe that those rights should be extended only to citizens and legal aliens within the US. Illegal aliens, when discovered by any means, but especially for arrest for any infraction of the rules should be escorted to their native countries...skip the trial (unless it's for murder, rape and a few other biggies)...just send them home.",

   "Jim's Trucking said...\n \n \"We are not isolationists and we accept immigrants, assimilate (sp) them into our society and make attempts at protecting them from unlawful things. Our mistake has been permitting the southern border to be a passageway for hordes of people who have no intention of obeying our laws or paying taxes to enjoy the services of our government. Building a wall will not solve that problem. Building a wall is a negative thing to do and would create more animosity between the fine people of two countries.\"\n \n \n As I said before, do not ever expect help on the southern border from the Mexican Govt. Their economy depends on the money sent back from here.\n \n As to the fence(or whatever obsticals), if you want to cheaply stop people from walking in there are only so many options. To stop someone from coming in along a 2 dimensional border is infinitely simpler and cheaper than chasing them all over the county in 4 dimensions. Will it stop all illegals, heck no. But when has a pound of cure Ever been better than an ounce of prevention? I've never found that to be the case.emoticon_cool",

   "I'd like to see how you guys propose we keep those mexicans from coming over to this country WITHOUT a fence. The border is too wide to patrol with simple guards, we need a way to bottleneck them so we can focus on key specific areas that'll make it easier for our guys to catch them and prosecute them.\n \n If we can't catch them then we sure as hell can't do anything to them. Meanwhile they're free to continue killing our border guards and trucking in more illegal immigrants, and we're left without options because people say a fence won't do anything, when a fence is the one and only thing we haven't tried yet!",
