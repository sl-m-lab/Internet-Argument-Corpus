   "That's an interesting point, Sybiote, that the right to an abortion is dependant upon the sanctity of life. I can understand the idea that if a person has a right to their own body, then to murder that person would be infringing on that right.

A right is by definition a choice, as so if one has a right to their own body, it is their own right to destroy it, thus destroying their own life. how can ones right to ones own body necessitate the sanctity of life if it gives a person the right to destroy life?\n \n Furthermore, and to the point: if a woman has the right to her own body, and a baby is a part of her body, then it is her right to do with it as she wishes. This is not because her life is sacred, but because her body is her own to control. I think, the point we are really disagreeing on here is that I believe a persons right to have control over their own body is their right naturally, and it dose not depend on the mystical idea that life is sacred.

   "I believe that killing a baby post birth violates its right to its own body. However, letting a baby die post birth that you don't wish to care for dose not violate said babies right to its own body. And finally: I am comfortable with killing a baby post birth as an act of mercy (euthanasia) as an alternative to just letting it die. To give you some background on that concept, it's a position I picked up when I watched a TV documentary about Julianna Wetmore who was \"born without a face.\" If I were to be the parent of a baby that would require a lifetime of constant medical attention to barely cling to its painful life I wouldn't want to be legally obligated to keep it alive.\n \n Also, you said:\n \n \"So for example if I say \"you are a part of my body, and therefore I have a right to kill you\", is this simply a matter of ideology?\"\n \n Yes, that is a matter if ideology, and your ideology would be wrong.\n \n What you would be trying to say when you claim that I was a part of your body under those circumstances, I don't know, but I would certainly disagree that I was a part of your body, unless you had a very compelling argument. And even if you were to convince me of that, I would most likely have an even harder time being convinced that you have a right to kill me.\n \n My point is just that it's a matter of interpretation. That the baby is a part of the woman, that they are separate beings, or that the woman is a part of a fetus are all just interpretations of the woman and fetus. As I see it, the baby, while it is being produced by the woman, is a part of her body, and producing life is a function of a body. I interpret it that way, because the baby is being built (its not building itself) by the body of the woman. Post birth, I agree that it is separate and distinct, its building itself (and probably has been even before birth, come to think of it) but it is not independent yet. It still requires care, or it will die. If it is left to die, its right to its own body is not being infringed upon.",

   "That's an interesting point, Sybiote, that the right to an abortion is dependant upon the sanctity of life. I can understand the idea that if a person has a right to their own body, then to murder that person would be infringing on that right. But is that really the same as claiming that life is absolutely sacred? A right is by definition a choice, as so if one has a right to their own body, it is their own right to destroy it, thus destroying their own life. how can ones right to ones own body necessitate the sanctity of life if it gives a person the right to destroy life?\n \n Furthermore, and to the point: if a woman has the right to her own body, and a baby is a part of her body, then it is her right to do with it as she wishes. This is not because her life is sacred, but because her body is her own to control. I think, the point we are really disagreeing on here is that I believe a persons right to have control over their own body is their right naturally, and it dose not depend on the mystical idea that life is sacred. What I mean when I say that I have never heard a good argument for the sanctity of life, is that I do not intuitively believe it to be necessary that life holds this mystical sanctity, and I haven't been convinced that it dose.\n\n All of this is moot because you think a baby can be killed after birth anyway.",

   "you are avoiding the issue here shake.\n \n is it the case that abandoning someobdy who cant live on its own is absolutely moraly wrong, by virtue of an absolute moral prinsiple - or do you feel differantly about it in some cases than you do in others?\n \n your arguemnt claims to be based in absolutes that are in reality arbitrary and made up - you say if you are uncomfortable with some abandonments then you are uncomfortable with all abandonments - you say that if i think its ok to abandon a hopless child then i must think its ok to toss two year olds in the dumpster\n \n my arguemnt is that if it is true that this absolute rule existed then abandoning a hopless child and tossing a two year old in the dumpster is exactly the same crime and would warrent the same punishment.

Symbiote successfully argued though, that who is part of who's body is not really that important - the important thing is justifying that abortion is abandonment and that abandonment is ok.\n \n I currently face the problem that I feel as though abandonment is ok in some circumstances, but I am not comfortable with it in others. I'm not sure how to deal with that, interestingly; nobody has really questioned me effectively on that. I guess a good question to address that would be- when is it ok and when isn't it? my answer would be that it would depend on the situation.\n \n Its been argued that that there must be an absolute rule about this that says either abandonment is always ok or always not ok. you have offered no justification that this rule must exist short of something to the effect of \"I have about two and a half pounds more logic than you do so you must be silly.\" I have responded to your insistence on such a rule though with several scenarios meant to illustrate my feeling that it just doesn't seem right to always consider it exactly the same thing.",
