Do you support blatant ignorance and hate as freedom of speech?\n \n Lev\n\n \n Yes, I do think that this is an example of freedom of speech. After all, the Aryan nation is still allowed to put out their propaganda, no matter how wrong it may be. when we try to censor things, we are taking away the author's right to his \"art\". Back when book banning was so popular, they removed 'Huckleberry Finn' from library shelves, since the text included the word nigger. While it is a hateful term with very bad connotations attached to it, it has to be viewed in the context of the tale. This would apply to an image shown on your hypothetical website, as it is in hte context of someone's opinion. There is legal recourse if someone is being libeled or slanderered or otherwise harmed by such things. The supreme court has repeatedly supported their opinions on such matters.\n If a child happens to \"accidentally\" view such images, it is their parents responsibility to let them know that it is just one person's opinion. As provoking as that opinion may be, you are only reacting in the way the author intended if you get angry. We are are legally entitled to our opinions, after all. \n I'm sure you would not like it if we were to censor all of the \"pro-america\" websites depicting the terrorists as evil incarnate. Unfortunately for those who are so sensitive and ignorant as to hate people who disagree with them, When we proclaim ourselves to be a fair and just society, we have to act accordingly, this includes granting the same rights we enjoy to those we may not like so much.",

   "the internet should only be censored to remove what is illegal, like drug selling, murder petitions, etc. child porn is illegal as well.\n \n as far as people's opinions and views, of course it should not be censored. even political defamatory sites, porn sites, sites with gross imagery, and every other interest imaginable should be permissible, as long as it is legal.\n \n as to what is appropriate, such as children watching porn or employees playing games, the internet itself does not promote perversion and counterproductivity, people need to monitor themselves (and their kids). the internet is one of the few places where so much unbiased information is available so inexpensively. to censor the internet would be to allow people to control what truth they want the public to know, just like the major news networks in this country.\n\n \n Your plan opens the path to rampant corrution of innocent children. The uncensored sites should require registration just as this one does. (It is a censored site.)\n \n This would not be foolproof but it would minimize access by adolescents.",

(It is a censored site.)\n \n This would not be foolproof but it would minimize access by adolescents.\n\n computers where adolescents access the internet from should have content filters by all means. and i would fully support a system that requires all sites to be indexed in such a way that obviously non-constructive web sites can be better filtered on computers.\n \n what im saying is that the internet as a whole should not be censored. no matter how offensive, disgusting or disturbing your site is, as long as its not ilegal it should not be banned from being on the net.\n \n this site is a monitored discussion board, and the monitor retains the right to remove or edit anybody's post at his discretion. as a site owner, you have a responsibility over what your site contains, even though people from all over contribute to the content. there are some discussion boards that allow any type of content, even information about illegal stuff. if a bust goes down it is the site admin, not the people that post, that have to take the rap.",
