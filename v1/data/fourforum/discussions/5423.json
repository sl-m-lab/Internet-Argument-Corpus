   "I believe in the whole YRS system! I am a product of such a program. As a teen I liked it very much! When I entered the YRS I was a C student, when I left I was a A/B student. I also (as a teen) liked being involved year round, our family could take our vacations during different times of the year (we weren't stuck during the June-Aug. rush). Plus, I got a break every 3 months! By the end of the 3 monthes I was ready for the break, by the end of the 3 weeks, I was ready to go back. I loved it! emoticon_love Now, as an adult and parent of 2. I love it even more. I now understand the impact of YRS on a community. It gives all year employment to teachers, bus drivers, school workers and many others. If a student needs to make up or catch up in a class, they can do it during thier 3 week break. Our high school had the lowest drop out rate and highest graduation rate in the state (in the 70's and early 80's). If you don't know how it all works, do your homework! I am telling you, this really does work. Some people really hate change, but change is what helps us grow. The summer break, is no longer needed! The child is not going out and working the farms during the summer! They are falling behing the rest of the world and we as the adults are allowing it! There are many reasons why this should be, the most important one is our kids! Wake up America!",
