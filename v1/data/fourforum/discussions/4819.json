   "Here is the link:\n \n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,153445,00.html\n \n Ore. Court Nullifies Gay Marriage Licenses \n Thursday, April 14, 2005\n \n SALEM, Ore. - The Oregon Supreme Court (search) on Thursday nullified nearly 3,000 marriage licenses issued to same-sex couples by Multnomah County (search) a year ago, saying a single county couldn't take such action on its own. \n \n The court said while the county can question the constitutionality of laws governing marriage, they are a matter of statewide concern so the county had no authority to issue licenses to gay couples.\n \n The court noted that last November, Oregonians approved a constitutional amendment that limits marriages to a man and a woman. The court also said that long before that vote, state law had set the same limitations on marriages since Oregon became a state.\n \n \"Today, marriage in Oregon - an institution once limited to opposite-sex couples only by statute - now is so limited by the state Constitution as well,\" the court ruling said.\n \n The court left the door open for state legislators to craft an alternative to gay marriages (search), such as civil unions.\n \n \"We conclude that Oregon law currently places the regulation of marriage exclusively within the province of the state's legislative power,\" the court said.\n \n Tim Nashif, head of the Oregon Family Council (search) and the Defense of Marriage Coalition (search), said, \"We're pretty thrilled and pretty relieved at the opinion.\"\n \n Members of the Legislature have been awaiting the ruling to give them guidance on how to proceed on the issue, and just Wednesday, Gov. Ted Kulongoski (search) said he will push for a law allowing gay couples to form civil unions.\n \n Marte Sheehan, who married Linda Duchek last March, said she was disappointed with the ruling but had hopes the Legislature would pass a bill allowing civil unions.\n \n \"I believe that ultimately the Legislature will do the right thing,\" she said.\n \n Multnomah County, which includes much of Portland and is the state's most populous county, began issuing marriages to gay couples last April, arguing that not doing so violated the state Constitution. A judge ordered the practice to cease about six weeks later, but not before nearly 3,000 same-sex couples had wed.\n \n Vermont is the first and still the only state to offer civil unions to gays, passing a law in 2000. Massachusetts has allowed gay marriage since last May. Both those changes came about after court rulings. In Connecticut, the state House passed legislation Wednesday that would make it the second state to establish same-sex civil unions\n \n Multnomah County's move last year was one of a flurry of similar ones after San Francisco started issuing same-sex marriage licenses on Feb. 12, 2004. San Francisco's spree of gay weddings also was shut down by the courts, though a related constitutional challenge brought by gay rights activists is still pending.\n \n \"Two West Coast liberal states now, both California and Oregon, have both said that local governments don't have authority to take the law into their own hands,\" said Kelly Clark, the attorney for the Defense of Marriage Coalition. \"It certainly sends a signal to the rest of the country...",

   "Well the idea of \"sanctity of marriage\" itself is a falicy. Since marriage itself is a construct of government to begin with, sanctity (which eludes to religious ideals) really has nothing to do with it at all.\n\n This reminds me of a story I read today in a local paper about the main proponent of an anti-gay marriage ammendment to the state constitution.\n \n The main pusher of the ammendment has a gay brother, but he's not bitter.\n \n But, the funny thing is that the main pusher guy is getting a divorce because he was having an affair one of his legal aides. He also pushed to strike down an adultery clause in the Protection of Marriage Ammendment.\n \n Ah, here is an online version of the article:\n \n \nMarriage Act sponsor facing divorce \n By Skip Cauthorn, scauthorn@nashvillecitypaper.com\n April 15, 2005\n \n Senate Republican Caucus Chairman Jeff Miller, the sponsor of Tennessee's Marriage Protection act, is facing divorce because of his alleged relationship with a Senate aide, his wife said.\n \n Miller (R-Cleveland) has been the chief sponsor of the Marriage Protection Amendment, which passed the Senate in February mere days prior to the divorce filing.\n \n Brigitte Miller, Sen. Miller's wife of 15 years, said he is having an affair with a legislative researcher and that he and the young lady accompanied the Millers' three daughters to a November Martina McBride concert in Nashville.\n \n \"They've been seeing each other for a while,\" Mrs. Miller told a Capitol Hill reporter. \"Now he admits things. But he said it's only been since he moved out. But I know better. I've got things that tell me differently.\"\n \n Sen. Miller said at the time of the concert the aide was a \"friend,\" Mrs. Miller said.\n \n A court date has not been set in Bradley County Circuit Court. Sen. Miller, who is representing himself in the proceedings, filed a countercomplaint with the court March 23. The countercomplaint said the February claim of \"inappropriate marital conduct\" is without merit.\n \n Miller didn't return calls to his legislative office Thursday afternoon but issued the following statement:\n \n \"My wife and I are in the process of getting a divorce. Divorce is a very difficult time for everyone. It is a very private matter, which is played out in public proceedings. Our chief concern right now is the best interest of our children,\" the statement said. ... \"It became apparent over the last week or so that we have irreconcilable differences which we have been unable to resolve.\" \n \n The Marriage Protection Amendment, which passed the Senate floor Feb. 23, would place a ban on gay marriage in the state constitution. The amendment, which says marriage should be defined as between \"one man and one woman,\" will go before the voters in a November referendum next year.\n \n Miller described the measure last year, in the first of two passages needed for a constitutional amendment, as a means of preserving the sanctity of marriage.\n \n In addition, while pushing the marriage act through the Senate last year, Miller openly opposed an amendment sponsored by state Sen. Steve Cohen that would have included an \"adultery clause.\"\n \n Cohen's amendment, which failed, stated: \"Adultery is deemed to be a threat to the institution of marriage and contrary to public policy in Tennessee.\"\n \n Prior to the passage of the amendment last year The City Paper learned Miller's brother and Nashville resident Gregg Miller was openly gay.\n \n Gregg Miller said at the time he was surprised to learn Sen. Miller was pushing the initiative.\n \n \"It's not going to hurt my relationship with [my brother]. He's a grown man and I love him and my whole family loves him and we love each other,\" Sen. Miller said of his sibling. \"We support each other whenever we feel like the other person is in the right. But, if the other person is not acting appropriately according to the belief systems that we all have, then we still love each other but we disagree.\" \n \n Mrs. Miller said she has suspected the senator to have had extramarital affairs in the past.\n \n \"I think he's played around for a long time. ... It's not any more wrong to be gay than to commit adultery,\" she said. \n\n \n Actually I would think it would be MORE wrong to commit adultery since it would involve lying and betrayal of trust, not to mention a breach of contract. Anyway, so much for \"sanctity.\"",
