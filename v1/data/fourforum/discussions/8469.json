   "This question is intended for anyone who does not espouse a belief in total \"moral relativism.\"\n \n If intelligent aliens existed, would it be our duty to treat them the same way we treat fellow humans? What about if they were killing each other off? Would it be our duty to intervene? If their culture espoused torturing one another for pleasure, should we then intervene? Are our morals truly Universal, or do they apply only to humans? If these aliens attacked us, would we be justified in any level of brutality during retaliation, or would we be morally required to offer them the same legal protections we offer ourselves? Is it possible that other intelligent life has what you may refer to as a \"soul?\" Or, despite their intelligence, are they mere beasts by default? What level of intelligence requires us to treat them the same way we treat humans?",

Namely, would a hypothetical alien race need to have a moral stance based on benevolent and compassionate principles in order to flourish and survive? I suspect that it doesn't. \n \n I would think that there would have to be a sufficient level of intra-group cooperation for a particular group to flourish but many human groups have flourished well at the expense of other groups, showing that inter-group cooperation may not be necessary - ex. Rome exploited its empire, Spain and Portugal exploited the natives of Central and South America, etc. \n \n I would also think that there would have to be some structure by which positions of authority or opportunities would be at least partly determined by merit. However, this says nothing about the treatment of those with less merit, who would be vulnerable to exploitation.\n \n So, though I would hope otherwise, I suspect that a moral stance of benevolence toward others would not be a requirement for a technologically advanced extra-terrestrial species.",
