Let's see how it compares to a conservative's definition.\n \n I have very strong moral values. I have a very strong sense of right and wrong. I try to remember every day that I may have to explain my actions at the pearly gates. I simply accept that my values are not shared by all. Just as the Republicans were recently offended by Howard Dean, we non-conservatives have been offended daily for years now by the notion that we're somehow less than on the moral front. Just as Howard Dean's comments won't bring supporters to his side, neither will the unrelenting superior attitude on the Republican side.\n \n I believe that moral values can not be effectively legislated. To try is foolhearty. Specific example: We can outlaw gay marriage but we'll never control what people do in their bedroom. We can outlaw references to same sex relationships in the media, but we'll never control what people do in their bedroom. Since what people do in private doesn't directly effect me, my best option is to ignore it. I feel confident that I can teach my children to do the same. I don't need or want the government's help to impart family values. I don't think that a massive upheavel in our government will have a positive outcome. That doesn't make me lacking in moral values. It makes me a pragmatist and it makes me independent and self reliant. Now, if you want to discuss adoption by gay couples, that's a whole new topic. One on which I haven't completely formed my own opinion. But that's a new animal because their life style may/may not affect someone else.\n \n I believe that government exists for the benefit of it's citizens. It's first responsibility is to protect each and every one of us. Specific example: It's government's responsibility to prosecute criminals, as a completely clear-headed unbiased third party -- not for the purpose of getting revenge for the offended party, but for the greater purpose of preventing the next offense. Vengence is available in civil court. Protection for the population comes in criminal court. Sentencing should be commensorate with the danger a criminal poses to society. It doesn't seem to currently work that way. Mandatory sentencing. Oh boy. We fill our prisons with mandatory sentencing for non-violent drug offenders - then we let sex offenders and pedofiles out with some crazy notion that they've been rehabilitated.\n \n If the government were doing it's job correctly on the last point, we wouldn't need to discuss gun control and the benefits of criminal court vs drawing down on 'em here and now.\n \n So, am I a liberal?
