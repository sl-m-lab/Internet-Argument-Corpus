   "Proponents of stem cell research were hoping the death of President Ronald Reagan would provide the impetus for lifting the federal restrictions on stem cell research and therapy. Fifty eight U.S. Senators, including some conservatives, along with Nancy Reagan, wrote a letter to President Bush asking him to reconsider his opposition to this new and evolving science, reminding him that medical problems such as Alzheimers disease may someday be eradicated by the promise of stem cells.\n \n First Lady Laura Bush has apparently responded by closing the door on the idea, calling for \"extreme caution\" in dealing with stem cell research.\n \n The U.S. currently has a limited supply of stem cells which can be used for research, and many are calling it woefully inadequate. The cells are obtained from human embryos used in fertility clinics which will eventually be discarded.\n \n I'm completely missing the ethical implications of the Bush administration's reluctance to allow a green light to this endeavor, and am hoping someone can enlighten me as to why it's good policy to willingly turn their back on the hope of various medical breakthroughs that stem cell research could provide, and are allowing other countries the opportunity to take the lead.",

   "While I support stem cell research I can also understand why someone would be against it. It is a matter of people being afraid of not knowing whether or not a stem cell is considered human life and if it is right to play with that at all. It also comes from people being afraid of what we might be able to do with this type of research. Some people don't want us to eventually be able to clone our own organs to replace worn out ones as again they fear it is tampering with human life. The religious are of course the ones who fear this type of stuff the most while only a small handful of on lookers would feel the same way when considering the possible medical implications of this research.",

Being a Christian, I am not afraid of what goes into the forming of a human, it is what becomes of that human; that is what is important. No one is &#8220;playing God&#8221; when the betterment of mankind is concerned.\n \n I would love for medicine to bring about some change in my stepson &#8211; through stem cells, DNA manipulation, etc. &#8211; so that he would be able to ride a bicycle, or a horse, or 4wheeler, or go hunting, or just be normal in general.\n \n Life is a blessing for so many of us. Let&#8217;s allow those that can improve it for others have the fast lane all to themselves.",
