   "I have a question for the antis. How does more gun control equal less crime. Don't tell me it's because there are less guns. Be specific. Why are less guns better. I tried to figure it out through logic. Heres where I got:\n \n I thought less guns meant less suicide, but then I thought about it. If a person wanted to commit suicide, I doubt the absence of a gun would stop them.\n \n It would mean there are less guns in the hands of criminals. Maybe, however citizens possessing guns is a huge deterrent for most criminals.\n \n I thought it was to prevent gun thefts, however when I thought about it, different laws could fix this. We don't need an all out ban.\n \n I thought it was to prevent kids from getting their hands on guns, but if we made laws that required owners to securely lock up guns when not in use this would not be a problem.\n \n So, is there anything I missed? Also, is there any faults in my logic?",

Using examples from other countries is pointless, because of cultural differences. Israel has a very low crime rate because of its lack of gun control. Britain has a very high rate of crime due to its gun control, but Japan is doing great because of gun control. Lets keep it to American references only.\n \n Let me add that Florida has had only 5 instances of violent crime from a CCW holder ever since it enacted its Shall Issue law.

I am demonstrating that many people who would be considered criminals if gun control was passed are abiding by all other laws.\nFirstly, I am not trying to outlaw 'people', I am trying to outlaw 'murder' (within the realms of the hypothetical argument).\n Otherwise... Yes. And if you tried to make murder illegal than many people who were otherwise law-abiding would be criminalised. Or robbery. Or speeding. Or...
