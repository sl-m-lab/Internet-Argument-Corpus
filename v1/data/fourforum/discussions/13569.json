It is just a matter of assessing if they pass the definition the law has made of what constitutes racist thoughts or actions. So of course we can prove or disprove if a person has acted or expressed racist sentiments.\n For instance discrimination based on race. When it comes to physical action against a person then of course the act itself is criminal such as beating up somebody for being black, racism is just the motive for it, the reason for doing it.\n I think that admission of racism itself is not racism until the person saying so really knows what he is talking about and under examination it is proven that he is racist.\n People admit to crimes they haven't committed, that it is true.\n I think that all the victims of racism consider it evil.

   "Winston Smith", 
   "Well that's a relief. What a horrible world we'd live in if we didn't persecute people for speaking the wrong words. \n \n \n We prosecute people for illegal doings, and speaking is doing. \n If we didn't believe in the power of words then why give speeches to incite others to do what we want them to do?\n I support free speech up to a point, but not to the point when people use the power of the word to incite others to do violence physically and/or psychological, in other words to foment the politics of hatred.\n \n Of course we shouldn't prosecute others for their thoughts even if we could read minds. Although it didn't happen in \"1984\" it did happen in 1947 that people who hadn't made their political opinions public were forced to do so when the HUAC began an investigation into the Hollywood Motion Picture Industry. In September 1947, the HUAC interviewed 41 people who were working in Hollywood. These people attended voluntarily and became known as \"friendly witnesses\". During their interviews they named several people who they accused of holding left-wing views.\n \n What about discriminating, isolating in ghettoes and finally exterminating people for being of a particular race ? or what about slaving people of a particular race? Is it evil or only stupid? \n \n \n The problem isn't people being punished for what they do think, it's that you can't know whether they're thinking it or not. \n\n \n Of course we can't know, but even if I knew what they were thinking I still would not persecute them of prosecute them.\n \n \n I don't believe in mind reading, as a result I'm not able to give you an example of a time someone was thinking racist thoughts.\n\n Neither do I",
