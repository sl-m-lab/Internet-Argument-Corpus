   "I'm an aspiring science fiction writer and the type of science I would like to write is \"hard sci-fi\". That is, I want to create fantastic technologies that obey the laws of physics. I'm just trying to decide if teleportation is one of those things. Let's examine the two possibilities: quantum teleportation and matter/energy conversion.\n \n \n I read an article on the net about quantum physics and in one section, the author mentions about quantum teleportation. Here is a quote from the author:\n \n \n \"Teleportation: As the probability wave suggests, you can get from Point A to Point C without necessarily passing through Point B. Small particles can jump from one location to another without actually moving through space between points, which is sometimes called a 'quantum leap'. In theory, this could be extended to larger particles.\"\n \n \n And here is the link:\n \n \n http://www.rotten.com/library/religion/quantum-physics/\n \n \n The aforementioned site is on quantum tunneling. Unfortunately, teleportation can only work for things at the microscopic level only, and not at the macroscopic stage. In the subatomic world, things are very fuzzy. The probability of a single electron tunneling even an inch is so improbable, that you may have to wait for the entire life of the universe and never see it happen anyway. \n \n \n The probability of TWO particles tunneling from the same place to the same place at the same time is even lower. Now, the probability of all of the matter in your body tunneling even a micrometer in the same direction at the same time is, again, so improbable, you'll never see it happen. Its more probably that your head will tunnel a few feet away from the rest of your body. Can you imagine how morbidly amusing life would be if this weren't so improbable?\n \n \n To make this even worse, we have no control over this. In fact, we can't even predict when or how it will happen. Its not just an engineering nightmare, its a line in the rule book that the universe seems to adhere to. I guess that means we can scratch off quantum tunneling as a good candidate for teleporting people.\n \n \n 1) Thoughts anyone?\n \n \n But then I thought of another possibility for teleportation: the conversion of matter into energy and vice-versa. Einstein has stated in his equations that matter and energy are interconvertible. An experiment at Stanford University was accomplished at S.L.A.C. (short for Stanford Linear Accelerator Center). Michael Pidwirny, the guy who wrote it claimed that it might one day be a useful means of teleportation like in Star Trek. Here is a direct quote from him:\n \n \n \"In 1998 researchers at Stanford University's Linear Accelerator Center successfully converted energy into matter. This feat was accomplished by using lasers and incredibly strong electromagnetic fields to change ordinary light into matter. The results of this experiment may allow for the development of variety of technological gadgets. One such development could be matter/energy transporters or food replicators that are commonly seen in some of our favorite science fiction programs.\"\n \n \n Here is the website: \n \n http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/6a.html\n \n \n Here are some links to SLAC's statements released to various publications concerning the experiment: \n \n \n http://www.slac.stanford.edu/exp/e144/nytimes.html\n \n \n http://www.slac.stanford.edu/exp/e144/science1202.html\n \n \n Personally, I don't think that there will ever be a conventional use for converting energy into matter because of the amount of energy contained in one human being. Think about it: if one human can produce thousands of hiroshimas bombs, then you would need thousands of atom bombs worth of energy to create a turkey sandwich. That just doesn't seem practical to me. If that amount of energy were to be released when turning a man into energy, well let's just say there wouldn't be much left of anything for a few thousand miles! In any conversion of matter, some energy is inevitably lost. In addition, such conversions of particles to energy are called annihilations, that is, they are like explosions: the explosive material is completely destroyed and no memory of its original form remains. \n \n \n Now imagine for the sake of arugment that there was a way around the second law of theromodynamics. Teleportation could be accomplish by converting a person into energy and you had the technology to reverse the process. In addition, you send the information along with the energy.\n \n \n The question is, would the person survive the procedure, or would the individual cease to exist and be replaced with a replica, who was literally born into existence once the energy was reconverted back into matter with the information? \n \n \n In my view, when your body is converted into energy, you're destroy, hence, you die. End of story. What comes out of the teleporter is an exact copy, with all your memories etc, and no knowledge that it isn't you, but it isn't. No one would ever notice the problem, so it only affects you when it happens. Unless, if you believe in souls, there are \"conservation of souls\" problems to deal with - does the same soul follow the body around? While in an energy state, there is no consciousness, no heart to beat, hence the person who first underwent this form of teleportation has cease to exist and replaced with a replica. \n \n \n 2) What does everybody else thinks? (Note: I know this question sounds a bit philosophical but I'd be very interested in everyones' opinion anyway.) \n \n \n There is another problem with the matter/energy conversion teleporter. The thing that always bothered me about this method of teleportation is that once a crew member is converted into energy, that energy is something akin to plasma. Meaning that that energy has to go somewhere. And the only way to get rid of it is to blast a hole in the ceiling for all the energy to escape before it destroys everyone on the ship! When Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry created the transporter, he did so because he couldn't afford on his television budget to land a huge starship or shuttlecraft on a planet every week. So, the transporter was born. \n \n \n In addition, he also invented Subspace, where once the crew member is converted into energy, it is sent through subspace, exits at it's appointed destination and the process is reversed. But in real life Subspace does not exist. That being said, if you convert a person into energy and you send it to its destination such as a building, the transmitted energy would not only punch a hole through the ceiling, it would also destroy the house and everything surrounding it. Therefore, I think it would be better to convert a person into a radio signal, that way it can pass through barriers like walls and ceilings without destroying them. \n \n \n 3) Any thoughts?\n \n \n Whitestar",

   "First off, you should check out this site:\n http://www.philosophers.co.uk/games/identity.htm\n \n It's a philosophy site, and this \"game\" deals with various scenarios, including teleportation, where you have to choose the path most likely to gaurantee your survival. It fits in perfectly with your concerns.\n \n On to other matters. The problem with quantum tunneling, as I recall, isn't so much a matter of probability as of size. The larger a particle is, the less profound quantum effects are. Thus, and electron can tunnel a distance many times greater than its size, whereas you or I could only tunnel a distance a fraction the size of an electron. In other words, no real distance at all.\n \n As for \"reading\" a person's info, and then beaming the info, with or without the energy contained in their bodies, and reconstructing them, Heisenburg says no go. Heisenburg's Uncertainty Principal says that it's impossible to know the position and momentum of a particle to a given degree of accuracy at the same time. The greater the precision of one measurment, the worse the precision on the other. While you might be able to get enough info to recreate the general shape of someones body, things like memory would most likely be lost.\n \n In Star Trek, they dealt with this by having a \"Heisenburg Compensator\" as one of the transporter components.\n \n I think the best bet for travel which takes no time is worm holes. Granted, we've never actually seen one, but we have no certain knowledge that they're impossible either.",

He placed his essence into the teleporter and several years later he was put back right by the Enterprise crew.\n\n \n Yes that is the one\n \n \n\n My question to the idea of transporters is what about the movie \"The Fly?\" Jeff Goldblum transports himself from one pod to another. But what happened was that a fly got in the system and got put back to gether with him. Then the more this happened, the more of a bug he became. If anything transports with you, would they then become a part of you, or you a part of them?\n As far as the writing of Hard-Science Fiction, you can either do transporter or wormhole. The only real differnce is what you write about it. (I took a Sci-Fi Lit class.) If you put infacis on how they work and are put together or generized, then both can work.\n\n \n \n I do get the idea of were you are going. Think about it for a second some sort of energy force pulling you apart a atom at a time and then reassembling you at the other end. Sounds very painfull to me.",

   "Did they teach you that fiction is the operative word? Just because something appears to be workable doesn't mean it will ever happen. Lost in Space is just a story.\n\n For the record, even if it is fiction, there still has to be some concept of science and what we already know about science and the theories. This is what seperates Science-Fiction from fantasy and/or regular fiction. There is a science to worm-holes. What we don't know is if we could safely go through one or how they are put together. We know that we can split atoms but we don't know how to do that safely in a transporter. The intire point to science fiction is to tell a story with a point in an odd setting and with some times odd charicters and with odd devices that would not be workable in our time. If you tell a story with a point but there is nothing out of the ordinary, all you have is fiction. Now why do you disbelieve that anything in science-fiction stories could ever happen. We already know that we can go into space. We already know that we can break the sound barrier. Isn't it true that a while back in England, they were building a starship. What's wrong with a belief in the possibilities? The guy who started the thread originally was trying to write a novel and wanted to know what was already known. Granted, we will probibly only be able to travel to the future if we could time travel, but when you think about it, are we really living in a time that some one from the future would want to come here? For the record, most of Science Fiction takes place in the future to make up for the fact that you are not able to do some things.\n \n BTW, my Lit of Sci-Fi class was in college and they stoped giving spelling test in 8th grade.",
