   "start by being a church of one.\n\n That's right. You first have to have that established within yourself.\n \n Good point, sinjin.\n \n For those of you who think sinjin is being sarcastic, just remember he's not stating something he has no idea about. He's been there and made his discovery; we all have to make that discovery.\n \n Greg, for the most part, the attitude of the congregation is what the church is made of - since they are the church. Whether it's overalls and broomstick skirts or suits and dresses, the character of the church shows its true colors.\n \n I can only add that after you establish that belief within yourself, then find a church that can convey those (that) belief(s) in another light and in doing so will create a good home base for your faith. Check out the Sunday School and Prayer Meetings, what and how they teach and see if it lines up with what the preacher teaches.\n \n Shy away from orations like, \"This is what I believe...\", if it happens to be saturated in each sermon. Listen to make sure the preacher and teachers use the scripture as references in their sermons. Get a Strong's Exhaustive Concordance, but use it by checking its definitions through several passages of scripture.\n \n The Holy Bible is the Living Word and those scriptures do come alive when read and studied through prayer and the Holy Spirit. Like directions to assemble anything worth doing - you need to follow each step. Without the proper parts it just won't come together, whether it is as simple as a swing set or studying the Bible all the steps must be taken to ensure that all the parts correctly fit.\n \n And one more important thing, which is spiritual: Your knower will know.",

For instance, many cults exist who don't even know who Jesus Christ really is (Lord, eternal God, Jewish Messiah, Resurrected Savior, etc.). The liberal \"Bishop\" Spong and his liberal \"Jesus Seminar\" buddies are in this group of spiritually-challenged individuals. Their reinvented Jesus is not Lord, eternal God, Jewish Messiah, Resurrected Savior, or even a miracle worker, etc. To them Jesus was basically just your ordinary religious philosopher who couldn't save a gnat from a pool of spit. So, that's a good starting point - to read the Bible without any pre-conceived bias and learn what it says for yourself.",

   "Greg\n The first thing you need to know is there isn't a such thing as a perfect church. There will always be something you don't agree with at one time or another. No church follows the bible word for word, but some come pretty close. When I searched for a church I always found out what their statement of beliefs is, to see if they believed as I believe. If they did I would attend a church service to see if there was a spirit of love present and find out more. Then if you feel spiritually connected perhaps you should give the church a try. emoticon_xangel",

I used to be serious in to weightlifting back in my twenties, and I had found I was more enthused about it , when I was with fellow lifters . A lot of believers feel the same way when following their faith, they feel that fellowship with others increases learning , and the presence of the Holy Spirit. I dont know, I have not been in a church except for funeral services since 1982, and even back then, I could not find one that was teaching the scriptures the way I had learned them by reading the Bible on my own.
