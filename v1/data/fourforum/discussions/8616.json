He wrote in the article in the reference to Hezbollah that \"Apart from Mao Zedong in China and Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, Hezbollah may have also learned a lesson or two from the battlefields of Chechnya - as it configures itself, like the Chechens, as one of the only guerilla groups in the world capable of facing an extremely powerful state army.\" \n \n However I think that the real thing is a little bit different from what the author suggests.

Where's your actual proof of this?\n \n \nDon't you find it odd that Chechens have been taking part in all recent armed conflicts between Islamic world and the West? I do. And this assures me that Chechens are really a forward detachment of global terrorism...\n\n \n If they're jihadis, it would only make sense for them to get involved with \"West vs. Islam\" affairs. Are you speaking of Chechens as a whole, or the Islamic fundamentalists?",

I doubt that he or the many other qualified jounalists that cover Lebanon and or Chechnya would have missed the possiblity of Chechen rebels in Lebanon.\n \n Overall your analysis is somewhat incorrect in my opinion. While Baseyive (sp) the Chechen leader who took responsibility for the Beslan atrocity was recently killed the Chechen rebellion has not ended. It has expanded towards other Caucus(sp) states and has taken towards targetted assasinations of political and security leaders.\n \n As for Hezbollah, I strongly doubt that they would require assistance from Chechen rebels. Hezbollah is better equiped, and have had 6 years of training, backed up by 18 years of direct experience in fighting a guerilla war. If anything it would be the Chechens who would be requiring assistance, due to the attrition of the Russian actions towards Chechnya. Out of a population of 1 million in 1994, it is believed that about 700 000 are remaining in Chechnya today, with 100 000 having been killed, 40 000 childern.",
