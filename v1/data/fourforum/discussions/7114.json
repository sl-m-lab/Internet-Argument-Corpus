   "Here is my idea on this. I expect it to meet with mild opposition.\n \n First, let them strike then use the fact that their strike is illegal to break their contract.\n \n Next, announce a new wage structure. Start wages at $7 per hour, cap them at 12. Retirement at 62, mandatory at 65, with an 80% employee funded pension plan.\n \n As far as the PR for this goes, first, they need to start quoting potential costs in real dollar costs. The real dollar costs of a transit strike are next to zero. Then, they need to point out that in the vast majority of cases, tranist workers are unskilled labor. I expect the normal line of BS that the teamsters use that driving a truck/bus is highly skilled labor. They can send a camera crew to any ag based community in the country and film 15 yr old kids driving semis loaded with cattle and grain around all day. It aint rocket science. \n \n While their billion dolalr surplus is problematic, it is nothing that cannot disapear with some creative accounting.",

There is no good solution to the problem, so in my view we should settle for a QUICK solution to the problem, and the quick solution to that problem is to take the inconvenience of strikes and break the unions backs. If they awould be reasonable and accept the fact that $55,000.00 yr is simply an unreasonabkle wage for a bus driver, there is a chance that they could negotiate downwards. No union does this.\n \n I think that the recent Delphi mess should be a message to unions everywhere. Their greed drove the company under. Now they have a choice, take the $9 per hour or get nothing ($9 an hour is a HUGE adjustment considering that some of their production workers were getting $60K per year). \n \n This is, IMO, goign to boil down to public opinion. If the public percieves that this is the result of incompetence in city government, the politicians will buckle immediatly. If the public largely views this as greedy, already overpaid transit authorities trying to screw the people even more than they already are, then this may be a good chnace to do a MASSIVE correction in those folks compensation.",

   "It`s always hard to assign \"fair\" wages on the labour market. There is only supply and demand, and manipulation thereoff. It becomes extra difficult in cases of monopoly markets as well as wages in public service. I find it peculiar that public services seems to be almost better payed in the US than the private sphere. Is this just my impression, or is this the case? Usually it`s the other way around* since public service markets are characterised by an employer monopsomy that is able to hold down the wages below average wages in the private sphere where competition between individual firms will raise the wages.\n \n * there are certain exceptions where loyalty, job insecurity or the fear of corruption in the public service sphere may drive the wages upwards instead, but this only applies to very specific proffesions (like police, judges, high level beurocrats and directors, politicians etc, etc.",

   "The quesiton will be whether the politicians in new yorkhave the cahones to go for the gold....break the union and start bringing in scabs at $7 per hour to replace them, or will they loose their nerve and make some kind of settlement with the union for a quick resolution. \n \n At this point, I think that if they do not break the union and drop the wages to something mroe reasonable, they are fools. They seem to have the support of the people, most of whom seem to see the transit strike as an illegal act by a bunch of greedy workers. \n \n There are roughly half a million unemployed people in New York. If the city started hiring tomorrow, they could start bringign services back online slowly. Granted it would take a while to get everythign back up and running, but prior uniion breaking experience has shown that union worker WILL go back to work, and at significantly lower wages, if the alternative appears to be being left out int he cold with no job, no unemployment, and no transferrable skills. I would imagine that within a week of starting the hiring process, the city could have 40% of the current workforce back in action at a severely cut rate IF they promised JUST that retirement benifits would be protected for peopel due to retire within 15 years. \n \n This is just another wakeup call for the American people.
