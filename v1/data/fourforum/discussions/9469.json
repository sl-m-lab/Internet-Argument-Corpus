   "The same could happen here. The promotion of marriage, commitent and stability is what it is all about. Who argues otherwise is not truly for the promotion of marriage and family (yes gays have families). \n \n http://www.365gay.com/Newscon07/01/011707canada.htm\n \n (Ottawa) The percentage of Canadians marrying has dropped by half over the past 60 years but had it not been for the legalization of same-sex marriage the number would have been even lower according to new government statistics.\n \n The figures, released Wednesday by Statistics Canada, are for 2003, the year that same-sex marriage became legal in Ontario and British Columbia.\n \n Stats Can says that A total of 147,391 couples tied the knot in 2003, only 653 more than in 2002 and just 773 more than in 2001, according to vital statistics data from the provinces and the territories.\n \n The agency says that the marriage rate in 2003 stayed at a three year record low of 4.7 marriages for every 1,000 population. This was less than half the rate seen in the 1940s when the rate peaked at 10.9.\n \n While Ontario does not keep statistics on whether marriage licenses were given to same-or opposite-sex couples British Columbia does.\n \n Of the 21,981 marriages that occurred in British Columbia in 2003, 774, or 3.5%, were between people of the same sex. \n \n But more than half of those people who entered into a same-sex marriage in British Columbia were not residents of Canada. \n \n On the other hand, less than five percent of people marrying someone of the opposite sex in that province did not reside in Canada. \n \n Of the 774 same-sex marriages in BC, 422, or 54.5 percent, were female couples and 352, or 45.5 percent, were male couples.\n \n In addition, people who married someone of the same sex were around 13 years older than people who married someone of the opposite sex. The average age for same-sex male couples was 44 years, and for lesbians it was 42 years. However, the average age for opposite-sex couples was 31years for men and 29 years for women.\n \n While Ontario does not keep statistics on the sexuality of marriage license applicants the total number of marriages increased by three percent in 2003 over the previous year - about the same percentage as British Columbia recorded as same-sex marriages.\n \n The ban on same-sex marriage began falling when courts in BC and Ontario ruled the federal definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman was unconstitutional.\n \n Six of the other eight provinces soon followed along with one of the three territories. The federal government opted not to fight any of the provincial rulings at the Supreme Court of Canada and in 2005 passed legislation extending full marriage rights to gays and lesbians across the country.",
