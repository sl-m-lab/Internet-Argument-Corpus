   "The RIGHT home schooling can be much better than public schools. Most kids are little learning machines that are not really challenged to reach their potential in a public school. My daughter, disappointed at the public schools which seemed to be concentrating on taking mandated tests rather than teaching to potential, has switched to home schooling with good results. A certified teacher, she researched home school curricula, enrolled her children in private school designed to supplement home schooling two days a week where they learn social skills in a group atmosphere while taking classes in Latin, mathematics, music and others (third grade). The rest of the week the kids are taught on a regular schedule at home with an established curriculum and do their assigned homework from the private school. My daughter stays in touch with other home schoolers online to exchange experience. So far all are happy, testing far above grade level and are developing confidence and good work habits.\n It is no accident that we rank 25th in education among industrilized countries.\n Dono",

   "I would say the usefulness of home schooling depends on both your parenting ability and your school system. I do not believe that any home schooled individual could have recieved as good an education as I did going to public schools. This is because I don't think any single person really has all of the knowledge necessary to teach his or her children a variety of subjects, and an attentive student is going to learn far more from a series of qualified teachers. The problem is that too many students aren't attentive and don't care about their grades. If you, as a parent, can assure that your student cares about his or her grades and is going to pay attention and do his or her homework, then I'd recommed public school over home schooling in a second. \n \n But I know a few people who made it through high school with a D average and couldn't solve \"x/2 + 6 = 11\" to save their lives. If you have trouble getting your child to take school seriously, home schooling might be a viable alternative, provided you are knowledgable in a variety of subjects and you are willing to allow your child to take a significant hit in the development of social skills. My recommended course of action would be: unless the school system in your area is notoriously worthless, send your child to public school, and if he or she starts doing poorly, speak with the school teachers to learn the topics being covered and combine public school with home education until your child takes education more seriously.",
