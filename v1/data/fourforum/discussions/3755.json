   "for those not aware of bush's strategy for combatting terrorism, it essentially entails attempting to change the environment in the middle east (presumably country by country) from monarchies and tyrants in power to elected leaders in democratic frameworks. in theory, by affording the middle east countries with the privellages that we enjoy in america, such as the freedom to vote, civil courts, etc, the terrorist organization will lose their foundational infrastructure and capability to flourish and expand, thus eliminating international terrorism\n \n this plan, deemed the best option going forward by our government, is what spawns the activities we see in the middle east right now, such as imposing democracy in iraq and afghanistan. the long-term goal is to have surrounding countries adopt a similar democratic system so that we wouldnt have to send our troops in every single middle east country just to make them into a democracy\n \n in my opinion, this plan is completely ludicrous, and absolutely ineffective to achieving the actual goal: eliminating terrorism\n \n an act of terrorism is a crime. when this act is commited across international borders, it is considered an international crime. when a crime occurs, the law has the right to arrest and punish the individual(s) that commited the crime. this method immediately removes the threat of the criminal commiting the crime repeatedly\n \n in the case of our situation, the crime is the murder of innocent american citizens and massive property damage (just for starters) and the criminal is osama bin laden and his al qaeda syndicate. the most effective way of enforcing justice is to arrest and punish bin laden and al qaeda according to the magnitude of such crimes.\n \n when a drug-related crime is commited in the slums of a large city, the government and law enforcement dont seek to bring education and prosperity to the people in that slum. they simply track down the criminal and bring them to justice. of course the possibility that other criminals will emerge exists, but to change the environment rather that extract the agent is impractical for the following reasons\n - it is too expensive\n - it takes generations to achieve\n - it doesnt guarantee the mindset of the people will change\n - it leaves the actual criminals at large and free to strike again\n - it has failed in the past\n \n our president has done exactly what conventional wisdom and the experience of the past has advised not to do. the problem is much more effectively solved when you remove the negative agent rather than the negative environment.\n \n let's look at exactly what is happening in the middle east now, and what trends are being followed there. \n - bin laden and al qaeda is in a position of greater advantage now than he was before 9/11. before 9/11 we knew he was in afghanistan but we did not know (ignored) his plans. now we dont know where he is, have less information about the size, capability and whereabouts of al qaeda, and we STILL dont know (still are ignoring) his plans\n - the overall furor and hatred for america has spread to even neutral muslims, increasing fundamentalist mentality and making the threat of violence even greater\n - we already know in iraq and afghanistan that the process in just those 2 countries will be slow. our troops are meeting violent resistance daily. the citizen themselves are more concerned about the fear of dying than the hope of liberty\n - our military presence and enormous funding into iraq is putting a strain on our homeland defence forces, leaving less man-power and resources in the event that we have to intercept another attack.\n \n this administration is essentially following a plan that cannot succeed. and they have been executing this failing plan for the last 2 years. \n \n \n \n but whats the very worse, they have convinced the public that this plan is the best option, and the public bought it",
