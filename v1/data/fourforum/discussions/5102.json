   "According to most professionals, most people are born homosexual. According to some historians, prejudice in society has caused some people to judge gay folks. Therefore, homosexuality is natural and people who force themselves to block their desires are leading a destructive lifestyle. Thus, the fanatic is destroying society. The fanatic attacks and uses abusive language when people challenge their ignorant and uneducated views. Most fanatics never provide any professional primary or secondary sources to justify his/her claims. Fanatics often pretend to befriend or respect the folks they judge. Most importantly, fanatics come in all colors, countries, and religions.",

   "The truth about homosexuality is this: Homosexuality is an orientation that is born out of lust;\n\n All sexual atrraction is out of lust, that is human sexuality 101.\n \n\n no individual is homosexual due to their genes. So it is this truth that has to be at the centre of any dispute whether it is right or wrong. If it is proved that homosexuality is genetic or that there is no choice in the orientation, then we can definitely state homosexuality as innocent, and a part of normal life.\n \n You have no evidence of anything you have said here other than your own, uninformed opinion. It shouldn't matter in a free society is people are born gay or not. \n \n\n But the problem here for homosexuals is this: why do some people go from being straight to becoming homosexual and vice versa? This is the crucial fact that proves that homosexuality is not a condition that is always with someone, or that they where born that way. A far logical answer is this: since people come and go from being homosexual, there must be something psychological taking place that has caused this, since no one can change their own genes.\n\n Again there is no evidence to support this claim. To date no real science lays behind the claim the sexuality is fluid and changeable. Only a small number of homosexuals claim to have become straight. No science has ever proven they were not just bisexuals to start with, and no science says that they are not still bisexual or gay.\n \n\n So, in the same way as mentally ill people suffer from a chemical imbalance in the brain, so too do homosexuals suffer a similar condition that draws their orientation from the opposite sex towards that of their own. This is not to suggest that homosexuals are mentally ill, as such, but they are suffering a form of illness associated with their physiology. \n\n I work with the mentallty ill. A chemical imablance is physical, not psychological. Here you have proven you know nothing about the mentally ill or gay people. Bi-polar disorder for instance is a physiological imbalance of chemicals in the brain. It is not a psycholigical disorder, but a physical disorder. schizophrenia is is also a phyisical condition. Recent brain scans show that the brain of a schizophenic is different from a normal brain, strarting the frontal lobe and working back, cells are destroyed. You contradict your self in this paragragh, you should stop while your ahead.\n \n\n This point is not so hard to grasp since there are a host of psychological problems that people can suffer and not be considered mentally ill, such as lack of confidence, or fear of heights etc, etc, notice these can be over come. So, this belief that homosexuality is a psychological matter is far more logical then that proposed by many homosexuals who claim that they where always this way, which in turn is greater proof that it is wrong.\n \n\n \n Years of research into homosexuality pretty much shoot your drunken stuper apart. To compare being gay to being afraid of heights is absolute rubbish. But if it helps you to sleep at night you may believe whatever you want.\n \n\n The main point that I'm trying to get across here is that the dispute over homosexuality being wrong or not, can be proven based on the argument that it is a choice or not. At least we should all agree that with out a doubt, homosexuals certainly are not born that way, since we all know people go from being straight to homosexual, and from homosexual to being straight, which leads me to say this: you had the choice of being homosexual or not when you decided to be lustful or not.\n\n \n Show me some evidence of anything you have said. I made no choice about who I would lust fro.. Niether did you. Did you decide who you would be attracted to?\n \n\n Besides we only have to see how fruitless homosexuality is to realize that it is wrong, the reason for homosexuality is just to gain gratification for a desire that has welled up due to lust.\n\n I guess companionship and love mean nothing to you! The fruits of my homosexual relationship have been a great house, a long time companion and a happy life. SOunds fruitful enough for me!\n \n\n Sex is designed to create new life, as is the sperm designed to bring new life, and the penis is designed for the vagina, and the breasts are design to provide milk for the baby, and so it is, these things are tailored to bring new life, everything is designed for a reason. What good is their in homosexuality? And why does a man have sex with a man? What has he achieved? What is the point of ejaculating that sperm into the anus of another man? The homosexual is damaging life, society and himself, whiles the only life form a homosexual can duplicate is the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the AIDS virus.\n\n \n Your last paragraph is so over the top and hateful, it isn't worth any real response. Especially the part about HIV. Millions of homosexuals are living disease free in happy committed relationships. You just want to play on sterotypes. That is why it is hate speech. If you had bothered to metion both sides of the story I would call it ionion, but since you only want to focus on known sterotypes like HIV and gays, then you are just here to spread hate about others.",

Reproduction is not the only use, or do you think homosexuality and most of the straight sex which doesn't lead to reproduction, simply don't exist? Your speakng of \"lust\" is used in the context of a moral judgment. You are projecting your own personal morality onto nature. Nature doesn't make such judgments, and nature obviously allows for homosexuality.

   "Ack, I just read the first post in this thread, and I'm not certain there is even a word in it that I agree with. Let's see what was said:\n \n \nThe truth about homosexuality is this: Homosexuality is an orientation that is born out of lust; no individual is homosexual due to their genes.\n\n \n Not only is that not the truth, there is no scientific or rational explanation that would indicate this to be the case. Can you choose to be sexually attracted to others of the same sex? Can you choose to fall in love with someone of the same sex? I don't feel that you likely can. Also, no science has suggested that people can choose to be homosexual.\n \n Or perhaps you mean that homosexual behavior is a choice based on unchosen sexual attraction and love? If so, I could agree with that.\n \n \nSo it is this truth that has to be at the centre of any dispute whether it is right or wrong. If it is proved that homosexuality is genetic or that there is no choice in the orientation, then we can definitely state homosexuality as innocent, and a part of normal life.\n\n \n No, the truth is that this has nothing to do with anything. Whether homosexuality is genetic or chosen has no bearing on whether or not homosexuals deserve equal rights or acceptance under the law. The idea that we should deny equal rights or acceptance to homosexuals under the law is absurd whether homosexuality is a choice or not.\n \n \nBut the problem here for homosexuals is this: why do some people go from being straight to becoming homosexual and vice versa? This is the crucial fact that proves that homosexuality is not a condition that is always with someone, or that they where born that way. A far logical answer is this: since people come and go from being homosexual, there must be something psychological taking place that has caused this, since no one can change their own genes.\n\n \n That is not a logical explanation, that is a guess without reasoning behind it. A more logical explanation is the following: since homosexuals come from a wide variety of family and emotional backgrounds, since it appears impossible for an individual to psychologically alter his or her orientation, and since the vast majority of homosexuals will never change and fail at reparative therapy, it logically makes sense to say that homosexuality is a static, unchangable occurance for most, yet some are able to change their orientation through therapy or more often over time. This indicates that homosexuality is genetic in nature, influenced both by psychological pressures and hormone production, making it alterable in people who have a less powerful genetic inclination toward homosexuality.\n \n Again, whether homosexuality is a choice is no indication whether or not we should legalize same-sex marriage.\n \n \nSo, in the same way as mentally ill people suffer from a chemical imbalance in the brain, so too do homosexuals suffer a similar condition that draws their orientation from the opposite sex towards that of their own. This is not to suggest that homosexuals are mentally ill, as such, but they are suffering a form of illness associated with their physiology.\n\n \n Yet homosexuality cannot be considered an illness unless there are negative effects of homosexuality. Indeed, there are none, and I will address the negative effects you brought up further down.\n \n \nThis point is not so hard to grasp since there are a host of psychological problems that people can suffer and not be considered mentally ill, such as lack of confidence, or fear of heights etc, etc, notice these can be over come. So, this belief that homosexuality is a psychological matter is far more logical then that proposed by many homosexuals who claim that they where always this way, which in turn is greater proof that it is wrong.\n\n \n The claims of homosexuals that they cannot change is neither proof that homosexuality is genetic nor psychological, for one with either condition would claim that he or she cannot change.\n \n \nThe main point that I'm trying to get across here is that the dispute over homosexuality being wrong or not, can be proven based on the argument that it is a choice or not.\n\n \n This is the most absurd thing I have ever heard. Indeed I do not know for certain that homosexuality is not a choice, although all evidence I have points to the possibility that it is not a choice. Yet I know with certainly that homosexuality is not morally wrong, that, in fact, those who oppose homosexuality are morally evil. It does not matter whether homosexuality is a choice, it is does not harm anyone nor anything, and those who would seek to deny equality to homosexuals are the ones who are wrong.\n \n \nAt least we should all agree that with out a doubt, homosexuals certainly are not born that way, since we all know people go from being straight to homosexual, and from homosexual to being straight, which leads me to say this: you had the choice of being homosexual or not when you decided to be lustful or not.\n\n \n It could certainly not be denied that some homosexuals can change, but it would be difficult to suggest with any manner of reasoning that any more than a handful are able to do so.\n \n \nBesides we only have to see how fruitless homosexuality is to realize that it is wrong, the reason for homosexuality is just to gain gratification for a desire that has welled up due to lust.\n\n \n We can see that homosexuality involves bringing two people who love each other together. These people may indeed wish to raise children, and they may even bring children into the world through having sex with a member of the opposite sex, a surrogate mother, or an artificially inseminated lesbian. This is in combination with the couples many non-children related contributions to society. Indeed, it can only be suggested that homosexuality is as fruitful in every way and shape as heterosexuality.\n \n \nSex is designed to create new life, as is the sperm designed to bring new life, and the penis is designed for the vagina, and the breasts are design to provide milk for the baby, and so it is, these things are tailored to bring new life, everything is designed for a reason.\n\n \n The idea that everything is designed for a reason suggests that an intelligent designer had a reason for creating things as they are. It is inherently an argument assuming the existence of God; a religious belief should not be used as an excuse to harm others. Yet if we did assume that everything is designed for a reason, then we must also assume that whatever intelligent creator there is made it possible for two men or two women to engage in and enjoy sex together in a harmless fashion, and we must assume he did so for a reason.\n \n \nWhat good is their in homosexuality? And why does a man have sex with a man? What has he achieved? What is the point of ejaculating that sperm into the anus of another man? The homosexual is damaging life, society and himself, whiles the only life form a homosexual can duplicate is the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the AIDS virus.\n\n \n You speak as though there is no good in allowing two people who love each other to enjoy themselves. You speak as though there is no good in making other people happy, making them more committed to one another, making them more willing and able to raise children. These are not bad things, these are good things, and you have listed only one thing that you believe to be a negative one: the AIDS virus. Indeed there exists a subculture of homosexuals who engage in irresponsible sexual behavior. But the idea that two married homosexual men would be at any risk whatsoever of AIDS is absurd. The vast majority of homosexuals engage in responsible sex, and as such, they are at zero risk of getting AIDS. Irresponsible sex of any form, whether homosexual or heterosexual, will put you at risk of AIDS, not homosexuality. Allowing same-sex marriage promote commitment between homosexuals, which will decrease the use of irresponsible sex by homosexuals, which will in turn decrease the rate of AIDS, not increase it. So if you are of the opinion that we should not legalize same-sex marriage because homosexuality leads to AIDS, you are wrong; homosexuality does not lead to AIDS, there is no negative consequence of homosexuality. If you are of the opinion that same-sex marriage would increase AIDS rates, you are again wrong; legalizing same-sex marriage would decrease those rates.",

(Especially when they are backed into the corner of debate and have no alternative but to outshout or insult me. You know, like they do on the Hannity or O'Reilly show. emoticon_rolleyes )\n \n\n My views are similar. I don't want the Left or Right telling me what's best for me. I never signed on to the idea of Uncle Sam knows best.......he doesn't and proves it every day. emoticon_mad \n \n\n I think the only thing worse than a Michael Moore worshipping liberal is a goosestepping rightwing conservative.

I am neither democrat or republican but I do tend to lean towards conservative republican ideals (before the party was taken over by the whackos) minus all the religious hogwash. I am more like a \"republican on hold,\" so to speak. You may call me liberal if that floats your boat but please refrain from confusing me with a democrat. I'm kinda like a Zell Miller, only in reverse. Much like Zell Miller has become ashamed of his party, I have became ashamed of mine. But I have faith that the GOP will come back to it's senses a long time before the Democrat party does.\n\n \n I'm with you on that one. I think that 9-11 turned what would have normally been a rational party into \"compassionate blank check writers\".
