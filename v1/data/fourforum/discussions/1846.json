   "U.N. vs. Guns: An international gun-control fight. \n \n By John R. Lott Jr.\n \n The U.S. government often makes American gun owners feel besieged. For example, over the last decade it is simply impossible to find one study by either the U.S. Justice Department or the Treasury that measures the benefits from people owning guns. While this has been done by both Democratic and Republican administrations, the Clinton administration surely set new standards for misleading attacks on gun ownership with its studies and public-service ads. \n \n But if you think that is bad, the Clinton administration pales in comparison to the United Nations' attitude on gun ownership. This week the U.N. conference to \"Prevent, combat, and eradicate the Illicit Trade in small arms and Light Weapons in All Aspects,\" which concludes today, puts these views in straightforward terms: Governments have the \"right\" to guns for \"self defense and security needs.\" On the other hand, not one acceptable reason for individuals owning guns is mentioned. And to the extent that individuals do buy guns, third-world and western European countries are pushing for a tax on every gun purchase, with the money then being used to eliminate world hunger. \n \n WHEN GOVERNMENTS ARE A THREAT\n The U.N. claims that guns used in armed conflicts cause 300,000 deaths worldwide every year. The solution proposed in conference's \"Program of Action\"? Keep rebels from getting guns by requiring that countries \"prevent, combat and eradicate\" what those countries who want to stop rebels from getting the guns define as \"the illicit trade in small arms\" \n \n This may be an understandable \"solution\" from governments that don't trust their citizens. But it also represents a dangerous disregard for their citizens' safety and freedom. Why? First, and most obviously, because not all insurgencies are \"bad.\" It is hardly surprising that infamous regimes such as those in Syria, Cuba, Rwanda, Vietnam, Zimbabwe, and Sierra Leone support these \"reforms.\" To ban providing guns to rebels in totalitarian countries is like arguing that there is never anything such as a just war. \n \n In hindsight, would Europeans have preferred that no resistance was put up against Hitler? Should the French or Norwegian resistance movements simply have given up? Surely this would have minimized war causalities. \n \n Many countries already ban private gun ownership. Rwanda and Sierra Leone are two notable examples. Yet, with more than a million people hacked to death over the last seven years, were their citizens better off without guns? \n \n Political scientist Rudy Rummel estimates that the 15 worst regimes during the 20th century killed 151 million of their own citizens. Even assuming that the 300,000-gun-deaths-per-year-in-armed-conflicts figure is accurate, the annual rate of government-sanctioned killing is five times higher. Adding the U.N.'s estimated deaths from gun suicides, homicides, and accidents still provides a number that is only a third as large. \n \n Of course, this last numerical example is questionable as gun control is more likely to increase than reduce violent crime. To put it in its most extreme form, suppose that tomorrow guns were banned, who would be most likely to turn them in? Presumably the most law-abiding citizens - not the criminals. And my own research shows that disarming law-abiding citizens relative to criminals emboldens the criminals to commit crimes. \n \n What about the massacre of civilians in Bosnia? Would that have been so easy if the Bosnian people had been able to defend themselves? And what about the Jews in the Warsaw ghetto during World War II? Wouldn't it have been better if they had more guns to defend themselves? More recently, the rules would have prevented the American government from assisting the Afghanis in their fight against the Soviet Union. \n \n There is a second reason to avoid a ban on small arms. Even in free countries, where there is little risk of a totalitarian regime, gun bans all but invariably result in higher crime. In the U.S., the states with the highest gun-ownership rates have by far the lowest violent-crime rates. And similarly, over time, states with the largest increases in gun ownership have experienced the biggest drops in violent crime. \n \n Research by Jeff Miron at Boston University, examining homicide rates across 44 countries, found that countries with the strictest gun-control laws also tended to have the highest homicide rates. News reports in Britain showed how crimes with guns have risen 40 percent in the four years after handguns were banned in 1997. Police are extremely important in stopping crime, but almost always arrive on the scene after the crime occurs. What would the U.N. recommend that victims do when they face criminals by themselves? Passive behavior is much more likely to result in serious injury or death than using a gun to defend oneself. \n \n TAXING GUN SALES\n Brazil's President Liz Inacio Lula da Silva advocated the arms-sales tax as a way that the world's wealthy nations could eliminate world hunger. French President Jacques Chirac immediately said, \"Lula's idea is a simple one. People must be able to eat three times a day, and that is not the case today.\" Elsewhere Chirac has also called the tax on guns \"quite justified.\" \n \n Yet, this tax makes about as much sense as taxing medicine to help feed the poor. One would think that the rest of the world would understand that the police simply cannot be there all the time to protect people. The 2000 International Crime Victimization Survey shows that almost all the western countries in their survey have much higher violent crime rates than the U.S., including: Australia, Canada, Denmark, England/Wales, Finland, France, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Sweden. (Jeff Miron argues that the relatively high murder rate in the United States is driven not by our gun-ownership rate but by gang violence that results from our drug-enforcement regulations.) \n \n The Bush administration deserves credit for stopping the 2001 U.N. conference from implementing many of the same proposals that are still being pushed now. One thing you can say about those united nations: They sure are persistent. \n \n - John Lott, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, is the author of the new released The Bias Against Guns.",

I was in sierra leone during hte rebellion, nad they did have a working government structure from begining to end. Civilians in rebel controlled portions of sierra leone were hacked apart with machetes (literally) and horribly treated because they had no way to fight back. In several circumstances, entire villages were bypassed by the rebels becasue one or 2 people had ignored the ban on guns. Rebels showed up, took fire from the town, and went and found an easier town to pick on. There was a move by certain british folks who worked for certain british companies to arm the civilian population. Unfortunatly, the UN impoased an arms embargo against sierra leone and short circuited the plan. \n \n \nWhy is gun control more likely to increase crime that reducing it?\n Mind telling us about your own \"research\"?\n You are right about the people who would give uop their gun.

Bullets first!\n \n \n MOLON LABE! emoticon_xkill\n \n United Nations Attack On Gun Ownership\n \n \n and\n \n \n \n \n \n \n The great U.N. gun grab \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \u00a9 2001 WorldNetDaily.com \n \n \n In its most ambitious effort in recent years, the United Nations is meeting this week to discuss ways in which it can legally confiscate privately owned weapons on a global basis. To be sure, that's not the way it is being presented by the press - instead, the conference is theoretically going after small-arms manufacturers, but the net result is the same. \n \n The name picked for the conference makes it sound like the main targets for the legislation are tin-pot dictatorships like Saddam's Iraq: The U.N. Conference on the Illicit Trade of Small Arms and Light Weapons in all its Aspects. \n \n But think again. What constitutes an \"illicit trade\" in small arms when one is dealing with national governments? According to the U.N., the illicit arms trade is \"international trade in conventional arms which is contrary to the laws of states and/or international law.\" \n \n So, the U.N. is meeting to discuss passage of laws making illegal something that, in order to qualify must already be illegal. On its face, then, it would appear this must be the brainchild of the U.N. Department of Redundancy Department. \n \n Although the U.N. stresses that legal weapons, properly obtained, are not on the table, the definition of what constitutes \"legal weapons, properly obtained\" is. \n \n The United Nations' propaganda team has been on this from the start - rolling out numbers to scare the pants off any critics of the conference. For example, it says there are 550 million small arms and light weapons in circulation today. Those weapons, when used in armed conflicts, account for 300,000 deaths annually, says the U.N. Another 200,000 guns are involved in murders, suicides and accidental deaths. Something must be done! \n \n But wait! A half million people die each year from gun-related causes worldwide, whereas more than 2 million people die each year from tobacco-related causes. Where is the U.N. Conference to Confiscate Tobacco? Why no global conference to eliminate this deadly killer - one far more deadly than a dumpster full of guns? \n \n Not everybody killed by guns is an innocent victim of gun violence, either, but the U.N. isn't discussing that. No point in reminding people that guns have been used to save innocent lives - that would just muddy the agenda. \n \n In America, crime is highest where gun control is the strictest. On the other hand, a few municipalities have actually passed laws requiring each household to have a gun. Those citizens who want to opt out have that right, but who has guns and who doesn't is kept secret. \n \n Those cities have proved the sagacity of the 1774 commentary by Thomas Jefferson. In his \"Commonplace Book\" Jefferson observed, \"Laws that forbid the carrying of arms ... disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. ... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.\" \n \n It is interesting to note who stands most strongly behind the U.N.'s plan for global gun confiscation. The Europeans [who hope one day to replace the U.N. as the global government in fact] are very much in favor of it. So are the Canadians, easily among the most propaganda-prone nations of modern times. \n \n U.N. conferees say that \"the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons has fueled many if not most of the recent civil and regional conflicts in various parts of the world, including Africa and the Balkans.\" This argument suggests that cause of war is the availability of guns, rather than disputes between nations. \n \n Following this twisted bit of logic, if there weren't any guns, there'd be no war. Of course, that makes it difficult to put Alexander the Great or Hannibal or Titus into some kind of historical perspective. They didn't have guns, but they managed to conduct very efficient wars, nonetheless. \n \n Secretary of State Kofi Annan said of the conference, \"It is a recognition by the international community that we need to do something about these weapons.\" We can balance against his words the words of history. \n \n \"'Necessity' is the plea for every infringement of human liberty,\" said William Pitt; \"it is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves.\" \n \n \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe,\" observed Noah Webster. \n \n In the Federalist Papers, James Madison outlined the real reason for the global gun grab. It is a matter of simple mathematics. \"The highest number to which, according to the best computation, a standing army can be carried in any country, does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number of souls; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. This proportion would yield, in the United States, an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by [state] governments possessing their affections and confidence.\" \n \n The U.N.'s true agenda is a New World Order with itself at the helm. And the only thing stopping them is Madison's equation. Belgium's Louis Michel offered a solution to the problem presented by Madison's equation - confiscate guns while they are still legal. \"It is our duty to consider the legal aspects directly involved in this illicit trade.\" In other words, disarm everybody, and let the global government sort it out. \n \n After all, if the U.N. conference is successful they'll be the only ones still armed. Except for the criminals. Which would include anybody who still owns a gun.",

   "Guys, people threw total hissy fits about this, then the conference actually came, and a lot of people ended up looking like jackasses. The end result of the conference was that the UN wishes to place restrictions on sales of MILITARY arms between nations. NAmely, the UN wants each country to be responsible for what their arms manufacturers are able to export. \n \n THe funny thing is, the measures the UN wishes to adopt are actually LESS STRINGENT than what US federal law already requires for arms exports.\n \n IN the history of the UN, private ownership of weapons has come up exactly 4 times. twice it was brought up by lobbyists from handguns control inc. BOth times the UN refused to hear their presentation. Once it was brought up by Bill CLinton in a speach to the general assembely, no action was taken. The fourth time it was brought up by the ambassador from the DRC, who complained that neiborghing countries were selling rocket launchers and bazookas to rebels by the truckload and calling them \"personal arms\".\n \n You are entirely right, the anit-gunners have wet dreams about the UN marhing in here in their little blue hats and taking our guns. The first thing they need to do is convince the UN to hear a debate on the issue. THis is simply not going to happen. In the maority of UN nations, ter is no law to prohibit you from having a machine gun or even an RPG in your closet. A vote on banning guns for personal use would be beaten by a landslide. \n \n WE sometimes forget that although we have pretty loose gun laws when compared to western european countries, we have downright draconian gunlaws when compared to most of africa, a large part of asia, and the entire middle east. There are places in Africa where you are required to have at least one designated security guy with you in order to travel, and he is required to be armed with at least a fully automatic AK and carry 500 rds of ammunition. Hand grenades are not required, but encouraged.\n \n The UN wanting to take our guns is a fallacy born from the minds of paranoids and fed by misunderstanding and failure to research the issue. There are a plethrae of articles like the ones you guys have linked, and they are at best wrong, at worst bald faced lies. It is such articles that feed the liberals hopes of blue hatted storm troopers kicking the snot out of american gun owners. It is ust not going to happen. You think we love our guns in America, we are small timers when compared to most of the rest of the world. IT is not at all unusal in most small african markets to see every man carrying a machine gun and every woman a pistol, and they think nothing of it.\n \n As much clout as te US and the western european countries like to believe they have in the UN, they must still walk softly. You will note if you follow the UN that often times the news get about what happens there is not quite on par with what transcripts show. THis is because frankly the western nations and te superpowers are outnumbered. And while these smaller countries do try to do everything in their power to accomodate the US and our allies, they still have to face their own people at home.\n \n This is why occasionally we will see a country stand up to the US when it doesn;t seem to make any sense for them to do so. A recent example of this would be turkey during the war in Iraq. We offered them a billion dollars to allow us overflight privelages and the right to place bases there. They initially accepted and then later refused. This was not because the leaders of turkey didn't want our money, and it wasn' tat they didn;t want to accomdate us. IT was because turkey is one of those places wit an armed citezenry, and the leaders didn't want to be dragged out and shot!",

There is a large base of support for anti-UN paranoia in the united states. The claims of the UN opposition are thet the UN is attempting to institute a one world government and is trying to pre empt domestic governments.\n \n From a logical standpoint, these claims do not hold water. First of all, you are talking about an organisation with no money, no military, and no power besides that which is handed it through a vote of the member nations. The UN is more or less a pure democracy of member nations. How can an organization that is composed of member nations lead a one world government? IF the UN declared itself the world government and declared all other governemtns to be invalid, it would (logically) be the end of the UN ust on the basis that suddenly, by their own definition, they have no more members and thus cease to exist. \n \n \n A government MUST HAVE 3 things in order to exist. The power to tax, the power and ability to wage war (or keep order), and subjects. Lacking any of these items, a government cannot exist. The UN has none of these things. \n \n I have about as much chance of naming myself \"emporer of the known world\" and ordering the disbandment of all other governments as the UN has. There is a lot of talk about what the UN \"wants\" The UN doen't \"want\" anything. The UN is simply a voting body of nations.",

And don't tell me she is Democratic, because no Iraqi cares about that. For them she's American.\n\n \n Wrong:\n \n \n The United States, United Kingdom, and Spain have jointly put forward a draft United Nations Security Council resolution calling for the lifting of economic sanctions against Iraq and the phasing out of the oil-for-food program. France and Russia have opposed the move, arguing that sanctions should be lifted and oil for food ended only after Iraq has been declared free of weapons of mass destruction by U.N. inspectors and the United Nations has been given a lead role in shaping the future of Iraq.\n \n The Bush Administration must resist the temptation to enter into a quid pro quo agreement with other members of the Security Council who are seeking a bigger role for the United Nations in post-war Iraq in exchange for supporting the U.S. resolution. A U.N.-controlled post-war administration would merely serve as a Trojan horse for European nations opposed to regime change, enabling them to stake their economic and strategic claims in Iraq.\n \n Oil for food has become a cash cow for the U.N. and a lucrative source of contracts for Russian and French companies. The revenues from the past sales of Iraqi oil, now controlled by the U.N., are the sovereign property of the Iraqi people and should be turned over as soon as possible to the new Iraqi Assistance Fund, to be held by the Central Bank of Iraq.\n \n Historical Background of Oil for Food\n The oil-for-food program was established by the United Nations Security Council in 1995 \"as a temporary measure to provide for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people\" while economic sanctions remained in place. Of Iraq's population of 24 million, 60 percent are dependent on food shipments administered through oil for food. The program was briefly suspended on the eve of the Iraq War but has been resumed and extended until June 3.\n \n According to the Congressional Research Service, between 1996 and 2003, the program generated over $63 billion in revenues for the Iraqi regime. The New York Times estimates that $13 billion is currently held in trust by the United Nations.\n \n With little oversight from the U.N., the Iraqi dictatorship was able both to circumvent and to exploit the oil-for-food program. According to the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), the Iraqi regime generated $6.6 billion in illicit earnings through surcharges and oil smuggling in the period between 1997 and 2001. Official United Kingdom estimates put the figure as high as $9 billion.\n \n General Tommy Franks has aptly described oil for food as the \"oil for palace\" program. The U.S. government believes that the Iraqi regime used $2 billion of funds provided by the program to build nine presidential palaces. The British government's report on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, published in October 2002, concluded that the Iraqi regime also used illicit oil revenues to develop its chemical, biological, nuclear, and ballistic missile programs.\n \n Who Benefits from Oil for Food\n European powers, including France and Russia, have called for the preservation of the oil-for-food program, largely out of economic self-interest. Although the program was established to benefit the Iraqi people, Saddam Hussein's regime manipulated it to reward countries that helped advance its diplomatic interests, particularly France and Russia. French and Russian companies stand to lose substantial business if the program is ended. The Washington Times reports that, according to U.N. records, Russian firms won about 21 percent of all oil-for-food deals in a recent six-month period. French firms pocketed 6 percent of contracts during the same period. The Times of London has calculated that over the last seven years, Russian companies received $7.3 billion of business through oil for food; French firms earned $3.7 billion.\n \n Oil for food is the world's largest United Nations program. As Claudia Rosett pointed out in The Wall Street Journal, the U.N. oversees \"a flow of funds averaging at least $15 billion a year, more than five times the UN's core annual budget.\" Oil for food is administered by 10 U.N. agencies employing over 1,000 staff internationally and in New York, as well as 3,000 Iraqi nationals. The U.N. has collected a 2.2 percent commission on every barrel of oil sold, and this has generated more than $1 billion in revenue.\n \n Until 2001, all Iraqi oil revenues were held in an escrow account run solely by Banque Nationale de Paris. The money is now kept by several unnamed international banks, all approved by Saddam's regime. The program is shrouded in a veil of secrecy, with little transparency or public accountability. There is no system of external auditing or publishing of accounts. The identity of the banks holding the Iraqi funds is still kept secret.\n \n Key Recommendations\n Dealing with this problem effectively will require several actions. Specifically:\n \n U.N. sanctions against Iraq should be lifted immediately, not simply suspended. Washington must resist making concessions to Moscow and Paris on this issue. \n The Bush Administration should reject calls to link the lifting of economic sanctions and the ending of oil for food to the readmittance of U.N. inspectors to Iraq or the U.N.'s being given a central role in running post-war Iraq. \n All money held in escrow accounts by the United Nations should be handed over as soon as possible to the new Iraqi Assistance Fund. \n U.N. oil-for-food accounts should be opened to full public scrutiny by private-sector auditors in order to uncover possible financial and other irregularities. Measures should be taken against individuals and businesses that profited illegally from the oil-for-food program. \n Conclusion\n The spectacle of countries that bitterly opposed the policy of sanctions against Saddam's dictatorship attempting to preserve the sanctions regime and the oil-for-food program is utterly abhorrent. Iraq's oil revenues must be returned to the Iraqi people. Governments that tried to prevent the removal of Saddam Hussein from power must not be permitted to blackmail the international community and hold the Iraqi nation hostage.\n \n Dr. Nile Gardiner, is Jay Kingham Fellow in International Regulatory Affairs, and James A. Phillips is Research Fellow in Middle Eastern Affairs, in the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for International Studies at the Heritage Foundation.\n \n \n \n \"The U.N. seems to be typical big government: inefficient, sluggish, unaccacountable, and often immoral (as the majority of its constituents represent unelected, oppressive dictatorships). Why people would want to exand the powers of such a monstrosity escapes me. Perhaps its a religious tenant for them.\n \n In the Weekly Standard, Claudia Rossett writes:\n \n Beyond that, if you like Enron-style transparency, you have to love Oil-for-Food. At any given time, the program oversees billions in Iraq's money, awaiting the sludge-slow U.N. process of allocation and disbursement. For the first few years the U.N. parked the cash in a French bank, the Banque Nationale de Paris. More recently, it diversified the funds--currently totaling some $13 billion--among a handful of banks. But the U.N. provides no bank statements to the public, does not disclose the names of the banks, and won't even say what countries they're based in. Auditing is an in-house affair, conducted by government employees of a rotating trio of member states, chaired this year by France.\n Hmmm... French banks get to collect interest on the old Oil For Food program? Interesting. Follow this: The slower the money is in moving through the pipeline, tthe longer we withhold food and medical supplies, the more money French banks make. Good thing we can trust those French auditors to keep things in line!\n \n The fact the auditors themselves are French should give us a bit of a hint as to what geographic region these banks probably occupy. Yet another French monetary incentive for continuing to keep the Iraqi people living on \"Oil for Food\".",

Much bigger than germany and they teach thier childeren to hate the western world.. another parralell you can draw is spains idiotic apeasement to the ETA... Blood is on both the spanish governments hands and the ETA. Appeasment does not work.\n \n \n \n \n\n Do you need a swastika? \n \n\n \n Personally no, but it is my god damn right to paint one on the side of my minivan if I so desire, it is my RIGHT as a freeman to associate with those types without fear of persecution... yes I see the irony in that statment but thats the point. IF YOU LIMIT THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS WHOM YOU DISAGREE WITH YOU ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN YOUR ENEMIES! \n \n point of clarification to those intellectually challenged... I am not a nazi nor do I care for thier politics... I am Reverend Hellh0und and I approve of this message....\n \n \n\n You can tell your kids whatever you want. They are more at home than at school.\n \n\n \n Again Thank you fedgove overlords for letting me keep my childeren at home at night..... You should be able to home school if you wish. the government not letting you is a restriction on your liberty.\n \n \n\n Oh, btw.:\n Thank you my fedgov overlords for giving me a free health insurance.\n \n\n \n Not a right an entilement program that makes quality care harder and harder. And you think its free?!?!?! hows that 50% income tax feel? What else do they tax? What percent of your overall income is taxed (sales, income, use, motor tolls, etc) sit down and figure it out you would be amazed... Now if they cut that tax to 12% wouldn't you be able to afford your own damn insurance?\n \n \n\n Thank you my fedgov overlords for giving me free universities.\n \n\n \n Again how much tax do you pay? who controls what is taught at these univerisities. How many students do not take education seriously at the univeristy level because it is free?\n \n \n\n Thank you my fedgov overlords for a Media that is not locked in at the tides of war.\n\n \n No its locked in a frenzy of anti-american socialist dictator appeasing lunacy! Government approved of course.\n \n \n\n Thank you my fedgov overlords for taxes that don't benefit the rich more than anyone else. \n\n \n Ah yes the Bullplop tax breaks for the rich propaganda... A fireman married to a teacher in the US are considered \"rich\".. Nice try though... But if you really think about it when everyone is taxed so heavilly who can withstand it with their wealth intact... (hint it aint the working man)\n \n \n\n Thank you my fedgov overlords for infringing my rights with the Patriot Act...oops, that wasn't a socialist country...\n\n \n I am against the patriot act applying to american citizens... Think it should be increased for foreigners... BTW show me where in the patriot act that it violates american citizens... Or are you drinking that lunatic fringe kool-aid again?\n \n \n\n Ok, let's get back to a real discussion.\n We liberal whackos can judge the US governmental structure, so please could you conservatives be a bit objective about other countries (to which most have never been and thus shouldn't tell lies about ;) ).\n \n\n \n And we Libertarians can comment on your socialist utopias and point out the flaws in governmental control of its subjects in your world. I am very objective. btw I have been to Germany several times. Not just as a tourist but as guests of friends families and what not. I got a pretty good feel for the deal there....\n \n \n The rest of your post I'll reply to later.\n It takes me some time to carefully read such long texts in English.[/QUOTE]",
