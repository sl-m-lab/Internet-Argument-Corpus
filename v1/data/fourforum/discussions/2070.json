   "Broker,\n \n I'm a crazy liberal with a stock portfolio. So I'll not try and knock down the 308,000 jobs. I was very happy on friday. I'm also waiting for next month and the month after that however. From an objective point of view, Bush needs strong job growth from now on. Because dems will play on what you or someone else has said about negative jobs. See I'm a liberal but a fiscal conservative. I think you should balance a budget and manage our debt. So while I'm upset at Bush because I'm a liberal, I'm upset with Bush because I'm a fiscal conservative, as are some of my relatives who are moderate or conservative republicans. I think John Kerry is a joke. But I'm going to vote for him rather than Bush. I don't hate Bush because he's a republican, I hate him because I fundamentally disagree with his domestic and foreign policy and the handling of many issues that have rise since his term began. The problem with most democrats is that they want Bush to fail. Hell, I hope we get 608,000 jobs next month. I don't want to attack my president. I just say don't give me reason to.\n \n Remi,\n Check out my new website, poeticinjustice.net, I have a forums page as well",

Kerry however seems prone to tax increases that is a major black mark on his record and could really hurt our fragile economy.\n\n \n You're wrong. Tax cuts work only when an industrial economy is able to respond with manufacturing growth, including creation of jobs (not service sector retail jobs), resulting in positive trade, which beings new wealth into the country. We're entering a service economy primarily fueled by consumer and government spending facilitated by both personal and government debt. Under those circumstances, tax cuts reduce tax revenue (2001 was the first time the US realized reduced tax revenue since the 1920s) and effectively create additional government debt to replace the lost tax revenue.\n \n We're currently in an economic situation where the GDP consists of 75% consumer and government spending, again, both enabled by debt, when the high mark for a developed country is considered 60%. That's currently being financed by rock bottom interest rates. We're basically using the same dollars over and over again with no new wealth, which means a multitude of federal, state and local taxes take a bite every time it goes around. How long can even our vast economy sustain those circumstances as the manufacturing sector continues to decline? \n \n Do a simple spreadsheet on national debt service and look at it with say 8% interest rates as the dollar continues it's decline and treasury issues require more interest to apeal to those non-US purchasers who buy 45% of our debt. Or imagine what 8% interest rates would do to our only strong industry, domestic construction. \n \n Rose-colored glasses must be enjoying a widespread selling bonanza.",

   "Of course tax cuts work. First off you have to remember that companies are focused purely on saving money right now in order to keep functioning. Life Savers left my town and went to Canada because they could save a few pennies per pound on sugar. They didn't do this in the past since they were able to make enough money and maintain a primary US factory. So what would tax cuts do to resolve this? First off Life Savers would have saved those few pennies in tax cuts and could have stayed which in turn would have actually added to the US federal tax revenue at this point. Secondly consumers in the US would have had a little extra money to spend meaning sales would be a bit higher for Life Savers. Third, people in my town would have more jobs meaning more tax revenues again as well as a stronger economy. That is the basics of how these tax cuts work. They can help maintain jobs here and in turn will increase tax revenue in the long run.\n \n I guess your ultimate solution would be to increase taxes to revive this economy. That just doesn't make any sense. If you tax the consumer which basically runs this economy then you will set a few things in motion. First, it will be less worth while for companies to stay in the US. Second, the rich will see less benefit to staying in business as they cannot make as much money anymore since they are taxed so bad meaning some will just call it quits and shut down businesses. Third, consumers as a whole will be purchasing less and if the economy starts getting worse they will start hoarding more money in the banks just like the Japanise did for their 20 year recession. How will the government counter act any of this? Consumer spending goes down across the board, businesses shut down or leave, and the inefficient government is the only one left to maintain the balance of our economy.\n \n Money is simply inefficient in government hands and efficient in consumer hands. That is ultimately why the free market exists and works as well as it does while communism does not. You cannot expect the government to be able to keep an economy rolling in my opinion.",

   "Sugar is a commodity in the rest of the world, in the US we heavily subsidize sugar producers and keep their market prices at high, artificial levels with restrictive import legislation. Most candy manufacturers have relocated outside the US not only to reduce their raw material costs, but to primarily reduce labor, facility and compliance costs. Lifesaver is the first I've heard of going to Canada, Mexico seems to be the most popular because of (like Canada) their sugar trade with Cuba. \n \n As I stated, tax cuts do not work as a tax revenue generator unless you have an industrial sector that can respond to decreased taxation with new equipment and facility improvements, increased employment and a portion of production that is exported to expand national wealth. If you look at trade balances, we export far less than we import, meaning we're draining our national wealth, not increasing it. And the feeble attempt of letting the dollar drop to offset trade balances is a scam to polish GDP numbers. That just puts imported producs, like tool steel, which we no longer manufacture in our country, even higher in cost to our manufacturers. Our manufacturing companies, due to our standard of living, are no longer competitive in world markets, even with tax cuts. Any responsible corporate officer with products competing in world markets has or is relocating manufacturing and administrative support outside the US to enable that company to compete with competitive products using lower labor, facility and compliance costs. That's the business side.\n \n Personal tax cuts such as last years 'refunds' cost a dollar. All of those refunds, for the most part, were spent on consumer goods or paying down personal credit card balances to purchase consumer goods, primarily imported, where the bulk of the profit (potential investment capital) flows to the country of origin. Maybe $.10 goes back to the federal government, after local tax bites, leaving a $.90 government deficit, covered by expanded national debt. We're already way over acceptable percentages of consumer/government spending for internal GDP (transaction) numbers, and those numbers are driven by debt, not profits. \n \n I am against any federal taxes beyond providing a military defense, a diplomatic corp and operating a government to manage those affairs with separation of all powers. Old fashioned and doomed thought, but I made my money without government help. \n \n We started our decline from being world industrial power in the 1970s. Our total domination of virtually all world markets, stemming from the industrial capacity we amassed during WWII combined with financially ruined Europe and Asia, was complete for what most historians would consider a long run in contemporary society. We're still the world's largest economy, but we're slowly (due to our massive financial base) coming apart at the seams as other nations become financially healthy and expand their lower cost industrial capacities. Until some event or series of events points out the facts to our public that we're too large with too many social and military demands on our economy to support ourselves on a declining tax base with reasonable debt that eventually produces new wealth, we'll muddle along. But sooner or later, we pay the piper. And the fact that every American isn't entitled by birth to cheap gas, two cars, a big house and disposable income will come as a shock to many people.

Any responsible corporate officer with products competing in world markets has or is relocating manufacturing and administrative support outside the US to enable that company to compete with competitive products using lower labor, facility and compliance costs. That's the business side.\n\n \n The fact of the matter is that if you increase taxes you will in the long run lose businesses in the US and that will mean you make less tax revenues. Lowering taxes will in the long run keep businesses in the US and will eventually increase tax revenues. We have seen this in the 1990's where taxes came down at the beginning of the decade and by the end of it our economy was booming. It was a poorly handled boom on many levels but it was a good example of our country going from recession to boom which in turn balanced the government budget. This all stemed off of the US style of business that you are insisting doesn't work. Technology drives our economy now.\n \n \nPersonal tax cuts such as last years 'refunds' cost a dollar. All of those refunds, for the most part, were spent on consumer goods or paying down personal credit card balances to purchase consumer goods, primarily imported, where the bulk of the profit (potential investment capital) flows to the country of origin.

We're already way over acceptable percentages of consumer/government spending for internal GDP (transaction) numbers, and those numbers are driven by debt, not profits.\n\n \n Are you taking into consideration how many times per year that dollar will be spent? If someone gets a dollar and then uses it to pay off creditors, creditors will use it again to finance someone and will again get it back. It is taxed each time. So I find it unlikely that only 10% of the dollar refund will return to the government within a period of 1 year. Anyways that isn't the point. The point is that the money is actually getting spent in an efficient mannor. Consumers are paying down their debt meaning they have the ability to spend their money on other goods. This in turn fuels businesses and means more people will have a job. That in turn means more people will have money and that again means more profits for businesses. That is the cycle that occurs when people have more money in their pockets to spend. During the Japanise recession people started hoarding their money and quit spending. The government was powerless to end the 20 year recession as they realized it fell on the consumer to get them out of the recession. We are lucky in the US since consumers refuse to quit spending and therefore it makes it possible to get us out of a recession simply by lowering taxes and giving them more to spend.\n \n \nI am against any federal taxes beyond providing a military defense, a diplomatic corp and operating a government to manage those affairs with separation of all powers. Old fashioned and doomed thought, but I made my money without government help.\n\n \n So why would you want the government not to lower taxes for you as well as spending? Lowering taxes increases economic efficiency as it puts money in the hands of those who will spend it wisely namely consumers and businesses. Government cannot spend money efficiently and therefore hampers our economy whenever they get ahold of money. If the government were trimmed down on what they could spend it would increase their own efficiency.\n \n \nWe started our decline from being world industrial power in the 1970s. Our total domination of virtually all world markets, stemming from the industrial capacity we amassed during WWII combined with financially ruined Europe and Asia, was complete for what most historians would consider a long run in contemporary society.

But sooner or later, we pay the piper. And the fact that every American isn't entitled by birth to cheap gas, two cars, a big house and disposable income will come as a shock to many people. They'll find someone to blame, but never themselves.\n\n \n Lets first focus on the fact that we are a country whose economy isn't based on service alone. Primarily we are based on technology and it will prove to be what keeps us an economic power for years to come. For instance, you state cheap gas in your post. What happens when we finally do develop a form of alternate power? We will reap benefits from that in economic savings alone. This is how technology builds our economy. It makes things more efficient saving us money as well as making us money. Another example of technology, our GDP grew rapidly because of the widespread use of credit cards. It increased how fast people could spend money. The same is true of computers. This is why our GDP keeps growing. Technology is evolving how our economy works.\n \n As for us being too large to support our social and military demands, what would you recommend?\n \n What do you recommend for increasing our tax base?\n \n How would you handle the discrepency of imports to exports?\n \n I only ask because you haven't really added any solutions to your arguments so far.

You seem to just be focused on stating how everything is wrong.\n\n \n I offer no solutions because I see none and believe you have to get to the bottom of a decline before things change. Government representation, no political affiliations intended, is in the business of getting re-elected, nothing else. Providing information that could possibly alarm the citizenry is not in their best interests, nor would it be considered responsible government to do so. As an example, I'll use the Federal employment numbers so many people believe in to illustrate that something not reported is actually better accepted by the public than bad news. Each state uploads the number of people in that state who are currently receiving unemployment benefits plus any new numbers filing for benefits and the number of new hires in that state (reported via the Deadbeat Dad requirement of each employer reporting any new hires within 20 days, new jobs created federal number). No numbers are recorded or published on those who exhaust benefits without finding new employment or take lesser paying positions. For a realistic calculation of the unemployed, it would be an easy database match to clock those who remain unemployed or take lesser positions, but not a pretty picture as factories continue to close on a regular basis. \n \n If one studies our GDP numbers, the preponderance of repetitious transactions and personal/public debt jumps out, with fresh capital, the mark of growth and normal interest rates created by expansion demand, being absent. These are not matters touted by any government or brokerage house (the most commonly 'quoted' economists). \n \n We're facing some very difficult financial times in the not-so-distant future. It doesn't take much effort to calculate projected revenue against expenses, determine debt service requirements to cover shortfalls and add future funding requirements based on current and future legislation. The stock markets, other than some transportation and technology issues, are close to or above book value on a majority of companies and they're digging in, not expanding, including Fortune members. I'm old enough to have experienced the boom days of our economy, don't require constant attaboys or maintenance of a positive attitude to make my mark in society and like to take a careful look at a lot of things, the economy included. As my concerns are not with the future, I tend to take a much harder look at what the politicians are saying and discount most highly polished government statements and numbers. \n \n Again, I'm still waiting for someone to show me how we're going to expand our economy, not with service level expansion that churns the same dollar to death, eliminates the middle class and eventually makes abundent social services more attractive than employment, but the 'plan' that will explain how we're going to even match China's true industrial growth over the next ten years and have capital thrown at us as it was during our time as king of the industrial hill.

For China, they are still well behind us in how much technology is incorporated into their economy but they are making jumps. So in short you can only expect that China is going to close the gap on the US for that basic reason and throw in the fact that they have a population that dwarfs our own.

There is no way to compete with it either. It is something that was inevitable.\n\n \n I'm in full agreement with that with the exception of the fact that our industrial production is falling and will continue to decine. Using projected oil consumption as an industrial indicator, China is expected to equal our requirements in less than five years, and that's without China's exploding consumer vehicle demands which are now beginning to take place.\n \n I found it interesting to read China's long-range plans, something we as a nation sorely lack, and how their central committee now manages the country more like a business than anything else. Their successes, from recently being primarily an agrarian society, are impressive. Most of their planning abilities came from educating selective students in the better universities around the world while attracting investment capital to modernize their port and airport infrastructures for distribution purposes without relinquishing control of those assets. To me as a businessman, regardless of how efficient or automated we become at manufacturing, it'll be 20 years before our operating costs drop and China's increase to a point where we again become competitive. Unless, of course, we have an economic crash that forces people to lower their standard of living before inflation eventually accomplishes the same thing. \n \n With our electoral process favoring popular representation, our drift into socialism from industrial production declines will become pronounced as more and more government social engineering is used by politicians to keep the 'natives' under control. That poises two important economic questions, what is our future ability to service expanding national debt with declining revenues at normal interest rates and how long can we continue to attract foreign investment in our treasury issues by letting the dollar fade as a tool to polish trade imbalances to help drive GDP numbers.
