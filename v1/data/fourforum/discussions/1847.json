   "South Dakota's Legislature: Human Life Begins at Conception \n \n Susan Jones, CNSNews.com\n Friday, Feb. 27, 2004 \n \n The South Dakota House on Thursday joined the state Senate in passing a bill that says human life begins at conception - something that would outlaw all abortions in South Dakota, except in cases where the mother's health or life were endangered. \n Pro-abortion groups called the bill \"a direct assault on South Dakotans' rights,\" and pro-life advocates see it as a way of directly challenging the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling that legalized abortion.\n \n The bill's main sponsor, Republican state Rep. Matt McCaulley, called it the \"strongest, cleanest pro-life legislation\" passed by a state legislature since 1973. \n \n Equal Protection\n \n He and other supporters say unborn babies deserve equal protection under the 14th Amendment, and they say the state is within its rights to expand the definition of \"persons\" to include unborn babies.\n \n \"If this is the case that goes to the Supreme Court to get them to overturn Roe versus Wade, so be it,\" a wire report quoted McCaulley as saying.\n \n South Dakota's pro-life Republican Gov. Mike Rounds has not yet said whether he would sign the bill. He has until March 12 to make up his mind.\n \n The bill makes it a crime to perform abortions. The penalties for doing so include up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine, unless a mother's life is in danger. The bill does not include exceptions for rape or incest. \n \n McCaulley estimated that about 800 abortions are performed every year in South Dakota.\n \n 'Be Very Worried'\n \n Every American who \"values a woman's right to choose\" should be worried, said Kate Michelman, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, in a press release.\n \n Michelman said the bill, if upheld by the courts, could endanger the health of women, send doctors to prison for \"doing what is in the best medical interests of their patients,\" and insert government into personal decisions to the point where some widely used forms of birth control might be banned.\n \n \"The anti-choice movement has not been shy about its two-pronged strategy for overturning Roe v.

In politics it tends to work more the other way, slow compromises weaken the other side while big changes just tend to polarise people more.

It's horrible. But making them illegal will not help a damned thing. It will lead to all the things I mentioned before - unwanted, unhealthy, fatherless children, and back-alley butcher abortions.\n \n And there are times when abortion is needed.\n \n Thirteen year old incest victims.\n Rape victims.\n Health/life of mother.\n People who will die if they stop taking medications that they would have to stop taking if pregnant.\n And a thousand stories you don't even know.\n \n You will just have to trust people to make the right choices for themselves.",

   "That's nice. Your perceptions don't reality make.\n\n Neither do yours. Or... perhaps perceptions do dictate reality. Hmm... this is getting a bit metaphysical, but do not your perceptions regarding the topic of abortion dictate, in reality, the actions that you take?\n \n \nThe rights denied would be making one's own reproductive decisions and a right to privacy. They government can't come into my home - why my body?\n\n Ahh... but the 'government' can come into your home and into your body. There are laws against spousal abuse, child abuse, illegal drug use, etc... Any 'rights' that are recognized by our government go only as far as the next persons rights. IF a fetus is recognized as a person, then the government CAN 'come into' your body (so to speak) to protect the rights of that person. Currently the fetus is recognized as a person in some states at different points of the pregnancy, so it is conceivable to suggest that laws can be made to protect the fetus.\n \n \nOh, and comparing the use of a car to a woman's body, you fail miserably to gain any points with that argument.\n\n Points? I'm not trying to gain any points with anybody. The comparison I made is perfectly valid if left in the context in which it was made. Abortion is legal (assuming you meet certain qualifications). Driving a car is legal (assuming you meet certain qualifications). Neither action is an inherent 'right' protected by our government. \n \n \nReally - show me how forced pregnancy will make parents who don't want said babies give a XXXX about said babies.\n\n The burden of evidence is on you, as you are the one who first made the claim. It may seem logical or common sensical to you, but that doesn't make it true. In the book \"Forbidden Grief,\" Theresa Burke, M.D. shows significant evidence (anecdotal and research based) that there are, in fact, many women who have had abortions that attempt to have another baby soon after the abortion to 'replace' the child that they lost.\n \n To suggest that the removal of abortion as an available option will 'force' all women to carry their pregnancy to its natural end implies no women will choose to 'accept' their pregnancy and love their children anyway... even if it was something they would have preferred not to do at that particular point in their lives.\n \n \nThey were frequently performed on themsleves - with coat hangers. In the end only the wealthy will have access to safe abortion.\n\n References??? Data to back up this statement?\n \n I don't have the references off the top of my head, but I have read from multiple sources that most abortions performed pre-1973 were actually done in physician's offices.\n \n \n \nPlease explain to me how forcing a women through a pregnancy she does not isn't controlling her. \n \n You can't.\n \n It is biologically impossible to not control women by exacting this law.\n\n The question of whether or not a pre-born human entity deserves protection as a 'person' according to the law is what is truly at stake. If this entity does not deserve to be recognized as a person, then no one 'should' have the 'right' to say what a woman can or cannot do with her own body.\n \n However, if it is determined that a pre-born human entity does deserve that protection, then it's not a matter of 'controlling' women, but rather protecting unborn women and men from destruction.\n \n The answer to this fundamental question is fuzzy at best according to current laws, and is in no way 'finalized.' This should be evident by the ongoing controversy, regardless of which 'side' you are on.\n \n Incidentally, I do not label myself as either 'pro-choice' or 'pro-life' or any other such rhetoric. If you believe abortion should be legal... good for you! If you believe it should be illegal... good for you! I'm not here to convince you one way or another.",

This is not only an emotional, but often a physical issue. People who have little/no knowledge of the experience of rape might theorize about this subject, but it clear that to those of us who have experienced this form of violence that the reality is much less pretty. Many women who are raped experience varying degrees of physical trauma to their reproductive organs, including and in particular the cervix, which make a pregnancy an extremely painful and potentially permanently injurious option. That is not always the case, but in those cases where it is true, this is not a medically life-threatening condition. Therefore, these women who were already raped now get to experience frequent pelvic exams (which in their case would be painful to excruciating), not to mention the birth process, which is painful enough these days in general, but in their case involves dilating/effacing a potentially bruised and damaged cervix. This will cause not only extreme pain in the cervix, but of course will interrupt and prolong the labor, potentially endangering her life.\n \n Perhaps those anti-choicers who have applauded this new legislation could submit to an approximate equivalent to the amount of pain potentially experienced by these women in their own reproductive organs?

There are people who take life-preserving medications that will harm the fetus.\n \n My point is, there are a thousand stories and reasons that can't be reflected in statistics. The people most intamately involved are more able to make these choices than anyone else. And they may make bad choices. It happens every day.\n \n Another thing about those stats. Most pro-life stats on \"medical necesity\" that I have seen tend to focus on the viability of the fetus, and not the medical situation of the mother. For example I have a friend, physically her body is more than cabable of hendling a pregnancy. However, she is mentally ill and is a diagnosed narcaleptic. For her to go through with a pregnancy would mean stopping her meds, which means not being mentally sound enough to do her job or raise her son (she is a single mother). Her son was three before she as diagnosed, she barely remembers those first years because she was asleep and/or suffering the effects of her mental illness. Plus she was in several accidents due to falling asleep at the wheel. She can't function without her meds.\n \n Anyway - I still don't thing making abortion will do anything but make abortion unsafe.",

The numbers weren't tracked until recently. You are probably right, though. But a lot of other ugly stuff was around back then, too. Women were chattel. The right of men to do as they wished to women and children was allowed. When my Grandma was a young woman she was not allowed the decision to get birth control, my mother was not allowed the decision to get her tubes tied. These decisions were legally given to their husbands. When I was a young girl men were not legally bound to care for the children they decided to leave. People still have a tendency to blame the victim in rape. These things have changed. The right to choose whether to be pregnant is part of that change. I personally have been raped and been the victim of physical abuse (at the hands of my pro-life ex-husband who does not support or contact his son).

There is always a chance of pregnancy - even in women who have had tubal ligations.\n \n There certainly are studies which claim that sex-ed has either had no effect, or actually increases pregnancy and/or abortion.\n \n For instance, there's this article, which notes that teenage pregnancies and STD's generally increased in the UK after the introduction of a sex-ed program: http://www.rense.com/general50/xex.htm (gives a description of some aspects of the program as well)\n \n Another article concerning the UK, form the SocietyGuardian: http://society.guardian.co.uk/publichealth/story/0,11098,669391,00.html\n \n This is a quote from Independent Catholic News also concerning the UK: \n \nThe pro-life charity LIFE, is urging South Warwickshire Health Care Trust to be the first in the country to stop providing the morning-after pills to women through chemists in the area. \n \n Nuala Scarisbrick, LIFE trustee said: \"The government thinks that easy access to the morning-after pill (MAP) will reduce the number of teenage pregnancies but in fact the opposite is true. Between 1992 and 2000 prescriptions for under 16s for the MAP rose by 284 per cent but the overall pregnancy rate among that group remained the same. In Herefordshire, when prescriptions for the MAP rose by 17 per cent in 2000, the underage pregnancy rate shot up by 75 per cent. \n\n \n http://www.indcatholicnews.com/mapri.html\n \n Here is a study by the Guttmacher institute, which calculates the decrease in pregnancies in the U.S. from 1988 to 1995, to be 1/4 due to increase in abstinence and 3/4 due to more effective contraceptives. (in particular, implants) The abstinence rate increased by 2% amoung women aged 15 to 19, overall use of contraceptives appeared to be the same, while use of implants increased. \n \n http://www.agi-usa.org/pubs/or_teen_preg_decline.html\n \n Here's a quote from the Christian Science Moniter, which is talking about a program that focus more on the people in the program, encouraging them to realize their potential: \n \n \n Sex-education researchers are also learning from their mistakes and none is more willing to admit that than Dr. Michael Carrera. He heads up the Children's Aid Society's Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Program that Abraham was a part of in high school. Today, it's one of only four programs with documented, statistically significant success in reducing both pregnancy and births among teens in disadvantaged neighborhoods.\n \n But Dr. Carrera wasn't always so successful.\n \n For the first 25 years of his career, he taught kids all they needed to know about the mechanics of sex education. Armed with all of that knowledge, they still kept getting pregnant. So he decided to focus on their minds as well as their bodies, an \"above the waist\" approach to sex education.\n \n In 1994, he designed a multipart program that focused on developing the teens' potential. In addition to sex education, Dr. Carrera's project includes tutoring for school work, help with job training, and encouraging participation in sports, music, dance and drama.\n \n \"We look at young people as pure potential with gifts and talents,\" says Carrera. \"We create a climate where they grow to believe that they are capable of success and that has a powerful contraceptive effect.\"\n \n Counselors in the program are also encouraged to treat the teens as if they were their own children, not just clients in an after-school program.\n \n \"There's a different kind of urgency - an exploration of all ways possible to get this person to take advantage of something that we as adults know will be good for them,\" he says.\n \n It is unorthodox. But independent evaluations have shown it's effective.\n \n Young women participating in the Carrera program delayed initiating sexual activity and had pregnancy rates that were less than half that of a control group (10 percent versus 22 percent). And the percentage of young women using contraceptives was two and a half-times higher among program participants.\n \n The program, which has been adopted in five states, is less successful among young men in delaying sexual activity, but it did have significant effect on other things, such as improved grades, graduation and college attendance rates, and reduced drug use. \n\n \n http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/1022/p03s01-ussc.html\n \n And, from \"The War Against The Family\", by William Gairdner, this is a paraphrase of his section on the results of sex-ed in the U.S.:\n \n Cost - Between 1971 and 1981, U.S. public federal agencies alone spent over 2 billion promoting sex-ed.\n \n Effect - During the 10-year period, teen pregnancies increased by 48.3 percent, and teen abortions by 133 percent. The U.S. Senate Committee on Labour demographics reported that, among states with comparable demographics, those that spent the most on family planning had the greatest increase in abortions and illegitimate births.\n \n Gairdner's information was mostly from \"Has Sex Education Failed Our Teenagers?\" by Dinah Richard - a compilation of more than 268 studies on the results of contraceptive-based sex-ed programs.\n \n \n And by the way, supplying abundant education and birth control is certainly less intrusive than laws that remove my right to make decisions about my own body.\n\n \n Thats an awfully general statement. It seems to imply that someone who would ban abortion in most cases would also plan on completely controlling women. Do you beleive that is the case?\n \n Also, have you seen any of Parcum's arguements against the claim that the fetus/unborn baby is not simply another part of the pregnant woman's body?\n \n As for intrusiveness, I think a much less intrusive and better idea would be to give parents information about different sex-ed programs, and let the parents teach their children.",

   "Well, I stand corrected, this obviously means that Conservatives are as bad as you think. GOOD LORD!! LOL\n\n \n I challenge you to show me where I said conservatives were bad. As I recall I stated that there are many conservatives in my life that I care about and I even noted the name a very prominent one that I admire.\n \n I was responding to you saying that \"all\" conservatives do or think (can't remember what) by showing you that I know of at least one conservative did not agree with your statement. I never said this guy was bad - the man I quote is one the coolest guys I know.\n \n \nI still fail to see what Conservative policies condone the starving of children and targeting of children in war\n\n \n I never said this. This is a jump you made all on your own. I simply said that these things are equally as tragic as abortion, but do not get the same energy from conservative politics. I then went on the say we all pick our battles. \n \n \nNice try, typical of the left to appear to be above party politics. If you REALLY thought for yourself, you would not have such negative things to say about Bush.\n\n \n WHAT?!!! I have to agree with you and the president to be an independent thinker???!!!! That sounds like being a follower to me.\n \n I don't like President Bush primarly because of all the Homeland Security administration. Both the Patriot Acts are blatant attacks on the Constitution and Bill of Rights. And I am not regurgitating liberal rhetoric here. I was angry about this back when the liberals were voting for them. If my president lacks the courage to protect the constitution, even in the face of danger, I have no use for him. That is how I feel and I came to that conclusion all on my own. \n \n \nC'mon, you would not support ANYTHING he does and you know it.\n\n \n Actually I don't know that - and you certainly don't. I actually support putting energy around terrorism. I was absolutely THRILLED that he sees the AIDS crisis in Africa as important to the US and was willing to pledge our support. I think it's AWESOME that he has visited troops himself.\n \n So guess what - you are wrong about me again.\n \n \nWhere has he lied? That's just the propoganda from the left. Everyone, including those on the left , believed that Hussein had WMD. So, where has he lied?\n\n \n Somone lied. Intelligence was sloppy. And part of being the boss is being accountable.\n \n \nAnd what do you mean, a little more class? We could have annihilated them in 24 hours if we chose to. And you still keep pushing the Liberal \"cowboy\" BS from the Left, how am I to believ that you aren't a Liberal?\n\n \n I believe we could have handled Hussein without war. I think statements like \"bring it on\" are tacky and jeopardizing to the troops.\n \n And of course I am a liberal! I said I wasn't a Democrat.\n \n \nSorry to hear we won't be talking then because I stand by it. You have continued to spew out the lies of the Left, hoping that the more everyone hears them, the more likelihood that people will believe it.\n\n \n I have spewed my personal opinion. You may not like it, but none of it is untrue. It is how I honestly feel.\n \n \nGoebbels would be proud!\n\n \n What? I disagree with you and I am suddenly a nazi? \n \n \nWhen your God Clinton was President and the economy was doing well, I never heard the Republicans talking down the economy. Except for job creation (which is a crock anyway), this economy is doing great, but you people don't have the integrity to admit it.\n\n \n My God is Jehovah/Yaweh - the Christian/Muslim/Jewish God of the Bible and other scriptures. Clinton was my president and you certainly have a misguided view of my regard for the man.\n \n I honestly start yawning when the discussion turns to taxes/economics. The economy is a very fluid and volatile thing. Many, many factors influence it. I find it absurd to give any one person or party credit for it being in good or bad shape.\n \n \nYou can't admit that this regime change in Iraq has worked miraculously well, you have to find the negative in it.\n\n \n I have always felt Hussein had to go. I just did not approve of how it was handled - and I do think we need to get ourselves out of there, now.\n \n \nAnd with all due respect to the hardships you have experienced in your life, this doesn't really fit into the context of principals and integrity.\n\n \n And with all due respect, you don't know enough about me to make the claim that I lack these things. \n \n \nHMMMMMMMMMM sounds like you are saying that Conservatives in general agree with violence, prejudice, hate, bigotry, meanness, selfishness and irresponsibility. And if I'm not mistaken, you seem to have done a pretty good job of stereotyping and demonizing Conservatives.\n\n \n Actually you are mistaken. You said liberals don't have principles. I said that that was a stereotype and listed some of my principles. I never said that conservatives did not have them. That was all you.\n \n Regarding this quote of mine:\n \n \"I rarely see conservatives up in arms over hungry children or the ones we kill in war - only when it is a woman taking ownership of her own body does it seem to offend them. That speaks volumes to me.\"\n \n Yes I said 'conservatives' first. It is generally accepted that \"pro-life\" is the conservative stand on abortion. They are quite vocal about it. Yet there are other equally awful issues that they are less vocal about. I don't think they want children starving or dead from war. I just think it's interesting that we have three awful things, all that kill children, and abortion is the priority. Not saying that is good or bad, but it makes me wonder why.\n \n Sky - you keep putting words in mouth and assigning intention to them that are not mine. Please, quit it.",

There is no other cause of death that even comes close to these numbers in the U.S.A. No matter where any 'social ill' falls on the scale of awfulness, there is nothing that touches the absolute number of deaths caused by abortion. I think that its common in our society to look at our own country first, but even if you looked at worldwide statistics, I wouldn't be surprised if the number of abortions superceded the number of innocent deaths from war and starvation.

But when I talk about sex ed and contraception I am not just talking teens - I am talking about adults. \n\n \n I'm not sure that I follow... are you saying that adults, parents even, need to be taught sex ed. and given contraceptives? I guess that's not much different from my proposal.

Who will want more than parents the best for their children? I think that the primary advantage would be that many parents do beleive their kids can abstain. Note that a 2% increase in abstinence accounted for 1/4 of the reduction in pregancies. (and that's according to the Guttmacher institute, which is affiliated with Planned Parenthood) You say that its not realistic. I can tell you this; as long as we beleive that teens can't control themselves they won't beleive it either. People live up to their expectations, good or bad.",

The trouble is... if you simply say that the bible is the standard... whose interpretation of the bible are you going to use?

For example, if you suggested that we use a completely literal translation of the bible in all cases... that would be a standard we could use. Or if you suggested that we use the standards as defined by the Roman Catholic church (which are well documented), then we would have a standard that we could use for debate. For example, with the latter set of standards, it is correct and valid to say that abortion is immoral. There is no doubt about it.

However, this is not necessarily a valid 'defense' of your position. Pick another action that is perceived to be 'immoral' or 'wrong' by some segment of the population, and it is possible you will find laws imposing these moral standards on the rest of the population.\n \n Murder is often used... but that can be interpreted to imply that abortion is equal to murder, which it is not (by definition). So, let's take stealing as an example. Person X may think stealing is horrible, but believes that Person Y should be able to make his own decisions about whether or not he steals, so therefore, Person X believes that there shouldn't be any laws that 'restrict' Person Y's decision to steal or not to steal. The reality is that no matter what laws are in place, Person Y still is able to make the decision to steal. Laws do nothing to restrict that freedom. Laws impose consequences (when enforced). The reality is that we do have laws in place to protect individuals other than Person Y from being victimized by Person Y's stealing. If Person Y is caught and found guilty, then Person Y can be punished according to the law. Person X can believe that those laws shouldn't be in place, but the laws are in place.\n \n I am not suggesting that abortion 'should' be made illegal. I AM suggesting that there is no more of a valid defense to keep abortion legal as there is to make it illegal.\n \n The action of stealing is not in and of itself objectively 'wrong.' It is just stealing. It is only 'wrong' when someone applies a set of moral standards (religious, social, or otherwise) to the action and labels it wrong. The same thing can be said of abortion. Stealing has consequences. So does abortion.\n \n No matter what precautions are taken, with few exceptions, there is a possibility that the act of sexual intercourse between a man and a woman MAY result in a sperm successfully fertilizing an egg. This fertilization begins the biological processes of a unique human entity. (Prior to that point, a unique human entity was not in existence in the physical world.) Anyone engaging in sex (whether forced or consensual) must accept that a fertilized egg is a possibility as a result. To deny that an egg may be fertilized is not reality. None of this is controversial. It just is.\n \n If that possibility comes to fruition, then the individuals involved that are capable of thinking and communicating (the couple, or possibly just the mother) must make a decision. At least two of the options are to abort the unique human entity that has begun developing, or carry the human entity until it 'naturally' exits the mother's body -- whether that be through miscarriage or birth (c-section included as 'natural' for convenience here). Again, this is not controversial... it just is.\n \n Anyone engaging in sex (forced or consensual) must accept the possibility (even with the best birth control outside of abstinence) that they MAY be forced to make a decision what to do in the event an egg is fertilized and begins to develop.\n \n I am not suggesting here that sex is solely for procreation. I AM suggesting that procreation happens through sexual intercourse. Whether they realize it or not, anyone engaging in sex accepts the possibility that a pregnancy may occur as a result of that action. Again, this is not really controversial.\n \n (sorry... this was more of a ramble than I intended... I think I'm done for now.)",

An abortion physically removes the consequence that the woman/couple accepted as a possibility.\n \n This proposed South Dakota law is simply giving the pre-birth human entity equal rights as post-birth human entities.

At least against the other person's will.\n \n However, what definition of 'rights' are you using? Legal rights are not absolute. They can change. Perceived rights are merely opinions.\n \n A valid argument could be made as follows:\n A man and a woman who engage in sexual intercourse accept that a potential outcome of their activity -- whether desired or not -- is a fertilized ovum. Once an ovum is fertilized, a unique member of the human species comes into existence by biological definition. By accepting the possibility of a pregnancy, it could be argued that the man and the woman have already consented to allowing the new member of the species to use the woman's bodily resources for protection, nourishment and oxygen. And it could be argued that the man and the woman now have the responsibility for protecting and providing for the new member of the species, whether it was wanted or not.\n \n One parallel that supports this argument is that a man and a woman who create a new member of the species and bring it into the world through birth are held responsible for this new entity whether they want it or not. There are ways of relenquishing the responsibility (adoption, or the program to which Mizmaxx referred earlier where a woman can leave her child with a hospital), but the man and the woman cannot legally abandon the child to die, regardless of their desire to raise it.\n \n Note that I am not saying the way that it 'should' be... but rather that it 'could' be, without taking away any individual's legal rights.",

   "So it is pointless to attach specific meaning to them also.\n\n I'm not certain what you are trying to say here. The point I am attempting to communicate is that it really makes no difference in reality what labels are used. Labels do not change the reality of what is happening. A rose by any other name... Some individuals state that abortion kills a baby. Other individuals state that abortion rids the mother of an unwanted blob of cells. Both are accurate statements, depending on the perspective of the individual making the statement. Neither statement changes the reality of what an abortion actually is or does.\n \n \n \nTell me why you believe that anyone has 'tried to redefine pregnancy'?\n\n \nBecause of what they say, about how a pregnancy begins at fertilization.\n\n Who are 'they'? You should check your facts before you argue this point too confidently. The currently accepted medical definition of pregnancy indicates that pregnancy begins with implantation. This current definition didn't arise until the late 60's or 70's when it was changed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Fertilization (which is synonymous with conception) is still widely regarded as the commencement of a pregnancy both in common usage of the term and by biologists and embryologists. Though I recognize that websites aren't necessarily authoritive on any subject, a quick google search brought up these sites (see below) that discuss prenatal development, and none of them make a distinction that pregnancy or prenatal development doesn't start until implantation. My point isn't to prove that pregnancy begins at fertlization. My point is that defining the commencement of pregnancy makes only semantical difference... it does not change the fact that a unique entity begins developing at fertilization/conception. \n \n http://www.childdevelopmentweb.com/InfoTopics/PrenatalDev2.asp\n http://departments.weber.edu/chfam/Prenatal/frames1.htm\n http://www.childdevelopmentinfo.com/development/prenataldevelopment.shtml\n http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/dept/d46/psy/dev/Spring00/prenatal/index.html\n \n \n \n \n Carla -- It appears that you are contradicting yourself in the following summary of our most recent exchanges. Not that you can't change your mind. And I may be mis-inerpreting. But this exchange developed like this:\n \n \nSome anti-choice people also oppose birth control, which I find to be the height of hypocricy.\n\n I explained that some forms of artificial birth control may destroy a post-conception entity, then stated, \"So, actually, according to the commonly used definition of the word 'hypocrisy,' it would be more appropriate to call anyone who claims to be 'pro-life' but promotes the use of birth control pills or IUD's a hypocrite.\" Your response:\n \nNot really...\n\n I replied, \"And tell me why you believe that someone is 'not really' a hypocrite if they profess that life begins at conception, yet they are fine with post-conception / pre-implantation embryos being intentionally destroyed.\" Your response to this was:\n \nI don't.\n\n Unless I am mis-interpreting your comments (which is possible) it seems that this contradicts your first statement that \"Some anti-choice people also oppose birth control, which I find to be the height of hypocricy [sic].\" So I am left wondering whether you would call someone a hypocrite for professing one thing and opposing that which contradicts what they profess.\n \n Somewhere in the middle, you introduced a separate statement:\n \nHowever, to be \"pro-life\" and also support the death penalty, THAT has always seemed hypocritical.\n\n This statement is valid. I found no reason to comment on it, as I agree that it is hypocritical to support the death penalty and claim to be 'pro-life.' Yet you are continuing to promote this red herring argument by stating again:\n \nBut I do find it hypocritical when \"pro-life\" people support the death penalty.

   "ROCC -- What you seem to be suggesting here is that the bible dictates that abortion is wrong and that there are no other possible interpretations of the bible. You are welcome to believe that. Some people do not agree with you. Some people believe that your perspective is wrong. Carla is correct that nowhere in the bible does it say, \"Abortion is wrong.\" You are correct that the bible has several references about biblical characters being 'formed in the womb.' I may be mistaken, but I don't believe Carla is suggesting that people are not formed in the womb. On the contrary, I don't think any educated individual can reasonably argue that the physical body was not formed in the womb.\n \n So, what do we have here??? On this particular issue, though no one asked for it, I am going to offer my two cents and say that Carla is on solid ground. If you are suggesting that the only way and the unbiased and 'right' way to interpret the bible is your way, then I will assert that you are quite wrong. Carla is proof that you are wrong. My friend who is a Lutheran pastor is proof that you are wrong. If we took the time to list them all, I assure you that the list of 'proofs' would be quite long.\n \n I realize that this line of discussion came about because somebody (jitobear, I believe) said that they read the bible and believed in God, but still supported a woman's right to a legal abortion. There is not just one way to interpret the bible, nor is there only one way to practice a life that someone feels God called them to, Christian or otherwise. To believe that your view of God is the only right view ignores the validity of the viewpoints of many, many other individuals far more spiritual, far more religious, far more educated, far more wise than you or I are. On a larger scale, using the bible to make something wrong is not valid to anyone who doesn't regard the bible as holy or as God's word (assuming a God even exists). At the end of the day, you may find you are 'right' and everything that you say is justified. Or you may find that you are 'wrong' and feel sheepish. Or you may even find that you believe one way and live your life according to those beliefs and someone else lives their life another way and lives according to their own beliefs and neither of you are right or wrong.

   "I must not have been paying close attention... I didn't notice this post right away. Here are a few of my comments:\n \n \nCertainly. Laws can be passed, removing people's rights, discriminating against them.\n\n And laws can be passed that recognize people's rights that were previously unrecognized.\n \n \nWell, that's a bit more iffy. Using the species concept to contrast developmental stages is not entirely valid. The species concept is for comparisons between species. Using it intraspecies causes all sorts of trouble with definitions.\n \n And \"unique member\" seems a bit contrived as well. At fertilization, it is a free-floating cell, which only have around a 40% chance of implanting and begin meaningful development.\n \n So using \"biological definition\" borders on the iffy here. But that's more for clarification. The argument itself is OK for our discussion's purpose.\n\n Granted. I have yet to come up with suitable labels to describe the concept. My point is simply this... a unique entity comes into existence when a sperm fertilizes the egg. This entity is by definition unique because there is not another identical entity in existence, nor has there ever been. It is an 'entity' because it has mass. It is real in the physical world. True, it may not implant in the uterine wall and continue it's development. That doesn't preclude it's existence, nor it's uniqueness.\n \n Your assertion that 'meaningful' development is a matter of opinion. I assert that the development prior to implantation is just as 'meaningful' as development after implantation -- given that you feel a need to assign meaning to development. In reality, I cannot even assert that any of the development is 'meaningful.' Rather, I would just say that development happens prior to implantation. To suggest otherwise, it is necessary to use semantical arguments such as 'meaningful.'\n \n None of this is 'iffy' as you suggest. It simply is. You can make it iffy by making implications or assigning meaning to the words used, but the point that I am making is that it doesn't matter what meaning it has to you... what happens is still what happens.\n \n \n \n \nNo, THAT I disagree with. By engaging in behaviors that can cause untowards outcomes, we do not consent to that untoward outcome. We don't consent to lung cancer merely because we smoke. We don't consent to heart attacks by eating junk food and sitting by the computer, typing on Delphi, rather than being out exercizing.\n \n We consent that we take risks in life. That doesn't mean that we consent to actually having these occur. Otherwise, we would have to shut down nearly all medical treatment.\n\n Re-reading my statement that invoked this response from you, I realize that I may not have stated the concept very clearly. I am not suggesting that we are consenting to any specific outcomes, but rather that we are consenting to the possibility of those specific outcomes. With no exceptions I am aware of, everything we do involves some amount of perceived risk on some level. If the individual is aware of the risk, they may decide whether or not the cost/benefit is worthwhile in their particular circumstances. In the case of smokers... they do not consent specifically to lung cancer developing in their bodies. But the possibility of developing lung cancer is certainly greater if you are a smoker. (I'll assume you accept this as true and do not need resources to back it up.) Regardless of whether or not someone is ignorant of the fact or accepts the fact and still decides to light up is irrelevant. That smoker is consenting -- by default... through the act of smoking -- to allowing themselves a higher risk of developing lung cancer. Just as someone who engages in sexual intercourse consents -- by default -- to the possibility of having a sperm fertilize an ovum. What the woman/couple decides to do with the developing entity is another matter.\n \n \n \nNo more than they have the responsibility to nurtur the lung tumor or the STD. When we expereince the untoward consequense of our choice, we insist on treatment of that untoward outcome (chemotherapy, abortion, cardiac cath, antibiotics).\n\n Here's where the distinction comes in that you seem to be ignoring... A possible consequence of sexual intercourse is the creation of a zygote -- to which nothing will be added except nourishment and oxygen during its entire biological life. A zygote is distinct from a tumor in that a tumor is not an entity that may develop into a fully grown adult. A zygote is such an entity. If you choose to assign value to things, then it is just as valid to assign the same value to a zygote as you would to a newborn. It is also valid NOT to assign the same value to the two entities. Regardless of the value assigned to entities, there is a major distinction between a zygote and a tumor.\n \n Under the assumption that a zygote can be assigned value equal to that of a newborn (which is a valid assumption, whether or not that's how YOU believe, Carla)... it would be perfectly valid to say that the woman/couple engaging in sexual intercourse has consented to the possibility of creating something that has value equal to that of a newborn. Should this possibility become reality, they will be faced with either allowing the pregnancy to continue to it's 'natural' end, or forcibly terminating the development of this entity that has value equal to a newborn.\n \n \n \nAgain, I don't accept any \"member of the species\" until they actually are born, individual members.\n\n Great. Good for you! You have an opinion. \n \n \nOr an abortion, a medical treatment to fix the medically undesirable outcome.\n\n Sure... this is currently a legal option that is available. This South Dakota law would have recognized the rights of the pre-birth entity as equal to those of a newborn (a valid perspective), and would have made that option illegal.\n \n \nBut the fetus is not a child. The child's rights comes from it being a person. I can not accept the claim that a zygote or an embryo is a person.\n\n You may not wish to label a fetus as a child. That's your prerogative. Do not try to force your view on others! (Sorry, I couldn't resist... I've always found that line to be humorous. I recognize that you do not believe you are forcing your personal views on others.) Just because you cannot accept the claim that a pre-birth entity is a 'person' does not mean that the pre-birth entity cannot be considered a 'person' -- whether by other individuals or by the government via laws.\n \n \nI just see multiple problems with your scenario.\n\n No problems exist with the scenario, except those problems you wish to see. Sorry... that may have sounded kinda Zen-like or something. That's not what I intended.",

   "Wow, this thread is growing fast. \n \n \nAs it is unaware, it is not possible to affect it in a meaningful way, in this context. \n\n \n As I said before, I am unaware while sleeping. I would never know it if I were gassed while sleeping. Indeed, the unborn baby or fetus who does feel pain is more aware of what is happening than I am.\n \n \nThere is no embryonic of fetal right to life, so yes definitely. \n\n \n This sounds like you were saying that legality automatically justifies something, however, I think that you didn't mean this, since you also have stated that unjust laws can be passed. \n \n The question is whether you think it ever valid that the right to choice superceeds the right to life. You avoid the question by saying that the unborn child or fetus has no right to life, according to current law. \n \n \n To the woman who seeks the abortion, yes it does. We are not the expert in her life, we can't say what is good for her; only she can. \n\n \n As I have seen many times in this forum, I am arguing on the presumption that the unborn baby or fetus is a valuable human being - no different than a newborn in worth... while someone I'm arguing with is aguing with the opposite presumption. I think the debate really revolves around whether the unborn human should have no value or rights, or should have great value and rights. (Unless you do beleive that the right to life can be superceeded by the right to choice)\n \n I mentioned that many assert that abortion is damaging and have been replied to by you, Mizmaxx, and Jitobear. I agree with bootfitter that this isn't what's really important. After all, smoking is damaging, but I find it worrisome that my cities' government has outlawed smoking in all public places, and especially that they have defined private property used to provide services (restaraunts) as public. I did mention it, partially because the opposite arguement is often used to support abortion. As to the claim that things like child abuse would be worse without abortion, that has no foundation. It was beleived that abortion would decrease the mentioned things. They increased, dramatically. If other factors such as a weakening of the family could be shown to be the likely cause, then you have a case. As it is, it is likely that abortion was a factor, or at least had no positive effect.\n \n According to this site: http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=baby \n \"Baby\" includes unborn human beings. I say unborn baby because I think fetus is a very cold term that makes it difficult to see the unborn human as special, unique, and valuable. On the other hand, if we were to only refer to the unborn human as \"child\", \"baby\", or \"human being\", then you easily can see them as valuable beings worthy of a right to life. Thats why pro-choicers refer the the said being as \"blob of tissue\", \"controlling the woman's body\", or draw parrallels to cancer, and why pro-lifers say \"baby\", \"child\", and \"murder\". Its semantics. In order to use fair language, I have decided to refer to the unborn human as \"unborn baby or fetus\".",

   "I think you're mixing up harm reduction with utilitarianism. Harm reduction originates in the field of health providers for drug users, but is now a broad philosophy of health care services in general. There's more info on-line, if you're interested. It has nothing to do with belief or disbelief in \"a Creator\". \n\n \n I see... harms reduction means \"they're going to do it anyways, so we might as well make it as safe as possible\". I assume you wouldn't follow harms reduction when another human being's right to life is involved. If so, our disagreement lies with wether or not the unborn human is as valuable as the newborn.\n \n \n I wouldn't bother.

That makes no sense. \n \n Organisms that can feel pain we should avoid inflicting pain on. Human or not. We should avoid killing when we can. However, I'm not going to refuse to take antibiotics based on the bacteria's \"right to life\". Obviously a human fetus is not bacteria, but it isn't a born human either. Life is full of hard choices. Whether or not to have an abortion is one of them.\n\n \n I beleive that human beings are priceless. That stems from my beleif that God created us in his image. I completely beleive that animals should not be killed or damaged for no reason, I beleive they are amazing creations as well. One of God's directives to mankind in the Bible is to be a caretaker for earth. I can't say I've thought much about the morality of animal testing... but I think if such testing can save human life it is justified. \n \n I have to say once again that the disagreements here seem to boil down to whether we view the unborn human as different from the born one, with regards to rights and value.",

I believe it's bad to make a being endure unnecessary pain. Abortion is not applicable to the above. \n\n \n You know, George Washington once said, \"Let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion.\" I think the reason why is that religion (at least the Christian religion) gives us an ultimate authority that is greater than politicians and judges, who says that human life is sacred. It gives us a reason to believe that every life has worth, such that it is worth dying to save a life. I try to imagine a basis, a reason to beleive that without beleiving God created us. And I can't. I can't see why we should care about starving kids if they are nothing more than complex dust. I don't see a reason that we should consider a violent society less desirable than a peaceful one, if there's no ultimate morality that says peace and love are Good. Otherwise, why should we impose our belief that murder or torture is bad on others? I suppose out of self-interest, like what Charchuck said once. (Although I see no reason to think our own self-interest is worth anything without God either, it seems that almost all people do think it is) I want a society where people aren't \"randomly killing each other\" because that means I probably won't be killed. I want a society of honest people because then I probably won't be cheated. Why should we bother with groups of society who can't speak for themselves, whom we can't really imagine what it might be like in their shoes? (That's why I find it fundamentally disturbing to see a picture of, or read words written by, someone who survived an abortion. That could be me.) Especially if they are a burden to the self-interest of the rest of us. Why not have a utilitarian society? \n \n Then there are people, many people, who beleive that life is valuable, though they aren't \"superstitious\". Who beleive that unnessecary pain is wrong, whatever they beleive \"wrong\" means. Why is that? Is it because our culture teaches us that from birth? Or maybe its because its a Truth, written on all our hearts. Maybe these people contradict what they beleive (that we are complex chemicals, nothing more) because they Know that life is valuable. \n \n \n Second, as I said, we are not comparing an infant 24 hrs before it will be born from an infant the minute after it is born, we are comparing an 8-12 week old blastocyst/fetus to a newborn. \n\n \n I guess I missed that. Do you not support partial birth abortion then? (excepting any possible case where the mother's life is in danger) \n If you don't beleive in rights, then why shouldn't it apply to a more developed human?\n \n \n For one, it's not a \"real time video\". Its a piece of visual propaganda, heavily edited, with fake sound effects and slo-mo camera work. It's like how B movie directors make their monsters look scary when they're just a 4 inch high plastic doll. Camera tricks.\n \n I also don't see how an abortion could be interesting to watch. Seems a little wierd to me, unless you're an ob/gyn surgery resident. \n\n \n Yes, I saw the arguements that it is doctored. That's why I said it would be interesting to see a real-time video. I want to know if the unborn human does feel pain, I want to know if it really does look like a 'blob of cells'. I beleive that we as a society share the responsiblility, and I don't want to look the other way, and say that its not my problem, it doesn't affect me.\n \n \nI get it. You believe in the church, I don't. That's the difference here. It has nothing to do with relative value, it has to do with your religious beliefs, that I don't share.\n\n \n I think it does have to do with beleif, because it is my beleif that convinces me that life is valuable, that it is an inalienable right.\n \n I think it does have to do with value. Virtually everyone beleives that its wrong to murder someone who has been born. I consider that a universal moral, and don't understand why it shouldn't apply to someone who is just short of being born. When it comes to the 8-12 week old, it is harder to argue, I admit. Emotionally, it is much harder to view those human beings as valuable.\n \n This is what Focus on the family's site says about the 8-12 week-old:\n \n Fetal Development-8-12 Weeks\n by Pregnancy Resource Ministry\n \n At a little more than an inch long, the developing life is now called a fetus - Latin for \"young one\" or \"offspring.\"\n \n Everything is now present that will be found in a fully-developed adult.\n \n The heart has been beating for more than a month, the stomach produces digestive juices and the kidneys have begun to function.\n \n At week 12, the fetus now sleeps, awakens and exercises its muscles energetically - turning its head, curling its toes, and opening and closing its mouth.\n\n ( http://www.family.org/pregnancy/articles/A0030209.cfm )\n \n \n And this is what Religious Tolerance.org says:\n \n \n 2 months: The embryo's face resembles that of a primate but is not fully human in appearance. Some of the brain begins to form; this is the \"reptilian brain\" that will function throughout life. The embryo will respond to prodding, although it has no consciousness at this stage of development. The brain's higher functions do not develop until much later in pregnancy.\n 10 weeks: The embryo is now called a fetus. Its face looks human; its gender may be detectable.\n\n ( http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_fetu.htm )",

   "Some individuals state that abortion kills a baby. Other individuals state that abortion rids the mother of an unwanted blob of cells. Both are accurate statements, depending on the perspective of the individual making the statement. Neither statement changes the reality of what an abortion actually is or does.\nI have been remiss in this tread, so here is my flurry of answers.\n \n I am sure you will back this up as well, when somebody tries to impose \"baby\" laws on the fetus, despite the reality that it is noit a baby, right, that the reality of it being a fetus excludes it from laws to the contrary. Thanks for that unbiased involvement. :-)\n \n \nWho are 'they'?\nThe anti-birthcontrol crowd, mainly bolstered by fundies and catholics.\n \n \nYou should check your facts before you argue this point too confidently. The currently accepted medical definition of pregnancy indicates that pregnancy begins with implantation. This current definition didn't arise until the late 60's or 70's when it was changed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Fertilization (which is synonymous with conception) is still widely regarded as the commencement of a pregnancy both in common usage of the term and by biologists and embryologists.\nActually not. Fertilization is the beginning of the developing embryo. It is NOT the beginning of the pregnancy. The pregnancy is what happens to the woman, not to the fetus. \n \n You should check your facts before you argue this point too confidently.:p \n \n \nThough I recognize that websites aren't necessarily authoritive on any subject, a quick google search brought up these sites (see below) that discuss prenatal development, and none of them make a distinction that pregnancy or prenatal development doesn't start until implantation.\nLOL. You are trying to teach me about my field of practice. Note that prenatal development certainly begins at fertilization, but doesn't have anything to do with the pregnancy. Pregnancy is about the woman, not the fetus. Embryologic development has to do with the embryo/fetus, pregnancy doesn't. This might be a distinction you have not thought about before?\n \n \nMy point isn't to prove that pregnancy begins at fertlization. My point is that defining the commencement of pregnancy makes only semantical difference... it does not change the fact that a unique entity begins developing at fertilization/conception.\nAh, but \"unique entity\" is kind of a dubious claim. Would you call a Hydatidiform Mole \"a unique entity\"? And again, embryology is different than pregnancy.\n \n \nCarla -- It appears that you are contradicting yourself in the following summary of our most recent exchanges. ... \n\n \n The point here is that to be against abortion, while also opposing what could prevent unwanted pregnancies (and hence also abortions), that is hypocritical.",

   "Sorry, I, like most Christians, believe God to be unbiased and love us all the same. Christians belive God has a purpose for us all.\n\n \n Ah, but when God speaks directly to Jeremiah, then he is not speaking to us. He is speaking to a unique individual for whom God has unique and and great purpose.\n \n \nJob 31:15-\"Did not he who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same one form us both within our mothers?\" \nSo?\n \n \nWhat are you talking about? The verses says in plain english that God made us in our mother's womb.\nSo? Where is abortion condemned? What we are seeing here is that you are trying to INTERPRET God's word to fit your political agenda. As far as I know, that fits the definition of blasphemy, the using of God's word for one's own purpose.\n \n \n\"Jeremiah 1:5 - \"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.\"\nWell, this shows 2 things. Second part shows that Jeremiah WAS unique. We were not all called on to be prophets to all nations. Only two people have ever been called to be that.\n \n First part does indeed show that God \"knew\" Jeremiah BEFORE he was formed in the womb. Per any anti-choice proponent, as \"life\" is claimed to start at conception, this must mean that the essense of what makes up Jeremiah, the entity that God knew as Jeremiah was in existence BEFORE fertilization, BEFORE there was any physical form that could be called Jeremiah. That is before even conception. That means that what God knows as Jeremiah, is NOT the body, not the physical cells. As such, what is the unique objection to aborting cells? This verse clearly shows that the physical shape is NOT what God knows as us, as the \"unique entities\" as Bootfitter likes to call it.\n \n If anything, this shows that God has no dealings with our physical bodies. The bodies are not what God considers uniquely us. So what is then the objection to abortions? That God wants to preserve something that God doesn't even consider to be us?\n \n \nYes, but we do know that it was \"in the womb\".\nYou are in error. We know that it was BEFORE the womb. God specifically states that he knows Jeremiah \"BEFORE I FORMED YOU IN THE WOMB.\" \n \n \nYou have argued that a baby should not have human rights until it exits the womb.\nAnd your claim now is that there are rights, even BEFORE fertilization\n \n \nYou lack the biblical knowledge to argue that the bible is OK with abortion.\nI don't lack the knowledge that the Bible doesn't speak against abortion. On the other hand, you have NOT shown that the Bible speaks against abortion. You have made your inferrences and assumptions based on your politics, but the Bible itself does not state any of what you claim it does.\n \n \n\"Again, the closest we get is that God places more value on the woman than on the fetus (Ex 21:22-24)\n\n \n \nIf you go back and read, you can see what I've already posted about that verse.\n\n Yes, if I remember right, we have disagreed about that before.",

   "True, it may not implant in the uterine wall and continue it's development. That doesn't preclude it's existence, nor it's uniqueness.\nNor its lack of future existence.\n \n \nYour assertion that 'meaningful' development is a matter of opinion. I assert that the development prior to implantation is just as 'meaningful' as development after implantation -- given that you feel a need to assign meaning to development.\nPoor choice of words. Lets just call it development that will impact the future. For the non-implanted zygotes, no amount of development will impact their future.\n \n \nNone of this is 'iffy' as you suggest.\nThe iffiness comes from (1) the use of the species concept to contrast developmental stages. The species concept is designed to, and defined on basis of comparisons between species.\n (2) claiming the unimplanted zygote to be a unique \"member\" of the species. Now, there is significant controversy over claiming a zygote to be a member of anything.\n \n \nI am not suggesting that we are consenting to any specific outcomes, but rather that we are consenting to the possibility of those specific outcomes.\nOK. I agree with that.\n \n \nIf the individual is aware of the risk, they may decide whether or not the cost/benefit is worthwhile in their particular circumstances.\nCertainly. Of course, also note that all info goes into C/B analysis, incl. the availability of abortions.\n \n \nIn the case of smokers... they do not consent specifically to lung cancer developing in their bodies. But the possibility of developing lung cancer is certainly greater if you are a smoker. (I'll assume you accept this as true and do not need resources to back it up.)\n ;) No, I am quite aware of the data, thanks. I deal with that every day.\n \n \nJust as someone who engages in sexual intercourse consents -- by default -- to the possibility of having a sperm fertilize an ovum. What the woman/couple decides to do with the developing entity is another matter.\nWe are in agreement.\n \n \nHere's where the distinction comes in that you seem to be ignoring... A possible consequence of sexual intercourse is the creation of a zygote -- to which nothing will be added except nourishment and oxygen during its entire biological life.\nKind of correct, except for the exceptions.\n \n \nA zygote is distinct from a tumor in that a tumor is not an entity that may develop into a fully grown adult. A zygote is such an entity.\nActually, the hydatidiform mole, which essentially is a cancer, is also starting as a zygote. So there is more to it than just simplistically claim the zygote to be only growth away from adulthood. But yes, I do get your point.\n \n \n If you choose to assign value to things, then it is just as valid to assign the same value to a zygote as you would to a newborn. It is also valid NOT to assign the same value to the two entities.\nCertainly. However, the BIG  question is who gets to place the value. Thew woman, whose body is pregnant, and who will be the one who carries the burden of pregnancy, should she so desire, or the rest of us, who then place the embryo above her?\n \n \nRgardless of the value assigned to entities, there is a major distinction between a zygote and a tumor.\nIn some cases. Occationally, they are the same (1:1500 pregnancies).\n \n \nhe assumption that a zygote can be assigned value equal to that of a newborn (which is a valid assumption, whether or not that's how YOU believe, Carla)...\nI, of course disgree with that being a valid assertion (you know me, meak and unopinionated ;) )\n \n \n it would be perfectly valid to say that the woman/couple engaging in sexual intercourse has consented to the possibility of creating something that has value equal to that of a newborn. Should this possibility become reality, they will be faced with either allowing the pregnancy to continue to it's 'natural' end, or forcibly terminating the development of this entity that has value equal to a newborn.\nWell, lets turn it on its head. Do YOU have the right to use another eprson's bodily resources agianst their will? Can they be forced to give blood or a kidney to keep you alive? \n \n Of course not. A person can die in front of your eyes, your bodily resources being the only thing that can help them, and nobody can do anything against you if you refuse, as you can not be forced to sustain other people's lives through your own bodily resources. As such, why would you give the fetus powers over the woman that no person holds? That will relegate te pregnant woman to a second-class citizen, with less right to her own body than anybody else. In fact, as others get to rule her body, how is that different than slavery?\n \n \nGreat. Good for you! You have an opinion.\nLOL. Kind of like you, eh? ;) \n \n \nSure... this is currently a legal option that is available. This South Dakota law would have recognized the rights of the pre-birth entity as equal to those of a newborn (a valid perspective), and would have made that option illegal.\nWell, it would give the fetus FAR MORE rights than a newborn. The newborn doesn't have the RIGHT to have the woman give of her bodily resources against her will. It would also give the fetus more right than any living person, and certainly MUCH more rights than the woman. SHE can not force the fetus or any person to sustain her life through giving of bodily resources.\n \n \nYou may not wish to label a fetus as a child. That's your prerogative. Do not try to force your view on others! (Sorry, I couldn't resist... I've always found that line to be humorous. I recognize that you do not believe you are forcing your personal views on others.) \nGood one. Point well taken. Of course, it goes both ways :-)\n \n \nJust because you cannot accept the claim that a pre-birth entity is a 'person' does not mean that the pre-birth entity cannot be considered a 'person' -- whether by other individuals or by the government via laws.\nCorrect. It would violate the Constitution, but hey, that's just a minor detail, right?\n \n \nNo problems exist with the scenario, except those problems you wish to see. Sorry... that may have sounded kinda Zen-like or something. That's not what I intended.\nHmm, you are not zen-like? Sure you are. You actually make sense most of the time, even if it is not sense that I agree with.",

I thought we were dealing with adults with some form of reasoning ability, but if you want to play games, we can go there as well. Doesn't do wonders for your credibility.\n \n The fetus does not have the ability to sense anything. It is impossible to affect it in a meaningful way because it doesn't have the ability to sense anything, and have never experienced any form of awareness.

The brain's cortex is not even connected to the sensory nervous system until week 26 of the pregnancy, at the start of the 3rd trimester.

You wouldn't want to make false claims about me, would you?\n \n \nI think the debate really revolves around whether the unborn human should have no value or rights,\nNot at all. That has never been an issue. I certainly have not debated that, so I am not sure who you are posting to, here.\n \n \nor should have great value and rights.\nWell, THAT is the focus; this time you get it right. But it is not a matter of whether the fetus should have as much right as a newborn, but rather about whether the woman's rights, including the right to control her own bodily resources, should be taken away.\n \n \n (Unless you do beleive that the right to life can be superceeded by the right to choice)\nYes, I do. Even if I am dying right next to you, you can not be forced to give blood or a kidney to me. YOU are the one with the rights to your bodily resources. Whether I get your resources or not is a matter of your choice, not my life.\n \n \nI mentioned that many assert that abortion is damaging and have been replied to by you, Mizmaxx, and Jitobear.\nWell, if you are talking about physically damaging, it is 20 times more lethal to give birth than to have an abortion. If you are talking about mental health, then the actual scientific research (the ones done through scientific, nonbiased principles) shows no mental harm caused by abortions. Those results ae consistent 10 years out.\n \n \nI agree with bootfitter that this isn't what's really important. After all, smoking is damaging, but I find it worrisome that my cities' government has outlawed smoking in all public places, and especially that they have defined private property used to provide services (restaraunts) as public.\nSmoking affects other persons. We are back to the legal issues. Roe vs Wade found that the fetus is not a person.\n \n \nI did mention it, partially because the opposite arguement is often used to support abortion.\nHow so?\n \n \nAs to the claim that things like child abuse would be worse without abortion, that has no foundation.\nIt actually have some foundation, as unwanted babies are more likely to be neglected.\n \n \nIt was beleived that abortion would decrease the mentioned things. They increased, dramatically. If other factors such as a weakening of the family could be shown to be the likely cause, then you have a case.\nAnd social poverty escalation, welfare \"reform\" reduction in support, reduction in funding of substance abuse treatment and a whole other host of factors that cause people more stress.\n \n \nAs it is, it is likely that abortion was a factor, or at least had no positive effect.\nPerhaps no possitive effect, though that hasn't been shown either. But there certainly is NO evidence that it has been a contributory factor.\n \n \n\"Baby\" includes unborn human beings. I say unborn baby because I think fetus is a very cold term that makes it difficult to see the unborn human as special, unique, and valuable.\nRather, \"baby\" is an overly emotional and unrealistic term that tries to assign warm fuzzy feelings to something that is not a baby. Your accusation can as well be directed at your revisionist linguistics. Certainly, \"fetus\" is the correct descriptor. As for calling it \"cold,\" that is YOUR claim. There is no value judgement in the correct terminology. There is no dehumanization or over-humanization in the term. You are the one who tries to make it more than it is.\n \n \nOn the other hand, if we were to only refer to the unborn human..\n\"unborn human,\" is that like a \"pre-dead corpse\"? Revisionist linguistics is rather silly, don't you think so? There are perfectly good words that accurately describes something specifically as defined. That you can't make your argument without stooping to revisionist linguistics because reality doesn't provide enough emotional appeal, well that kind of indicates that your case is rather weak on its own merits, needing emotional trickery to be sustained.\n \n \n..as \"child\", \"baby\", or \"human being\", then you easily can see them as valuable beings worthy of a right to life.\nThus you are directly admitting that the choice of \"baby\" is deliberately done for emotional manipulation. How is that not dishonest?\n \n \nThats why pro-choicers refer the the said being..\n first you have to prove that it is a being, yor emotional, revisionist lingusitics none withstanding.\n \n \n.. as \"blob of tissue\",\nSome do. It is not entirely correct, but it is more correct that \"baby\" and certainly more correct than \"child.\" \n \n \ncontrolling the woman's body\",\nIf the woman is forced to remain pregnant against her will, then the fetus certainly IS controlling her body against her will.\n \n \nor draw parrallels to cancer,\nAre you saying that a zygote that is a hydatidiform mole is not a cancer? Certainly, the uncontrolled proliferation of invasive placental tissue functions as a cancer with no growth regulation. The classification is under Chorionic Carcinoma.\n \n \nand why pro-lifers say \"baby\", \"child\", and \"murder\".\nAll being non-factual. All being emotional trickery because your cause can't stand on its own merit.",

   "You know, George Washington once said, \"Let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion.\"\nThat's nice. It is not in the US Constitution. On the contrary, there it is explicitly prohibited for the Government to lend credence to a religion.\n \n \nI think the reason why is that religion (at least the Christian religion) gives us an ultimate authority that is greater than politicians and judges, who says that human life is sacred.\nIn a theocracy, perhaps. certainly not in the US.\n \n \n It gives us a reason to believe that every life has worth, such that it is worth dying to save a life.\nThe you should make organ donations and the giving of blood mandatory. You find it acceptable to starp somebody down and draw their blood against their own will because it can save somebody's life?\n \n \nif there's no ultimate morality that says peace and love are Good. \nYour claim is bogus. You are claiming that there is no morality without God. That simply isn't true.\n \n \nOtherwise, why should we impose our belief that murder or torture is bad on others? I suppose out of self-interest,\nThat could be one source of self-interest. It happens to be in the Bible asw ell (do onto others as..), but could easily arise on its own without religious influence.\n \n \n(Although I see no reason to think our own self-interest is worth anything without God either, it seems that almost all people do think it is)\nIndeed. While I have faith in God, God is not necessary for me to treat others as I want to be treated.\n \n \nI want a society where people aren't \"randomly killing each other\" because that means I probably won't be killed. I want a society of honest people because then I probably won't be cheated.\nAgain, these don't require religion to be realized.\n \n \n (That's why I find it fundamentally disturbing to see a picture of, or read words written by, someone who survived an abortion. That could be me.)\nIf they had been, neither they nor you would know the difference.\n \n \nEspecially if they are a burden to the self-interest of the rest of us. Why not have a utilitarian society? \nWell, that IS what you are proposing, women's value being in them giving birth, rather than their individual humanity. You value their individual humanity so little that you are willing to treat them as objects, as a womb with legs, ignoring their right to their own bodies, making a pregnant woman no different than a slave. That sure is rather utilitarian.\n \n \nI want to know if the unborn human does feel pain,\nYou could educate yourself. Read in a embryonic neurology book about the thalamocortical tract, the connection betwen the body's nervous system and the cortex, where all processing of sensation takes place. That connection happens during the 26th week of pregnancy.\n \n \nI want to know if it really does look like a 'blob of cells'.\nThat depends on the stage, of course. What does it matter what it looks like? (Ah, I forgot, You are into emotional imagery big time).\n \n \nI beleive that we as a society share the responsiblility, and I don't want to look the other way, and say that its not my problem, it doesn't affect me.\nBut the enslavement of pregnant women is OK?\n \n \nI think it does have to do with beleif, because it is my beleif that convinces me that life is valuable, that it is an inalienable right.\nSo you supports violating people's civil rights if it can keep other people alive? have you signed up to give one of your kidneys away yet? Somebody will die within the next week because they didn't get your kidney. You can save a life by doing so, and it is perfectly safe for you.\n \n You want the woman to give of her bodily resources for your beliefs. Are you willing to give of your own bodily resources as well? The challenge is now on you.\n \n \nWhen it comes to the 8-12 week old, it is harder to argue, I admit. Emotionally, it is much harder to view those human beings as valuable.\nThey are not \"human beings,\" of course, but I guess your view of their value depends on what they look like?\n \n \nThis is what Focus on the family's site..\nFoF borders on fascism, albeit of the theocratic kind. Why do they have any credence?\n \n \n..says about the 8-12 week-old:\nAnd so on. (1) What does the latin meaning have to do with anything, when we are talkign English? (2) Not everything is present. The foundation for all organ systems are present, which certainly is not the same. (3) And how does a fetus do ANYTHING \"energetically\" when there is no awareness?\n \n \nAnd this is what Religious Tolerance.org says:\nYes? And so?

   "I may not touch on all points here, but wanted to make a couple distinctions...\n \n The first distinction I'd like to make is regarding the usage of certain labels... Baby and child are not scientific terms with precise boundaries on their defined meaning. Rather they are used in common, everyday language with frequency. Carla frequently suggests that using 'baby' or 'child' to refer to a pre-birth individual is 'revisionist linguistics.' Definitions and understood meanings of words may change over time. Dictionaries are useful to describe the current range of understood definitions at the time of writing them. Following, you will see the first definition listed by webster.com for the words 'baby' and 'child.'\n \n Main Entry: 1ba\u0095by  \n 1 a (1) : an extremely young child;\n \n Main Entry: child  \n 1 a : an unborn or recently born person\n \n No revisionist linguistics are necessary to refer to a fetus or embryo as a 'baby' or a 'child.' Commonly accepted definitions of these words indicate that they can be used correctly to refer to a pre-birth entity. Regardless, labels do not affect the reality of the object they are describing. Rather, they affect our perceptions of the object.\n \n \n \n \nAh, but \"unique entity\" is kind of a dubious claim. Would you call a Hydatidiform Mole \"a unique entity\"?\n\n Sure. In reality, a hydatidiform mole is a unique entity. (Under the assumption that all hydatiform moles are unique, which I will refer to you... as you seem to be far more knowledgable than I regarding the topic of hydatiform moles.) Both statements are factual statements (that both zygotes and a hydatidiform moles are unique entities). Neither is dubious in the least.\n \n \n \n \nThe point here is that to be against abortion, while also opposing what could prevent unwanted pregnancies (and hence also abortions), that is hypocritical.\n\n From your perspective, the situation you describe may seem hypocritical. However, another valid perspective exists: The belief that life begins at conception, and after that point, it has the same intrinsic value throughout it's natural life-cycle. From this perspective, it is not hypocritical at all. Rather, it is consistent.\n \n \n \n \nGreat. Good for you! You have an opinion.\n\n \nLOL. Kind of like you, eh?\n\n Sure, I have many opinions. However, I think we would find that a majority of what I write on these forums is factual, and not opinion. I may be mistaken, and you could certainly prove that statement incorrect, but it's relatively uncommon for me to state my personal opinions here. Usually I describe the perspective of some segment of the population. That perspective may or may not reflect my personal opinion.\n \n \n \n Here's one of my opinions, though: It is fun to debate topics on these forums, especially with seemingly intelligent and informed people (like Carla) who are able to think logically and reasonably for themselves, rather than with individuals who rely on untested beliefs and canned answers from somebody else for their arguments.",

   "And as such, refering to something as a unique entity would also have to enclude other products of conception, such as blighted ovum. And an encapsulated tumor woulf fit that description. SO how useful is the term?\n\n Sure. Even a flea is a unique entity. Any product of conception is a unique entity of human origin. The distinction is that nothing except a zygote has even the slightest chance of ever developing into an adult human being. As I've stated before, and as you so aptly point out, not all zygotes DO develop into an adult human being. But no other unique entity on earth has any potential to develop into an adult human being (except a unique human entity in a stage of development other than a zygote).\n \n Not all human zygotes are able to develop into an adult human being for various reasons (non-implantation in the uterine wall, ectopic pregnancies, hydatidiform moles, abortions, miscarriages, SIDS, accidents, suicides, cancer, murder, etc. -- just to name a few reasons). But there is nothing other than nourishment and oxygen that is required to be added to the zygote during it's entire development into adulthood, assuming it is allowed to develop in a safe environment. Again, even if these conditions are met, it doesn't mean that the zygote necessarily will continue it's development.\n \n \n \nBit I still find it hypocritical that a condom, f.ex. is objected to, even under your scenario.

   "Though I'm not certain it will do any good... I will attempt to reconstruct this sequence of events. \n \n You made the below comment in reference to some comment of mine regarding the zygote being a unique member of the species. I have not yet found language precise enough to convey this meaning well, as I recognize the problem with using 'species.' My point was that nothing needs to be added to the zygote in order for it to grow into an adult human being, except nourishment and oxygen. This is a fact. (Which means it could be shown to be false... but it hasn't been shown to be false yet that I am aware of.)\n \nAgain, I don't accept any \"member of the species\" until they actually are born, individual members.\n\n You have an opinion that precludes recognition of a zygote as a \"member of the species.\" This is an opinion similar to the opinion that a fetus is not really a human being, or is not a person. Unless the term has specific and precise meanings that cannot be interpreted in more than one manner, then it is an opinion. I recognized this below (albeit with a touch of sarcasm).\n \nGreat. Good for you! You have an opinion.\n\n You responded:\n \nLOL. Kind of like you, eh?\n\n And of course I have opinions. Some of which I post here. I acknowledge that. But I wanted to continue to make the distinction between opinion and fact, because I have run into this before... I can't remember if it was with Gormless or Mr Jack awhile back. So I wrote the following comments:\n \nSure, I have many opinions. However, I think we would find that a majority of what I write on these forums is factual, and not opinion. I may be mistaken, and you could certainly prove that statement incorrect, but it's relatively uncommon for me to state my personal opinions here. Usually I describe the perspective of some segment of the population. That perspective may or may not reflect my personal opinion.\n\n \n Nowhere in the above did I even once suggest or imply that you do not post factual information. In fact, you do post factual information. For me to claim otherwise is pointless because the evidence is right here in front of everyone.\n \n Anyone is welcome to believe that I intentionally 'smeared' you. I assure you that I had no such intent. For one, it doesn't make sense... You can read all of my posts on these forums. 'Smearing' someone else doesn't fit my style. A few times I stated my opinion that 'Rapture' is a troll. Rapture's posting style fits that of a troll, and I stand behind my opinion that Rapture is posting non-coherent gibberish in order to incite heated responses. I don't believe you will find anything else anywhere that I've posted that could be considered 'smearing.'\n \n There is nothing that I can do to 'fix' things if you believe that I intentionally implied anything derogatory about you. Even if I were to change my post or apologize, you would still believe that I did something that I didn't do. This is a separate topic, but I believe apologies are worthless, anyway. Being 'sorry' cannot change the fact that X happened. A much more powerful way to handle such a situation is to recognize the impact of X and commit to not allowing X to happen again. In this case, I made a few statements about my posting style. Nowhere in that paragraph were you mentioned or referred to, Carla. The paragraph didn't have anything to do with you whatsoever, except that it was in response to one of your comments. Any implications of me accusing you of anything are completely fabricated in your mind. No written accusations exist in reality. (And you certainly cannot claim to know my intentions better than I know my own intentions.) As with anything in life, only YOU have the power to be able to create something in your mind that does not exist in reality. \n \n If it pleases you, I will repeat the factual information that I posted earlier: You do post factual information. There is evidence to show it. You can make comments about your own posting style if you like. You can also criticize my posting style if you like. I'm okay with that.\n \n Peace,\n The Bootfitter",
