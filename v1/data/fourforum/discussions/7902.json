As Karl Rove is quoted saying \"Gay marriage is the gift that keeps on giving\".\n \n By accidentalactivist \n 04/06/2006 12:53:38 PM EST\n \n The nation is at war with no end in sight. 15,000 of our service-members have been wounded, several thousand are dead, and over 100,000 are suffering from PTSD. Iraq is burning while the White House fiddles. The national debt has skyrocketed and the trade and budget deficits are soaring. We're about to sign a pact with India that will increase the proliferation of nuclear weapons at the same time as we are saber-rattling against Iran and North Korea for their nuclear programs. Hundreds of thousands of Africans are dying from AIDS or starvation while genocide is happening right before our eyes in the Sudan. Members of Congress are being investigated, indicted, and convicted along with their crooked corporate sponsors. The President is spying on Americans without warrants and imprisoning people without due process. The EPA is gutting environmental protection laws, the Department of the Interior is selling off our national parks, and the Transportation Security Agency can't seem to notice weapons being snuck through airport security checkpoints or keep radioactive suitcases out the country. Millions of Americans have fallen below the Federal poverty level, millions more have lost their health coverage, and over 2 million Americans are languishing in jails.\n What will Congress do about all this? Read on! \n \n \n Simple, they'll introduce and debate a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.\n How long are Americans going to let these political hacks use wedge issues like gay marriage and immigration to keep our focus off the real problems this country is facing? \n \n I'm a gay man. I admit that I would like to be able to legally marry my partner of 17 years. We've done the California domestic partner thing, the wills and powers of attorney, and our community of faith has sanctified our union. We'd like to see the laws change so that we don't face the discriminatory financial and legal challenges we encounter today. But, right now, I'd really like our members of Congress to focus on the forces that truly are bankrupting our nation, the ones that are killing people, and the ones that will harm the planet and us for many generations to come. \n \n My wish, right now, is that the Democrats find some way to keep this stupid, discriminatory, and mean-spirited amendment off the floor of Congress. But, if it does land on the floor, I hope that each of them stands up and says: \n \n \"Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this ill-conceived and mean-spirited gay-bashing amendment. The nation is at war with no end in sight. 15,000 of our service-members have been wounded, several thousand are dead, and over 100,000 are suffering from PTSD.

Millions of Americans have fallen below the Federal poverty level, millions more have lost their health coverage, and over 2 million Americans are languishing in jails. Is now really the time we should be talking about gay marriage? I think not and I yield back my time.\"",

We can't put everything else on hold.\n\n \n We definitely should be discussing domestic issues without a doubt. \n We should start by addressing issues that actually have an impact on Americans like mimimum wage, unemployment, health care, national security, the enviroment, the price of gasoline. etc. etc. etc. .\n What we should not be doing is purposefully dredging up an issue, that has sat somewhat dorment, right before elections in order to secure a Republican victory. Especially when the issue they are focusing on so much is not even an issue that would harm a single American individual or family if gay marriage did become legal. Instead if allowed, would stregthen marriage, stregthen families including gay families, help to stop discrimination (which harms everyone involved both emotionally and many times physically) and slow the rate of infectious diseases. I know you don't agree that it would slow the rate of infectious disease but just try to apply logic here, it would. \n My point is yes, lets focus on domestic issues, they are in desparate need of attention but lets be smart about it and do the right thing for America instead of using an obvious divisive issue to divide the American people and secure the republican majority in the house and senate. If republicans bring this issue back to the forefront right before the elections wouldn't you have to agree that this is exactly what they are doing in light of much more pressing issues?",
