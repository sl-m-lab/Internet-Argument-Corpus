   "Recently there has been a certain \"crackpot\" theory gaining prominence amongst \"ignorant XXXXXX\" and scientists in the pay of the natural gas industry, that oven temperatures are driven by the heat directed to them by the so-called \"temperature controls\" on them, rather than the quantity of food inside.\n \n A recent survey suggested 90% of Americans had been misled into believing this lie, but a new scientific study has refuted this falsehood once and for all. Its all contained in this scientific graph attached.\n \n First, note that historically, oven temperature and oven temperature setting have risen in concert, but in the last 2 minutes as the oven control settings were reduced, the oven temperature continued to rise\n \n This is the clearest evidence yet that oven temperature controls do not actually control oven temperature, despite what those crackpots and gasmongers who hate well cooked food would have you believe.",
