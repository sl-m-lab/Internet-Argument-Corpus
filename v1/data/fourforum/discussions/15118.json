   "The drafters of these bills seem to have an image of peaceful students, bent over their books, suddenly attacked by gunslingers who materialize from nowhere. They ignore that students can and do shoot people on campus.\n \n It was a student at Virginia Tech in 2007 who shot and killed 32 people. In 2008, a former student killed five people and wounded 17 when he opened fire in a crowded lecture hall at Northern Illinois University. And a professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville is accused of killing three of her colleagues in 2010 after she was denied tenure.\n \n This is hardly surprising. Students and professors are not much different from the rest of the population. Among every 1,000 adult Americans, 60 suffer from a serious mental illness. Some of them will seek appropriate treatment, some will commit suicide, some will resort to drugs -- and some will vent their anger by shooting people.\n \n One might say, \"But surely we will not give guns to these guys.\" A test that allows one to reliably determine who can be trusted with a gun and who cannot, however, does not exist. And if it were ever created, I expect the National Rifle Association and various state legislatures would strenuously oppose submitting millions of students and professors, or anyone else, to such a test before they could purchase a firearm.\n \n Not that I want \"stable\" students to carry guns. I have used firearms in close-range combat, but only after extensive training. And I still saw quite a few of my fellow combatants miss their targets and wind up with their bullets flying all over the place. This also happened with more of mine than I care to admit. If students are going to fire at intruders in their classroom, I'll bet my last dollar that they will bring down more of their friends than they will gunslingers. As for the professors, I have spent a lifetime among them. Trust me: Most of them come from the gang that can't shoot straight.\n \n Worse, long before anyone storms into a classroom, some students will use their guns -- when their anger boils over, when they have one drink too many or their girlfriend makes out with someone else -- to shoot someone. And then there are those who die from an accidental firing of a gun -- on average, more than 700 Americans died each year from gun accidents between 1999 and 2007.\n \n What should be done? Make guns less accessible, not more.\n \n A well-known slogan of those who favor guns is, \"Guns don't kill people. People kill people.\" But those nations that exercise much more control over access to guns have much lower levels of killing than those countries in which guns are freely available.\n \n One study examined violence in 23 high-income countries and found that the firearm homicide rate was nearly 20 times higher in the U.S. than in the other countries, all of which have stricter gun control laws than the U.S. America has more firearms per capita than the other countries, more handguns per capita, and has the most permissive gun control laws of all the nations. Among the 23 countries, 80% of all firearm deaths happened in the United States; 86% of women killed by firearms were U.S. women; and 87% of all children up to 14 years old who were killed by guns were U.S. children.\n \n The friends of guns argue that even if you took away all guns, people would still kill each other with knives and wrenches. However, attackers armed in this fashion can be much more readily subdued than those with guns. And no one can go to the top of the University of Texas clock tower and kill 16 people with a knife or wrench. Nor could Seung-Hui Cho have killed 32 people and injured 18 others at Virginia Tech with a knife instead of two handguns.\n \n I have a hard enough time with students who bring their cell phones to their classes. If they bring guns, they better check them at the door, or I may be forced to arm myself and try to outdraw them when I see one of them reaching for his holster.\n Guns on campus? Expect tragedy - CNN.com\n \n Well said!",

   "First I'm going to point you to the Bath School disaster. An incident that claimed the lives of 45 people and injured another 58, all without a shot ever being fired.\n \n http://www.answers.com/topic/bath-school-disaster\n \n And then I'm going to cite the weapons used by the students responsible for Columbine which included 95 bombs.\n \n http://www.acolumbinesite.com/weapon.html\n \n Bomb tally:\n 48 -- Carbon Dioxide bombs\n 27 -- Pipe bombs\n 11 -- 1.5 gallon propane bombs\n 7 -- gas or napalm bombs\n 2 -- 20 pound propane bombs\n \n And then I'm going to cite someone who disagrees with you and your latest source of nonsense.\n \n Should Bans Against Carrying Concealed Weapons Be Lifted On College Campuses? - FoxNews.com\n \n \nFortunately, we don't need to speculate about what might happen. We actually already have a lot of evidence and experience from numerous campuses. \n \n Seventy-one college campuses allow students with permits to carry concealed handguns, and many more let faculty carry, some for over a decade. But none -- absolutely none -- of these schools have experienced the type of harm predicted by opponents. Not a single permit holder on these campuses has been involved in a firearm accident or crime. \n \n We also have extensive experience with permitted concealed handguns on campuses prior to the push for gun-free zones during the early 1990s. Back then, in the states that allowed concealed permitted handguns, students and professors frequently carried handguns, and there simply weren't any problems then either. \n \n But we have even more evidence than that. Permit holders, not just on campuses, are exceedingly law-abiding. Consider the two states at the front of the current debate, Florida and Texas: Both states provide detailed records on the behavior of permit holders on easily accessible websites. During over two decades, from October 1, 1987 to February 28, 2011, Florida has issued permits to over 1.96 million people, with the average person having a permit for more than a decade. Few -- 168 (about 0.01%) -- have had their permits revoked for any type of firearms related violation, the most common was accidentally carrying a concealed handgun into a gun-free zone such as a school or an airport, not threats or acts of violence. \n \n Over the last 38 months, only four permit holders have had their permit revoked for a firearms related violation -- an annual revocation rate of 0.0003%. The numbers are similarly small in Texas. In 2009, there were 402,914 active license holders. 101 were convicted of either a misdemeanor or a felony, a rate of 0.025 percent, with only few of these crimes involving a gun.\n\n \n It doesn't matter who you choose to copy and paste to spread your message of fear and propaganda, we'll find just as many people to cite to refute you and shame you back into the shadows.",

   "If guns promote crime then why are all the mass killings only in gun free zones such as schools,malls, or recently democratic functions. You can quote statistics till you are dead, but you see this on television and the media is as biased as the leftists\n\n The argument isn't that guns promote or cause crime, it is that when crimes happen having a gun involved causes more damage. Otherwise it's utter bull.\n \n \nYou couldnt be more wrong. There are entire nations that are like gun free zones and they have alot less shootings and murders than the USA.\n\n A lot of countries have less population. Less shootings with less guns, certainly, but there would be more stabbings.\n \n Before rifles, cocked weapons, and semi-automatics there were muskets, before muskets there were swords, bows and spears, before those there were rocks and clubs, before them there was strangling and beating to death.\n \n Is it easier to kill more people with better weapons? Obviously, but history shows us that there is no real appreciable limit with any weapon in which one is proficient.\n \n Whether or not it is more efficient to keep weapons from the populous depends on how much you are willing to invest and rely upon police.\n \n In the old west it was pretty bad, but you can imagine the slaughter that would take place if a posse was impossible because citizens couldn't have guns.\n \n In either case controlling small weapons is redundant so long as real combat weapons are still ending up in the hands of killers. They obviously aren't being stopped by existing gun laws not because they don't apply but because they are being evaded. It's like those ridiculous signs I see sometimes 'entering school zone no drugs', as if you would be carrying an illegal substance but now that there is a yellow sign you are going to come clean.\n \n Right now we have the worst of both strategies, gun laws are restrictive enough that not many criminals are being stopped by citizens; they are permissive enough that low level criminals may still own a gun legally.\n \n So we have gun enthusiast, hunters, and criminals as the people willing to go through the paperwork and cost. The former of which wouldn't be likely to have their weapons in any useful situations anyway.",

You constantly praise the ATF yet you've done nothing to address the fact that they're been accused of deliberately trafficking weapons into Mexico, allowing thousands of suspicious sales to be completed, doing nothing to alert the authorities of Mexico to the program Fast and Furious, and have played an integral part in the murder of at least one border agent and one ICE agent.\n \n You cite the Legal Community Against Violence as your source of information. I've pointed out before that the Legal Community Against Violence receives funding from the Joyce Foundation to carry out notoriously anti-gun and biased \"studies\" for the purpose of political agenda. Kindly don't make me present the Joyce Foundation grant list yet again.\n \n I see no evidence to suggest that straw purchases are more likely at gun shows in states outside of California. Nor do I see why exactly you chose to bring up attendees being armed. What was that all about exactly? Any particular reason you mentioned armed patrons?\n \n Then there's the issue of so-called \"unlicensed vendors.\" There's no such thing as an \"unlicensed vendor\" at a gun show or anywhere else. There are private individuals selling from their personal collections for whatever reason drives them, be a need to make room for new acquisitions or simply to pay the bills. They aren't in the business of selling guns to make a profit. Legally they can't be counted as dealers nor is their justification for making them observe the licensing and paperwork mandates dictated to licensed dealers.\n \n I also don't see the problem with \"assault weapons\" or .50 caliber rifles being sold at gun shows. All I see is you fearmongering.\n \n As to the ATF's claim that gun shows are linked to criminal markets I call bull. The ATF has a long history of being fools and not knowing what they're talking about. Their most recent ****up is without a doubt them claiming that plastic airsoft guns are considered true weapons under the law.

   "Well come on Penfeld and show me what you got. Surely you wouldn't bandy about lies without having abundant proof would you comrade?? QED\n\n \n \n I suppose comrades' propaganda and lies have been exposed, no abundant proof of citizens murdering each other at every gun \"shoe\" or shooting range. In fact, failure to come up with one QED.\n \n In your haste to disparage citizen rights you chose the wrong parameters and the wrong folks as objects of your bloviated attacks not unlike your other collusions to left wing socialist/communist agendas. You have literally become what you eat, enjoy your dining experience and don't forget to leave a tip...get outa town!",

   "I did not claim that the debate was originally about accidents and suicides. I was making a point about your hypocrisy. I've already given examples of killings so don't try to imply otherwise.\n\n That a murder never happens at a gun show or range is something I very much doubt as there is hardly any physical law against it.\n \n but no example posted here has really made much of a case against it.\n \n I have seen a bunch of accidents, suicides, and police involved shootings.\n \n One thing I have never allowed myself be guilty of is reading into mis-phrasings of anothers post and not giving my best honesty to their meaning. Everyone who has posted examples have done just that.\n \n It is perfectly obvious to the most idiotic that the statements made were about the safety inferred from having many armed citizens around.\n \n I don't know why any of the pro-gun crowd haven't mentioned it, but the place doest not matter, it's whose there and whats going on.\n \n If there is a murder on a deserted shooting range, what is that supposed to prove? that the shooting range doesn't have a mystical spirit preventing guns from hitting the innocent?\n \n Police were not mentioned in the OP but it is quite obvious by the context and the fact that anti-gun people are implying that guns are not safe in the hands of citizens but safe in the hands of government hired people that if a government employee commits the murder... no net point is made.\n \n Then of course there are all the examples of suicides and accidents, which are clearly not murder.\n \n Don't mistake mine nor anyone else's dismissal of these examples as invalid as investment in the impossibility of a true murder. It is simply an identification of a fact and everyone you guys post which is similarly exposed is sanctioning the aforementioned unlikelihood.",
