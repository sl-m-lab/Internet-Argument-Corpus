That shows an immature attitude while debating.\n\n \n No I do not use fallacies - but your initial post did. In it you claim that you are against gay marriage because it is an unhealthy environment for children. There are TWO fallacies here - one, that it is unhealthy for kids, 2 - that marriage and parenting are consistently tied. Many people parent without being or ever having been married. Stopping gay marriage will not stop gay people from becoming parents.\n \n \nHis problem not mine.\n\n \n Why is it a problem?\n \n You said that children raised by homosexuals get confused about their sexuality. Most gay people have straight parents, including Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter. The comment was a funny way to poke a hole in that assertation.\n \n \nBig deal! I've encountered my share of ones who said they choose to be gay. So whats your point?! Because if thats what your basing things on, I'd say you lose. Because there are an equal amount who say, they chose it.\n\n \n No, there are not an equal amount who claim they chose to be gay. Frankly, I also don't believe your claim that any have told you that they did. Of, course I can't know that, but I though I would let you know that I don't believe it. Its not just that gays have told me, overwhelmingly the evidence supports that, we may know know what causes sexual orientation (although there are theories), it is not a concious choice. \n \n A simple search on google will find a lot of opinion sites about whether being gay is a choice or not. All those I encountered who said it was a choice were either straight folks or religious sites. \n \n Below are some links to what gays have to say and even one that is more of a scientific paper.\n \n http://www.logcabin.org/lef/choice_white_paper.html\n http://www.gfcbaltimore.org/GFC_Choice.htm\n http://rzero.com/diffangle/index.html\n \n A also found this - which is just funny.\n \n Reasons to choose to be gay:\n 1) To become rejected by society.\n 2) To have multiple groups against myself.\n 3) To raise risks of being physically harmed.\n 4) To raise risks of being mentally harmed.\n 5) To have less rights in the states.\n 6) To risk losing family support.\n 7) To risk losing friends.\n 8) To risk losing chances at good jobs.\n 9) To get flamed for being a flamer.\n 10) To be a large target for rude jokes.\n 11) To be described as animals to others.\n 12) To be talked about as things among the law.\n 13) To raise my chance of being lead toward suicide.\n 14) To lose my chance at a rightful marriage.\n 15) To hide myself from everyone else.\n \n \n \nHell yeah I chose to be straight!!( the curse was not meant at you personally.) And I'm happy about it too. And no, I don't find women attractive in the least bit. Not even dear old Angalina Jolie. I'm 100% about men, and choose to be.\n\n \n If you had to choose, talk yourself into finding men hot - you probably aren't straight.\n \n \nI'm glad its not for sale. Because I'm not intreasted in buying it. And I know its highly debated. Just stating my stand on it. \n\n \n Obviously. But how much weight do you think an obviously anti-gay, straight girl's stand on what it is to be gay actually holds?\n \n \nI taught myself. Like gays teach themselves.\n\n \n Not me. I just noted one day that guys were cute and got me excited.\n \n \nI don't care if you agree or not. I'm not here to convince you. I'm here to state my views.\n\n \n Fine. But you claimed there was a flaw in my argument. Not agreeing with you is not a flaw on my part.\n \n \nThen you would be pretty confused when you meet the several gays that told me they chose to be gay. You made an assumption based on what only a few whom you met, know, are friends with, said. Now what are you going to do when you meet one who says differently?! I'm pretty sure the ones who told me they chose it, should know more about it then people who are straight too.\n\n \n I am almost 40, have known gay people since I was child, have talked to many hundred of them on the topic, have read their accounts in newspapers, magazines, forums like this, as well as other places on the internet. I have never encountered a single gay person claim it was choice. Not one. Never. I provided links to some examples. Go talk to the gay people in this forum. Try to find me an example that isn't tied to ministry. Just a regular, actively gay person. I dare you.\n \n \nWell read this link, http://www.realwomenca.com/newsletter/2004_mar_apr/article_1.html \n \n Why take my word for it when you can read it for yourself from professionals, professors, mental health studies, etc. This link also disclaims the links you have listed. Finding flaws in their studies. So thats my source, and thats my stand.\n\n \n I read it. It is a women's website based out of Canada that according to its own objectives strives to \"promote, secure and defend legislation which upholds the Judeo-Christian understanding of marriage and family life\". Its a religious site. Furthermore the article you provide lists all kinds of numbers and stats and vague names of where the data is from, but does not adequaltely cite its sources (name, author, year, etc.) so that the information can even be verified. I would be willing to bet most of it was pulled off of religious websites. My links were to/about valid medical and phsychologial organizations.\n \n \nCall me crazy but I thought that we were debating gay parenting and marriage. That is why I couldn't grasp why you were going into single parents, and seperating marriage from parenting. Since the discussion is about gay marriage and gay parenting. And whether I get out or not is no concern of yours, lets keep the debate formal.And comment on the statements and not the person making the statements. That can bring a debate down, when people start assuming things.emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n If you are going to debate this with any kind validity you have to seperate the two institutions. Kids happen without marriage all the time. If anything it seems to me that you are debating whether gay people should be parents more than whether they should be married.\n \n \nIts only one, if you make it one. I never said it was.\n\n \n You brought it up. It seemed you were implying that there was something wrong with this. If not, lets drop it.\n \n \nNo thanks. I'll pass. Not really intreasted. I accepted your invite on the debate. Not your personal experiences.\n\n \n My personal experiences are part of the debate. My immediate family is impacted by this debate. My son's father is gay. \n \n \nI'm really not intreasted in getting your personal story right. Because I'm speaking in general. Stating your business, is of no concern of mine. That is why I never made my statements personal towards you. Maybe you should chill on the personal information. \n\n \n No. My story falsifies your position. I will not shut up about or lie about it for your's (or anyone's) comfort factor.\n \n \nHow can I?! They were documentations on T.V about true life experiences.\n\n \n What channel? Google is marvelous. So are libraries.\n \n \nYour opinion is your own.\n\n \n Mistress of the obvious.\n \n \nI don't believe I refered to your son as,\" just some kid.\" And since I don't know his name, I probably said child. Actually, I don't believe I even mentioned him. You're the one speaking about him.\n\n \n The reason I said \"my son\" is because your stories were around some \"kids you saw (on on TV)\" - strangers to you. I was emphasizing that my story is personal - that is all.\n \n \nWell nice to know that about your son. But he could chose a better crush then beyonce, she is sort of trashy. Although I like her song,\" irreplaceable.\" \n\n \n I can't stand pop music at all. I do not know her character so I will also not judge her. My son is 12 - he is crushes because she is pretty. \n \n \nWell I'm glad its no problem for your son. No child deserves to be harrassed.\n\n \n He has been harassed. I am saying that the flaw is not with his family, but rather, the harassers. Just wanted to make sure I was clear.\n \n \nNews channels. They covered the story not too long ago.\n\n \n What news channels?\n \n \nWow! The sky is going to fall because I spelt does wrong. DOSE! OOOPS! Lock me up!\n\n \n No. Generally typos don't bug me, but that one kept coming up so I thought I would point it out to you.\n \n \nNo thanks! I'd rather not. My link above disclaims anything they have to say.\n\n \n No, it doesn't.\n \n \nMy link says your wrong too. And your source. S whos to say whos wrong?!\n\n \n I am going with the doctors and mental health professionals over a group of broads in Canada with a religious agenda.\n \n \nThats nice. But I'll pass.\n\n \n Why? Don't like having your opnion threatened by those who would actually know best? \"My minds made up, don't confuse me with the facts?\" Even, if ultimately, you stance actually causes harm to children in gay families?\n \n \nAnd since we are correcting spelling. Its, \"college\" not, \"colage\".\n\n \n No, it's \"colage\". Below is the link to their main website - but local chapters have websites, too. There are stories, pictures, events, artwork, all kinds of neat stuff on the sites about and for gay families.\n \n http://www.colage.org/",

   "Why is it a problem?\n\n \n Because of the standards I choose to live by. And that is my right. I'm not trying to change anyone else. If I see it as a problem, I can.\n \n \nYou said that children raised by homosexuals get confused about their sexuality. Most gay people have straight parents, including Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter. The comment was a funny way to poke a hole in that assertation.\n\n \n Sorry I missed the humor. I'm sure it was a blast.\n \n \n \n \nNo, there are not an equal amount who claim they chose to be gay. Frankly, I also don't believe your claim that any have told you that they did. Of, course I can't know that, but I though I would let you know that I don't believe it.\n\n \n Nope of course you can't. You can choos not to believe it. Fine with me. It just seems to me that you have a one diamentional mind. \n \n \n \n \nA also found this - which is just funny.\n \n Reasons to choose to be gay:\n 1) To become rejected by society.\n 2) To have multiple groups against myself.\n 3) To raise risks of being physically harmed.\n 4) To raise risks of being mentally harmed.\n 5) To have less rights in the states.\n 6) To risk losing family support.\n 7) To risk losing friends.\n 8) To risk losing chances at good jobs.\n 9) To get flamed for being a flamer.\n 10) To be a large target for rude jokes.\n 11) To be described as animals to others.\n 12) To be talked about as things among the law.\n 13) To raise my chance of being lead toward suicide.\n 14) To lose my chance at a rightful marriage.\n 15) To hide myself from everyone else.\n\n \n Now thats just sad. I don't find it amusing.\n \n \n \n \n \nIf you had to choose, talk yourself into finding men hot - you probably aren't straight.\n\n \n \n Have you ever heard of a thing called sarcasim?! What I stated was mild sarcasim. Don't try to push that lifestyle on me. By making such statements. I'm not the one turned on by Angelina Jolie. I question how straight you are. Women never were and never will be attractive to me. I have breast, she has breast. Big deal. Show me something I don't see everyday.emoticon_rolleyes Bottomline is...*Drum roll please* Men!! They get my vote. Expecially chinese men!! \n \n \n \n \nObviously. But how much weight do you think an obviously anti-gay, straight girl's stand on what it is to be gay actually holds?\n\n \n Just because I'm straight does not mean that I can't voice my stand. Whether some agree I have a strong stand or not, dose not bother me in the least bit. Voicing my stand, is the only concern of mine.\n \n \n \nNot me. I just noted one day that guys were cute and got me excited.\n\n \n Same here. But with me I never had to notice one day. I had already known they were sexy. \n \n \nI am almost 40, have known gay people since I was child, have talked to many hundred of them on the topic, have read their accounts in newspapers, magazines, forums like this, as well as other places on the internet. I have never encountered a single gay person claim it was choice. Not one. Never. I provided links to some examples. Go talk to the gay people in this forum. Try to find me an example that isn't tied to ministry. Just a regular, actively gay person. I dare you.\n\n \n Find a gay person, and ask them questions?! You dare me?! OOOOH I'm shaking. I probably won't be able to sleep tonight because you dared me.\n \n Plus, you are 40, not 400. So I doubt that you talked to all of the gay people in the world. You made a bold statement about doubting that they said they chose the lifestyle. You have no right to assume that. Unless you personally talked to all of them, in order to find this information out.\n \n \nI read it. It is a women's website based out of Canada that according to its own objectives strives to \"promote, secure and defend legislation which upholds the Judeo-Christian understanding of marriage and family life\". Its a religious site. Furthermore the article you provide lists all kinds of numbers and stats and vague names of where the data is from, but does not adequaltely cite its sources (name, author, year, etc.) so that the information can even be verified. I would be willing to bet most of it was pulled off of religious websites. My links were to/about valid medical and phsychologial organizations.\n\n \n Names of professors, and such are not vague. I think I'll stick to agreeing with my link, and you can agree with yours. Since that is my right.\n \n \n \n \n \nNo. My story falsifies your position. I will not shut up about or lie about it for your's (or anyone's) comfort factor.\n\n \n No one told you to lie. I believe I said, I'm not intreasted in your experiences. About what role your sons father plays is not important to me. And thats all I'm saying. And if you believe it falsifies it, then fine. No skin off my back.\n \n \n \nMistress of the obvious.\n\n \n You quoted somethings that were obvious yourself. Give me a break here. lol\n \n \nThe reason I said \"my son\" is because your stories were around some \"kids you saw (on on TV)\" - strangers to you. I was emphasizing that my story is personal - that is all.\n\n \n Just because they were not people I know. Dose not mean that they were not real experiences.\n \n \n \n \nI can't stand pop music at all. I do not know her character so I will also not judge her. My son is 12 - he is crushes because she is pretty.\n\n \n Let him see her without her make-up. He will change his mind. lol\n \n \n \nHe has been harassed. I am saying that the flaw is not with his family, but rather, the harassers. Just wanted to make sure I was clear.\n\n \n Even though I don't approve of gay marriages, and parenting. I don't think that any family should be harassed. On any level. You made mention that my views cause harm. No they don't. It is only when you choose to act on them, is when it causes harm. And not before. I don't agree with the lifestyle, for alot of reasons. But I have never disrespected anyone who is gay. So maybe the problem dose lay with the people who harassed your son. To disagree is one thing, to harass someone is another.\n \n \n \nWhat news channels?\n\n \n NBC,ABC, and FOX\n \n \nNo. Generally typos don't bug me, but that one kept coming up so I thought I would point it out to you.\n\n \n Gee thanks!! It changed my life!! Not really.emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \n \nNo, it doesn't.\n\n \n I believe it dose.

   "I'm sorry if it seems that I've lead the debate into an off-topic discussion. I only mentioned my view of why gay marriages are harmful. Because once they marry, the couples choose to adopt or have children.\n\n This is virtually pointless because gays cannot marry in the U.S. today, and they STILL adopt. They still raise kids.\n Between six million and 10 million children of lesbian, gay and bisexual parents currently live in the United States. 11 \n http://www.womedia.org/taf_statistics.htm\n \n Marriage is not a requirement for adoption. Ergo, your complaint is moot.\n \n It's like arguing against driving cars because of vehicular murder. The murder takes place with or without the car, and there is no indication that the rate of murder is increased by people's capability to drive cars.\n \n \n \nThat in my view can be harmful. And a reason that I would oppose gay marriage.\n\n The \"harm\" has yet to really be shown.\n You quoted a lobbyist group web-site, which \"quotes\" studies and statements made by people but typically does an incredibly poor job of citing the source of what it claim.\n It offers one \"study\" claiming to refute dozens of other research studies, but having viewed such claims in the past it typically revolves around statements of how the study could have been improved. Not really invalidating the study at all. And I find extreme irony in the pretense that the opinion of one or two people analyzing a study should somehow overrule an ENTIRE PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION which has evaluated these studies and found them worthy of leading to a conclusion.\n It offers a statement of one psychologist's OPINION, but offers no counter studies of its own to demonstrate a harm to children. In fact, there is NO existing study which shows that being raised by gay parent(s) somehow harms kids. Plenty of opinion, but no actual proof.\n It takes a look at one study which gives statistics on gay relationship abuse, but then pulls the typical tactic I have seen DOZENS of times in not giving ANY SORT OF COMPARISON to the heterosexual situation. And some of the wording??? \"one or more acts of verbal aggression from their intimate partners\"??? Geez. Does getting loud and byatchy during a fight count as \"verbal aggression\"? Can't tell because (of course) this article gives NOWHERE NEAR enough information to reference the actual source it pretends to quote.\n \"Higher incidence of mental health problems\"? Funny how the article leaves out the fact that professional medical organization after professional medical organization has concluded that the REASON for the higher incidence of mental health problems is the higher rate of PREJUDICE that gays experience.\n Sexual molestation by gay parents? This involves a variety of lies and misrepresentations, ignoring the actual facts on the matter.\n The biggest lie being that it assumes that just because a man molests a boy, that the man must be gay. So what do you call the man if he is married to a woman, and he is actually molesting his son?\n The truth of the matter is that research has proven that the vast majority of pedophiles who molest boys are actually straight in their adult sexual interactions. Pedophilia is typically about attraction towards the AGE of the victim, with the gender being often irrelevant.\n \n I know it's a radical idea to actually reference a PSYCHOLOGY web-site when talking about psychological issues instead of a lobbyist web-site, but this web-page refutes a LOT of the XXXX that the \"real women\" have thrown out there...\n \n http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/policy/parents.html\n \n \n \nAnd thats aside from the gay couples who do not marry and yet have children.\n\n Since gay marriage is not legal in this country (with only one state exception), what percentage of gay couples would you guess that would be?",

It ruled that same-sex couples domiciled in other states that expressly prohibit same-sex marriage cannot legally marry in Massachusetts, and remanded cases from New York and Rhode Island to the Superior Court to determine whether same-sex marriage is prohibited in those states.[19] \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Massachusetts\n \n There have been attempts at advances on this issue regarding the few states that do not expressly prohibit same-sex marriage, but I do not know their status off-hand.\n \n \n \nThats what I'm talking about.

It is YOU, who seems to be prejudice, and YOU who seems to be hateful. You can't take it that there are people who just don't agree with gay marriage. WELL GET OVER IT!! I don't agree!! And I'm not about to sit here and take the blame for someone else doing, or saying hurtful things to gay people. I would rather have my opinions, and poliely disagree, then go around gay bashing, and insulting people. You feel you have the right to express your views, what the hell makes you think I don't have the right to express mine?! And I will not walk on eggshells because of your prejudice towards people who don't agree with that lifestyle. Plus, you only have your sons father who is gay. I have family members, who are gay. And I worried about people gay bashing my uncle all the time. Why would I be apart of something that would harm my family as well. YOUR family is not the only one who suffers. So YOU can cut the XXXX, about who is hurting YOUR family. I don't agree with gay marriage piont blank. If you think I'm hateful, then go right ahead!! I really don't give to shakes of a rats rusty backside!! I have the right to agree or disagree. The only time it hurts your family is if I was right there gay bashing, and on the news. I'm not taking any responsibility for anything that happens to your family because of gay issues. Plus I don't even know you. But it seems like you go overboard and think that everyone wants to attack YOUR family!! Goodness forbid that someone doesn't like the same ice cream flavor as you, all of a sudden they are harming your family because they don't like the same ice cream your family likes. Get a life honey and stop taking things so personaly that you feel everyone is out to get you just because they don't agree with you. You talk about hate, but you replaced the so-called hate that you fight against, with your own kind of hate. Hate towards those who don't agree with that lifestyle. So if I'm accountable for something, then so are you. You help hate circulate by harboring it in yourself, towards those whom you feel it is justified. Disagreeing is not hateful, but using hate to fufill what you beieve is right is. And hateful is also hating those who don't agree with you, by saying they are part of a problem. I see a problem when I read the anger you have towards people who disagree. That is part of a big problem that you ar accountable for. I rest my case, regardless of whether you like it or not.

It just isn't recognized by 49 out of 50 states. Is that \"harmful\" to society?\n Second, what you think that \"tells people\" is your own interpretation. Quite frankly, it makes no sense to me. Just because gay marriage is allowed doesn't mean anything about the \"original purpose\".\n People change. Societies change.\n That doesn't necessarily mean anything bad or good about previous situations.\n Third, what do you think the \"original purpose\" of marriage actually was?\n And how does the modern heterosexual observance of the \"original purpose\" stack up?\n \n \n \nThe fact that you have a problem with people politely disagreeing is like saying we don't have the right to disagree.\n\n We're talking about more than just \"disagreeing\" here.\n Two people can disagree without a value judgment being placed on a group of people. Nobody is saying that JUST disagreeing is harmful.\n \n What we're talking about SPECIFICALLY here is a negative value judgment being placed on gays.\n Continuing to ignore that is not debate.

Everytime anyone speaks as such, they do my family damage. \n\n \n I'm curious as to where exactly you draw the line there. At what point, specifically, does disagreement about gay relations turn harmful? While I disagree with Spicy on the adoption issue, I can't go along with this idea of yours that mere disagreement to any extent on homosexality is harmful. This IS a national debate, and people are going to have to accept that there are opinions on both sides to be said. To not do so, and try to sweep one whole side under the rug by arbitrarily declaring the whole thing harmful with no regard for specifics or degree is going to get you nowhere. \n \n But here's the thing: even if it IS harmful to some unknown degree, I think it is safe to say that you have a lot worse opponents out there than someone who quietly, politely, and respectfully disagrees. So it seems odd to me that you put as much effort into the opposing the respectful voices rather than opposing those who CLEARLY hate gay people and do so vocally. Is it because you won't get as much virulent argument out of the more respectful ones that you target them with this unreasonable and unrealistic idea of yours? Using your logic, I could claim ANY position held by anyone on ANY issue is harmful. That's how wide-open your standard is here, to what constitutes harm. So again, where do you draw that line specifically to where it becomes harmful? Someone saying \"God hates gays\" as publically as they can? Someone who \"has no problem with gays whatsoever other than a little homophobia?\" Somewhere in-between? Because if you're going to keep this up nearly every single time someone argues with you respectfully on a homosexuality-related issue, you need to say.\n \n I'd also like to know what harm, specifically, comes from someone giving respectful disagreement in the debate. To what extent are you hurt by that? Because I suspect you can't really quantify it.",

One can most assuredly predict what the outcome of such a family will be. 30 years of research has shown repeatedly that children of same-sex couples fare no worse nor better that opposite-sex couples.

I am pleased that you will not beat a gay person to death, but I will never say you aren't part of the problem.

Even the very idea that some people's level of humanity is open for debate is sickening.\n \n Let me make this analogy. Is there anyone in your life, whom you love, who is a blonde? What if violence was committed against them for being blond? Or maybe there were efforts to not allow them access to public schools, or roads, or marriage. Or maybe people just loudly or quietly preached or debated that blondes weren't natural, weren't loved by God, or were bad parents. Where would you draw the line?

If there were some instances in the world where blondes were being killed I would NOT blame anyone who happened to respectfully think blondes shouldn't get married for some reason;I'd blame the people that were doing the violence. It's that simple. In fact, I'd want to dialog with the people who felt that way about blondes and find out why they felt that way, and what their concerns were. The ONLY ones I'd blame for violence are those who are violent and commit violent acts. I just don't understand your mindset on this.\n \n Where I draw the line is this: people who do crimes are the ones blamed for the crimes. Not so-and-so in a completely different town/state/country who who just happens to share SOME degree of a view on an issue. If you want to stop violence, then stop violence and violent people--don't seek to shut down dialog and the marketplace of conversation just because a violent person happens to have a similar view on some issue to some degree as whomever you are conversing with. It's not only unfactual to blame non-violent people for violence, but it sells short the gay rights movement because it misplaces blame that should be going to the right place.",

If there were some instances in the world where blondes were being killed I would NOT blame anyone who happened to respectfully think blondes shouldn't get married for some reason;I'd blame the people that were doing the violence.

The hate is not at the same level as someone who would want to kill blondes. It's hate, and hate begets hate. Although, there are other issues a person has which would make him or her react in a certain way; the hate is the prominent one when he or she reacts that way towards someone identified with a group. Well, yes, the blame for the worst and most violent manifestations of racism, homophobia, etc., should go to the person doing those acts. However, where is the vacuum where he or she lives?",

There is more at stake here - legal access and recognition of different types of families, discrimination in housing and employment, the idea that the gay experience ever has to be \"kept quiet\" (something you, yourself support, i.e., stories about gay penguins or gay families in school), and the very idea that whether these things should be granted to any law-abiding citizen should be up for debate by those who are not part of the impacted group - all of these things are part of the problem. So are the arguments used against gays, gay marriage, and preventing gay discrimination.

Only those issues where people are getting hurt due to an ideology that claims a superiroity to another group of people - PREJUDICE.\n\n \n But that's just it--you have no idea 'if it's due to an ideology' or not. You claim it is because it just so happens that some people on your side of the issue has experienced violence. But to claim mere disagreement alone is a cause is just not reasonable. That's why I asked you earlier to tell me at hat point, specifically, ideology becomes harmful. At what point in the ideology does it become a catalyst for violence. I'm sure that at SOME point, ideology does do that. Naturally, if someone says \"gays should be killed\" then that's dangerous. But I think it's ridiculous to say that something like saying \"gays shouldn't redefine marriage\" is a catalyst for violence. Or even if someone says \"I morally disagree that gay sex is ok.\" Those aren't people to blame for violence against gays, and the fact you basically have to jump through roundabout speculative hoops to make blame stick to such people says it all.\n \n \nYou may not buy into all of these - but they exist none the less; \"gays are sinful\", \"gay parents are bad/confusing for children\", \"gays are a threat to marriage, society, the American way, etc.\"\n\n \n But those are examples of statement directed at gay people, not at things like marriage and homosexuality relations. If you're only condemning statements of people that say that, then fine, because most people who oppose gay marriage or are on the other side of the fence on these issues don't say that. They don't say \"gays are bad\" they say \"gay marriage is bad\" or \"gay relations is wrong\", etc. Those are two VERY different concepts and the difference is VERY important. But even there, I don't see that you've proven how those views truly cause harm. It's when people act on those view and hurt people that it matters.\n \n \nMaybe you don't condone violence. Maybe you wouldn't choose it. But you make it easier for those who do to justify it. What does one do with a threat afterall?\n\n \n Like I said, that could be said about any issue. I could just as justifiably claim that when someone says \"America is bad\" it makes it easier for terrorists to justify terrorist acts on Americans. But we don't tell people they can't say \"America is bad.\" Opinions are opinions, and actions are actions. When people support legalized medical marajuana, it makes it easier for people to harm themselves with marajuana. We don't tell people they can't have an opinion that we should have legalized marajuana.\n \n \nAnd by the way, you speak ugly untruths about people I love. You bet your XXX I condemn you for it.\n \n \n Nope; I do not speak anything about anyone you love (or hate, or are otherwise connected with in some way).

   "Relative patterns of psychiatric illness and wellness among lesbian and gay people as compared to heterosexuals have yet to be completely understood. Nevertheless, the effects of homophobia seem to fall disproportionately on lesbian and gay youth, who are more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual youth (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1989). Same sex marriage would signal to these adolescents that emotionally fulfilling same sex relationships are not only possible, but validated by society. \n \n Lack of recognition of same sex relationship and their families can lead to a failure to provide appropriate mental health care. If same sex marriage were legal, then the partner would more likely be included in mental health treatment and planning.

   "Oh do tell me how I am trying to prevent you from having an opinion!? Thats rich. Have your stupid and wrong opinion all you want. Just know I will point it out for what it is when you voice it (stupid, mean, hateful, wrong, unjust, ugly, foul, you get the picture).\n\n \n That is the very reason I called you a bigot. Because you have a preconcieved idea, about people who hold a different opinion then yourself. So No, I'm clear about the definition. Hello!! It doesn't only go for color, it also goes for anything that someone is prejudice against. \n \n \nAnyway - you are missing the point. We are well aware that most who disagrees with gay marriage, or even who all-out hate gays aren't likely to engage in acts of violence. We are saying however, that your quiet disagreement - although, yes, you are entitled to it - isn't harmless. It hurts. And it does help those who do engage in violence justify their actions.\n\n \n Disagreement does not justifiy violent actions. So it is you who seems to be misunderstanding something. I'm not going to go out and change the way I look at life, just because you feel it is harmful. There are people out there that think liking the number 13 is harmful. Is it?! No, but thats something conjured up only in thier mind. Kind of like you conjuring up silly things just to prove some obsurd point. Let me give you another example, since you used blonds, then lets take another look at it. There are alot of people who disagree with blond as a good hair color. I don't see people doing hate crimes on people with blond hair. Some just disagree with that hair color. So disagreeing is not harmful. And you are the one that brought that point up. You said that silent disagreeing is harmful. Well thats your opinion. I think that mindframes like yours is harmful. \n \n \nAnd, do get up. You just tripped over your ego, My thinking, wait, KNOWING you are dead wrong about gays, gay parents and gay marriage and saying so is not an indicator of my sanity.\n\n \n Get up from where?! I never fell. Maybe in your eyes, but not in mine. And that is what counts. I feel no shame in what I believe, regardless of whether you like it or not. So maybe you need to either get up yourself, or stop seeing things.\n \n \n \n \nWell you said you weren't going to debate the topic anymore - I assumed you were conceding.\n\n \n I said I'd stop commenting to your posts. But what the heck, I'm still doing it.\n \n \n \n \nAnd I label you a one eyed one one horned flying purple people eater.\n\n \n Real cute! How intelligent. Thanks for the compliment.emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \n \nI am happy to continue defending my opinion and those I care about. My head is fine. But if you can't take it, I understand.\n\n \n And I'm happy to defend mine. It is you who can't take someone disagreeing with you. I'm sick of the whole,\" You're hurting my family speech.\" But handling you is a walk in the park. But also very annoying. I'd bet you'd be nothing if you didn't have your son, and family to keep throwing into the pot. Stop hiding behind them and start doing the debate on your own. \n \n \n \nI am in a debate forum. I expect them disagree - hence my being here arguing my points and stuff.\n\n \n LOL!! And thats why you can't even take a silent disagreement.(and stuff?) LOL\n \n \n \nI do not. But anti-gay rhetoric is harmful to his father, his family, etc. I even gave you an example of how it has manifested harm in his life.\n\n \n And I'm most sorry for that. But will not take responsibility for it. But I dislike anyone who is harming him physically, and mentally.\n \n \n \n \nHe is living the debate, sunshine. I know nobody in here has attacked him. However there are people - LIKE YOU - in here who supprt ideas that do cause him harm. Hence my fighting said ideas. Really - this isn't rocket science.\n\n \n First of all my username is not sunshine.emoticon_rolleyes Like I said, I'm not goning to feel guilty for holding my own opinion. And I'm not taking the responsability for any harm done to your son. I don't even know you or him, and before I started posting here, you did not know my views.So they were not harmful to you or your child. So like they say, what you don't know won't hurt you. But what does not kill you, makes you stronger. So you'll have to either be stronger because of people not agreeing to that lifestyle, or you can let it eat you up inside. But whatever course you take, or don't take. YOU and ONLY YOU!! Are responsiable for it. Blaming others for something that happns to you, is your fault. Not excluding the ones who commit hate crimes. But the fact that you don't like my stand, and how its affecting you. Is your problem not mine. \n \n \n \nAnd I see a little girl with little to no life experience, minimal education and much more of a reactionary attitude to opposition than me.\n\n \n And this from a 40 year old who can't take others point of view without saying it is harmful. And who ends her statements with,\" And stuff.\" Come on! Does that seem like a reliable source to you?! Let me answer that...NO!! Good try, but not good enough. And just because I don't have as much experience with gay lifestyles, does not mean I don't have life experience. Gay life, is not the only lifestyle out there.

Nevertheless, the effects of homophobia seem to fall disproportionately on lesbian and gay youth, who are more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual youth (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1989). Same sex marriage would signal to these adolescents that emotionally fulfilling same sex relationships are not only possible, but validated by society. \n \n Lack of recognition of same sex relationship and their families can lead to a failure to provide appropriate mental health care. If same sex marriage were legal, then the partner would more likely be included in mental health treatment and planning. Finally, same sex legal union would foster better psychological integration of the identities of lesbians and gay men, thus facilitating same sex couples' ability to integrate into supportive social networks.

   "If there was no disagreement, would the discrimination exist? In a society where we have a constitution that enforces equality, and a democracy that allows people to create and revoke laws, would the discrimination exist if nobody had \"disagreement\" over gay rights???\n\n \n Do you really think it's tha cut and dry? That everyone who disagrees is a cause of discrimination? I think that's a bit extreme. For one it doesn't take into account that the real cause would more likely be those who don't have a respectful opinion. Discrimination exists for probably many reasons, but I don't think it's reasonable to be able to just take anyone who respectfully disagrees and say \"You're part of the cause!\" And that's where you're logic goes. IMO, this is a ridiculous debate, because it shouldn't even be an issue. People shouldn't be castigated for disagreeing on something and made to feel like they are causing something awful just by having a respectful opinion. It does nothing good for a healthy debate, and it's treading on ground that is unprovable because no matter what you say here you'll never be able to take any ONE respectful person and prove that THEY were a cause of the \"XXXX\" that you mentioned (whether that's discrimination or whatever). And you know that.\n \n \nIf the disagreement isn't \"silent\", and people make known their desire to discriminate against gays, that does have an impact.\n\n \n Impact or cause? You're using a lighter term. Since you aren't using the term \"cause\" can I assume you agree that attributing cause to someone wh respectfully disagrees is unreasonable?\n \n And for what it's worth, I think you're also just about as hard pressed to prove any one person has an impact.\n \n \nI have given the proof before, with again no comment from you. I showed that around 70% of the people who are against gay marriage are ALSO against any form of gay union recognition.\n We could do further math and demonstrate that those against gay marriage also have a majority (of that sub-group) against a variety of other gay equality issues.\n They're against gays. Not JUST gay marriage.\n\n \n What does that have to do with people who respectfully disagreeing being a CAUSE for the \"XXXX\" that gays deal with?\n \n \nWhat the hell do you think we're \"disagreeing\" on in the first place???\n\n \n Oh come on. You know what I mean. it could be any number of issues--that gay relations are morally ok, for instance. Or disagreeing that gays should be able to redefine marriage (while still being for them getting couples' benefits). I shouldn't have to define for you what would be respectful disagreement. Now it's YOU who apparently needs to obvious pointed out to you.\n \n \nYou don't see how the anti-gay side, disagreeing with the pro-gay side, on the issue of gay rights can lead to discrimination???\n The anti-gay support for discrimination LEADING TO discrimination???\n\n \n No, not necessarily. It's ust not that simple, and you know that. I also think it's interesting that you're talking in terms of the WHOLE SIDE rather than individuals, because it's individuals that we're talking about here. If you can't prove to me that any ONE respectful person is a cause, then you don't have a case. That's what you don't get--when you post some article or APA report that says supported discrimination hurts gays, that doesn't prove to me that MY opinions are harming gays. ME. Or any other ONE person. Not the mush of anti-gayism (with ALL it's degrees, respectul or NON-respectful) out there, or however you want to broadly refer to it. \"Supported discrimination\" is about the discrimination being harmful, NOT the people who respectfully disagree on some area that touches on homosexuality. You're dealing with something so gray an area, and something so non-concrete, it can't be quantified. But go ahead, think that you can quantify it, all the time unable to do so.",

   "That is the very reason I called you a bigot. Because you have a preconcieved idea, about people who hold a different opinion then yourself. So No, I'm clear about the definition. Hello!! It doesn't only go for color, it also goes for anything that someone is prejudice against. \n \n \n I know what a bigot is. I am just curious as to what you are basing your accusation of calling me one. I have an opinion about gay people, relationships, and parenting. You have an opinion about gay people, relationships, parenting. Our opinions are not the same. If I am bigot for disagreeing with your opinion than you must be a bigot, too.\n \n I would like to remind you that this started when you stated that gays raising children was bad for children and society. That wasn't preconception - its something you actually said. When it comes to gays and raising kids - one of us here has actual real life experience - and yet you hold steadfast to your opinion and accuse me of having preconceived ideas.\n \n \n \nDisagreement does not justifiy violent actions. \n\n \n Of course it doesn't. Nor do I believe that you think it does. What I am saying is that it helps those who would carry out violence carry justify it to themselves.\n \n \nSo it is you who seems to be misunderstanding something. \n\n \n No, I'm not. I am disagreeing with you on whether or not silent disagreement helps create a hostile environment for gays and gay families. Disagreeing with you does not denote a misunderstanding on my part.\n \n \nI'm not going to go out and change the way I look at life, just because you feel it is harmful. \n\n \n Would if it actually was proven to be harmful?\n \n \nThere are people out there that think liking the number 13 is harmful. Is it?! No, but thats something conjured up only in thier mind. Kind of like you conjuring up silly things just to prove some obsurd point. \n\n \n That idea that discrimination is harmful is not an absurd point. \n \n \nLet me give you another example, since you used blonds, then lets take another look at it. There are alot of people who disagree with blond as a good hair color. I don't see people doing hate crimes on people with blond hair. Some just disagree with that hair color. So disagreeing is not harmful. And you are the one that brought that point up. You said that silent disagreeing is harmful. Well thats your opinion. \n\n \n OK - lets continue this example. Lets say we have a room full of brunettes. A couple of them think blondes are just fine. Most think blonde is not a good hair color. That blondes are bad for society. That blondes are bad parents. That blondes shouldn't get married. About half think that it should be OK to discriminate against blondes in housing and employment. Only one thinks that blondes should die. In walks a blonde and his/her child/family. \n \n Lets make it more personal. Lets take the same room - only its not blondes they have a problem with - its you. Is it a place you would feel safe? Is it a place you take your neices/nephews? \n \n And you are right - in general nobody is committing acts of hate violence against blondes. Nor are there really any groups questioning whether they are good for society, marriage, children, etc. Both are being done to gays. You do the math on what silent disagreement may do to a family.\n \n \nI think that mindframes like yours is harmful. \n\n \n I bet.\n \n \nReal cute! How intelligent. Thanks for the compliment.emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n It was no more inane than your labeling me INSANE. By the way, did I mention I am a part-time mental health worker in Dakota County, MN?\n \n \nIt is you who can't take someone disagreeing with you. \n\n \n And you have been example of tolerance in those who disagree with you? Hell - not sharing your point of view makes one a bigot!\n \n \nI'm sick of the whole,\" You're hurting my family speech.\" But handling you is a walk in the park. But also very annoying. I'd bet you'd be nothing if you didn't have your son, and family to keep throwing into the pot. Stop hiding behind them and start doing the debate on your own. \n\n \n I would support gay rights regarldess. I supported them before I was ever even pregnant. I just happen to have relevant life experiences that pokes holes in your opinions. \n \n And how about not making assumptions about who I am, can be, will be, was? You know my stance on a single issue. That hardly makes you an expert as to my character.\n \n \nLOL!! And thats why you can't even take a silent disagreement.(and stuff?) LOL\n\n \n Lighten up.\n \n \nAnd I'm most sorry for that. But will not take responsibility for it. But I dislike anyone who is harming him physically, and mentally.\n\n \n And what do you suppose saying his family is bad for society does for his mental health?\n \n \nBut what does not kill you, makes you stronger. \n\n \n I have been through holy hell and back - I really don't need this lesson from you.\n \n \nSo you'll have to either be stronger because of people not agreeing to that lifestyle, or you can let it eat you up inside. \n\n \n Or I can continue to argue with those I believe to be wrong. And I can continue to dismantle false arguments used to justify your opinion. My options are much broader than put up or shut up.\n \n \nAnd this from a 40 year old who can't take others point of view without saying it is harmful. And who ends her statements with,\" And stuff.\" Come on! Does that seem like a reliable source to you?! \n\n \n I was responsding to a comment you made about me. I am the expert on me. \n \n \nAnd just because I don't have as much experience with gay lifestyles, does not mean I don't have life experience. Gay life, is not the only lifestyle out there. So yes, as far as that gose, I'm proud I don't! \n\n \n Somebody's insecurities showing again? Who said anything about gay lifestyle? First of all - what is a gay lifestyle? There is just life. Secondly - I said I believed you had limited life experience - it was meant to be a comment on the fact that I believe you to be very young.\n \n Its interesting that you claim having little or no interaction whith the \"gay lifestyle\" (those who are alive and gay???) and are even proud of that. You basically announce your ignorance on the matter and yet still feel qualified to make judgement calls about these people and their families? What were you saying about preconceptions?\n \n By the way - I'm not gay.",

You have an opinion about gay people, relationships, parenting. Our opinions are not the same. If I am bigot for disagreeing with your opinion than you must be a bigot, too.\n\n \n No, You're a bigot for classifying me. I never said your views were, ugly, stupid, hateful, etc. I just disagreed with them. Classifying something, or someone, is walking along the lines of being a bigot. At least in this instance. You classify people who don't agree with that lifestlye as hateful. That is prejudice. Expecially since I'm not a hateful person. I just disagree with that lifestyle. Meaning< I'm not going to practice it, and I'm not going to support it. If thats what they want to do, then fine. But I don't support it. If thats hateful, then you need to look up the word hateful again. Let me.....\n \n HATEFUL\n 1. Arousing or worthy of hatred.deteastable.\n \n HATE\n 1. An extreme feeling of dislike, animosity.\n \n I don't fit into any of these definitions. So before you keep calling me hateful, you better think about it first. You don't know me enough to say I'm hateful. And none of my statements here have shown that I'm hateful towards gays. If I was hateful towards them, I would condone gay bashing. I wouldn't be ready to entertain my gay cousin and his friends this weekend, when they come and visit. And I wouldn't be so kind to my gay neighbors downstairs from me. SO!! That is why I called you a bigot. You took a word and tried to push it on my, because you are prejudice against any who disagree with gay marriage. Whether it makes sense or not. Bigots do that. They don't think about it, they just lash out, at anyone who does not fit into their mindframe, color, etc. And thats what you did.\n \n \n \nI would like to remind you that this started when you stated that gays raising children was bad for children and society. That wasn't preconception - its something you actually said. When it comes to gays and raising kids - one of us here has actual real life experience - and yet you hold steadfast to your opinion and accuse me of having preconceived ideas.\n\n \n Yup That is what I said. BUT, I'm talking about your continuing to call me hateful because I disagree. You have a preconcieved idea, about people who disagree with you. You set them all up in the same class as the ones, who outwardly oppose gays. That is a preconcieved idea. And a fallcey. And trending on the lines of saying people cannot have an opinion without being hateful.\n \n \n \n \nWhat I am saying is that it helps those who would carry out violence carry justify it to themselves.\n\n \n Again that problem lays with the ones who carry out the crimes. If they can't distinguish between, mere disagreement, and justification of their actions. Then they have the distorted view. They have the problem with brain patterns working correctly. The problem STILL does not rest with the ones who disagree, and do nothing more. To say that is a fallcey.\n \n \n \n \n \nNo, I'm not. I am disagreeing with you on whether or not silent disagreement helps create a hostile environment for gays and gay families. Disagreeing with you does not denote a misunderstanding on my part.\n\n \n Its a misunderstanding when you quote someone wrong, and misuse words against them it is. Me being part of a big problem, is a misunderstanding you choose to accept. Although I could care less.\n \n \n \n \nWould if it actually was proven to be harmful?\n\n \n Then you be the one to prove it to be harmful. And don't quote articals that are based on people who are outwardly, claiming gays are bad. Find a source that shows, without a doubt, that disagreeing is what is helping people commit violent crimes. People who respectfully disagree, still help create gay violence. And lets not use any WHAT IF'S.\n \n \n \n \nThat idea that discrimination is harmful is not an absurd point.\n \n \n No, but your assumptions are.\n \n \n \nOK - lets continue this example. Lets say we have a room full of brunettes. A couple of them think blondes are just fine. Most think blonde is not a good hair color. That blondes are bad for society. That blondes are bad parents. That blondes shouldn't get married. About half think that it should be OK to discriminate against blondes in housing and employment. Only one thinks that blondes should die. In walks a blonde and his/her child/family. \n \n Lets make it more personal. Lets take the same room - only its not blondes they have a problem with - its you. Is it a place you would feel safe? Is it a place you take your neices/nephews?\n\n \n If it was me. No I would not feel comfortable. And being black, I do get discriminated against. And people will choose lighter skin over darker when it comes to chossing someone for a job. But you know what?! I really don't care. Because I feel this way, ones who are activly discriminating against me, are the ones to blame. Ones who don't want to give me jobs because I'm black, and ones who want to harm me because of my color. They are the ones to blame. But the ones who silently disagree, then I could care less. As long as they are not getting in my way. They can have their opinion. And as long as they don't harm me physically, then feel what you want to feel. It won't stop me. If a person is self-confident as they say they are, they wouldn't worry about ones not doing them harm by disagreeing. They would only worry about those who, actively stand in their way. I don't stand in anyones way. I disagree, and as long as no one is trying to force me into what I don't like. Then I usually keep it to myself. But since this is a debate forum, here I go... \n \n \nYou do the math on what silent disagreement may do to a family.\n\n \n I already did if you read my reply up top.\n \n \n \nI bet.\n\n \n I bet you do. You wanna keep playing the game of who bets?!emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nIt was no more inane than your labeling me INSANE. By the way, did I mention I am a part-time mental health worker in Dakota County, MN?\n\n \n Not saying that your really insane. But what does that prove. Plenty of shrinks/mental health workers have lost their license because off doing things that are mentally unfit. A postion in life proves nothing now-a-days. Its just a postion. Although I don't think you are really insane, just some of your statements.\n \n \n \n \nAnd you have been example of tolerance in those who disagree with you? Hell - not sharing your point of view makes one a bigot!\n\n \n No, but crazy statements do.\n \n \n \nI would support gay rights regarldess. I supported them before I was ever even pregnant. I just happen to have relevant life experiences that pokes holes in your opinions.\n\n \n Not really. You still didn't settle that silent disagreeing argument. \n \n \nAnd how about not making assumptions about who I am, can be, will be, was? You know my stance on a single issue. That hardly makes you an expert as to my character.\n\n \n I never judged your character. I was refering to your statements, and what your argument was based on. Connect the dots here!!\n \n \n \n \nLighten up.\n\n \n Only if you do.:)\n \n \n \n \nAnd what do you suppose saying his family is bad for society does for his mental health?\n\n \n I'm sure your going to tell everyone. Anyway, having my opinion respectfully, is not harming him. He doesn't even know I exisist. Big part my views are playing in his life.emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \n \nI have been through holy hell and back - I really don't need this lesson from you.\n\n \n If you're on here talking to me you will, hear it. The only way you won't have to hear what I'm saying, is if you stop talking to me. Until then I will speak my mind, regardless of whether you think you want to hear it or not.

In that case it will be choice number three, and that is,\" Ring the alarm, baby!!\" *Joke*\n \n \n \n \nI was responsding to a comment you made about me. I am the expert on me.\n\n \n I'm not claiming anything personal towards you. So I guess you would know yourself more, then a stranger would. No arguments there. But I know the stuff that I see written down, thats what I attack. \n \n \n \n \nSomebody's insecurities showing again? Who said anything about gay lifestyle? First of all - what is a gay lifestyle? There is just life. Secondly - I said I believed you had limited life experience - it was meant to be a comment on the fact that I believe you to be very young.\n\n \n Isn't it, gay lifestyle that we are discussing here?! Gay marriage etc.? So that is what I assumed you were alluding to. And judging from your comment at the bottom, that is what you are saying. So for which I'm saying, I'm not ashamed I don't have experience as far as knowing about that lifestyle. I know enough about it.\n Plus my age is not an issuse. I know what I'm talking about, and what my stand is. So being young has nothing to do with it.(That may sound hypocritical, since I made comments about yor age. Oh well your allowed one)\n \n \n \nIts interesting that you claim having little or no interaction whith the \"gay lifestyle\" (those who are alive and gay???) and are even proud of that. You basically announce your ignorance on the matter and yet still feel qualified to make judgement calls about these people and their families? What were you saying about preconceptions?\n\n \n I know poison kills, and never drank it. I know in china they speak chinese, and never been there. I know how a gun works and never held one. So your point is?! I know about gay life from, people around me. Just because I'm not in it, does not mean I'm ignorent to it.\n \n \nBy the way - I'm not gay.\n\n Didn't say you were.",

   "I am talking about people who argue over the existence of a discriminatory practice.\n\n \n So given than that's specifically what you're talking about, should I assume that you don't think someone's moral disagreement over homosexuality causes harm? Because you only seem to want to talk about the discriminatory question.\n \n We also need to remember that what is discriminatory in this is very much a matter of opinion. As well as whether or not the discrimination is warranted.\n \n \n \nWhen it comes to votes in favor of discrimination, or voices which enable discrimination to continue, the \"respectfulness\" of the voice is irrelevant.\n\n \n We aren't talking abot voting here. But if you're going to continue with these vague statements like \"voices which enable\", you need to quantify it and give examples. What constitutes a voice that doesn't enable discrimination to continue? I'm simply not going to let you get away with these vague statements if you insist on making them. Give some specifics and draw the lines.\n \n \nAre you telling me that you think that if every voice in opposition of gay equality on issues like adoption or gay civil unions were suddenly turned into \"respectful opinions\", that it would mean the discrimination would cease to exist?\n\n \n I don't know. That's the point, no one does. You working off an unfounded premise.\n \n \nYou have given no reason why that isn't the case.\n\n \n It makes no sense that it WOULD be the case to begin with. It makes much MORE sense that the disrespectful and hateful voices would be fueling the \"XXXX\" gays deal with. ( as you put it)\n \n \nMoreover, just because MULTIPLE things may cause X to exist, doesn't mean that an individual component of the cause of X is somehow absolved of its part in causing X to exist.\n\n \n The key word is \"MAY\" cause, in the first part of your statement. It's funny how you jump to the automatic assumption that those individual components are the cause with a word like \"may\" in your premise. And then even expect someone to prove they aren't (a negative).\n \n \nIt's funny how you often castigate gays in their fight for equality\n\n \n Back it up. Where have I castigated gays? Or is that another unbacked claim?\n \n \nAlong those lines, do you disagree with what I ACTUALLY said above?\n\n \n The little \"logic\" statement or what?\n \n \nNo. I don't know what you mean as it hasn't been explicitly defined before. \"redefining marriage\"? That is supported discrimination. \n\n \n Well, in your opinion. emoticon_xgood \n \n \n\"morally ok\"? I personally could care less about. \n\n \n Really? You could care less that some morally disapprove of homosexuality? Wow! That's quite a statement.\n \n \nIt's funny how you did that.\n I was talking about just DISAGREEMENT and what issues the DISAGREEMENT revolves around.\n I said nothing about \"respectful\". I made no question regarding \"respectful\".\n And then you turn around and pretend I need the obvious regarding \"respectful disagreement\" pointed out.\n\n \n \nAnd for the record Jyoshu, don't think it has gone unnoticed how you suddenly have dropped the \"silent disagreement\" approach, replacing \"silent\" with \"respectful\".\n\n \n \"respectful\" has been a part of this from early on, before you even weighed in. We've been talking about opinions that weren't hateful and respectful, and the fact that there is a difference. Let me help you get back on track: Some people respectfully disagree on issues related to homosexuality. The issue is whenever someone does that, it causes harm. Remember now? Please try to keep up. \n \n \nHow do you differentiate a SIGNIFICANT difference between \"whole side\" and \"individuals\"?\n\n \n It's very simple, and it's a very crucial difference. The \"whole side\" contains both people who are very hateful and obviously harmful, the Phelpsian types. It could be said that it contains people who also disagree on these issues without being hateful, and without being rooted in hate, and respectfully give their opinions. It IS a national debate, after all. I'd say that's a significant difference. Both may disagree that gays should have marriage, but may completely differ in the other details (such as that gays should STILL get couples' benefits). When you focus ONLY on the whole group the whole point of the debate is lost because you'v then added hateful dissenters to the equation, when it's about the non-hateful ones.\n \n \nThis is a mundane refusal to admit the obvious!\n If 100 people push a brick wall and force it to topple, then it's not just the \"whole side\" of the 100 people, but each individual person involved bears a responsibility for toppling that brick wall.\n\n \n Depends! Some of them might not even be pushing, but they may be on that side of the wall--that's the whole point!\n \n And for the record Jyoshu, don't think it has gone unnoticed how you suddenly have dropped the \"silent disagreement\" approach, replacing \"silent\" with \"respectful\".",

   "Well I didn't mean to be such a bitch, because you weren't talking to me, but stating an opinion. I don't know if you realize how hearing that so much and so often can make a person feel. In my mind this is what I heard: \"You are harming your kid and society at large by doing what feels right and natural to you. I still remember vividly having a violent, homophobic jerk for an upstairs neighbor a few years ago. He used to alternate between beating his girlfriend and (trying) to intimidate us. She used to holler hateful XXXX at us too, come to think of it. So anyway, I can be a bit sensitive at times, I admit. I apologize if I said you were personally dishing out XXXX at me.\n\n \n Thats ok dude! We all have our, bite your head off moments.LOL :) That upstairs neighbor was a jerk. He couldn't even take care of a woman right. So he really shouldn't have been saying anything about someone else. And I don't know why she was talking! She had other things to worry about. Like not getting her head bashed in.emoticon_rolleyes They were both just fools.\n \n A guy here bothers the two guys downstairs form me. He even peed on their welcome mat. He also broke into their car and messed it up really bad. And then shot at the door of the car. They had to get a new one. And not only that, he threated their life. They are thinking about moving. I think that is taking an opinion too far. That is just nasty!! \n \n \nYou didn't say they had any kids, so I'm going on the assumption (yeah I know) that they don't have any. So if your upstairs neighbors adopted a kid, or one of them had a kid from another marriage, you would think they were harming the child and society?\n\n \n They have a daughter. And no, I don't agree with it. I think that a child should grow up in a home with a mother and a father. A mother is nurturing, and has a special bond with a child. While a father is more of a protector. I just believe in the balance of a mother and father. I don't think its healthy, from my standpoint to have two people, of the same sex raising a child. To me there is no balance. I know some will disagree. But that my unwavering stand on it. \n \n \nWould you tell them that? Actually, I'm sort of curious. No one here in this community has ever said anything like that to us, but sometimes I wonder how they really feel.\n\n \n I don't know how they feel. But no, I would not tell them that. Its not my place to tell them that. That is not my business to go up to them and say nasty things. Like I've been saying all along. I don't agree, but I'm not going to harass, those who do pactice it. I just won't practice it, or support it. I'll just live my life according to the standards that I go by. And treat all humans with respect. Anything else?! I'll answer more questions.lol",

   "So given than that's specifically what you're talking about, should I assume that you don't think someone's moral disagreement over homosexuality causes harm? Because you only seem to want to talk about the discriminatory question.\n\n It can cause harm, depending upon the importance a person places upon a need for moral \"agreement\" or approval.\n Your moral agreement means nothing to me.\n But if a father were to morally disagree with who his son or daughter is, that could have deep and long-lasting repercussions.\n \n \n \nWe also need to remember that what is discriminatory in this is very much a matter of opinion. As well as whether or not the discrimination is warranted.\n\n Whether or not discrimination is warranted is obviously a debatable issue involving value judgments.\n Whether or not something is \"discriminatory\" being a \"matter of opinion\"???\n emoticon_xdonno \n \n discriminate: To make distinctions on the basis of class or category without regard to individual merit; show preference or prejudice: was accused of discriminating against women; discriminated in favor of his cronies.\n http://www.answers.com/topic/discriminate\n \n It's a word with a definition. Something either fits, or it doesn't.\n To pretend it's a \"matter of opinion\" is just plain wrong.\n \n If somebody says that somebody is disqualified because they are gay, that is DISCRIMINATION.\n Jyoshu? Can you give me an example of something you think is debatable with regards to whether or not it is discrimination?\n \n \n \nWe aren't talking abot voting here. But if you're going to continue with these vague statements like \"voices which enable\", you need to quantify it and give examples. What constitutes a voice that doesn't enable discrimination to continue?\n\n A voice which fights against it.\n Take the gay marriage / gay civil union issue.\n Those people who don't voice an opinion in favor of gay civil unions are enabling the discrimination between heterosexual and homosexual couples to continue.\n \n \n \nI'm simply not going to let you get away with these vague statements if you insist on making them. Give some specifics and draw the lines.\n\n Gee. Can I count on the same from you? emoticon_xangel \n \n \n \nI don't know. That's the point, no one does. You working off an unfounded premise.\n\n You don't know because you revel in a position of \"not knowing\", or assuming the best when it comes to the anti-gay side.\n Yes. We do know.\n If every voice out there against gay marriage \"respectfully\" said that gays should not be able to marry, it wouldn't change the situation at all. Discrimination would still continue.\n \n Why do you insist on \"not knowing\" what is obvious?\n \n \n \nIt makes no sense that it WOULD be the case to begin with. It makes much MORE sense that the disrespectful and hateful voices would be fueling the \"XXXX\" gays deal with. ( as you put it)\n\n Mind-BOGGLINGLY missing the point.\n Yes. Gays DO put up with \"XXXX\" from the \"disrespectful and hateful voices\".\n But the RESPECTFUL voices which advocate discrimination ALSO cause us problems.\n \n I really don't know how else to explain it beyond the obvious already stated.\n Suppose 55 people out of 100 said \"no\" to gay marriage, with 45 people of the 55 saying \"%@#$ you gays\".\n If those 45 suddenly just said \"no\" and not demonstrating the disrespect, would that suddenly mean that the problems gays face by not having gay marriage recognition suddenly disappear?\n \n Continue to obfuscate the issue and you'll only be confusing yourself...\n \n \n \nThe key word is \"MAY\" cause...\n\n The \"may\" was an oversight which I will now correct. If you want to argue why the \"may\" needs to be there, then I recommend you do so...\n \n Moreover, just because MULTIPLE things cause X to exist, doesn't mean that an individual component of the cause of X is somehow absolved of its part in causing X to exist.\n \n \n \nBack it up. Where have I castigated gays? Or is that another unbacked claim?\n\n I have NO unbacked claims, unlike you...\n \n For starters, I'll define \"castigate\" because it boggles my mind that you would even pose such an obviously answerable challenge.\n \n castigate: to subject to severe punishment, reproof, or criticism\n \n Secondly? An example?\n How about your criticism of gays for the whole \"Easter\" thing at the White House and the gays making a \"political statement\" wearing matching accessories?\n \n \n \nThe little \"logic\" statement or what?\n\n ROFLMAO!\n I requote it DIRECTLY ABOVE, reposting what you were talking about, and still you insist on the confused response...\n \n For the THIRD time...I have given the proof before, with again no comment from you. I showed that around 70% of the people who are against gay marriage are ALSO against any form of gay union recognition.\n We could do further math and demonstrate that those against gay marriage also have a majority (of that sub-group) against a variety of other gay equality issues.\n They're against gays. Not JUST gay marriage.\n I'll ask again:\n Do you disagree with the indented statements directly above?\n \n \n \nWell, in your opinion. emoticon_xgood \n\n I'm really curious how you think it isn't supported discrimination.\n Please. Explain that one...\n \n \n \nReally? You could care less that some morally disapprove of homosexuality? Wow! That's quite a statement.\n\n 1) Stay in context.\n 2) Why should it be?\n Some people think Christians aren't that bright for believing some of the stuff they do. Does that keep you up at night?\n People morally disapprove of blacks, jews, christians, whites, etc, etc, etc...\n Why waste the energy on being concerned with a situation that I'll never be able to change, and in most cases has no real effect on me?\n \n Now, change that from \"some\" to a SPECIFIC group of people, and it is a whole different ball-game...\n Change that to having an actual effect on me, like denied equal rights, and it's a whole different ball-game...\n And note, I am talking about MY personal perspective...\n \n \n \n\"respectful\" has been a part of this from early on, before you even weighed in. We've been talking about opinions that weren't hateful and respectful, and the fact that there is a difference. Let me help you get back on track: Some people respectfully disagree on issues related to homosexuality. The issue is whenever someone does that, it causes harm. Remember now? Please try to keep up.\n\n You mentioned \"respect\" ONCE in this thread, referring to Jitobear, a couple days ago.\n And then, when you start talking to me, the whole \"silent\" thing disappears, and it's ONLY about \"respect\"...\n http://4forums.com/political/search.php?searchid=112603\n \n I have been talking about the \"silent disagreement\", referencing other people who have talked about \"silent disagreement\".\n And now suddenly, talk about the \"silent disagreement\" disappears in favor of pushing the \"respectful\" disagreement.\n \n Next time, try not to get so pompous when the message board has a pretty good search feature...\n \n \n \nIt's very simple, and it's a very crucial difference. The \"whole side\" contains both people who are very hateful and obviously harmful, the Phelpsian types. It could be said that it contains people who also disagree on these issues without being hateful, and without being rooted in hate, and respectfully give their opinions. It IS a national debate, after all. I'd say that's a significant difference.

When you focus ONLY on the whole group the whole point of the debate is lost because you'v then added hateful dissenters to the equation, when it's about the non-hateful ones.\n\n You've got this habit of trying to throw in \"differences\" which exist, and derive significances to the differences where the significances don't exist. Or, in this case, the significance doesn't negate that BOTH sides of the \"difference\" have a similar effect to varying degrees.\n \n One voice, whether it be hateful or respectful, against gay equality counts just the same at the toll booth. One voice, saying that you can't do \"X\" because you're gay, has an impact. The voice being hateful may cause extra hurt, but that doesn't mean the \"respectful\" voice doesn't cause hurt.\n \n \n \nDepends! Some of them might not even be pushing, but they may be on that side of the wall--that's the whole point!\n\n Man. Dogs chasing their tails make more progress...\n If a person's disagreement is SILENT, which would include \"not even pushing\", then it's a bear fart in the woods.\n \n You took my analogy about 100 people PUSHING on a wall, and then turned around and said that some of the people may not be pushing...\n \n Yeah. So OBVIOUSLY when I was talking about the people PUSHING on the wall, I must have been lumping in those that weren't doing any pushing at all...\n emoticon_xdonno \n \n Yet another question for you to avoid.\n Does ANY of that last part of my reply contain any new information from me???\n Or is it just me repeating the same stuff I already said?",

Respectful disagreement is silent disagreement, they can be used interchangeably.\n\n No. They can't. They are not synonyms.

SPEECHLESS.\n If a person is in \"respectful disagreement\", they are holding the opposition with high regard, but they CAN TALK about their opinion. They can be silent and respectful, or not silent but still respectful.\n And of course, neither silent nor respectful is another option.\n \n Pick up a dictionary and read.\n \n \n \nSo now you change your claim, and say it is harmful?!\n\n No \"change\".\n Just not based on this absurd notion that \"silent\" and \"respectful\" are the same.\n \n \n \nPlus, you all of the examples you gave, were not respectfu/silent disagreement.\n\n The examples I gave were NOT SILENT, nor did I ever claim they were.\n The examples I gave were often not specific to \"respectful\", and could be used as either entirely \"respectful\", disrespectful, or both.\n \n \n \nAnyone who speaks publicly, against anyone, is not silently/respetfully disagreeing.\n\n They sure as heck aren't silent. I will agree there.\n As for \"respectful\", in part it depends upon what you mean by speaking \"against anyone\". This whole discussion on GAY MARRIAGE regarding \"respectful\" is centered around the notion that the \"speaking publicly\" is NOT against GAYS, but rather gay MARRIAGE.\n I will admit that is sometimes a rarety. Despite your claims, YOU have linked to anti-gay web-sites which have slurred gays.\n Ergo, while your posting itself ruled you as not \"silent\", your content in that post demonstrated disrespect.\n \n See the difference?\n \n \n \nHaving an opinion about something is in no way harmful. Because that is what a silent/respectful disagreeen is.\n\n If I had an opinion about God not existing, and don't say anything about it, that is silent.\n If I had an opinion about God not existing, and said that was my opinion, I wouldn't be silent.

   "No, You're a bigot for classifying me. I never said your views were, ugly, stupid, hateful, etc. I just disagreed with them. Classifying something, or someone, is walking along the lines of being a bigot. \n\n \n You say you are black. What if I told you my quite, respectful opinion is that blacks are ugly, lazy, illiterate, gang-banger crooks who are bad for society? Where would you place my views on the scale of love and hate?\n \n (For the record, I in no way, shape or form believe these things. I am speaking hypothetically)\n \n \nAt least in this instance. You classify people who don't agree with that lifestlye as hateful. \n\n \n The arguments used to back up that opinion are false, prejudicial, religiously fueled misinformation. Hate led to the arguments (that you believe) that led to your disgreement. The reasons you \"disagree\" aren't valid. That's why I fight them.\n \n \nThat is prejudice. \n\n \n It is not prejudice to find your opinions wrong or hateful. And I do. You are out of your mind if you think I wouldn't take a comment that directly insults my family with my fists in my pocket. Would you? You don't strike me as the kind of person who would.\n \n \nIf I was hateful towards them, I would condone gay bashing. I wouldn't be ready to entertain my gay cousin and his friends this weekend, when they come and visit. And I wouldn't be so kind to my gay neighbors downstairs from me. SO!! That is why I called you a bigot. You took a word and tried to push it on my, because you are prejudice against any who disagree with gay marriage. Whether it makes sense or not. Bigots do that. They don't think about it, they just lash out, at anyone who does not fit into their mindframe, color, etc. And thats what you did.\n\n \n I lashed out because you said that gay parents are bad for children and society. That is a direct insult to my son, my family and my choices as a parent. Furthermore - it is NOT TRUE. \n \n \nYou have a preconcieved idea, about people who disagree with you. \n\n \n Once again - you know my mind on one issue. Leave your comments within that realm please.\n \n \nYou set them all up in the same class as the ones, who outwardly oppose gays. \n\n \n No I have not. I specifically stated otherwise. I recognize the difference between a peaceful objector and a gay basher. I am saying the peaceful objectors make it easier for the gay bashers. They aren't intentionally doing so - but it does none the less.\n \n \nAnd trending on the lines of saying people cannot have an opinion without being hateful.\n\n \n Anyone can have an opinion. Doesn't mean that there aren't opinions that are harmful and hateful.\n \n \nAgain that problem lays with the ones who carry out the crimes. If they can't distinguish between, mere disagreement, and justification of their actions. Then they have the distorted view. They have the problem with brain patterns working correctly. The problem STILL does not rest with the ones who disagree, and do nothing more. To say that is a fallcey.\n\n \n It would be a lot harder for a gay basher to bash if the environment he was in embraced his victim. \n \n \nThen you be the one to prove it to be harmful. And don't quote articals that are based on people who are outwardly, claiming gays are bad. Find a source that shows, without a doubt, that disagreeing is what is helping people commit violent crimes. People who respectfully disagree, still help create gay violence. And lets not use any WHAT IF'S.\n\n \n It should be obvious. An environment that is hostile or apethetic towards an individual or group will make that environment less safe for that group. In the earlier part of this century black Americans were frequently the targets of horrible violence by racists. The number of people carrying out the violence was limited - but the apathetic, quiet agreement and fear from everyone else was also part of the problem.\n \n It is not OK to quietly sick back and allow harmful misinformation about our gay brothers and sisters be propogated. It is not OK to be apathetic when they are done harm. And even telling me that \"gay parents are bad for children and society\" is propogating harmful information about gay people. \n \n No, you aren't a gay basher. I am sure you aren't even hateful. But that kind of talk about gay people is wrong. It hurts. Its not OK. How do you suppose your gay neighbors and little girl would feel about it if they were to hear it?\n \n \nIf it was me.

In that case it will be choice number three, and that is,\" Ring the alarm, baby!!\" *Joke*\n\n \n No - you were implying I needed to \"put up or shut up\" when it came to opinions like yours.

I know enough about it.\n\n \n I suspect you don't know too much since you believe stuff that isn't true and from what I could tell from your posts you were unwilling to examine posted evidence/links that counters what you believe.\n \n \nPlus my age is not an issuse.

When I am 80 I am sure I will know all the ways I was stupid at 40, like I now know all the ways I was stupid at 20.\n \n \nI know poison kills, and never drank it. I know in china they speak chinese, and never been there. I know how a gun works and never held one. So your point is?! I know about gay life from, people around me. Just because I'm not in it, does not mean I'm ignorent to it.\n\n \n Then tell me - how is gay life different than yours? - they have jobs, interests, bills, hobbies, and desire love and families. Some are lazy, petty, irresponsible, mean. They are pretty much like anyone else. What the hell is it about their lifestyle that you find objectionable? That fact that they, like you, love?",

If people who support gay marriage can speak about it, why is it they we can't lend our opinion RESPECTFULLY, without being judged?\n\n \n That's not how it is working here. What people are doing are examining your arguments and pointing out the flaws. Simply because you don't like that doesn't mean you're being judged. Jyoshu gets his/her arguments shreaded from time to time and you don't see Jyoshu b*tching. That is the great thing about a opinion.

Get that through your head. \n \n \nI think it is hypocritical, to feel you can speak out, and judge others who say their opinions respectfully. Why should anyone have the right to judge others because of what opinions they hold.\n\n \n Again you seem to be confusing refutation of opinions as judgement of a person. However, I will admit that poor arguments often come from people with low amounts of knowledge or little educations, or simply a lack of examiniation of their own beliefs. This is why we go to debate: to ensure that our beliefs are valid and true. If you don't want to to this, don't enter into a debate. That's perfectly fine. Many people do not want to examine their beliefs and simply live their lives. Ignorance truly is bliss for them.

Well they already do, and I really don't give a damn.\n\n \n It was a hypothical comparsion using a argument that takes the logic of a opponent and concludes it as absurd, therefore making the argument absurd.

When one group presupposes a different group is inferior, bad or wrong, without a logical and thoughtful reasoning process; it can't help but cause suspicion, fear and negative bias towards the group that's different.

The two are analogous if the following substitutions are used:\n \n single school = laws governing all civil unions (marriages and gay unions)\n \n black students = gay unions\n \n white students = marriages\n \n Just as there is no need to call black students white students in order for them to be treated equally under the single school roof, there is no need to call gay unions marriages to treat them equally under the single set of laws required to do so.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n And logical fallacy #29. Blindly rewriting my analogy while ignoring what I was saying in the first place.\nI didn't ignore what you said and I didn't blindly rewrite anything.\n \n \n \n\n \"all black students must be called white students\"?\n The point is that they go to the SAME SCHOOL which is just called SCHOOL. Not \"white school\". Not \"black school\". But \"school.\n Marriage? Both gays and straights using the same institution without requiring a \"different name\".\n Nobody is asking that the gays be labelled as \"straight\".\n...and that's a good thing.\n \n \n \n\n Apples and oranges, and you're missing the point.\n 1) \"separate but equal schools\" never worked because they were NEVER MADE EQUAL in the first place. The black schools were always inferior to the white schools.\nThis is true. It is because they were impossible to equalize. They were impossible to equalize because they were two separate entities run by inherently unequal staffs. I do not deny that separate facilities will not work. What I do deny is that it is necessary to change names to allow equal access to a single system such as a set of laws to govern all unions, gay and straight.\n \n \n\n 2) Pointing out the \"DENIED efforts\" only goes to prove my point, which you missed.\nYou appeared to be arguing for and against separate-but-equal, saying gays have been FORBIDDEN in some states to have their own schools. In one case you argue that separate schools cannot be equal while in another you argue that you were DENIED the right to start your own schools. Which is it that you prefer?\n \n \n\n It's nonsensical to insist that we settle for an option which does not exist, and is the less likely to come to fruition.\nThis is exactly what you are doing now...insisting on an option that does not exist.\n \n \n\n Personally? I WOULD settle for separate but equal under the name of \"civil unions\" or something similar.\nThere still doesn't have to be any separation. One set of laws can cover all unions.

Likewise, the gay civil unions are KEPT INFERIOR. So much so that in some states, blacks are FORBIDDEN FROM GOING TO SCHOOL.\n \n Ergo, how \"equal\" is that?\n \n \n \nJust as there is no need to call black students white students in order for them to be treated equally under the single school roof, there is no need to call gay unions marriages to treat them equally under the single set of laws required to do so.\n\n And here is where your \"analogy\" falls to pieces.\n How does the \"single school\" work out with regards to what ACTUALLY HAPPENED with blacks and whites, which were integrated???\n \n And WHY did it work out that way?\n \n You want to focus on how no redefinition is used, but the rest of your analogy falls apart in the wash. It makes no sense.\n \n \n \nI didn't ignore what you said and I didn't blindly rewrite anything.\n\n 1) You DID ignore what I said, as you didn't actually comment on what I said.\n I still have seen no comment on the fact that gay civil unions are EXPRESSLY ILLEGAL in some states.\n 2) I wrote the analogy on the 2nd of February.\n You responded after the 2nd of February, rewriting it.\n \n \n \nThis is true. It is because they were impossible to equalize. They were impossible to equalize because they were two separate entities run by inherently unequal staffs.\n\n Actually, this is a false statement with regards solely to the phrase \"impossible to equalize\".\n They COULD HAVE BEEN equalized.\n There was nothing \"impossible\" about the capability to equalize, unless you're talking about \"equality\" to the millionth decimal place, whereby if the janitor in the black school was lazier and only cleaned once a week, that would constitute \"inequality\".\n It would overlook the main purpose of the whole discussion in favor of squabbling over minutia.\n \n The point is that black schools were KEPT inferior all the way around. KEPT inferior.\n Just like gay civil unions are being kept inferior today, except with the gays there is the whole legislative issue with laws against civil unions...\n \n And on another note, utilizing your usage of the words, how \"impossible\" is it to equalize straight marriage and gay civil unions when some states EXPLICITLY FORBID gay civil unions from being created or recognized in their state?\n \n \n \nI do not deny that separate facilities will not work. What I do deny is that it is necessary to change names to allow equal access to a single system such as a set of laws to govern all unions, gay and straight.\n\n If EQUAL gay civil unions ACTUALLY EXISTED, it wouldn't be \"necessary\".\n That is part of my point that I don't think you appreciate.\n \n \n \nYou appeared to be arguing for and against separate-but-equal, saying gays have been FORBIDDEN in some states to have their own schools. In one case you argue that separate schools cannot be equal while in another you argue that you were DENIED the right to start your own schools.

I am talking in analogy here, referring to the analogy of how gay civil unions are legislative forbidden in some states. \n That is a fact, irrelevant of opinion.\n \n \n \nThis is exactly what you are doing now...insisting on an option that does not exist.\n\n And gay civil unions do exist in states where they are expressly forbidden from legislation?\n \n \n \nThere still doesn't have to be any separation. One set of laws can cover all unions. The government can recognize marriages and gay unions and have them all comply with a single set of laws to enjoy the benefits....\n\n Right now, in a lot of states the \"set of laws\" that governs gay civil unions expressly forbids them from existing.",

Look on wiki : \nAnal sex exposes the participants to hazards of two kinds: infections, due to the high number of infectious microorganisms not found elsewhere on the body, and physical damage to the anus and the rectum due to their vulnerability. Inexperienced people can also find it painful.[8]\n \n \n [edit] Infectious diseases\n Among the diseases with which anal sex is associated are HIV,[9] anal cancer,[10] typhoid fever[11] and various diseases associated with the infectious nature of fecal matter or sexual intercourse in general. Among these are: Amoebiasis; Chlamydia; Cryptosporidiosis; Giardiasis; Gonorrhea; Hepatitis A; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; Herpes simplex; Human papillomavirus; Lymphogranuloma venereum; Pubic lice; Salmonellosis; Shigella; Syphilis; Tuberculosis.[12][13]\n \n \n [edit] HIV/AIDS\n The high concentration of white blood cells around the rectum, together with the risk of cuts to the rectum and that one of the functions of the rectum is to absorb fluid, increases the risk of HIV transmission because the HIV retrovirus reproduces within the immune system's T-cells/CD4 cells. Use of condoms and other precautions are a medically recommended way to lessen risk of infections. Unprotected receptive anal sex is the most risky sexual behavior in terms of HIV transmission.[14][15][16]\n \n \n [edit] Physical damage\n Physical damage to the rectum and anus can manifest as generalized ano-rectal trauma, hemorrhoids, anal fissures,[17] anal fistula and rectal prolapse. Damage is more likely if anal sex is done without consent, if alcohol or other drugs have dulled sensitivity, if communication is poor, or if technique is clumsy.\n \n \n [edit] Incontinence\n Incontinence has also been reported; the result of the anal sphincter losing its tonus.[18] A 1993 study published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine found that out of a sample of forty individuals receiving anal intercourse, fourteen experienced episodes of frequent anal incontinence.[19] Though this study has been used by some to impute incontinence as a characteristic of male homosexuals, this is held to be a mistaken interpretation, as the conclusions of the study were contingent on the activity rather than on sexual orientation.[20]\n \n As Tristan Taormino pointed out in her book The Ultimate Guide to Anal Sex for Women, \"Having anal sex does not mean that you will end up in adult diapers.\" This can happen in cases of rape (which is a violent act) and it can happen if alcohol or other drugs are used to excess (causing lack of bodily awareness); it doesn't happen if the participants use proper technique, communicate clearly, and are both consenting adults.\n \n \n\n \n \n And for the bible, look at this: \nLeviticus 18:22:\n \n 22Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.\n \n \n",

There may be other factors that are as yet undetermined. A look at scientific history shows that every time we think we have it all figured out, something comes up that we overlooked before that changes everything.\n \n \nAnd for the bible, look at this:\n\n \n Than I'd advise you to follow your Bible and don't do it. Keep your nose out of my bedroom and my rectum, please.\n \n Thank you.",

In other words, adultery and unwarranted divorce are just as sinful as the whole \"gay\" thing.\n \n Yet IN THEIR OWN CHURCHES, we don't see such a struggle to \"abide by their religious beliefs\" on issues like divorce or adultery.\n \n Even in the \"gay marriage\" issue, the bible establishes a standard for Christians. Nowhere does it say that Christians need to enforce these beliefs upon others. It doesn't say that Christians need to prevent others from having gay sex.

It's economics 101 really. As to pursuing Energy Independance 70 years ago, blame your liberal environmentalists. After the Oil Embargo of the 70s, which I experienced personally, the Government assured us it would seek independance. But everytime the issue was debated, the environmental lobby fought new Oil Exploration on US Territory like it would cause the end of the World.

Under what circumstances would you see fit to actually go to War with a Country ?

Let's hear it for the compassion of the left. Perhaps a review of the facts would be instructive at this point: \n \n \"Now, I believe the facts that have brought us to this fateful vote are not in doubt. Saddam Hussein is a tyrant who has tortured and killed his own people, even his own family members, to maintain his iron grip on power. He used chemical weapons on Iraqi Kurds and on Iranians, killing over 20 thousand people. Unfortunately, during the 1980's, while he engaged in such horrific activity, he enjoyed the support of the American government, because he had oil and was seen as a counterweight to the Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran. \n \n In 1991, Saddam Hussein invaded and occupied Kuwait, losing the support of the United States. The first President Bush assembled a global coalition, including many Arab states, and threw Saddam out after forty-three days of bombing and a hundred hours of ground operations. The U.S.-led coalition then withdrew, leaving the Kurds and the Shiites, who had risen against Saddam Hussein at our urging, to Saddam's revenge. \n \n As a condition for ending the conflict, the United Nations imposed a number of requirements on Iraq, among them disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction, stocks used to make such weapons, and laboratories necessary to do the work. Saddam Hussein agreed, and an inspection system was set up to ensure compliance. And though he repeatedly lied, delayed, and obstructed the inspections work, the inspectors found and destroyed far more weapons of mass destruction capability than were destroyed in the Gulf War, including thousands of chemical weapons, large volumes of chemical and biological stocks, a number of missiles and warheads, a major lab equipped to produce anthrax and other bio-weapons, as well as substantial nuclear facilities. \n \n In 1998, Saddam Hussein pressured the United Nations to lift the sanctions by threatening to stop all cooperation with the inspectors. In an attempt to resolve the situation, the UN, unwisely in my view, agreed to put limits on inspections of designated \"sovereign sites\" including the so-called presidential palaces, which in reality were huge compounds well suited to hold weapons labs, stocks, and records which Saddam Hussein was required by UN resolution to turn over. When Saddam blocked the inspection process, the inspectors left. As a result, President Clinton, with the British and others, ordered an intensive four-day air assault, Operation Desert Fox, on known and suspected weapons of mass destruction sites and other military targets. \n \n In 1998, the United States also changed its underlying policy toward Iraq from containment to regime change and began to examine options to effect such a change, including support for Iraqi opposition leaders within the country and abroad. \n \n In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11, 2001. \n \n It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well affects American security.\"\n \n The above speech was made by the self-righteous neocon fascist Junior Senator from New York Hillary Clinton.\n \n Now this presents a problem for ye. If Bush is indeed stupid he was at least clever enough to convince a democratic presidential front runner of the danger. That susceptibility to persuasion would say something about that junior senator's faculties would it not? It also gives one pause to consider that the left blames Bush for the high price of gasoline on the one hand while dismissing the war as one about oil. The left also opposes any and all attempts to explore domestic energy by opposing nuclear power, development of ANWR and off-shore drilling. Thanks to democratic opposition not one new refinery faciity has been constructed during my lifetime. Not one. Now, Speaker Pelosi would slap the oil companies with an \"excessive profits tax\". Way to encourage domestic energy Frau Nancy!\n \n Oh, and do try to be a little bit more civil. Your propensity to call your opponents \"losers\" says far more about your insecurities than it does about your opponents. Let's try to keep things above the 100 IQ mark shall we?",

The only people who are fighting in Allah's name are the Islamofascist Terrorists whom you are defending here. You blind hypocrite. Why can't you see that you are defending the enemy and condemning the liberators ?

For all those reasons we had every right in the World to defend ourselves and to also, while we're at it give the 24 million Iraqi's a chance to self govern as free people. \n \n Why is freedom of choice and speech good enough for you but not good enough for the people of the middle east who want the same freedoms as we enjoy ? And those freedoms are inbred into the fiber and spirits of all humans. So why don't you think they deserve them also ? You claim to love and cherish freedom yet you selfishly hoard it as if only you are worthy to possess it while standing by with our overwhelming wealth and watching oppression and misery enslave our fellow humans around the World.

The first President Bush assembled a global coalition, including many Arab states, and threw Saddam out after forty-three days of bombing and a hundred hours of ground operations. The U.S.-led coalition then withdrew, leaving the Kurds and the Shiites, who had risen against Saddam Hussein at our urging, to Saddam's revenge. \n \n As a condition for ending the conflict, the United Nations imposed a number of requirements on Iraq, among them disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction, stocks used to make such weapons, and laboratories necessary to do the work. Saddam Hussein agreed, and an inspection system was set up to ensure compliance. And though he repeatedly lied, delayed, and obstructed the inspections work, the inspectors found and destroyed far more weapons of mass destruction capability than were destroyed in the Gulf War, including thousands of chemical weapons, large volumes of chemical and biological stocks, a number of missiles and warheads, a major lab equipped to produce anthrax and other bio-weapons, as well as substantial nuclear facilities. \n \n In 1998, Saddam Hussein pressured the United Nations to lift the sanctions by threatening to stop all cooperation with the inspectors. In an attempt to resolve the situation, the UN, unwisely in my view, agreed to put limits on inspections of designated \"sovereign sites\" including the so-called presidential palaces, which in reality were huge compounds well suited to hold weapons labs, stocks, and records which Saddam Hussein was required by UN resolution to turn over. When Saddam blocked the inspection process, the inspectors left. As a result, President Clinton, with the British and others, ordered an intensive four-day air assault, Operation Desert Fox, on known and suspected weapons of mass destruction sites and other military targets. \n \n In 1998, the United States also changed its underlying policy toward Iraq from containment to regime change and began to examine options to effect such a change, including support for Iraqi opposition leaders within the country and abroad. \n \n In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11, 2001. \n \n It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well affects American security.\"\n \n The above speech was made by the self-righteous neocon fascist Junior Senator from New York Hillary Clinton.\n \n \n My truth used to be universally accepted until the Socialist Left decided to once again rewrite history and use this War for Political gain as a campaign issue. Only you are accepting the rewritten propaganda as your truth. Even Hillary doesn't really believe as you do. She's just saying it to get your vote.\n \n \nSee he views the lives of the Iraqis, who don't want us there, more important then the lives of US troops.\n\n \n You just can't help it can you matt. If your not lying, your just not saying anything I guess. Stop attributing your slander and propaganda to me like some pathetic reprobate. I'm sick of it.\n \n \n\n I am begining to believe that those in the us miliatry that want to come home should be allowed to and those that want to stay well...., and I know that this sounds harsh but I do believe in live and let live, let the fools die in a lost cause, let them throw their lives away for no reason. It is their choice to throw their lives away.Just let those who are trapped come home.\n\n \n Every single person in the Iraqi theater freely joined to serve in the military. None were drafted against their will. So I guess they all chose to throw their lives away huh ? Or did they choose to defend their country, something selfish cowards like you just can't identify with or relate to. And when it comes to suicide bombers who seek to kill innocent people through acts of terror, better to kill them before they strap the bomb on and take an innocent group of bystanders with them. Or is it beyond your ability to see that rationale ?",

If they have to accept gay marriage as equal to heterosexual marriage they feel that something will be taken from them. Their marriages will be lessened and their marriages will no longer have any meaning. So they are content and happy do deny happiness and marriage to gay people while at the same time demanding that we be happy for them when they announce their marriages.\n \n I will give you an example. Think of the last hetero that announced to you that they were getting married. What did they expect your responce to be? They expect you to be happy for them and joyously congradulate them. Now what would their reaction be if you, knowing their stance on gay marriage, if you said you couldn't support their marriage because of their stance on gay marriage.

Archangel posted no attack on you. He did make some comments about saminh which were intended comment on Saminh's views and not on saminh personally.

   "Please provide an example of where Archangel has said that he hates gay people or that he thinks they are evil. \n \n Your statements here are not based on fact, but rather your apparent hatred of christians. Please review his posts. He has declared what he believes to be true about the lifestyle but no where does he claim judgement on the person. It is an objective stance. he is separating the behavior from the person. In fact, as I understand him, he is stating that the behavior is harmful to the person and therefore not good. Now, you may have a very different viewpoint on whether or not it is harmful to the person. If that is the case then provide an argument as to why it is not harmful instead of attacking someone else. Archangel posted no attack on you. He did make some comments about saminh which were intended comment on Saminh's views and not on saminh personally. Archangel's OPINION about the VIEWS is that they are \"twisted\" meaning that they are not supportive of what is observable in reality. You may have an OPINION that they are not \"twisted\" and are perfectly logical in view of reality. If so, post an argument supporting that.\n \n You have essentially posted a non argument based on your own emotional response rather than looking at what has been objectively posted.\n \n Huck.\n\n \n \n He may not have said those words directly, but you give him far more credit for benevolence than he deserves. He most certainly woefully misunderstands gay people and is a highly insulting poster. He has hurled ugly and false accusation about gays destroying the family, American society, etc. He claims that they are all miserable and feel guilty about their sexuality. He called them reprbate. He accused me of having no moral center and being like an animal for not sharing his faith. Many of these posts were offensive enough to warrant deletion.\n \n Personally I am tired of the \"its my religion\" mantra. Its a cop-out. Say and believe what you will, but know that the opposition against gays and gay families is hurtful and harmful - regardless of the excuse.",

   "Archangel, I see your legitimate concern for the living souls as eternal and therefore your intent is to save that which is eternal regardless of that which is temporal. I see that pretty clearly. However, I would sugget that you consider that HOW you say things is as important as WHAT you say. After all, Jesus died so that man would actually have a CHOICE. You desparately desire those (including me) who don't know him to know him. However, remember that words such as \"reprobate\" etc, contain a great deal of emotional value. I know the specific meanings and origins of such words so I take no offense at them, however, most are not as knowlegable as to delve into word origins regularly ( I am not so much smart as fortunate in my upbringing in this respect, many others here as well do know, but many do not). The woman at the well was a sinner of the tried and true variety. Only have Jesus showed her compassion and interacted with her when no one else would, did he choose to address her sin. He made sure she knew she was accepted first. That tack will take you much further.\n \n\n \n Excellent post huck, and I take it to heart. But even posts I have made with sensitivity have been met with insults and condescending attacks based on their seemingly superior intellect.

Please review his posts. He has declared what he believes to be true about the lifestyle but no where does he claim judgement on the person. It is an objective stance. he is separating the behavior from the person. In fact, as I understand him, he is stating that the behavior is harmful to the person and therefore not good. Now, you may have a very different viewpoint on whether or not it is harmful to the person. If that is the case then provide an argument as to why it is not harmful instead of attacking someone else. Archangel posted no attack on you. He did make some comments about saminh which were intended comment on Saminh's views and not on saminh personally. Archangel's OPINION about the VIEWS is that they are \"twisted\" meaning that they are not supportive of what is observable in reality. You may have an OPINION that they are not \"twisted\" and are perfectly logical in view of reality. If so, post an argument supporting that.\n \n You have essentially posted a non argument based on your own emotional response rather than looking at what has been objectively posted.\n \n Huck.\n\n \n he called my views twisted and he called my statements ignorant. how is that different from my emotional views?",

You started off here in the gay forums with your attacks.\n \n All you have to do is look up your posts in the forum and display them oldest to youngest, and, not including your first post (which was a veiled sort of insult toward John Edwards), your second post shows your colors right away.\n \n Here it is for anyone interested: http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=255601&postcount=13\n \n And here is the post in its entirety.\n \nThe real Gay Agenda is about normalizing abnormal behavior, and about forcing 95% of Society to accept those abnormal and unnatural practices of the other 5% that is proven to be unnatural because if it ever became the majority of the human race in practice, we would gay ourselves right out of existence as a species. approximately 5% of human beings commit violent or illegal crimes against their fellow man, should we then normalize their right to kill, maim, and rob others because for them it's normal ?\n \n Does basic human morality play no part in our deciding what is right and wrong anymore ? Are we now a total and complete REPROBATE Society where wrong is now seen as right and normal, and right is now seen as wrong and abnormal ? I guess it is for a growing majority, but it doesn't mean you are right. It simply means that we are that much closer to the point of our own self destruction.

I prepare my daughter's breakfast, then wake her up. I take a shower while she watches the Noggin channel or PBS Kids. We all brush our teeth, and I make sure she washes her face. We get dressed, gather our things, and head out the door. I drop her at pre-school and go to work. Between 5 and 5:30 I pick her up. We eat dinner and discuss our day.

I'm not sure if you are in the minority in the wider society; you are in the majority as a Christian, but you may be in the minority on specific issues. The last Gallup poll I read indicated that a majority of Americans now view \"homosexuality\" as \"an acceptable alternative lifestyle.\" I personally object to the phrasing of that question, as being gay is not a \"lifestyle.\" It's a characteristic of some people. But apparently a majority of Americans now accept people being gay. A minority of Americans support same-sex marriage, but the percentage has risen steadily over time. \n \n Anyhow, I won't attack you personally. If I do inadvertently, please alert me to that, and I will apologize and remove my post. I will disagree with you on some specific issues, and I may agree with you on others.

Because these people place such importance on religious belief and doctrine, I think it is unlikely you will do much to change their mind. The only way you can do it is to somehow convince then that homosexual relationships are compatible with their religious texts/beliefs.

   "My observation is that religious people who oppose gay rights (to varying degrees) can be categorized into 3 basic groups ...\n [*]Religion-justified hate groups (e.g. KKK, Phelps)[*]Groups that oppose some degree of gay rights and cultural acceptance because of genuine religious belief and not because of hate (and do not lash out or attack gays)[*]Groups that only marginally oppose gay rights and cultural acceptance of gays and would eliminate any opposition upon hearing your message ('just by talking with folks')\n I believe your post doesn't take into account the second category, and my opinion is that by-far most people who do not give full acceptance and claim religion as the reason fall under the second category. Because these people place such importance on religious belief and doctrine, I think it is unlikely you will do much to change their mind. The only way you can do it is to somehow convince then that homosexual relationships are compatible with their religious texts/beliefs. And then you're really doing little more than giving an unconventional interpretation.\n\n \n That's an interesting categorization. There may also be people who oppose gay equality because that's how they were raised, and when pressed to explain why or to justify their opposition, they then turn to scripture for the justification. The source of their opposition may in fact be simply or primarily what they were taught about gay people since childhood....a set of unexamined assumptions, not necessarily a deep commitment to a particular interpretation of scripture. This may be a fourth category. These folks may harbor deep anti-gay sentiment, but its roots may be more cultural than religious, with religion as the later justification. \n \n Of course there is a long history of people debating the true meaning of scripture and its implications for public policy. There were passionate debates in the antebellum period over whether the Bible condoned slavery or condemned slavery. Today this is not an issue, because we have settled the question of slavery in the United States. In the early 19th century, the abolitionist interpretation of the Bible was the one that probably seemed to most people \"an unconventional interpretation,\" and yet that interpretation won out over time. People can read the Bible many different ways, and conventional interpretations do change, of course. \n \n I think that people's interpretations of the Bible usually reflect their experiences in society and the beliefs they were taught coupled with their reading of scripture. We do not read scripture with neutral eyes. We read with the assumptions that we have been taught and in the context of the society in which we live. To the extent that Christians hear only that \"homosexuality\" is a sin and that gay people are condemned if they do not repent of their sin, these Christians are likely to believe that this is what scripture says. If and when alternate viewpoints are presented, these assumptions about gay people that many Christians bring to their reading of scripture are challenged. That will not necessarily lead people to change their thinking, but over time it may. And certainly NOT challenging people's assumptions about gay people simply leaves the assumptions intact.\n \n I think we have no choice but to challenge people's myths and stereotypes and assumptions about us gay people. I think this will prompt some anti-gay Christians, but not all, to rethink how they interpret scripture. This is why I think the Equality Rides are so powerful and why several conservative Christian colleges have barred the Equality Riders from their campuses and have had them arrested. The Equality Riders are young people, mostly Christians, who are bringing a message to young Christian conservatives that gay people are not as the myths and stereotypes suggest and that Christians should rethink how they interpret scripture when it comes to gay people. The Equality Riders thus challenge the assumptions that many people hold about gay people, assumptions that I think prompt many Christians to embrace an anti-gay interpretation of scripture.",

   "the radical gay groups work 24/7 trying to nullify the morals and values\n Could you be more specific as to which morals and values are being nullified? Thank you in advance.\n\n \n First, in order to be fair, let's post my whole passage as quoting just the part you did changes the meaning of what i actually said.\n \n \nBut the radical gay groups work 24/7 trying to nullify the morals and values that we believe have made America the greatest Country on Earth, not perfect mind you, but the greatest none the less.\n\n \n We not only export products and technology from the USA, but possibly our largest export is our Pop Culture. As a small but very vocal segment of our population is calling for the legalization of gay marriage and the acceptance and normalization of the radical gay culture; and don't say it isn't happening because they are the most vocal and activist among you. You fail to acknowledge or concern yourselves with a whole Word surrounding us that still deems homosexuality as either a criminal offense, a disease, or a sin worthy of death.\n \n Look at China, the largest single population on Earth. I dare you to go to Beijing and proudly declare you are gay on a street corner. Or India and Pakistan which also have populations in excess of a billion people. Go to Malaysia or North Korea and be outwardly flamboyant and see what happens to your freedom of choice. Now let's hop over to virtually any Middle Eastern or Islamic Country you want to deal with. The out of the closet gay would be beheaded at noon in the market square as an infidel. \n \n We have just covered more than two thirds of the Worlds population who must hide their gayness in order to simply remain free of persecution or death. And there are more I haven't touched on. Now I'm not sanctioning the injustices that exist elsewhere but I'm pointing out how fair this Country has been in spite of the universally accepted unnaturalness and criminality the Homosexual act is viewed with.\n \n Personally speaking I believe that \"Don't ask, Don't tell\" is a bad joke on our Society and gays should be able to proudly serve in our military without being expected to hide their true identities. I would inject myself in a situation if I walked upon a gay or any minority being abused in any way by a bigot or a racist, and I did when I lived in the South and it happened. \n \n But my question to you all is why aren't your pro equal rights organizations fighting the powers that be around the World who hold down your brothers and sisters who must live in fear of being found out for who they really are, My questions are, why don't you worry about the homosexuals in the rest of the World and the abuses they suffer ? Their murders and torture. Their imprisonment in retraining camps that drives the effeminate mannerisms out of them in the more merciful Countries that don't just kill them as defectives ? \n \n rather than attempt to force the 95% of your fellow Americans who have supported all the laws to protect your 5% from civil and human rights abuses, who support fair employment and equal opportunity, to also accept gay marriage as normal when it defies our original definition of marriage because two gays have no hope of being able to reproduce naturally. We believe it will lead to the destruction of the traditional family and will completely tear down the core values that once existed in America. And based on the loss of respect to America by the rest of the World who condemns our current culture and lifestyle, it seems to be hurting us in ways we refuse to consider as of late. \n \n You all will say you love America and yet all you can see is what you want with no consideration at all for the effect it is and will have on the Country and culture you claim to love so much. I'm sure you've heard that with freedom comes responsibility. I believe that if we continue to shirk our responsibility as the most ethical Nation on Earth with the most enlightened Bill of Rights and Constitution known to man, then we will surely lose the freedoms outlined in those documents that have made us the Greatest Superpower that has ever existed.\n \n So please don't think my fight is based on some shallow hate filled desire to oppress others who disagree with my world view, my concern is for the survival of my Country which I believe has been blessed by God because of what we have stood for in spite of the sins of our youth as a Nation. He blessed us because of the inherent good in those documents that led us to right the wrongs that most other Nations still suffer under. I could go on but I've said enough for now.",

He blessed us because of the inherent good in those documents that led us to right the wrongs that most other Nations still suffer under. I could go on but I've said enough for now.\n\n \n First, most of us DO care about what happens to gay people in other parts of the world. I will turn the question back to you. You support human rights; why aren't YOU fighting for fair and equal treatment for gay people all around the world? There is not exactly an easy way to fight for the rights of these folks, but I agree that we can and should all be fighting for them. However, to put the burden of doing this entirely on gay people is not exactly fair, is it? \n \n Second, 95% of the population of the United States has NOT supported gay people in our struggle for fair and equal treatment. Many of our victories have been court victories, opposed by a majority of voters in particular states. We are still widely reviled by many people here in the United States, and we are still subject to hate crimes that have left and continue to leave gay people dead. I myself was beaten up years ago when I walked out of a lesbian bar. It also was only a few years ago that gay people could be and were arrested for having intimate relationships with our partners.....here in the United States. That only changed with the Supreme Court ruling in Lawrence v. Texas in 2003. And many gay people still live in fear here in the United States. Gay people live in fear of being physically attacked, of losing our jobs, of losing our children. In most states, we can still be fired for being gay, and it does happen. \n \n I don't want to suggest that most Americans are mean-spirited or that they would beat gay people up. That's certainly not true, and we have gained the support of significant heterosexual allies in our struggle for equal rights. We would not be where we are without the support of good people who are heterosexual allies. However, winning that support has been a long, uphill struggle. I remember when that support was largely absent; it was not long ago. We have had to fight to change things, and for years, mostly we fought alone, with few heterosexual allies willing to support us. That we have allies now is the result of our long, mostly lonely struggle. \n \n For you to suggest that we are somehow remiss because we haven't overcome the repression of gay people everywhere in the world shows how little you understand the struggle we have gone through here, and the struggle we are still engaged in. You say that we are fighting for the right to marry with no consideration of the impact this will have. Of course we are considering the impact it will have. Our winning the right to marry will provide greater protections for our children and for our families. That's the impact it will have. Our having the right to marry will help our children. And our children matter just as much as the children of heterosexuals matter. I have a small daughter. I want her to have the same protections that heterosexual parents can provide for their children through legal marriage. \n \n Some people argue that we should be satisfied with civil unions, that everyone supports civil unions now, so why can't we be satisfied with that? It was just a few years ago that people went ballistic in Vermont over our winning the right to civil unions. Opponents of gay rights were outraged that we should get any state recognition at all for our relationships, and they threatened to vote the legislators who supported civil unions out of office. Now people say similar things about marriage. How dare we presume to argue that we should have the right to marry? The idea offends good heterosexual Christians! Well, too bad if heterosexual Christians are offended. My daughter matters more than whether someone else feels offended about my marriage. Our children and our families matter more than whether someone feels offended because they don't want us to be treated as equals. \n \n That's what this boils down to. The opponents of same-sex marriage refuse to allow gay people to be treated as equals. \n \n I am sick and tired of listening to the whining of anti-gay heterosexuals over how terrible it will somehow be for them or for the society if we get married. When asked what will be so terrible, they can't come up with anything. All they can say is that our marriages are against their religion. Well, fine. People don't have to like our marriages. They can ignore them. I do not care if my marriage is against someone else's religion. It's not against my religion, and I don't adhere to someone else's religion. We do not live in a theocracy. Someone's religion should not dictate civil law. Someone else's religion should not dictate whether I can get married to protect my child.",

   "Building on my previous post, one person who has argued that he has evidence of same-sex marriage undermining opposite-sex marriage in conservative pundit Stanley Kurtz. Kurtz has argued that same-sex marriage has led to the decline of opposite-sex marriage in Scandinavia. This is from Kurtz's 2994 article on this issue:\n \n http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/660zypwj.asp\n \n \"MARRIAGE IS SLOWLY DYING IN SCANDINAVIA. A majority of children in Sweden and Norway are born out of wedlock. Sixty percent of first-born children in Denmark have unmarried parents. Not coincidentally, these countries have had something close to full gay marriage for a decade or more. Same-sex marriage has locked in and reinforced an existing Scandinavian trend toward the separation of marriage and parenthood. The Nordic family pattern--including gay marriage--is spreading across Europe. And by looking closely at it we can answer the key empirical question underlying the gay marriage debate. Will same-sex marriage undermine the institution of marriage? It already has.\"\n \n Kurtz's arguments are easily refuted. First, same-sex marriage is not legal in the countries Kurtz singled out. Gay couples in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark instead can commit to registered partnerships, which are essentially civil unions, not legal marriage. Belgium and the Netherlands have legalized same-sex marriage. Second, Kurtz argues that the legalization of same-sex marriage has caused a decline in opposite-sex marriage, which is quite clearly not true. He appears intentionally to confound correlation with causation, and he knows better, given his credentials. But even a correlation argument falls apart, because the data do not support Kurtz's assertion that heterosexual marriage is in decline in Scandinavia. The following is from an article by M.V.Lee Badgett:\n \n http://www.slate.com/id/2100884/\n \n \"Despite what Kurtz might say, the apocalypse has not yet arrived. In fact, the numbers show that heterosexual marriage looks pretty healthy in Scandinavia, where same-sex couples have had rights the longest. In Denmark, for example, the marriage rate had been declining for a half-century but turned around in the early 1980s. After the 1989 passage of the registered-partner law, the marriage rate continued to climb; Danish heterosexual marriage rates are now the highest they've been since the early 1970's. And the most recent marriage rates in Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are all higher than the rates for the years before the partner laws were passed. Furthermore, in the 1990s, divorce rates in Scandinavia remained basically unchanged.\" \n \n Kurtz also claims that in Scandinavia, the numbers of unmarried heterosexual cohabiting couples have increased dramatically, as have births to unwed mothers, and for this he blames the legalization of same-sex marriage. But as Badgett points out, the increase in co-habitation between unmarried couples went up before the legalization of same-sex marriage, not afterward. And, according to Badgett, most co-habiting opposite-sex Scandinavian couples do marry after they have a child. He reports that 70% of co-habiting opposite-sex couples in Sweden marry after they have their first child. Badgett also reports that in the Netherlands, where same-sex marriage is legal, 90% of heterosexual couples with children are married. \n \n Kurtz's arguments are repeated ad nauseum in conservative publications to provide supposed \"evidence\" that same-sex marriage has led to the decline of heterosexual marriage. But examination of Kurtz's arguments quickly shows how absurd his claims are, and how he falsifies \"evidence.\" I think he falsifies evidence deliberately. Kurtz knows better than to put forward such falsehoods as he does.",

   "It is about marriage being seen as opposite sex i.e. marriage is opposite-sex not same-sex\n\n \n The argument that quite a few opponents of same-sex marriage make is that it will somehow destroy opposite-sex marriage, or erode opposite-sex marriage. See my post about Stanley Kurtz. \n \n As for how people \"see\" marriage, for the first 140 years or so of the American republic, women were not \"seen\" as voters, and for most of that time the idea of women voting was widely regarded as contrary to the natural order and, indeed, as shocking. For much of American history, people were deeply offended by the idea that women could be voters. Opponents argued that allowing women to vote would \"unsex\" them and turn the relationships between men and women upside down. Many predicted dire consequences for the society if women were granted the vote. Those dire consequences never materialized, of course, and today everyone accepts women as voters and even as serious Presidential candidates. \n \n What used to be shocking and apparently contrary to the natural order can become accepted and the norm, without undermining the society. Tell me how accepting gay couples as married couples will do anything to harm society? Tell me how accepting gay couples as married couples will produce any negative consequences for anyone?",

Well lo and behold - people of different races have married and the world did not fall apart. Marriage did not even fall apart. When will those who oppose gay marriage realize that allowing 2 people who love each other to marry is only going to strengthen marriage?\n \n Whether you want to admit it or not, marriage in the US is a civil concept, not a religious concept. You must get a license from the government and nothing is required of any church or religion. It is basically a legal contract, and actually began as a legal contract - prior to religion and sacraments and such, marriage was simply about property rights.\n \n With that in mind, how long will it be before some attorney or maybe the ACLU gets this issue to the Supreme Court as a simple discrimination issue?

   "Dominionism is a trend in Protestant Christian evangelicalism and fundamentalism, primarily, though not exclusively, in the United States, that seeks to establish specific political policies based on religious beliefs.\n \n It is most often used to describe politically active conservative Christians with a specific agenda. The term is rarely used as a self-description; many feel it is a loaded or pejorative term, and use of the term is primarily limited to critics of the Christian Right.\n \n The term emerged in relation to the Christian Right in the mid-1990s, but became more widely known due in large part to the U.S. presidential election, 2004 where the media attributed Republican wins to Evangelical voters in Red states who voted for moral values.[1] A number of authors, among them Andrew Sullivan, use the terms Christianism or Christianist in place of Dominionism in an attempt to \"take back the word Christian (from) the religious right.\"[2",

   "The First Prince of the Theocratic States of America\n \n \n \n It happened quietly, with barely a mention in the media. Only the Washington Post dutifully reported it.[1] And only Kevin Phillips saw its significance in his new book, American Dynasty.[2] On December 24, 2001, Pat Robertson resigned his position as President of the Christian Coalition.\n \n \n \n Behind the scenes religious conservatives were abuzz with excitement. They believed Robertson had stepped down to allow the ascendance of the President of the United States of America to take his rightful place as the head of the true American Holy Christian Church.\n \n \n \n Robertson's act was symbolic, but it carried a secret and solemn revelation to the faithful. It was the signal that the Bush administration was a government under God that was led by an anointed President who would be the first regent in a dynasty of regents awaiting the return of Jesus to earth. The President would now be the minister through whom God would execute His will in the nation. George W. Bush accepted his scepter and his sword with humility, grace and a sense of exultation.\n \n \n \n As Antonin Scalia, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court explained a few months later, the Bible teaches and Christians believe \"... that government ...derives its moral authority from God. Government is the 'minister of God' with powers to 'revenge,' to 'execute wrath,' including even wrath by the sword...\"[3]\n \n \n \n George W. Bush began to wield the sword of God's revenge with relish from the beginning of his administration, but most of us missed the sword play. I have taken the liberty to paraphrase an illustration from Leo Strauss, the father of the neo-conservative movement, which gives us a clue of how the hiding is done:\n \n \"One ought not to say to those whom one wants to kill, 'Give me your votes, because your votes will enable me to kill you and I want to kill you,' but merely, 'Give me your votes,' for once you have the power of the votes in your hand, you can satisfy your desire.\"[4]\n \n Notwithstanding the advice, the President's foreign policy revealed a flair for saber rattling. He warned the world that \"nations are either with us or they're against us!\" His speeches, often containing allusions to biblical passages, were spoken with the certainty of a man who holds the authority of God's wrath on earth, for he not only challenged the evil nations of the world, singling out Iraq, Syria, Iran, and North Korea as the \"axis of evil,\" but he wielded the sword of punishment and the sword of revenge against his own people: the American poor and the middle class who according to the religious right have earned God's wrath by their licentiousness and undisciplined lives.\n \n \n \n To the middle class he said, \"I'm going to give you clear skies clean air and clean water,\" then he gutted the environmental controls that were designed to provide clean air and water. The estimated number of premature deaths that will result: 100,000.[5] He said to the poor and to the middle class: \"I'm going to give you a prescription drug program, one that you truly deserve.\" Then he gave the drug industry an estimated $139 billion dollars in increased profits from the Medicare funds and arranged for the poorest of seniors to be eliminated from coverage, while most elderly will pay more for drugs than they paid before his drug benefit bill passed.[6] After that he arranged for the dismantling of the Medicare program entirely, based on the method outlined by his religious mentors.[7] He said to the people of America, \"I'm going to build a future for you and your children,\" then he gutted their future with tax breaks to the rich and a pre-emptive war against Iraq, and the largest spending deficit in history.[8]",

And it isn't from a religious site. Here's an excerpt that outlines the damage done by secularism.\n \n America's Schizophrenic Culture\n \n America has developed a schizophrenic culture. On the one hand, we have attained unprecedented heights of material success and prosperity On the other hand, we have been unable to maintain a solid moral character, family stability, safe communities, and a harmonious and happy society. This contradiction is manifest in individual lives. We instill in our youth a strong desire for material success and prosperity yet we fail to teach the values that are necessary to build good character, strong families, and a harmonious society.\n \n A Vicious Cycle\n \n The moral compass of our society, the conscience, has been corrupted and a vicious cycle is being generated. Children born and raised in dysfunctional families in which they do not receive the love of parents necessary to instill the sense of value, empathy for others, self-discipline, and good character necessary for a healthy society are less likely to form lasting intimate relationships which develop into committed marriages and stable families. As this cycle expands, society's problems multiply. If we are to renew American society, it is imperative that we break the cycle of family breakdown. In order to do this however, it is necessary to understand more about the cultural climate of 20th century America and to identify certain ideas which have suborned and weakened the power of the conscience in today's society.\n \n Ideas Have Consequences\n \n Ideas have consequences. People act the way that they do because they think in certain ways, because they hold certain beliefs. This is true for individuals and it is also true for a society or culture. In the modern world, certain institutions - the universities, schools, the media and the entertainment industry - have a major influence in shaping our understanding of ourselves and the world. The ideas and images which are communicated not only influence the actions of individuals; they have a profound influence on public policy which in turn further affects our life and our decisions.\n \n Secular \"Modern\" Ideas\n \n Truth is truth. Ideally truth discovered by science and reason should be in agreement with truth revealed by religion and work in harmony to help create a healthy society in a prosperous and productive environment. In practice, however, this has not often been the case. A later lecture will contain a more full discussion of the development and relationship between secular thought, tracing it's antecedents back to the Greek Hellenism, and sacred thought, which in our tradition have been based primarily upon the Bible.\n \n In this short presentation, there is not time to explore the tremendous social changes that have occurred in the past several hundred years and the complex interplay of secular and religious thought. For our purposes, I will simply say that building on the thought of the Enlightenment and inspired by the rapid development of science, many thinkers in the 19th century rejected the authenticity of divine revelation and called into question basic principles of Judeo-Christian culture. Based upon 19th century conceptions of science, a number of thinkers with a secular bias sought to develop a modern scientific conception of man and the universe. In the process of this development, several ideas were expounded which have contributed to modern man's separation from God, and confused our comprehension of basic moral truths. As these ideas have been propagated, people's consciences have been weakened, and this has helped to create a climate in which the breakdown of the family has been occurring. I would like to pinpoint a number of these ideas and trace their development through some of our major institutions.\n \n The following ideas in combination have been particularly harmful:\n \n God, religion, and questions of morality are matters of personal opinion which have little or no relevance to social problems.\n Man is a highly evolved animal.\n There are no absolute standards; values are relative.\n The nuclear family is a product of social evolution and is just one of a number of possible forms of social organization.\n Societies problems can be solved by technology and the social sciences with a particular emphasis on the role of the state in social engineering.\n Traditional Religious Beliefs\n \n This is in contrast to Judeo-Christian beliefs as well as other traditional cultures which have asserted that:\n \n There is a God\n Man is a spiritual being who depends upon a relationship with the divine to discover and fulfill his purpose in life\n There are universal and absolute moral principles\n The nuclear family is not only the central foundation for the transmission of social values but is a sacred institution protected by very clear standards of sexual morality.\n Erroneous Notions of Modernism\n \n In the following remarks, I look at several thinkers who have had a profound influence on the 20th century. Let me clarify that I am not attacking them personally, I am not pretending to give a systematic presentation of their philosophy, and I am not saying that they that they were evil or totally wrong in all of their views. What I would like to do is look at the impact that some of their ideas had - how those ideas have been popularly received by the culture - and how they contributed to and gave currency to the notions mentioned above.\n \n A. God, religion, and questions of morality are matters of personal opinion which have little or no relevance to social problems.\n \n Auguste Comte who lived in France from 1798 to 1857 was the father of Positivism and the founder of the Sociology. Positivism maintains that the only way that verifiable truth can be ascertained is through the empirical methods of science. Because statements of a religious, moral or metaphysical nature can not be verified, they are not objective truths. Though they may have emotional value, they are opinion rather than scientific truth. Comte proposed that scientific methods should be used to study society and human behavior and for this purpose he founded sociology. The founding of sociology was followed by the establishment of several other disciplines of social science such as anthropology, psychology, political science, and the development of social statistics. The principles of positivism also influenced the study of history, law, and philosophy. In fact, the social sciences played a major role in the development of the 20th century university. As the university became the central institution for training the leadership of modern America, the social sciences with their positivistic bias became the wellspring of the progressive movement and the modern liberal state. The army of bureaucrats who man numerous administrative agencies of the modern state are evidence of the legacy of positivism. For you legislators, the next time a representative of a government agency testifies before your committee with a barrage of social statistics, say a little thank you to Auguste.\n \n B. Man as Animal: Evolution as a Result of Random Mutations\n \n The publication of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species in 1859 was a second milestone in the development of the modernist viewpoint. Darwin's theory that evolution takes place through a process of natural selection based upon random genetic mutations not only suggested that man is merely a physical animal. His emphasis on the random nature of genetic mutation implies that there is no inherent order to the universe and no creative design. If evolution is determined by chance, then some other form of life could just as easily have developed to a position of ascendancy. Science can explain the ascent of man better than religion. There is no need for belief in God to explain man's existence. Indeed, God, morality, and religion each can be viewed as mere creations of the human mind. As man's brain evolved to the point that he developed intelligence and the capability of abstract thought, man created religion in his attempt to explain natural phenomena. God didn't create man; man created God.\n \n C. Relative Values\n \n In Thus Spoke Zarathustra, written by Friedrich Nietzsche between 1883 and 1885, Zarathustra proclaims\n \n Before God! But now this god has died. You higher men, this god was your greatest danger. It is only since he lies in his tomb that you have been resurrected. Only now the great noon comes; only now the higher man becomes lord.\n Have you understood this word. O my brothers? You are startled? Do your hearts become giddy? Does the abyss yawn before you? Does the hellhound howl at you? Well then you higher men! Only now is the mountain of man's future in labor. God died: now we want the overman to live. (translation by Walter Kaufman)\n Nietzsche was announcing the demise of traditional values and moral restraints of Christian society and the potential for powerful creative individuals to create their own values freed from the restraints of \"the morality of the herd.\" As Alan Bloom states in his book Closing the American Mind:\n \n Values are not discovered by reason, and it is useless to seek them, to find the truth or the good life. The quest begun by Odysseus and continued for over three thousand millennia has come to an end with the observation that there is nothing to seek. This alleged fact was announced by Nietzsche just over a century ago when he said, \"God is dead.\" Good and evil now appear for the first time as values, of which there have been a thousand and one, none rationally or objectively preferable to one another. (p. 143)\n Once man is deprived man of a standard of value based on faith in divine revelation, reason itself is incapable of defining any absolute standard of value. Bloom describes in his book how the concept of relative values became extremely influential in American universities after World War II.\n \n D. The Nature and Role of Human Sexuality\n \n In his clinical work with women suffering from hysteria, Sigmund Freud discovered that sexual frustration seemed to be the common cause of their neuroses. In time, Freud developed a theory of personality emphasizing the determining power of unconscious sexual drives. The central principle of the personality is the pleasure principle. The unconscious id or libido is the dominant factor in the human psyche and its strongest impulse is the desire for sexual gratification. The ego, or consciousness is the rational faculty which seeks to adapt the needs of the id to its environment. The superego, which we would generally identify as the conscience, is the composite of parental taboos and rewards which are imbedded in our in our formative years. In the case of Western civilization, the monogamous family as a social institution is a culturally derived attempt of a patriarchal society to control sexuality. Strict monogamy can cause sexual repression and thus give rise to individual and social neuroses. Religion itself is a creation of the unconscious mind, an \"illusion\", similar to a neuroses, which is generated by the unconscious to reinforce the predominant social mores. In other words, a patriarchal society creates a Father God to replace the father figure of childhood and maintain the control of the superego.\n \n Here is a representative quote form one of Freud's later and most widely read works:\n \n The tendency on the part of civilization to restrict sexual life is no less clear than its tendency to expand the cultural unit. Its first, totemic, phase already brings with it the prohibition against an incestuous choice of object, and this is perhaps the most drastic mutilation which man's erotic life has in all time experienced. Taboos, laws, customs impose further restrictions, which affect both men and women. Not all civilizations go equally far in this; and the economic structure of the society also influences the amount of sexual freedom that remains.... A high-water mark has been reached in our Western Civilization.... As regards the sexually mature individual, the choice of an object is restricted to the opposite sex, and most extra-genital satisfactions are forbidden as perversions. The requirement, demonstrated in these prohibitions, that there be a single kind of sex life for everyone, disregards the dissimilarities, whether innate or acquired, in the sexual constitution of human beings. It cuts off a fair number of them from sexual enjoyment, and so becomes a source of serious injustice. (Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents, 1930)\n As Freud's ideas gained popularity they gave rise to the notion that sexual repression is unhealthy and that morality is artificial. Such notions are at the root of the sexual revolution of the 1960's, the sexual liberation movements as well as many of the ideas which determine the bias of sex education and school policy to this day. In a more general sense the pervasive influence of the popular concepts of Freud created a general climate in which it is easy for anyone to rationalize the immorality and infidelity which lead to teen pregnancy, and family breakdown.\n \n The Institutionalization of Secular Relativistic Ideas\n \n Now I would like to take a brief look at how these \"modern\" ideas have influenced the major institutions of 20th century America and have helped to create a moral and cultural climate which has contributed to the breakdown of the family in the last three decades of this century.\n \n A. The University\n \n The university has come to play a central role in 20th century America. Our teachers, our journalists, our policy makers, our lawyers, our writers, and our bureaucrats are all university educated. As emphasized earlier, the 20th century university has emphasized a scientific, empirical approach not only in the hard sciences but in the social sciences as well. University education has embraced the secular ideas of modernism. Whereas, in the 18th and 19th century our most important universities were founded initially as seminaries and theology was seen as the queen of the sciences, gradually the situation changed and the sciences and the social sciences became dominant with government funding for social and scientific research. University students learned to view the universe through a modernist viewpoint emphasizing relative values and man's secular nature. Needless to say such ideas influenced their personal morality. Moreover, graduates have carried these ideas with them into their work in education, media, and public policy.\n \n B. The Public Education System\n \n John Dewey had a long career extending from the last decade of the 19th century through the first half of the 20th. According to John Westbrook, author of John Dewey and American Democracy:\n \n The consensus of opinion, including that of those critical of Dewey's social philosophy, is that he was a major influence on the ideology of modern liberalism and that Deweyan pragmatism is the most articulate expression of the philosophical foundation of this ideology, an ideology that has dominated political and social intercourse in twentieth-century America.\n Dewey was especially influential in the field of education. As chairman of the department of philosophy, psychology and education at the University of Chicago from 1894 to 1904, he helped to found the famous Dewey School, a laboratory school designed to test and develop his psychological and educational theories. In 1904 he went to Columbia University where remained until his retirement in 1930. The Columbia Teachers College trained teachers for the United States and schools around the world and Dewey's philosophy had a major impact on education. Expressing his pedagogic creed in 1897, Dewey declared: \"I believe... the teacher is engaged, not simply in the training of individuals, but in the formation of the proper social life... that he is a social servant set apart for the maintenance of proper social order and the securing of the right social growth.\"\n \n Says Westbrook:\n \n Dewey's conviction ... reflected his belief that \"education is the fundamental method of social progress and reform.\" There is a certain logic to this belief. Insofar as schools played an important part in the shaping of the character of a society's children, they could if they were designed to do so, fundamentally transform the society. The school provided a relatively controlled environment in which the conditions of self-development could effectively shape its course. Indeed, if teachers did their job well, there would hardly be need of any other sort of reform. (John Dewey and American Democracy, p. 109)\n Inspired and guided by this mission, American public education in the 20th century became the vehicle for implementing and testing the latest social theories out of the secular academic world.\n \n http://www.tparents.org/Library/Unification/Talks/Colvin/secular.htm",

   "Here's the Christian perspective:\n \n This item is available on the Apologetics Press website at: http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/3105\n \n AP Content :: In the News\n \n Destruction of Marriage Equals Destruction of America\n by Dave Miller, Ph.D.\n \n Since the God of the Bible exists (a fact that can be proven-see Flew and Warren, 1977), then the foundational building block of human civilization is the family as God designed it. He created one man for one woman for life (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:3-12; 1 Corinthians 7:1ff.). All deviations from that fundamental norm (e.g., polygamy, bigamy, and homosexuality) contribute to the breakdown of the ethical fabric of society. On the Day of Judgment, homosexuality and same-sex marriage surely will be pinpointed as one of the foremost culprits responsible for the dissolution of moral cohesion at this moment in American history. The militancy, arrogance, and unmitigated defiance that homosexual activists continue to manifest is astounding-and only underscores the absolute essentiality of those who embrace traditional American (i.e., Christian) values to rise up and oppose their efforts.\n \n Instances of the insane and suicidal determination to destroy society's moral underpinnings are occurring with increasing frequency. One recent example involves a lesbian couple from Rhode Island. Though the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004, a law remains on the books there that prevents issuance of a license to out-of-state couples if their home state would refuse to recognize their marriage. The Rhode Island couple filed suit in Massachusetts in an effort to gain recognition of their \"marriage\" in Massachusetts which, in turn, they hope will enable them to gain recognition in their home state. The superior court has now ruled in favor of the couple (Cote-Whitacre v..., 2006).\n \n Similar pressure to conform to the politically correct agenda is seen in the widespread capitulation of America's corporate community to threats, coercion, and intimidation by gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender activists. Though corporations have been targeted for many years, homosexual forces are stepping up their efforts to force corporations to include \"sexual orientation\" in their non-discrimination policies. To be \"gay friendly\" is defined as supporting transgender workers, offering \"inclusive\" health insurance and other benefits, requiring diversity training for employees, and spending advertising money with GLBT organizations (Unruh, 2006). In other words, force everyone to endorse (not merely tolerate) the homosexual lifestyle. Bully employees into silence by stifling all free speech that questions the morality of homosexuality.\n \n The success of the gay rights community along this line is alarming and heart-breaking. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the largest national homosexual political organization, reports an unprecedented 138 major U.S. corporations as having earned a top rating of 100% in their accommodation of alternative sexual lifestyles (\"America's Pro-Homosexual Giants...,\" 2006). Some corporations quietly acquiesce. Others seem to jump on board the homosexual bandwagon with vigorous militancy. For example, Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the world, has asserted its enthusiastic support of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender movement by initiating permission to join the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, as well as sponsoring the LGBT Diversity Week at a state university (\"Wal-Mart Asks for...,\" 2006; \"Boise State...,\" 2006). Likewise, Ford Motor Company is pursuing the same flagrant conduct (\"Boycott...,\" 2006). So are Walgreens (Sharp, 2005), Starbucks (Kleppinger, 2005), and many others. With the intense pressure to submit to political correctness, it is surprising that some major corporations are thus far resisting the intimidation by remaining unwilling to sign onto the homosexual agenda, including Reebok, Northwest Airlines, The Men's Wearhouse, J.C. Penney, Nissan, Gallup, Kroger, Cooper Tire, Circuit City, Radio Shack, and Toys \"R\" Us (Unruh, 2006).\n \n What is the ultimate outcome of this surrealistic inundation of America by outright paganism and moral depravity? What inevitably must happen to any country or society that enshrines morally deviant behavior by undermining the biblical definition of marriage? The social stability of that nation is placed in dire jeopardy. Its demise is inevitable (see Miller, 2005). Indeed, in 1848, the Supreme Court of South Carolina articulated the sentiment of the Founders and early Americans regarding what would happen to America if a sizeable portion of its citizenry ever abandoned Christian morality:\n \n What constitutes the standard of good morals? Is it not Christianity? There certainly is none other. Say that cannot be appealed to and...what would be good morals? The day of moral virtue in which we live would, in an instant, if that standard were abolished, lapse into the dark and murky night of pagan immorality (City Council of Charleston..., emp. added).\n \n The nation is headed swiftly in that direction. The destruction of marriage will inevitably result in the destruction of the nation.\n \n REFERENCES\n \"America's Pro-Homosexual Giants: 2006\" (2006), WorldNetDaily, September 20, [On-line], URL: http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=52052.\n \n \"Boise State University Recognizes LGBT Diversity Week with Series of Events\" (2006), Boise State Office of Communications and Marketing News Release, September 25, [On-line], URL: http://news.boisestate.edu/newsrelease/092006/0925gaydiversity.shtml.\n \n \"BoycottFord.com\" (2006), American Family Association, [On-line], URL: http://www.boycottford.com/.\n \n City Council of Charleston v.

So why should we stand in the way of people who have no religious obligation to our conservative Christian beliefs who want to marry someone of the same gender because they are simply incapable of having heterosexual feelings? What reason do we have that is so important as to justify barring two people from making this private commitment to each other?\n \n We're squeamish? Well, for sake of civil liberties we'll just have to get over it. We think it's wrong? Well, we think the Buddhist religion is wrong too, but we don't prevent Buddhists from meeting peacefully in this country. We don't want to expand the definition of marriage to accommodate something that isn't true marriage? But we recognize Buddhism as a religion that deserves to be protected under America's freedom of religion clause, even though from a biblical standpoint we believe Buddhism to be a false religion.\n \n We're afraid that supporting civil same-sex marriage will send a message to the gay community that Christians approve of homosexuality? Well, believe me, the gay community is under no such delusion. For years they have listened to our arguments against homosexuality ad nauseam and can even quote all the pertinent Bible verses back to us by heart. But if that doesn't convince you, perhaps it would be more helpful to look at it this way. Which is the worse sin, supporting civil same-sex marriage and giving gays and lesbians the impression that Christians approve of their homosexuality; or opposing it and continuing this political campaign of smearing the gay community with half-truths so as to prevent people from entering legally into committed and sexually responsible relationships in violation of their civil rights?\n \n If we're so concerned about the message we might be sending, why not look at it as sending a message that we approve of committed relationships and sexual responsibility? Aren't these the values that we have been trumpeting at our fellow Americans for years? Aren't we the ones who are always condemning the promiscuous \"lifestyle\" of gay men? Why not look at gay marriage as a step in the right moral direction? \n A Letter to Louise (from a heterosexual Baptist minister and grandfather)\n http://www.godmademegay.com/\n \n Excerpt: \nYour heavy-hearted words to Anna Marie and me the last time we saw you will always burn in our hearts: \"My brother hates God because God made him gay, and he knows he is going to hell, and I do, too, for that is what the Bible says.\" I struggled for a response, realizing suddenly that what I knew about gays and what the Bible says about them was very superficial. Anna Marie's immediate response to you was, \"No one will go to hell who puts his faith in Jesus Christ.\" How gloriously true! Whatever else the Bible says or doesn`t say, homosexuals are not necessarily going to hell.\n \n I decided to give serious study to homosexuality and what the Bible says about it. Thank God! There was so much to learn about gays and lesbians--and the Bible--that I am so glad to have come to know. It distresses me, though, to realize that most others of our church people do not know these facts about homosexuality and what the Bible really says, and that their thinking, like my previous concept, is based on suppositions, not facts, and on feelings, which, of course, have no place in a thoughtful consideration of facts.\n",

   "The 3 sects of evangelical dominionism\n \n There are three predominant sects (or movements) that propagate dominion theology which hold considerable influence over evangelicaldom.\n \n 1. SPIRITUAL WARFARE PRAYER movement: The Kingdom of God must be advanced on Earth through hyper-spiritual \"warfare\" activities against the devil. A veritable supermarket of verbal and physical prayer techniques such as chanting, walks, and marches are employed in this effort. Believers are told their prayer power creates spiritual \"canopies\" over regions, preparing the way for \"revival.\" In this sense, prayer warfare is seen as preparatory work so that the other two movements can build the kingdom. Recently the contemplative prayer movement - which includes meditation, fasting, and labyrinths - has been brought into the spiritual warfare prayer \"arsenal.\" Prayer serves as a convenient decoy for covert operations. All three sects are utilizing massive statistical databanking resources (e.g., the World Prayer Center in Colorado Springs) and sophisticated psycho-social group manipulations to forge kingdom \"transformation.\" One key leader of this sect is Cindy Jacobs, who is closely associated with C. Peter Wagner (see below). Her website http://www.generals.org epitomizes the militant doctrines and practices of the spiritual warfare sect.\n \n \n Prayer before fighting\n \n Our calling is to be worshippers, warriors, and workers. We must first offer our lives as a living sacrifice in worship to God. From our worship will flow our intercession and warfare as we fight with weapons of righteousness in our right hand and in our left. Only after we have worshipped our God and fought the fight in the Spirit will we proceed to work in the harvest fields, advancing the Kingdom of God.8 [emphasis added]\n \n \n \n \n \n Promoting these prayer warfare activities are hyper-charismatics from the \"signs and wonders\" movement, which include self-anointed, self-appointed \"apostles\" and \"prophets\" who are preparing to govern the world through their \"New Apostolic Reformation.\" This dominionist sect is a direct offshoot of the Latter Rain cult (also known as Joel's Army or Manifest Sons of God).9 Chief architect of this movement for the past two decades is C. Peter Wagner, President of Global Harvest Ministries and Chancellor of the Wagner Leadership Institute. His spiritual warfare teachings have been widely disseminated through mission networks such as AD 2000, which was closely associated with the Lausanne Movement. A prominent individual connected to this sect is Ted Haggard, current head of the National Association of Evangelicals.10\n \n \n \n The New Apostolic Reformation\n \n Since 2001, the body of Christ has been in the Second Apostolic Age. The apostolic/prophetic government of the church is now in place. . . . [W]e began to build our base by locating and identifying with the intercessory prayer movements. This time, however, we feel that God wants us to start governmentally, connecting with the apostles of the region. God has already raised up for us a key apostle in one of the strategic nations of the Middle East, and other apostles are already coming on board. Once we have the apostles in place, we will then bring the intercessors and the prophets into the inner circle, and we will end up with the spiritual core we need to move ahead for retaking the dominion that is rightfully ours.11 [emphasis added]\n \n C. Peter Wagner\n \n \n \n 2. MISSION AS TRANSFORMATION movement: The words \"revival,\" \"reformation\" and \"transformation\" now carry embedded dominionist connotations. \"Fulfilling the Great Commission\" (Matthew 28:18-20) no longer means spreading the Gospel message by speaking the Word of salvation from the Bible. The dominionist focus is placed upon the phrase making disciples, with an incorrect exegesis that is disconcertingly compulsory. Traditional mission evangelism, done one-on-one using the Bible, is being replaced with a slew of \"kingdom building\" corporate activities for cities, regions and nations. The disingenuous phrase \"bless the nations\" is often used to conceal dominionism. Dr. Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ International and Ralph Winter, founder of the U.S. Center for World Mission and editor of the Perspectives on the World Christian Movement curriculum (which has taught dominionism to an entire generation of missionaries), have been among the chief architects of this movement.12\n \n \n Dominionism supplants biblical evangelism\n \n \"The Church must grow past the 'Gospel of Salvation' message and understand that it is only when we begin to implement the principles of the 'Gospel of the kingdom' that we will really begin to see change in lives and cities and nations. The Church has no understanding of this realm. . . The Church must grow up. . . . 13 [emphasis added]\n \n Dale Neill, president of ICCC\n \n \n \n Beyond Salvation\n \n \". . . God's concern goes beyond the salvation of individual people. His redemptive plan encompasses the healing and transformation of entire nations . . . . Nations are discipled as the church makes the invisible Kingdom visible by faithful obedience to God's Word throughout culture--in every area of life, and every realm of society including the family, the community, the arts, sciences, media, law, government, schools, or business. . . .\"14 [emphasis added]\n \n Disciple the Nations\n \n \n \n 3. PATRIOTIC AMERICAN movement: Patriotic dominionists, most of whom are not Reconstructionists, teach that political action will advance the kingdom of God in America. Using the vehicle of Christian media, they have taught evangelicals for the past three decades that America is a Christian nation and needs to return to its roots. Almost every evangelical in the pew has been influenced in one way or another by this sect. Patriotic dominionist leaders and their organizations have been closely interlocked financially and politically with the conservatives from the political Right.

   "\n You fail to acknowledge or concern yourselves with a whole Word surrounding us that still deems homosexuality as either a criminal offense, a disease, or a sin worthy of death.\n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n So what does that mean exactly? There are many places where Christianity is deemed a false religion. Where it is also against the law. What is your point?\n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n Look at China, the largest single population on Earth. I dare you to go to Beijing and proudly declare you are gay on a street corner. Or India and Pakistan which also have populations in excess of a billion people. Go to Malaysia or North Korea and be outwardly flamboyant and see what happens to your freedom of choice. Now let's hop over to virtually any Middle Eastern or Islamic Country you want to deal with. The out of the closet gay would be beheaded at noon in the market square as an infidel. \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano: \n Go to some of those same places and be a Christian. I repeat what is your point?\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n We have just covered more than two thirds of the Worlds population who must hide their gayness in order to simply remain free of persecution or death. And there are more I haven't touched on. Now I'm not sanctioning the injustices that exist elsewhere but I'm pointing out how fair this Country has been in spite of the universally accepted unnaturalness and criminality the Homosexual act is viewed with.\n \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n More tolerant yes, but fair no. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n Personally speaking I believe that \"Don't ask, Don't tell\" is a bad joke on our Society and gays should be able to proudly serve in our military without being expected to hide their true identities. I would inject myself in a situation if I walked upon a gay or any minority being abused in any way by a bigot or a racist, and I did when I lived in the South and it happened. \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n Is it fair that you can give your life for your country, when your country does not allow you to marry? No, but gays are still willing to give their lives in spite of that fact. I would say that is in direct conflict with those who you refer to as reprobate and depraved.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n But my question to you all is why aren't your pro equal rights organizations fighting the powers that be around the World who hold down your brothers and sisters who must live in fear of being found out for who they really are, My questions are, why don't you worry about the homosexuals in the rest of the World and the abuses they suffer ? Their murders and torture. Their imprisonment in retraining camps that drives the effeminate mannerisms out of them in the more merciful Countries that don't just kill them as defectives ? \n \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n The same reason that you are not going around the world feeding hungry children. Because the picture is too vast. There are hungry people right here you can help if you so desire. As there also exists problems for gay people in this country. \n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n rather than attempt to force the 95% of your fellow Americans who have supported all the laws to protect your 5% from civil and human rights abuses, who support fair employment and equal opportunity, to also accept gay marriage as normal when it defies our original definition of marriage because two gays have no hope of being able to reproduce naturally.\n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n In other words, people like you have been so generous in allowing people like us to have certain freedoms, we should be thankful and stop the fight for total equality. That is not how this country works. And what does natural reproduction have to do with marriage?\n \n \n \n Archangel:\n We believe it will lead to the destruction of the traditional family and will completely tear down the core values that once existed in America.\n \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n You also believe in a god that I find just as hard to swallow as your statement above. Please show how this will happen.\n \n \n \n Archangel:\n And based on the loss of respect to America by the rest of the World who condemns our current culture and lifestyle, it seems to be hurting us in ways we refuse to consider as of late. \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n Our lifestyle is not what has caused parts of the world to loose respect for us. It has been the use of militaty force in places where we were not wanted.\n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n You all will say you love America and yet all you can see is what you want with no consideration at all for the effect it is and will have on the Country and culture you claim to love so much.\n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n I am still waiting for you to illustrate how gay marriage is going to lead to this nations demise.\n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n I'm sure you've heard that with freedom comes responsibility.\n \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n To me that would mean that it was my responsibility to make sure that my fellow Americans enjoyed the same rights and freedoms as I do. It obviously means something different to you, otherwise you would not be against gay marriage.\n \n \n \n Archangel:\n I believe that if we continue to shirk our responsibility as the most ethical Nation on Earth with the most enlightened Bill of Rights and Constitution known to man, then we will surely lose the freedoms outlined in those documents that have made us the Greatest Superpower that has ever existed.\n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n How is legalizing gay marriage shirking responsibility as the most ethical nation on earth? The many freedoms outlined in the Bill of Rights and the Constitution include the protection of the minority from the tyranny of the majority, in addition to separating church from state. I believe a strong military with allied support has been the key to the superpower status of this country.\n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n So please don't think my fight is based on some shallow hate filled desire to oppress others who disagree with my world view, my concern is for the survival of my Country which I believe has been blessed by God because of what we have stood for in spite of the sins of our youth as a Nation. He blessed us because of the inherent good in those documents that led us to right the wrongs that most other Nations still suffer under. I could go on but I've said enough for now.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n You feel that your fight against gay marriage is for the survival of the country, I see. And gay marriage is the sacrificial lamb that YOU have decided to offer the god which YOU feel has blessed us. Does this blessing include your right to discriminate against your fellow law abiding, tax paying citizens? I am convinced that the survival of this country would be complete and total adherance to those great documents you speak of. That would include gay people enjoying the same rights as straight people.",

   "Here's the Christian perspective:\n \n \n\n \n You present A Christian perspective, not THE Christian perspective. Many Christians do not agree with you about many issues you raise, and specially about equal and fair treatment for gay people. Many Christians believe that supporting equality is not moral depravity; it is the right and Christian thing to do. \n \n When I read your posts, I see how differently I view the world around me from the way you view the world. I do not see the world in decline, particularly. I do not see families collapsing. I see a world filled with social problems, but it has long been filled with social problems. There was no golden age from which we are falling. \n \n Some people have always made declension arguments, claiming that morals have collapsed and our society is therefore falling apart. I was just reading a pamphlet from the early 19th century by a Christian reformer named Thomas Branagan who warned that morals had collapsed and society was falling apart. He blamed the failure to provide moral instruction to children for what he insisted was a broader social decline. Conservative Christian leaders in the antebellum period decried women giving anti-slavery speeches to mixed-sex audiences. They claimed that with their \"promiscuous speeking,\" such women were destroying the family and undermining morality. But here we are nearly 180 years later, and we still have families, and society is still intact.\n \n I see the broad social changes that have taken place over the past century as mostly good. Women have more opportunities now than we did 100 years ago. African Americans and other minorities are no longer subject to repressive segregation laws or denial of their right to vote. Economic prosperity and access to higher education are available to a greater percentage of the population than they were 100 years ago. \n \n As for families, I do not see a decline. I see changes, specifically in the number of divorced parents and in the numbers of women with children working outside the home. Divorce is not a good thing, but religion does not appear to prevent it, as the rate of divorce is reportedly higher among conservative evangelical Christians than among atheists and more mainstream Christians. Blaming divorce on the \"secularization\" of the society makes little sense, because being Christian does not appear to innoculate couples from getting divorced. Whether women with children working is a good or a bad thing depends, I think, on the circumstances of the families we are considering. Perhaps it would be better for one parent to stay home with children when they are very small, but many parents simply cannot afford to do that. The problem for them is not \"morals\" or the \"secularization\" of the society; it's economic. Wages in many jobs are simply too low to support a family, and so both parents are forced to work to make ends meet. \n \n You make a leap, from your assumption that society's morals are in decline, which I think they are not, to blaming \"secularization\" of society for this supposed decline, and then to linking the movement for equality for gay people to the supposed moral decline and to secularization. I see no credible evidence that \"secularization\" has produced moral decline, and indeed, I do not see evidence for moral decline. I think we are no more in moral decline today than we were in the early 19th century or at any other time in our history. \n \n I see the movement for gay equality as an expression of what is good and moral about our society. It is a moral act to work for the full inclusion of all in the society and to treat everyone as equals. It is the moral position to support legal marriage for all of our families, for the protection of all children, not just the children of heterosexuals. To legalize same-sex marriage is a move to strengthen families, not to weaken them. The moral position is the position in favor of same-sex marriage. By legalizing same-sex marriage, we do not decline. Rather, we continue to improve, by extending justice and fairness to all.",

   "The 3 sects of evangelical dominionism\n \n There are three predominant sects (or movements) that propagate dominion theology which hold considerable influence over evangelicaldom.\n \n 1. SPIRITUAL WARFARE PRAYER movement: The Kingdom of God must be advanced on Earth through hyper-spiritual \"warfare\" activities against the devil. A veritable supermarket of verbal and physical prayer techniques such as chanting, walks, and marches are employed in this effort. Believers are told their prayer power creates spiritual \"canopies\" over regions, preparing the way for \"revival.\" In this sense, prayer warfare is seen as preparatory work so that the other two movements can build the kingdom. Recently the contemplative prayer movement - which includes meditation, fasting, and labyrinths - has been brought into the spiritual warfare prayer \"arsenal.\" Prayer serves as a convenient decoy for covert operations. All three sects are utilizing massive statistical databanking resources (e.g., the World Prayer Center in Colorado Springs) and sophisticated psycho-social group manipulations to forge kingdom \"transformation.\" One key leader of this sect is Cindy Jacobs, who is closely associated with C. Peter Wagner (see below). Her website http://www.generals.org epitomizes the militant doctrines and practices of the spiritual warfare sect.\n \n \n Prayer before fighting\n \n Our calling is to be worshippers, warriors, and workers. We must first offer our lives as a living sacrifice in worship to God. From our worship will flow our intercession and warfare as we fight with weapons of righteousness in our right hand and in our left. Only after we have worshipped our God and fought the fight in the Spirit will we proceed to work in the harvest fields, advancing the Kingdom of God.8 [emphasis added]\n \n \n \n \n \n Promoting these prayer warfare activities are hyper-charismatics from the \"signs and wonders\" movement, which include self-anointed, self-appointed \"apostles\" and \"prophets\" who are preparing to govern the world through their \"New Apostolic Reformation.\" This dominionist sect is a direct offshoot of the Latter Rain cult (also known as Joel's Army or Manifest Sons of God).9 Chief architect of this movement for the past two decades is C. Peter Wagner, President of Global Harvest Ministries and Chancellor of the Wagner Leadership Institute. His spiritual warfare teachings have been widely disseminated through mission networks such as AD 2000, which was closely associated with the Lausanne Movement. A prominent individual connected to this sect is Ted Haggard, current head of the National Association of Evangelicals.10\n \n \n \n The New Apostolic Reformation\n \n Since 2001, the body of Christ has been in the Second Apostolic Age. The apostolic/prophetic government of the church is now in place. . . . [W]e began to build our base by locating and identifying with the intercessory prayer movements. This time, however, we feel that God wants us to start governmentally, connecting with the apostles of the region. God has already raised up for us a key apostle in one of the strategic nations of the Middle East, and other apostles are already coming on board. Once we have the apostles in place, we will then bring the intercessors and the prophets into the inner circle, and we will end up with the spiritual core we need to move ahead for retaking the dominion that is rightfully ours.11 [emphasis added]\n \n C. Peter Wagner\n \n \n \n 2. MISSION AS TRANSFORMATION movement: The words \"revival,\" \"reformation\" and \"transformation\" now carry embedded dominionist connotations. \"Fulfilling the Great Commission\" (Matthew 28:18-20) no longer means spreading the Gospel message by speaking the Word of salvation from the Bible. The dominionist focus is placed upon the phrase making disciples, with an incorrect exegesis that is disconcertingly compulsory. Traditional mission evangelism, done one-on-one using the Bible, is being replaced with a slew of \"kingdom building\" corporate activities for cities, regions and nations. The disingenuous phrase \"bless the nations\" is often used to conceal dominionism. Dr. Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ International and Ralph Winter, founder of the U.S. Center for World Mission and editor of the Perspectives on the World Christian Movement curriculum (which has taught dominionism to an entire generation of missionaries), have been among the chief architects of this movement.12\n \n \n Dominionism supplants biblical evangelism\n \n \"The Church must grow past the 'Gospel of Salvation' message and understand that it is only when we begin to implement the principles of the 'Gospel of the kingdom' that we will really begin to see change in lives and cities and nations. The Church has no understanding of this realm. . . The Church must grow up. . . . 13 [emphasis added]\n \n Dale Neill, president of ICCC\n \n \n \n Beyond Salvation\n \n \". . . God's concern goes beyond the salvation of individual people. His redemptive plan encompasses the healing and transformation of entire nations . . . . Nations are discipled as the church makes the invisible Kingdom visible by faithful obedience to God's Word throughout culture--in every area of life, and every realm of society including the family, the community, the arts, sciences, media, law, government, schools, or business. . . .\"14 [emphasis added]\n \n Disciple the Nations\n \n \n \n 3. PATRIOTIC AMERICAN movement: Patriotic dominionists, most of whom are not Reconstructionists, teach that political action will advance the kingdom of God in America. Using the vehicle of Christian media, they have taught evangelicals for the past three decades that America is a Christian nation and needs to return to its roots. Almost every evangelical in the pew has been influenced in one way or another by this sect. Patriotic dominionist leaders and their organizations have been closely interlocked financially and politically with the conservatives from the political Right. The secular conservatives purport to uphold morality, which appeals to evangelicals. The combined force of conservatives and evangelicals flexes its political muscles in Washington. One of its most powerful leaders is James Dobson of Focus on the Family. Patriotic dominionism was widely disseminated through the activities of Jay Grimstead, founder of Coalition on Revival (COR). From its earliest inception COR managed to successfully bring together key leaders from all three dominionist sects, including the Reconstructionists, to promote the most ruthless doctrines of dominionism.15\n \n Grimstead's COR Steering Council letter, dated May 1993\n \n 1.

Biblical evangelism according to the Great Commission of Matt. 28:18-20 is not truly accomplished unless that message of Christ's lordship from point #4 above is given to the person being evangelized so that they know that an attempt at personal neutrality before King Jesus is sin and treason in this universe.16 [emphases added]\n\n \n Samiinh, give it up. You have not provided a link for the Dominionists website but instead one site that promotes prayer for revival as if that is a concerted effort to take over our Government and then force all Americans to convert or die. How dishonest can you get ?\n \n And then for the rest of your post, you don't even dare post the links because you know they're again from Leftist sites that are making these preposterous accusations. All you have to do to put this claim that an organized group named the Dominionists who have proudly declared their agenda to infiltrate the US Government with fanatical citizens determined to employ the Christian Doctrine upon the American people for the sole purpose of creating a Religious Oligarchy is to post their web site. But once again you attempt to post leftist accusers rather than the site itself. \n \n Could the reason be that their are plenty of leftist sites passing this propaganda on as truth, which you yourself are trying to propagate, yet you can't post the one single site of the Dominionists themselves ? Give it up, you defeat yourself by starting out with a lie and a nonexistent group with a nonexistent agenda.",

   "For the Monitor\n Apr 27, 2007\n \n T\n here is nothing more frightening than the marriage of state and religion. The framers and founders were painfully aware of this and took steps to avert such a dangerous union.\n \n Persons such as Mr. Lull (\"My Turn,\" Monitor, April 24) would have the near-omnipotent power of government given the moral authority of the church (theirs, of course) to oppress those who believe differently from them. What really scares them?\n \n Since I can not fathom how giving others the same rights and privileges that I enjoy threatens me or my marriage, I can only assume they feel their status is somehow threatened.\n \n How sad. I can only imagine how low their self-esteem must be. Perhaps counseling would help.\n \n For those of you with slightly less fragile egos, this issue is not dissimilar from other divisive civil rights issues of the past. Chicken Little and his followers were wrong then, and they are wrong now. The sky is right where it has always been.\n One does not choose to be born black, female or gay.\n \n All you really need to do is examine your circle of friends and family and ask yourself a simple question. Would you tolerate any one of them being denied the rights and privileges you enjoy because of how they were born, or to whom? Because of the color of their skin or gender?\n \n One hopes your answer would be of course not.",

You are alarmed at the words of militant homosexuals from 1969, who were mad as hell and weren't going to take it anymore, as if they speak for your neighbors today who just want the same rights you enjoy.\n \n You are entitled to believe that the Holiness Code of Ancient Israel and the correspondence of Paul of Tarsus are the literal, inerrant Words of God - a belief that not all your fellow citizens, or even all your fellow Christians, share. Your belief does not entitle you to discriminate against those who differ from you. In our great country, not even an alleged majority is empowered to do that.\n \n This issue is not a war, Pastor. You of all people should know the power of words. To equate the desire to visit committed partners on their deathbeds with the carnage in Iraq, or a nuclear strike on the foundations of society, is tasteless hyperbole.\n \n Your side doesn't have to win.

   "I think it's sad that we live in a country where everyone (no matter your race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or socio-economic status) are techically afforded the same rights, but who do not actually have the same rights. That is, if you're an American citizen. Undoubtedly, it's discriminating against gay/lesbians to not allow them to marry. This is just another example of how influential religious beliefs can have upon a legal issue. Hell, I know there are plenty of heterosexual couples in our society that should not have been allowed to get married, particularly those who have married 3 or 4 times. However, I believe this will always be a debatable and prominent issue in our society, just like racism. Although it's wonderful that we can freely speak our mind and form our own opinion in this country, that liberty is often misused when people form ignorant opinions without having done their homework first.",

Maybe we are a lesson in your journey? Your \"Marriage\" holds too many pagan customs and symbols(rings/veils/hand binding,etc) for you to even think of holding a monopoly on the custom of marriage.
