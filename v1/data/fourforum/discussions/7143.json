   "A Grand Master Plan for the re-construction of New Orleans infrastructure is needed starting with the levee system. It is time to create a tidal water generating system as part of the new levee and canal system. Tidal ponds, lakes and rivers need to be created as part of a safety net for New Orleans. A tidal water generating system could generate electricity with the tidal waters going in and go out of New Orleans levee system. A lock and pump system could lower the water table within New Orleans levee system before an impending major storm. The dredging material from the creation of the tidal water system could be used to create new highland for the community. \n \n With the use of global positioning satellites (GPS) surveying a master plan could be developed for New Orleans working with the natural boundaries. Only by keeping in balanced the land reclaimed and the tidal water system within the New Orleans levee system can the maximum security be achieved economically. Environmentally friendly turbines could generate electricity from the tidal flow in the New Orleans levee system. \n \n There will be two different types of land within the New Orleans that will be condemned by the New Orleans Land Authority. \n \n a. Land that will become part of the wetlands, ponds, lakes, rivers or waterways. \n b. Land that will be raised to sea level creating the new highlands for the community.\n \n A major effort will be made to save the historical structures within the land that is condemned. Moving these structures to the new highland once they are constructed. A composition package will be made with the land owners of the condemned land to having first choice in the new highlands. Banks and Real Estate leading institutions that hold land that is condemned will be compensated in cash. The Grand Master Plan to rebuild New Orleans is a twenty plus year program. The people of New Orleans should have the first right to the new jobs and opportunities that come about in the re-building of New Orleans.",
