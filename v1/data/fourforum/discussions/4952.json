   "\"My feeling as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded only by a few followers, summoned men to fight and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter.\n \n In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. \n \n Today, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed his blood upon the Cross.\n \n As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice.\n \n And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly, it is the distress that daily grows. For as a Christian I have also a duty to my own people. And when I look on my people I see them work and work and toil and labor, and at the end of the week they have only for their wages wretchedness and misery.\n \n When I go out in the morning and see these men standing in their queues and look into their pinched faces, then I believe I would be no Christian, but a very devil, if I felt no pity for them, if I did not, as did our Lord two thousand years ago, turn against those by whom today this poor people are plundered and exploited\".\n \n Adolf Hitler, in a speech delivered April 12, 1922, and published in \"My New Order\".\n \n Speaking in Vienna in April, 1938, after Anschluss (union) with Austria, Hitler said: \"I believe that it was God's will to send a youth from here into the Reich, to let him grow up, to raise him to be the leader of the nation so as to enable him to lead back his homeland into the Reich . . . In three days the Lord has smitten them. . . . And to me the grace was given on the day of the betrayal to be able to unite my homeland with the Reich . . . I would now give thanks to Him who let me return to my homeland in order that I might now lead it into my German Reich. Tomorrow, may every German recognize the hour, and measure its import and bow in humility before the Almighty who in a few weeks has wrought a miracle upon us.\"\n \n \"By defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord,\" Hitler declared in Mein Kampf. He invoked another German, Martin Luther the first Protestant, when Luther spoke before the Diet at Worms saying, \"All Jews should be driven from Germany\".\n \n Well, that's enough of that. Hitler claimed to be a Christian. It is a mark of utmost ignorance to claim that Hitler knew anything about the theory of evolution, just as it would be stupid to claim that he was a Christian.",

But what would we expect from someone who shows so little ability to think for himself.\n \n Ray's reference to the subtitle of On the Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life as evidence of racial bias is based on stupidity of the truest kind.

Here is the second time that Darwin used the words race in the actual text of the book:\n \nNevertheless, as our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms, it seems to me not improbable, that if we could succeed in naturalising, or were to cultivate, during many generations, the several races, for instance, of the cabbage, in very poor soil (in which case, however, some effect would have to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil), that they would to a large extent, or even wholly, revert to the wild aboriginal stock.\n\n And here's a couple more of Darwin's use of the word:\n \nWhen we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants, and compare them with species closely allied together, we generally perceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less uniformity of character than in true species.\n\n Yep. That sure sounds like racism to me. How about you, Ray? Please explain how that reference shows that Darwin was a racist or that his theory is racist. Otherwise you remain among the group that I have already characterized.\n \n You can also explain how Darwin's extensive discussion of the races of pigeons demonstrates the racism of Darwin and his theory.\n \n Don't be shy, Ray.

   "I said DarwinISM has racism as its origin.\n\n But every attempt you have made to support that assertion has failed. In fact, several times you have been shown to be wrong.\n \n So perhaps you can explain exactly what about Darwin's theories is racist. In order to adequately answer my question you're going to have to enumerate each of Darwin's theories. In just On the Origin of Species there are at least 5 independent theories. Be sure to explain each one and then explain how it is relevant to racism, and of course, how the origin is racist. And that doesn't even begin to touch some of Darwin's other theories - on vulcanism, the growth of coral, island populations, orchids, snails, and earthworms, just to name a few. In fact, when someone brought Darwin a specimen of orchid (from Madigascar I believe) with an exceptionally long flower, Darwin predicted that there would be a moth with an exceptionally long probiscus, adapted to feed on the nectar of that orchid and, at the same time, pollinate it. Darwin was correct. That moth was found.\n \n Your failure to respond to this question will be another admission of defeat, just like before. Please don't disappoint us again by running away like you did before. I'm still waiting for you to demonstrate that you actually know what isochron dating is and that you haven't just confused the term with plain old radiometric dating or K/Ar dating. In that case you were requested to furnish references to show that isochron dating was used by both Fitch/Miller and the Berkeley team - that would be some time around 1969 to 1972. You ran away from that question too.\n \n I suspect all that we are going to see about any question will be your nappied little fanny being carried away as fast as your chubby little legs can carry it.",
