   "Obama Gives a Pass: TSA Won&#8217;t Touch Muslims&#8217; Junk | Floyd Reports\n \n \nThirty-one-year-old John Tyner, a 31-year-old recently unleashed the \"Don't tase me, Bro\" moment of airport security. While about to receive a genital check from TSA security, Tyner agreed to a search of non-intimate areas but said, \"If you touch my junk, I'll have you arrested.\" However, Muslim women will not have to face such worries. CNSNews.com has reported that Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) - which is frequently tied to domestic terror plots - has been guaranteed that TSA officials will only pat down Muslim women in the head and neck area.\n \n CAIR said Muslims who object to full-body scans for religious reasons should know their rights if they are required to undergo a pat-down, including asking for the procedure to be done in a private place. In addition, CAIR offered a \"special recommendation\" for Muslim women who wear a hijab, telling them they should tell the TSA officer that they may be searched only around the head and neck.\n \n \"Before you are patted down, you should remind the TSA officer that they are only supposed to pat down the area in question, in this scenario, your head and neck. They SHOULD NOT subject you to a full-body or partial-body pat-down.\"\n \n Muslim women will likely opt for the not-very-invasive security pat-down, because most consider airports' high-image body scans a violation of Islamic Shari'a law. CNS News adds, \"In February, the Figh Council of North America, a group of Islamic scholars, issued a fatwa, or religious ruling, that full-body scanners violate Islamic law.\"\n \n So, Muslim women will not be subject to a full body scan or a pat-down on much of their elaborately concealed bodies. Feeling secure yet?\n \n Add this to the growing proof that political correctness is not merely totalitarian but suicidal. The president made an exception to airline security protocol big enough to drive a jihad through - and applied it only to the adherents of Islam. Roman Catholic nuns can be groped en masse, but Obama rushed to defend the dignity of Muslim women.\n \n Luckily, Muslim terrorists have no history of using female suicide bombers or hiding explosives in their underwear.\n \n Consider this just another reason why one-in-four Americans believe Obama is a Muslim.\n\n \n So muslims get to be exempt from the terrorist screening at airports. And yet muslims are the ones that brought about this whole security boondoggle.",

   "TSA: The New Sex Predators Grooming Your Children With Your Consent | Maria Muir.com\n \n \nUnbelievably the TSA are telling children that &#8216;pat downs&#8217; are a game so they will comply and allow strangers to touch them and putting them in danger. If you are of the view that the pat downs are harmless, non evasive and needed to tighten security at airports then now is the time to re-assess that thought.\n \n Think of the ramifications that this pat down &#8216;game&#8217; will have overall. Think about how a total stranger will be touching your child&#8217;s body, all in the name of security. Think about when your child could be faced with a situation and being told that its a &#8216;game&#8217; by another stranger, by a sexual predator, by a paedophile. The child will accept this game because he/she played it before, at the airport, in full view of other passengers, witnessed by airport staff, carried out by the TSA so they won&#8217;t be alarmed or afraid and then willingly play the game.\n \n Any victim of abuse will tell you that the &#8216;game&#8217; is a tactic used by paedophiles and draw victims into a false sense of security. Any decent parent raise their children never speak to strangers and yet are now allowing and subjecting their children to such treatment by the TSA without blinking an eyelid. Telling your child that the pat downs are a game is WRONG. You are leaving your children wide open to abuse as they have been told its a game, by you and as you so calmly stood by and watched your child being groped, your child will believe that it&#8217;s OK because Mummy and Daddy said so and Mummy and Daddy are always right, aren&#8217;t they?\n \n You are giving your child a clear signal that it is okay for a complete stranger to touch them and so what will you do when faced with the real scenario of child abuse after telling your child it was only a &#8216;game&#8217;?\n \n An expert in the fight against child sexual abuse is raising the alarm about a technique the TSA is reportedly using to get children to co-operate with airport pat-downs: calling it a &#8220;game&#8221;.\n \n Ken Wooden, founder of Child Lures Prevention, says the TSA&#8217;s recommendation that children be told the pat-down is a &#8220;game&#8221; is potentially putting children in danger.\n \n Telling a child that they are engaging in a game is &#8220;one of the most common ways&#8221; that sexual predators use to convince children to engage in inappropriate contact, Wooden told Raw Story.\n \n Children &#8220;don&#8217;t have the sophistication&#8221; to distinguish between a pat-down carried out by an airport security officer and an assault by a sexual predator, he said.\n \n The TSA policy could &#8220;desensitize children to inappropriate touch and ultimately make it easier for sexual offenders to prey on our children,&#8221; Wooden added.\n \n Following an outcry last month over the use on children of &#8220;enhanced pat-downs&#8221; &#8212; which involve the touching of genitals &#8212; the TSA announced a new &#8220;modified&#8221; pat-down for children under 12. However, as the LA Times noted, the new rules are &#8220;unclear&#8221; on whether TSA agents can touch children&#8217;s genitals.\n \n Addressing the controversy over pat-downs of children last month, TSA regional security director James Marchand told the press the TSA was working on new practices to make children more comfortable during the pat-down process.\n \n Wooden, who has testified before Congress on child safety issues on numerous occasions, says he was told by a TSA agent that the practice has been used.\n \n &#8220;How can experts working at the TSA be so incredibly misinformed and misguided to suggest that full body pat downs for children be portrayed as a game?&#8221; Wooden asked in an email. &#8220;To do so is completely contrary to what we in the sexual abuse prevention field have been trying to accomplish for the past thirty years.&#8221;\n \n He added: &#8220;This policy is also incredibly insensitive to the countless victims who have already been traumatized by unwanted touching in their lives and could be re-traumatized by such pat-downs.&#8221;\n \n On Tuesday, TSA administrator John Pistole said the agency may change its screening rules for victims of sex abuse. He also said the TSA had no plans to continue expanding the airport screening process.\n \n &#8220;I think we are at the most thorough that we will probably be in terms of our physical screening,&#8221; he announced.\n \n So are you willing to put your child at risk?\n \n Will you stand back and allow this to happen to your child?\n \n Do you agree with the TSA and think this is acceptable?\n \n Will you keep a firm hold of your child while the TSA play their &#8216;game&#8217; as your child objects and cries?\n \n These invasive body scanners and pat downs are already being planned for shopping malls, sports stadiums, concert arenas and train stations and it wont be long until this starts happening in the UK. You will be treated like a terrorist, questioned, searched, displayed in public and humiliated even if you have done nothing wrong.\n \n Then what will you do?\n",

   "They don't need these security measures for \"security.\" If they wanted security, they would research names on lists and stop identified individuals from boarding. For example, they HAD the information on the Nigerian underwear bomber. But they were too busy look at innocent people rather than people already under suspicion. Hey, they could have apprehended some of the 9-11 terrorists if they had bothered to look more closely at their visa documents which had doctored to conceal entrance into specific red-flag nations.

I guess if I had to, I'd opt for the x-ray, as long the radiation levels were very insignificant, and I wasn't going ot keep using the x-rays via repeated airplane commuter rides. (I gues people who ride a lot might make another choice.)\n \n But if you go with the x-ray, you don't have to deal with the hand/grope confrontation, or anyone for that matter, the lines are shorter and move faster, and you figure at the end of the day, whoever googled your pre-shower form will not remember it stunning beauty at all amidst the thousands of other bodies in America's modern Greek sculpture collection\n \n Just imagine what some conceptual artists could do with this material -- say, the actual x-rays of bodies, picture of people getting felt up, etc. The possibilities seem endless.",
