One of the two men also had French citizenship.\n \n Paola Pollice, 38, and Marco Sodini, 40, unmarried, brought their three children to the rally. \"We are here to offer our support to non-heterosexual couples and their families,\" Sodini said.\n \n The Milan demonstration, whose slogan was \"Let's emerge from silence,\" was organized by women concerned that Catholic politicians, encouraged by the Vatican, will try to undo a 1978 law that makes abortion legal during the first three months of pregnancy.\n \n Police estimated 50,000 people joined in the march, which ended in the square in front of the Duomo, the city's Gothic cathedral.\n \n The events came two days after Pope Benedict XVI said it was wrong to give legal recognition to gay unions and also reaffirmed the Vatican's condemnation of abortion.\n \n Italian bishops have made abortion a campaign issue for the first time since 1981, when Italians upheld the law in a referendum that had been backed by the Vatican in a bid to overturn the legislation.\n \n Politicians in the center-left opposition challenging Berlusconi in April 9 parliamentary elections have been divided over how far to go in granting rights to homosexuals who live together. It is a delicate question for Romano Prodi, a Catholic who is Berlusconi's opponent for the premiership.",
