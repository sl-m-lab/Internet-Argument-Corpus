If the suffering of that man is not enough to convince you it is needed I don't know what else would...",

   "These to pieces of excrement should rot in jail for the very reason Price states, because they attacked a human being. The fact that they attacked a gay human being is irrelevant. I hope they put these two under the jail.\n\n It is often a mistake to try to treat a disease if you don't understand what you are treating in the first place.\n \n So understanding the MOTIVE for the crime is important in addressing the crime.\n \n There are areas in the Middle East where Christians are killed.\n Would it make sense to just talk about people being killed, without recognizing (and addressing) WHY they are being killed?\n If you want to deal with the ACTUAL problem, it is useful to IDENTIFY the actual problem and not just insist on being color-blind...\n \n \n \nLast Thursday, 49-year-old Jack Price, an openly gay man, was attacked right outside of his home by two individuals yelling anti-gay slurs. Price suffered a broken jaw, fractured ribs, collapsed lungs, a lacerated spleen, and had to be placed in a medically induced coma.\n\n This is the depth of the hate that exists out there...\n Some people are incapable of empathizing. Some people will immediately see something like this and try to fixate on some way to denigrate gays.\n Some will immediately feel more annoyance over how others may have sympathy towards gays over the issue, thinking about how it affects their opinion politically as opposed to recognizing a vile crime.\n Some will just plain ignore it.\n \n Some, like Lurch, will accurately assess and condemn the crime unequivocably. While we may quibble over some of the details, the fact that he took the time to condemn the crime is the main aspect which (IMO) is very important (as opposed to the other types of responses).",
