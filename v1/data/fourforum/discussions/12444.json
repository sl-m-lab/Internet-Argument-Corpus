   "I haven't read through this whole article yet, but could someone who insists that nationalized health care will cause spiraling costs with worse results explain these paragraphs to me:\n\n \n This is why, let's hear directly from a Canadian expert who works in their healthcare system\n THE CONSEQUENCES OF SINGLE-PAYER CARE IN CANADA\n \n DAVID GRATZER: It's a great honor to be able to speak today at The Heritage Foundation. I'm always impressed by the debates and discussions that come out of Heritage. I think Americans are very lucky to have such a think tank.\n \n Canadians who went to the United States five, 10, or 15 years ago, when they would talk about health care, would speak fondly of the best health care system in the world. Until very recently, Canadians thought they got it right and always looked south and shook their heads.\n \n If Canadians liked to look south and brag, Americans would come north and express awe. It wasn't uncommon to find an article in The New York Times or The Washington Post discussing the health care system where everything is free, where hospitals are brand-new, where doctors and patients are absolutely content.\n \n Losing Favor\n Those days have passed. Americans still sometimes come north and express awe; Senator Kennedy was in town a few years ago for a fund raiser. Sometimes Canadian politicians go south and talk up the Canadian system; our Prime Minister lectured your President about four or five years ago. By and large, however, the enthusiasm for the Canadian system has very much waned.\n \n I'm a fan of polls. Of course, one should always take these things with a grain of salt, but a good poll can be informative.\n \n For example, Angus Reid, a well-respected Canadian pollster, asked Canadians to rate their health care system. When they started doing this polling in 1991, a clear majority of Canadians gave the system top marks: excellent or very good. Last year, when they did the poll again, under one in four gave the system that rating.\n \n Angus Reid has done other polls as well. A year and a half ago, a poll sent shock waves across the country when 73 percent of Canadians described their health care system as being \"in crisis.\" Reid actually went back and redid the poll six months later: 78 percent of Canadians now thought the system was in crisis.\n \n People who have had reservations about the Canadian system have often talked up ideas that are very common in other Western countries: user fees being one and two-tier health care, or the ability to buy private insurance, being another.\n \n There isn't a single politician who advocates user fees. There isn't a single politician who will publicly state that they are in favor of private insurance. And yet, just before the end of last year, a major poll commissioned by Macleans magazine showed that a clear majority of Canadians now support user fees. On private insurance, we're divided.\n \n That may not seem so incredible, perhaps, to outside observers. But in a country where no politician is willing to advocate such ideas, it's quite a remarkable development.\n \n The Health Care Quality Problem\n So what has happened in Canada? Why is it that we've gone from being very bullish on this health care system to having great reservations? Part of it is that Canadians read newspapers, and it doesn't much matter whether you're on the west coast or the east coast; it doesn't much matter whether you're a Globe and Mail reader, or a National Post reader; every single day, there are stories describing the system.\n \n I've just randomly chosen a few stories that have come to light recently.\n \n The head of trauma care at Vancouver's largest hospital announces that they turn away more cases than any other center in North America. He's quoted as saying this would be unheard of in the United States.\n \n In Manitoba, which is my former home province, the premier--the political equivalent of a governor--concedes that his pledge to end hallway medicine has fallen short. Hallway medicine is the phenomenon where the emergency rooms are so filled with patients that people are forced to lie on stretchers in hallways, often for days. Overcrowding is a periodic problem. In fact, the overcrowding is worse than last year. The community is rocked by the death of a 74-year old man who had waited in the emergency room for three hours and had not been seen.\n \n New Brunswick announces that they will send cancer patients south to the United States for radiation therapy. New Brunswick, a small maritime province, is the seventh to publicly announce its plans to send patients south. In the best health care system in the world, the vast majority of provinces now rely on American health care to provide radiation therapy. Provinces do this because the clinically recommended waiting time for treatment is often badly exceeded. Ordinarily, oncologists suggest that there should be a two-week gap between the initial consult by the family doctor and the referral to the oncologist, and then two weeks more from the oncologist to the commencement of radiation therapy. In most Canadian provinces, we exceed that by one to two months, sometimes three.\n \n In Alberta earlier this year, a young man dies because of the profound emergency room overcrowding. He is 23. On a winter's night, he develops pain in his flank and goes to the local emergency room. It is so crowded that he grows impatient and goes to another. There, he waits six hours. No one sees him. Exhausted and frustrated, he goes home. The pain continues, so he finally decides to go to the local community hospital. It's too late: His appendix ruptured. He dies from the complications hours later.\n Those are some of the examples of the cruelty of what goes on in Canada. But they don't give you the flavor of the insanity--and I'll use that term in a nonprofessional sense--of the Canadian system.\n \n MRI scanners are very difficult to get in Canada. There are long wait times. In my book, I talk about a political struggle on Vancouver Island where the wait time for a non-urgent MRI scan was over a year--\"non-urgent\" being defined by government officials, not by physicians. In the province I now live in, Ontario, there are long wait times for MRIs.\n \n Part of the problem is that we have so few of these scanners. Canada per capita has as many MRI scanners as Colombia and Mexico. It wouldn't be fair to try and compare us to the United States or Western Europe. And the few MRIs that we have tend to run on bankers' hours. MRI scanners are expensive to operate. So if an MRI scanner stops dealing with humans at 5 p.m., there are still hours you could run the scanner.\n \n What many MRI clinics now do to make a little bit of money is rent out their facilities to veterinarians. There was a story, which caused quite a scandal, that a London man was expected to wait seven months for an MRI but his dog could get one in just a couple of weeks. They, of course, addressed this discrepancy in a very Canadian way: by preventing veterinarians from booking the off hours.\n \n They're still renting out in some parts of the country. Where I live now, Toronto, there's an MRI scanner that was renting out to vets. A patient came up with a clever idea: He tried to book himself for an appointment under the name of \"Spot.\" Spot was a good name to choose, because Spot could be seen a hell of a lot faster than a person bearing a less canine name.\n \n The Fairness Issue\n We had an election campaign several months ago, and the state of our health care system was an issue. Canadian politicians are a timid lot, and no one was directly willing to criticize the system's structure. One interesting point raised, however, was that despite the emphasis on equality and fairness, many people queue jump. One of the big accusations against the Liberal Party, Canada's government party, was that members periodically queue jump and get preferential care.\n \n The National Post, one of Canada's national dailies, went to a number of prominent politicians and asked if they queue jump. They had done a little bit of work and knew of a clinic where VIPs received faster care. A reporter asked Senator Sharon Carstairs, government leader of the Senate, if it was true that her husband queue jumped. She said that that story was absolutely untrue and unfounded. Actually, she observed that the sort of surgery he needed wasn't available in Canada, so they went to the United States and paid $15,000--an unspeakable act by Canadian standards.\n \n A Clinical Case\n I mention these stories, and very often people ask me if this is merely sensational journalism. Is the system really that bad?\n \n I don't just read about the health care system. I work and study in it. Frankly, I'm impressed by the efforts of providers within the system despite the many, many frustrations.\n \n One story, however, particularly troubled me: a patient on the osteosarcoma ward of a Toronto hospital. Basically, she had an obscure cancer; osteosarcomas are particularly malignant and particularly rare. She had the primary in her foot, and the orthopods decided to begin with amputation, then move on to other types of therapy.\n \n They weren't comfortable with amputation until they got an MRI scan. After they got the MRI scan of the foot, they were willing to go ahead with the surgery. MRI scans are difficult to get, even in hospitals. It was a bad time of year. The hospital was very full, so they planned to do the scan at the end of the week, but she got bumped for another week.\n \n They did the scan and wanted to go ahead with the surgery, except that operating room time is very limited. To complicate matters, urgent surgeries like an amputation are often postponed because emergency cases get priority. The patient was bumped several times. She finally did get the amputation she needed after three weeks. Osteosarcoma is a very aggressive cancer, and she could actually see the lesion growing in her foot. It grew from a sore on her foot to the size of a football.\n \n I should condition all of this by saying that we knew she had metastasis to her lungs. Her prognosis was poor to begin with. But she deserved better.\n \n Of course, all of this is anecdotal evidence. It's very easy to say, \"Well, he's given one horror story and a couple of examples drawn from newspapers. Is the system really that poorly off?\" I'll just summarize a couple of studies that have gone on recently and then move to my concluding comments.\n \n The Fraser Institute, a major think tank in Canada, does a survey of 2,300 physicians across 12 specialties and asks them to estimate the wait time between the initial visit with the family doctor to the surgical therapy. They do this every year. Right now, the average wait time is 14 weeks. What's very impressive is the extent to which that has grown; 14 weeks marks a 5.3 percent increase over the last year, despite the fact that government spending in health care has grown by 22 percent over the last three years.\n \n The Fraser Institute not only asks physicians how long patients wait, but they ask doctors how long they think patients ought to reasonably wait. In every single category, patients wait too long, in the opinion of the physicians.\n \n There was a recent five-country survey of health care by the Harvard School of Public Health. They asked specialists across these nations if they felt there was a decline in the quality of health care. Canada has the dubious distinction of having highest response rate in the affirmative, 63 percent.\n \n The Harvard researchers also looked at wait times, where Canada faired poorly. There were a variety of scenarios that were given. One of them was a 50-year-old woman with irregular breast mass, without lymph node involvement. Obviously, this woman needs a biopsy. In Canada, patients typically waited the longest; 19 percent waited longer than a month for a biopsy. That was the highest percentage of the five countries. Just to put that in some perspective, in the United States, 90 percent of patients are biopsied within a fortnight.\n \n Just last week, the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, traditionally very supportive of socialized health care, released a major study on heart attack survival. Five-year survival rates in Canada and the United States are extremely comparable, but morbidity, meaning how people felt, was not.\n \n Some of their findings: After 12 months, 31 percent of patients rated their health as being better than the month before the cardiac event. In the United States, 44 percent of survivors felt their health was better. Researchers attributed part of the difference to the ability of Americans to get angioplasty and bypass surgery, which is so difficult to get north of the 49th parallel.\n \n The Cancer Advocacy Coalition of Canada is a not-for-profit group. The entire operation is run out of an office above the garage of one of the member's houses. They look at wait times and availability of chemotherapy.\n \n They decided to try and figure out what impact the dearth of technology and cutting-edge chemo drugs have on cancer survival rates. Drawing on an international database, they compared mortality rates. So how many people in each jurisdiction die of different cancers?\n \n The findings were really quite striking. One finding: In New Brunswick, which is the Atlantic province I mentioned earlier that's sending the patients over the border for cancer care, people are twice as likely to die from colorectal cancer as a person in Utah.\n \n One of the big criticisms of that study is that it doesn't look at incidence. Without getting into biostatistics, what you ought to do is not just look at what people die from, but look at how many people are diagnosed, thus discounting lifestyle. People were critical of the study.\n \n So they did something very sneaky. They actually got a government biostatistician to provide the incidence. They could thus answer a simple question: If you're diagnosed with cancer in Canada, how do you compare in terms of your life expectancy to somebody who's diagnosed in the United States? Canadian provinces ranked close to or at the bottom in every single category.\n \n The Canadian system is ailing. Why? I believe that Canadian medicare suffers from a basic economic problem. We have a free-for-all system, and, as health economists have well shown, costs are driven up. Patients tend to overconsume health services while providers tend to oversupply health services. The only way we can deal with this is to ration through waiting.\n \n It's like the old Soviet system: Everything is free, but nothing is readily available. It's very amusing when you're talking about toilet paper in Moscow in 1975; it's far less amusing when you're talking about cancer treatment in Toronto in the year 2001.\n \n A Message for Americans\n I think it would be safe to say that you could have a single-payer system that's smarter than the Canadian system. You could have a single-payer system that has user fees. You could have a single-payer system that allows private insurance. You could hire better administrators. But I think at the end of the day--and this would be my message to you Americans--you have to understand that when the government finances something, it ends up managing it.\n \n That is well illustrated by Canadian medicare. Even if we did make the revolutionary reforms that politicians aren't willing to advocate, but we kept it as a single-payer system, we would still have bad health care. Single-payer health care, which effectively means government-run health care, has three consequences. I will list them and then cite a Canadian example of each.\n \n Consequence One: Poor Accountability. There is an extraordinary lack of information about the health care system in Canada. I'm putting together a book now, and I asked one of the big health information experts in Canada to write a chapter for it. As an exercise, he wrote a letter to every ministry of health in the country and asked about wait times for treatment. Not if they were clinically reasonable; not how many people were on wait times; not even the geographic distribution; just a sense of how long people wait for basic therapies, treatments, and surgeries. Not a single ministry of health in the country could respond.\n \n In fact, because our health care system runs into so many troubles, government often obstructs the flow of information. In Toronto, where about a fifth of the population resides, hospitals typically go on redirect and critical care bypass because of emergency room overcrowding. How did the government first address this problem? They stopped publishing data on the frequency of hospital bypasses.\n \n Consequence Two: Politicized Decision-Making. I'm not talking about just small decisions, but every decision, the sort of decisions that should be apolitical and influenced by community needs. In Ontario, where the government is elected by rural constituents, major hospital restructuring was initiated. The first thing the government did was announce that they were going to close hospitals and that there would be no sacred cows. The second thing they said is that no rural institution would be touched.\n \n If it seems unfair to pick on Ontario, we can look at Saskatchewan, a smaller prairie province, where the government is traditionally elected out of the urban centers. They too had a major restructuring of their hospital system, and they started and ended with rural institutions.\n \n Consequence Three: Lack of Innovation. Bureaucrats are very cautious as a lot. They tend not to be aggressive. As a result, innovative people within the system are frustrated. It's difficult to get financial support for cutting-edge treatments and technologies.\n \n Last month, the National Post ran a three-part series on cancer care in Canada. One of the stories focused on a man who was diagnosed with esophageal carcinoma. Given a 10 percent survival rate in Canada, he went to the United States and was treated with experimental medicines. Four years later, he's still alive. He couldn't get that kind of care in Canada, not because the oncologists aren't well-trained or the nurses aren't skilled but because funding for clinical trials and experimental treatments is scarce.\n \n So, in terms of the larger issue, is the single-payer system attractive? I think a single-payer system in the short term is very politically sexy, but I think that there are good lessons to learn from Canada on why you would not want to do this.Buyer Beware: The Failure of Single-Payer Health Care\n \n What's the point of this? Cost is secondary to quality when ones Healthcare is concerned.",

   "I'm curious as to how people on here can claim that the American health care system is the cheapest, most efficient, economical model (and overall \"best\" option) given the stats presented above.\n\n \n It used to be that way, but no longer is. A major shift has taken place in the last decade or so. The enormous costs of research and development done in the U.S. has finally come home to roost, while other countries have taken advantage of that research and development, in legitimate ways. There's nothing wrong with them doing it either, but it would be nice if they apprecialted it. I somehow get the feeling that many of them don't. \n \n I believe the US used to have the best healthcare system, back in the 1950's and 1960's. All routine medical expenses were paid by the individual (head of household in the case of families) and insurance only covered unusual/catastrophic/unexpected medical emergencies, and childbirth - it seemed to fit in without much of a problem. About all anyone needed was a job, and medical insurance for himself and his entire family were easily provided by the employer in most cases. Then someone in the insurance industry had the brilliant idea of insurance for routine expenses - I believe it started with dental insurance, in the early 1970's. It grew from there - prescription insurance, $5 co-pays for office visits, birth control pills, on and on. HMO's - it was easy at first, everybody was happy. \"Maintain your health\", never mind that the human body essentially heals itself. \"Come to the doctor every few months, your boss will pay for your absense. Stick out your tongue - you're fine! - bam - that'll be $75 but don't worry, your insurance will pay it!\" \n \n Third party payers for routine living expenses is bad news in a free market system. It worked okay for awhile, before too many people started taking advantage of it. It's human nature, if someone gets a service they don't have to pay for, they will use more of it than they need, and will not appreciate it. There is always a point where it gets so big that the money runs out. \n \n I'll admit that if the US system would have stayed exactly the way it was in the 1960's, most of the medical breakthroughs of the past few decades, most recent prescription drugs, etc. probably never would have been developed. But the cost monster is now fully grown. Things were possible while he was growing, that are no longer possible now that he has grown. \n \n The US healthcare system is now half and half - half private and half socialist. It doesn't work very well, and it's not going to work very well if it goes completely socialist. Going completely socialist is probably the only way possible - there's no way to get it back to being completely private like it was 50 years ago. Only one thing is for sure, the research and development of the past few decades is going to have to slow down. No society on earth, individually or collectively, can afford unlimited amounts of it.",

   "I hardly think a description of healthcare is Britain from an organisation devoted to promoting private healthcare can be considered a valid source.\n \n It would also be nice if you actually made some arguments yourself, because there are many obvious flaws with the article but I don't know which points you'll wriggle away from when challenged.\n \n I'll start with a few though: the NHS cost more than expected because a lot of people were not getting treatment because they couldn't afford it. \n \n I also fail to see how actually requiring doctors to be qualified can be evidence of a cartel, and I'm puzzled as to why the author stops blaming the doctors when the NHS is created, could it be because the doctors moaned like old boots about the creation of the NHS? The national insurance scheme didn't even cover healthcare - it was unemployment and pensions insurance.\n \n The PFI scheme was not an admission that the public sector couldn't fund capital projects, it was part of a dogma of marketisation that has been pursued since the 80s, these schemes are actually more expensive that public funding in the long term, come with horrendous strings attached (I recommend George Monbiot's book, Captive State, for the history of this) and are simply a way of funneling money into private hands. The first PFI project (a bridge to the Isle of Skye) cost more upfront than the government hiring a contractor would, and left the islanders with huge tolls to pay into the bargain. The contract has now been bought out after more than a decade of protests. The other benefit to the government of the PFI scheme is that it meant debt for capital projects was kept \"off balance sheet\" and only the annual costs were recorded.\n \n The NHS is far more efficient than the private sector. The article mention the NHS not building any more hospitals until the 60s (haven't been able to verify that), but possibly part of the reason is more efficient use of resources. Certainly today the private sector has bed occupancy below 50%, while the NHS managed above 90%.",

They propose comprehensive national health insurance as a solution. A reexamination of their data suggests that medical bills are a contributing factor in just 17 percent of personal bankruptcies and that those affected tend to have incomes closer to poverty level than to middle class. Moreover, for national health insurance to have an impact, it would have to define \"medical\" expenses in a much broader way than is now typical of either private or government-funded plans. \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n The great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie-deliberate, contrived and dishonest-but the myth: persistent, persuasive and unrealistic.\n -President John F.

Anxious to erase the headline that three-quarters of U.S. medical bankrupts had health insurance at the onset of their illnesses and the resulting spotlight on inadequate coverage and insurance cancellation practices, they ignore most of our data and misrepresent the rest. They dismiss families' explanations of their difficulties and blame those ruined by illness for their own problems. However, the data from the bankruptcy courts are undeniable.

So it isn't like you can just walk up to a cabinet and pull out what you need you have procedures to follow and signatures to get before you can get them then log and verification. The reason he couldn't process his meds is that his liver was failing.

If they did then the hospitals hands are tied and they have to be released. There is no way a person can be held against their will unless they are a danger to themselves or others.

   "According to this graph, people in the United States have a lower life expectancy than people in Canada. Canada has a socialized healthcare system, whereas the United States has some socialized medicine (Medicare) but is more based on private healthcare. One can easily come to the conclusion that because the life expectancy is higher in Canada, their healthcare system is better. But this conclusion would only be valid if all other variables would be removed. If Canada and the United States were identical in every way other than the healthcare system, then that conclusion could be valid. But that is clearly not the case.\n \n United States: In the year 2004 33.2% of all adults aged 18 and older were obese.\n Canada: In the year 2004 23.1% of all adults aged 18 and older were obese.\n Therefore the USA has 1.4 times more obese people than Canada.\n \n Obesity increases risks for diseases and can often lead to death. People are more obese in the United States not because of the healthcare system but because of poor eating habits and exposure to more unhealthy food.\n \n Another reason why socialized healthcare will not succeed well in the US is because of the population size of the country. Canada has a population of 33,212,696 people. The United states has a population of 306,116,427. We have over nine times the amount of people living in the United States than those living in Canada. We cannot support socialized medicine with such a great population without significantly increasing taxes for everyone. In Canada, products are taxed more to pay for healthcare. It is not as simple as getting a health bill added to taxes. Other forms of taxation could be increased to support the healthcare, and the economy would suffer from it.\n \n Socialized healthcare is one of those theories that is completely good, moral, and great-sounding in intent, but bound to fail and costly in practice.",

   "I am going to say that the fact we had to institute wage controls because they were rising so quickly during a time of 90% taxation proves pretty conclusively that, as it has been since the dawn of time, wages are based on labor supply and demand, not taxation level.\n\n Wrong. Trigger has already stated why, but let me add another piece of information. Wealthy people being taxed at such high rates during that time would not pay the taxes. They would hire lawyers (doing so would be cheaper than paying the taxes) who would find deductions for almost anything, significantly lowering the amount of taxes paid by a large number. During the war there was no limit to the deductions, and often the rich hardly paid any taxes at all. Lawyers, on the other hand, were making more money by providing their service. Once the taxes are lowered to a certain point, the rich would realize hiring a lawyer would not be worth it, and they would actually give to the government more money under a lower tax rate than under a higher one.\n \n Supply in demand works more for the cost of products, not the wages of workers. Why do poorer people not start up a business and hire people? They don't have money to do so. If the rich are taxed enough they too will have less money and won't be able to hire as many workers.\n \n \nSince per capita health care costs are much lower under socialized systems, that logic is severely flawed.\n\n Health care costs are paid often through heavy sales tax, property tax, or other taxes. Like I said earlier, it is not like an electricity bill. You are not simply sent a bill for healthcare through taxes, it is much more complex than that.",

The hospital told him he needs $350K up front to get his name on the waiting list.\n \n That's a death sentence.\n \n Please also no more bleating about health care being rationed under a single payer system. \n \n The ugly truth is that the cruelest form of rationing is already in effect, rationing according to ability to pay which is, of course, just the way the fat cats in the USA want it.\n \n Under the current system, the only thing that gets healthy is the insurance companies' bottom line.emoticon_mad\n \n Tort reform is another strawman. 90+% of all cases are either dismissed or result in a jury verdict in favor of the provider.\n \n Any more right wing talking points you want to see destroyed?emoticon_xclown\n \n BTW, is the Spell Check feature disabled on your computer?",
