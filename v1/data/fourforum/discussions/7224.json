   "Allowing those behaviors which God finds offensive and for which he may bring judgment on a people or nation is very dangerous too. But there's a fine balance there, which is what reasonable people can debate.\n\n \n A couple of interesting things for reasonable people to debate here.\n \n First, there are the theological implications of god finding particular human behaviours offensive. We are offended by actions or statements which transgress our notions of what is proper. (Looking at humanity en masse, almost any human action will be deemed offensive in some society or other: whatever you do, don't publicly blow your nose in Japan.) But to define limits on what is proper is to define limits on one's own freedom of action. How can this be true of god?\n \n Second, there's the question of 'bringing judgment on a people or nation'. Nations are defined by humans, often quite arbitrarily. Thirty years ago there was a nation called Yugoslavia. If god had been outraged in 1976 by the behaviour of the citizens of Belgrade, would he then have smitten all Yugoslavs? Would he now smite only Serbs? Or should we regard the biblical use of 'nation' as really equivalent to 'tribe'? In which case, what bearing does it have on modern nation-states? The obvious answer is 'none', but EZ keeps referring to 'nations' (he seems to mean the US) risking god's wrath if they legitimise behaviour it finds offensive (see above).",

I must also say I've never heard of Mithras' death and resurrection: he ascends to heaven but I cannot find a death. The virgin story is sometimes reported, but so is birth from a rock: the main similarity is in the sacraments, which are identical and which some early Christians seemed to accept as being in Mithraism earlier (albeit planted by the Devil to lead people astray). As our earliest knowledge of Mithraism is post 100 AD we cannot be sure who stole what from who.\n\n \n The resurrection of Krishna predates them both, and most religious historians think that the idea of the \"resurrected savior\" is older than that still. It is a theme common to many less well known religions too, as is virgin birth, etc.\n There is a controversial theory that during his teenage and young adult years, Jesus was in India studying religion. While there is scant historical evidence for this (or for his existence, period), the glaring similarities between many of Jesus' \"ideas\" and those from older Hindu texts cannot be ignored, particularly his core teachings within the Sermon on the Mount. In modern parlance we would accuse him of cutting and pasting.",

If the accounts in the Bible are correct, the time of Jesus birth would have been closer to mid-summer, for this is when shepherds would have been \"tending their flocks in the field\" and the new lambs were born. Strange enough there is an ancient pagan religion, Mithraism, which dates back over 2,800 years that also celebrated the birth of their \"savior\" on that date. Many elements in the story of Jesus' life and birth are either coincidental or borrowings \n \n <snip< http://www.vetssweatshop.net/dogma.htm\n \n \nMithra or Mitra is even worshipped as Itu (Mitra-Mitu-Itu) in every house of the Hindus in India. Itu (derivative of Mitu or Mitra) is considered as the Vegetation-deity. This Mithra or Mitra (Sun-God) is believed to be a Mediator between God and man, between the Sky and the Earth. It is said that Mithra or [the] Sun took birth in the Cave on December 25th. It is also the belief of the Christian world that Mithra or the Sun-God was born of [a] Virgin. He travelled far and wide. He has twelve satellites, which are taken as the Sun's disciples.... [The Sun's] great festivals are observed in the Winter Solstice and the Vernal Equinox--Christmas and Easter. His symbol is the Lamb....\n\n <snip< http://www.truthbeknown.com/mithra.htm\n \n \nAs our earliest knowledge of Mithraism is post 100 AD we cannot be sure who stole what from who.\n\n \n \n \nIn Persia Mithra was the protector God of the tribal society until the Zoroaster's reformation of Persian polytheism (628-55BC). Mithra like the rest of the gods and goddess of the Iranian Pantheon was stripped of his sovereignty, and all his powers and attributes were bestowed upon Zarathustra. \n <snip< http://www.crystalinks.com/mithra.html",

Apparently it was a successful combination.\n\n \n How did the comparison with Mithra start? Did it start by the Jewish scholars who lived at the same time and would have known about these religions and were themselves trying to discredit Jesus? No, it started with an Islamic writer named Yousuf Saleem Chishti, in his book, What is Christianity. This book is available by the way in a classics edition from Islamic booksellers. He wrote in this book on pages 87-88, \"Mithra was considered the son of God, he was a savior, he was born of a virgin, he had twelve disciples, he was crucified, he rose from the grave the third day, he atoned for the sins of humankind, and he returned to his father in heaven.\" \n \n Where did he get this information? No one knows, he listed no sources, and none have been found. However that didn't stop a writer in the late 1800s and early 1900s named Gerald Massey from using Chishti as his source for the same information.\n \n What is interesting is the way that others have built on Chishti's initial claims. The really bizarre claim added to Chishti's by later writers is that of Mithra supposedly being born on December 25. You see this is mentioned nowhere in the bible about Christ, but was chosen by the early church with no claims to being Jesus' actual birth date. \n \n What do we know about the Mithra cult? I quote from scholar Ronald Nash in Christianity and the Hellenistic World, \" We do know that Mithraism, like its mystery competitors, had a basic myth. Mithra was supposedly born when he emerged from a rock; he was carrying a knife and torch and wearing a Phrygian cap. He battled first with the sun and then with a primeval bull, thought to be the first act of creation. Mithra slew the bull, which then became the ground of life for the human race.\" Nash and other scholars are unanimous in their conclusions that the so-called \"simularities\" between Mithra and Christ are not found prior to the advent of Christianity and the birth of Jesus. It was only after Christianity became established that pagan influences merged with and borrowed from Christianity to come up with the alleged simularities previously mentioned in this post.

   "A theory is just a model that accurately and repeatedly describes our observations of a physical system. Asking whether they are \"true\" or \"false\" is meaningless, either the theory can be shown to be accurate by experimentation or it can't.\n \n Long-standing scientific theories can pretty much be assumed to be \"true\", but not in a literal sense because as time goes on new theories may be proposed which describe these phenomena more accurately.\n The perfect example is Einstein's General Relativity, which among many other things described the orbits of the planets to a greater degree of accuracy than Newton's laws of motion. However Newton's laws can still be used on a small scale as they are so accurate it makes little difference.\n \n Today, at the cutting edge of physics there are lots of different theories being investigated to try and explain the structure of the universe on the scale of the very large and the incredibly small. Asking which one is true is meaningless, whichever proves to be the most accurate in time will be accepted until enough data can be accumulated to refine it further or, if necessary, discard it.\n \n Religion, however, has no proof, has no self-regulating system, is not based on repeatable observation and empirical evidence, and is very very old.\n \n Your question is essentially meaningless, because one of the important features of the scientific method is that by its very nature it allows for multiple viewpoints until enough research and experimentation has been done that we can home in on the most accurate description of phenomena.",

   "For example, we might ask, what would an inspired Bible look like as opposed to one that is uninspired? One might suppose that a divinely inspired Bible would be perfect, unambiguous, timeless, free of error, trivia, duplication, or contradiction, and not subject to misinterpretation. Any such attempt at determination would, of necessity, be almost entirely subjective.\nYou're assuming that we can divide easily into meaningful and trivial writings, when the apparently 'trivial' often adds context and enrichens the perspective. Also, the problem with saying an inspired Bible would not be subject to misinterpretation is that it assumes the way the universe works at a metaphysical level can be easily and straightforwardly expressed. If you look at how science is presented to the young, you will find simplifications and indeed lies (the structure of the atom, Newton's Laws of Motion). The Bible is not trying to be a scientific textbook, but to communicate primarily active, ethical and salvific truth.\n \n \nThe main thing that convinced me when I was very young that all the organised religions are purely human constructs was simply that there is more than one of them. That was all I needed to know.\nThis is one reaction, but another is that all are somehow related to the right one: either less perfect versions or imitations created by the devil (although if you've reached this point of free-thinking the latter may seem less likely). And then of course there is the idea that ALL religions are imperfect reactions to some fundamental truth of human experience, a consciousness of the divine. \n \n \nIdeally, I'd prefer to seperate children from religion until they are old enough to look at it objectively. I honestly believe that within a single generation, rates of those who genuinely believe would drop from the oft quoted 80% to perhaps 2%. In reality, I know this is impossible.\nThe problem is, you cannot simply seperate them from religion, you inevitably have to have an answer to certain questions, and they are indoctrinated to an atheist position. I also think that the problem with those who accept inerrancy is either lack of education or enthusiasm, and it is often found in converts rather than those brought up as Christian. I was brought up in a fairly secular household, but others I know were brought up in quite liberal Christian households and there is little difference. In fact, I think by making someone part of a religious community from a young age you give them that option later in life.",

One might suppose that a divinely inspired Bible would be perfect, unambiguous, timeless, free of error, trivia, duplication, or contradiction, and not subject to misinterpretation. Any such attempt at determination would, of necessity, be almost entirely subjective.\n \n \nYou're assuming that we can divide easily into meaningful and trivial writings, when the apparently 'trivial' often adds context and enrichens the perspective.\n\n \n Let me give you an example...\n \n Det 23:10-11 If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp: But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash himself with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp again.\n \n Perhaps I'm dense, but I'm unable to find any spiritual insight or inspiration here.

   "One could argue that one of the effects of punishment is to rewire the brain, so that when the person is exposed to the same stimuli in the future they will react differently.\n\n \n The problem is that Tollman and others have shown that to not be true. They showed that what punishment did was not to rewire the brain so that that choice is never made again but rather to delay that response until such time as threat of punishment is removed. \n \n Reward is found to be a much more powerful motivator. Tollman proved in 1983 place learning occured in rats. A rat could learn different situations depending on the location. It could learn to react one way in one type of maze (short walls) and another way in another type of maze (tall walls) where the height of the wall did not figure into the choice offered the rat. Others have shown this to be true of humans as well. \n \n One would have to give me some really could psychology studies to show that ALL choices are HARDwired as opposed to actual choice. There is no real body of evidence to support the idea that choices are hardwired by genetics and environment. Certainly they play into it, but there is adequate proof in animals alone that choice occurs. I would think humans more capable of choice than the average rat.\n \n EF",

   "DamEtel: Indeed, Christians do see death as no biggie, and this view of theirs allows them - unlike atheists - to come up with notion of \"Kill them all, and let God sort them out\". Not only does it explain how a Pope could come up with such a grossly immoral command, but also how his command to slaughter innocent men, women, and children could be carried out by his subjects without their giving it much concern. Yes, Christianity can be used - and in fact has been used - to rationalize and justify the mass murder of many thousands of innocent men, women, and children. \n\n \n \nObvious Child: Lack of a belief in afterlife can also make death seem unimportant.\n\n \n No, it doesn't. Lack of belief in an afterlife makes death FINAL. It is the absolute ending of a life. There is no possibility of a great reward waiting on the other side. Hell, in Christiainity, THIS bodily life is a mere instant: it is the COMING life that is all important. People are even told to accept suffering and pain in THIS life in expectation of rewards in the (hypothetical) NEXT life. Christianity is all about the NEXT life, not THIS one.\n \n PS: IIRC, when I was a child in a Baptist church up in Delaware, we sang a hymn with these lyrics: \n \n \nFor me to live is Christ, to die is gain.\n To know his words, and walk his narrow lane.\n There's no peace no joy no thrill\n Like walking in God's will.\n For me to live is Christ, to die is gain.\n\n \n I even remember as a child, me and others wondering why, if moving on into the next life is such a gain, why we don't just end our current miserable life and get to wonderous heavenily afterlife sooner. \n \n \n \nObvious Child: The Epic of Gilgamesh has one character say to the other: mankind lives only for a short span and then dissolves. Why avoid or fear the inevitable death? It is better to be remembered for fighting the great monster etc. etc.\n\n \n Again, you've provided no quotes, just your own personal statements and take on matters.\n \n But note that even in your personal formulation, it doesn't say that death is no biggie: it says that as long as you are goint to die anyway, you might as well make your death count. \n \n That's a completely different picture than a Pope saying to effect, \"kill them all and let God sort them out.\", commanding the mass murder of thousands of innocent men, women, and children.

Note my explicit use of the word ESSENTIALLY in my original statement. \n \n That addition of ESSENTIALLY, which changes the meaning of the statement, really should have stood out like a sore thumb. Why do you think that word was purposely put in there? To make the sentence longer?!?!?! No, there was a good reason: it makes the statement more accurate.\n \n There is a difference between \"There are no common beliefs...\" and \"There are essentially no common beliefs...\" The first is a hard, blanket statement whereas the second is a qualified, softened statement. It is the second that you need to address.\n \n PS: There is another word in there that could matter: BELIEFS. I won't get into that now since the above (about ESSENTIALLY) makes my current point, but for future discussion, I 'reserve the right' to rely upon the wordchoice BELIEF.\nThe word 'essentially' is very vague in how it qualifies. It suggests that 'at essence' there are no common beliefs: i.e. there may be ones but because of chance or whatever, there's no essential commonality.\n \n \nMere hearsay.\nAs, of course, is your claim. \n \n \nAnd the least you need to do is provide the logic the alleged atheists you claim to know used to arrive at your asserted position of theirs.\nI never claimed they were logical.

That shows that atheists do base their view of humans on God or divine revelation, and/or that atheists don't view humans as being 'at the top of nature' - AS I DESCRIBED IT? Absent. The usual state of supporting evidence coming from you.\nEssentially, there are two problems. You identify humans as top because 'we are the only [LIVING] thing known that could destroy the Earth, the only thing known to contemplate the past and future, and so on.'\n First, some people would dispute the incapability of higher animals to contemplate past and future. they might also argue humans couldn't destroy the Earth.\n \n Secondly, you arbitarily choose destructiveness and consciousness of time as signs of being at the 'top' of nature. As Douglas Adams has it: humans think they're more intelligent because they've created war, NYC etc, while all dolphins do is much around in the water and have fun. Dolphins think they're more intelligent for precisely the same reasons. Basically, we attribute 'top' status on the basis that what we have must be best: hopelessly anthropic.\n \n \nPS: Possibly a better formulation of atheism and belief (though still not an official one). \n \n About the only \"belief\" atheists share is their DISBELIEF in God(s). Atheists don't have a set of core beliefs that make up their \"religion\": there is no atheist Bible that we all read and have to follow its teachings; we don't go to atheist church and have a \"minister\" tell us how he thinks we are supposed to live our lives or what he thinks is moral and immoral, based on his interpretation of the Bible.

Firstly, it is obvious not all religions share a single Bible or church. Secondly, not all religions have core beliefs that tie everyone together: there are often Wittgenstenian family resemblances more than anything else. Indeed, 'religious' covers more variety and free thought than 'atheism': there is not a single shared belief for the religious, even the belief in God(s).",

And, atheists see death as final, and thus, bad. Definitely bad. In atheism, there's no assumed afterlife to help justify killing someone's body: in Christianity, there is.\n \n\n \n I have to say I just don't agree with this. I'm not 100% atheistic in outlook, but I certainly don't subscribe to a religion as you may have guessed from my posts(!) and I doubt that if there is a 'higher intelligence' or whatever, that it has much interest in us, individually or collectively.\n OK, that stated, I certainly don't see humans as being at the 'top' of nature by any qualification, I'm not even sure what that means. We are just another species trapped in the same ecosystem as all the others, obviously there are things that make us 'more unique' than other species, but I just don't see nature as having a 'top', let alone us being it. \n Sharks and crocodiles have been around for much longer than us, something like 300 million years, so these two species can certainly be seen as being more evolutionarily 'successful' than us, and we are no match for them in their own environment without a great deal of resources and effort being expended. So if I were to name any species as being at the 'top' of nature, it would have to be either sharks or crocodiles.\n As another example, bacteria are extraordinarly successful; they have been around since practically the beginning of life, they multiply incredibly quickly and efficiently, they can survive in all kinds of environments, and for example if we had a nuclear apocalypse or a massive meteor impact, they can lie dormant for eons and begin replicating again when conditions are right. \n As for the afterlife argument, again I don't see how being an atheist automatically makes you totally reject the possibility of another form of existence after the physical. I'm not talking spiritualist mumbo-jumbo here, I just mean that it's one of those things we don't, and cannot, know. Advances in science are showing the universe to be a seriously weird place that contradicts our intuition wherever we look, so the idea that it might be perfectly natural for consciousness to carry on an independent existence after death is not just ruled out by the abscence of God. We don't even know what consciousness is or how it works, so saying it just ends when the body dies is an assumption, pure and simple.",

   "DamEtel: Now, the fact is that - contrary to your incorrect assertion - the atheistic view, which is not based on God or divine revelation, is that humans are at the top of nature - we are the only thing known that could destroy the Earth, the only thing known to contemplate the past and future, and so on. And, atheists see death as final, and thus, bad. Definitely bad. In atheism, there's no assumed afterlife to help justify killing someone's body: in Christianity, there is.\n\n \n \nLiminus: I certainly don't see humans as being at the 'top' of nature by any qualification, I'm not even sure what that means.\n\n \n Really? So you can't read English either? Damn, there's an epidemic around here!\n \n I gave some examples of how I was using the phrase. \n \n 1) We humans are the only living things known capable of destroying the Earth: that puts us on the top of all living things as far as power goes.\n \n 2) We humans are the only thing things known - living or nonliving - that contemplate the past and the future: that puts us on the top of all things in regards to mental capabilities (ignoring JPSartre12's desire to be overly concerned with irrelevant minutia, we all know this to be true: I could have put in more detail, such as humans deriving general relativity, quantum mechanics, and so on, whereas a dog or cat or rock will never even be able to understand these things, let alone come up with them. But I thought people would try to understand my point, instead of trying so hard to NOT understand it.).\n \n \n \n It is true that at 'less important' things humans are inferior to some other things. Some examples:\n \n 1) A dog's ability to smell is better than ours, but I doubt one would therefore conclude that dogs are above us. They never came up with relativity or computers; they are our 'slaves', not the other way around; and so on.\n \n \n \n \n Oh wait, to appease the anal retentive and ridiculous claims of JPSartre12, I guess I have to say something like this;\n \n 1) When considering dogs with smelling faculties that are operating at what is generally considered to be normal for a dog, as determined based on experimentation on a large number of dogs and then determining statistical relationships in the values, and comparing said normally operating dog faculty with the same faculty in humans - that is, humans who also have what is considered to be normal capabilities for the said faculty being compared, as also determined by the performing of multiple experiments, collecting data, and analyzing said data statistically - it is generally true that the dog's faculty of smelling is considered to be superior to that of humans, in that, dogs can smell 'fainter odors' than can humans, in that, it requires fewer particles of a substance to be present in the air before detection of said particles can be accomplished by the nose - or smelling apparatus - of a dog than is the case for a human.\n \n But hey, even then I'm sure JPSartre12 would find something \"grossly\" wrong with it! In other words, if JPSartre12 has it out for you, there's NOTHING you can say that s/he'll accept as being correct. S/he'll nitpick you to death over irrelevant matters: straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel, so to speak.\n \n \n \n 2) Eagles have better eyesight than humans, but one would not likely therefore consider eagles to be at the top. When did an eagle ever program a computer, play a game of chess, blow up an enemy city? And we humans have the power to destroy eagles - and virtually all other life - not the other way around. \n \n 3) Bacteria have the potential to kill all humans, but that's about it (and, we have the power to kill them too). We sure can't say that they've mastered mathematics, or that they have sent themselves to the moon, and so on. Nor does their power extend past disease: they don't have thermonuclear weapons or bombs or missiles and so on - they don't have the power to destroy inanimate objects the way humans do.\n \n 4) The sun puts out much more energy than humans can, but the sun can't write a poem, or read a book, or contemplate getting a college degree, and so on. And the sun is powerless to control its state: while humans can CONTROL where and when a thermonuclear reaction will occur, the sun can't do the same thing. The sun also can't change its own future: it's essentially just an enormous helpless, dumb thermonuclear powerplant 'adrift' in space.\n \n \n \n Nature is made up of living and nonliving things. \n \n 1) Inanimate: All known inanimate stuff is 'dumb': it all lacks thought processes and intelligence. We humans surely have the edge in intelligence over everything known that is inanimate. We also have the edge in many other ways, such as being able to change our future (i.e., we can MOVE ourselves somewhere else if we desire, unlike inanimate objects). And we have the power to destroy most inanimate things which we come into contact with, whereas only a few inanimate things have the power to destroy us (asteroids, for example).\n \n Oh, perhaps I should be more precise before JPSartre12 thinks he's found another imagined \"fatal flaw\" in my logic: before he takes a subatomic anthill and pretends it's Mt. Everest. The only inanimate things that are known to posses any degree of 'intelligence' are computers (and computerized robotics), but that is intelligence by proxy. WE HUMANS built them and infused them with their \"intelligence\". And, we can simply turn them off (at least for now!) any time we please, and they are reliant upon us for their functioning.\n \n \n 2) Living: As far as known living things, we are at the top in terms of technology, intelligence, and power: the more key factors. We are the 'masters' of the living world (for 'power', there's the possible exception of bacteria, but then, as I already pointed out, they can't compare to our intelligence and technology).\n \n \n \n \nLiminus: Sharks and crocodiles have been around for much longer than us, something like 300 million years, so these two species can certainly be seen as being more evolutionarily 'successful' than us, \n\n \n Okay, but show me a shark or crocodile that can blow up the world. Show me a shark or crocodile that can create a computer. Show me a shark or crocodile that can play a game of chess. Show me a shark or crocodile that can gather a team together to figure how to rocket to the moon, and then achieve their goal. And so on. \n \n Also, we humans were on the brink of completely wiping out some species of shark in certain areas: I've never heard of the opposite being true. \n \n And going one step farther, if we wanted to, we could end both the shark's and the crocodile's long history here on the planet: they can't do the same to us.\n \n \nLiminus: ... and we are no match for them in their own environment without a great deal of resources and effort being expended.\n\n \n I'll go up against a crocodile any day: just give me a rifle - you know, one of the many things the superior human intellect was able to build, that (even if it wasn't it's main intent) increasing our 'standing' in nature.\n \n \nLiminus: So if I were to name any species as being at the 'top' of nature, it would have to be either sharks or crocodiles.\n\n \n And I'd have to strongly disagree with you. You gave only 1 reason to possibly believe that, and it doesn't seem like a good one at that.\n \n \nLiminus: As another example, bacteria are extraordinarly successful; they have been around since practically the beginning of life, they multiply incredibly quickly and efficiently, they can survive in all kinds of environments, and for example if we had a nuclear apocalypse or a massive meteor impact, they can lie dormant for eons and begin replicating again when conditions are right. \n\n \n There are problems with that. \n \n First, you aren't talking about a type of organism, you are talking about an entire DOMAIN. That's comparing apples and oranges!\n \n For example, you aren't talking about a single species of bacteria that can live under all of those widely different conditions, but rather MANY DIFFERENT species of bacteria. You're trying to compare my single species - humans - to potentially millions of different species - bacteria: that's \"cheating\".\n \n Also, we have technology: they don't. We have intelligence: they don't. When's the last time a bacterium programmed a computer, or chatted on the internet, or investigated world history, or built a spaceship to send itself to another body in the solar system, or contemplated ways to destroy and asteroid heading for Earth, or decided to take charge of its life and change its behaviors, or debated another bacterium, or tried to reason to what it meant to live the good life, or ...?\n \n All in all, in the more key characteristics - intelligence, technology, and power - we humans come out on top.\n \n \n PS: I should also point out the CONTEXT of my statements. I was comparing the Christian/theistic view of humans with the atheist view. In the Christian view, there are several things above us: the main one is God. We humans are LOWLY according Christians, because there is a God we are compared to (there is not one good, no not one; all our works are as dirty rags; and so on ... oh, those are off the top of my head, so they are probably not exact quotes). In atheism, there is no God or gods. That alone elevates the standing of humans. That's actually good enough for me. Wheras Christianity says we humans are 'lowly' because it compares us to a suppose all-knowing, all-loving, all-powerful being; atheism doesn't hold this 'lowly' view of humans.",

   "This is kinda my point\n \n As for the afterlife: it is not present in all theisitic systems (early Judaism for instance), and is present in certain atheistic systems (Therevada Buddhism).\n\n \n Is the 23rd Psalm early enough for you?

Or how about the following:\n \n Jewish Rabbis, etc., on the Afterlife, the Resurrection, and Hell\n \n Reward & Punishment:\n \n What do the Rabbis teach about the concept of the good being rewarded and the evil being punished? What does that entail? Is it similar to what Christians believe? Is there such a thing as \"eternal hell\" in the Jewish Faith??\n \n Answer:\n One of the basic principles of Judaism is that God rewards those who obey His commands and punishes those who disobey. The primary place for both reward and punishment is the afterlife. It is, of course, nearly impossible for us to have any real idea what the actual nature of this reward and punishment is like. While I suspect that the basic idea is similar to that of Christianity, there are probably some important differences. I am not familiar, in any detail, with Christian theology on this point.\n <b<Regarding \"eternal hell\", the Talmud teaches us that sinners are released from Hell (Gehinnom in Hebrew) after 12 months (Eduyos 2:10).

Gan Eden (which translates as \"The Garden of Eden\" since it's the spiritual counterpart of the earthly Garden depicted in Genesis) is where the soul delights in G-d. And Gehenom (which is usually taken to be \"hell\" but is actually different) is where the soul suffers the consequences of its misdeeds.\n \n Understand of course that the consequences the soul suffers in Gehenom are spiritual in nature. After all, the body is buried in the ground, so anything that happens after death is non-physical. The sort of \"pain\" the soul suffers in Gehenom can best be depicted as an existential anguish and mortal discomfit brought on by catching sight of oneself for the first time. \n \n http://www.torah.org/learning/ramchal/classes/class47.html\n \n Rabbis Meir and Levi - Afterlife in the Torah\n \n \n Rabbi Meir said: Where can we see that resurrection is derived from the Torah? In the passage: \"Then will Moses and the children of Israel sing this song to the Lord [Exodus 15:1]. It does not say \"sang\" but rather \"will sing\". Therefore, resurrection is deducible from the Torah. Again, Rabbi Joshua b. Levi asked: \"Where can we see that resurrection is derived from the Torah? In the passage Happy are those who dwell in Your house, they will be still praising you [Psalm 84:5]; it is not stated \"they have praised You\" but rather \"will be praising You\"; therefore, resurrection is derived from the Torah [i.e. Psalms].

We don't. \n Now you can scoff all you like about my having no evidence to support this, but I'm not trying to convince you of anything, it's just my overactive imagination, and I only brought it up as an example that not all non-religious people have total certainty that there is absolutely nothing after death, which was your unsupported assertion.",

When about to lay siege to the French city of Beziers, the Bishop was asked how the crusaders would be able to tell the good Catholics from the heretics, his reply was, in effect, \"Neca eos omnes. Deus suos agnoset\" (\"Kill them all, God will know his own.\") This is the origin of today's \"Kill them all, let God sort them out\" phrase.

   "Is the 23rd Psalm early enough for you? Or Daniel 12:2? Or how about the following:\n \n Jewish Rabbis, etc., on the Afterlife, the Resurrection, and Hell\n \n Reward & Punishment:\n \n What do the Rabbis teach about the concept of the good being rewarded and the evil being punished? What does that entail? Is it similar to what Christians believe? Is there such a thing as \"eternal hell\" in the Jewish Faith??\n \n Answer:\n One of the basic principles of Judaism is that God rewards those who obey His commands and punishes those who disobey. The primary place for both reward and punishment is the afterlife. It is, of course, nearly impossible for us to have any real idea what the actual nature of this reward and punishment is like. While I suspect that the basic idea is similar to that of Christianity, there are probably some important differences. I am not familiar, in any detail, with Christian theology on this point.\n <b<Regarding \"eternal hell\", the Talmud teaches us that sinners are released from Hell (Gehinnom in Hebrew) after 12 months (Eduyos 2:10). There are, however, some exceptions to this rule in cases of extreme wickedness where the punishment is truly eternal (Talmud Rosh HaShana 17a).</b<\n \n http://members.aol.com/lazera/archive/belief.html\n \n \n From Rabbi Yaakov Feldman (Torah.org)\n \n There are two facets of the afterlife: \"Gan Eden\", and \"Gehenom\". Gan Eden (which translates as \"The Garden of Eden\" since it's the spiritual counterpart of the earthly Garden depicted in Genesis) is where the soul delights in G-d. And Gehenom (which is usually taken to be \"hell\" but is actually different) is where the soul suffers the consequences of its misdeeds.\n \n Understand of course that the consequences the soul suffers in Gehenom are spiritual in nature. After all, the body is buried in the ground, so anything that happens after death is non-physical. The sort of \"pain\" the soul suffers in Gehenom can best be depicted as an existential anguish and mortal discomfit brought on by catching sight of oneself for the first time. \n \n http://www.torah.org/learning/ramchal/classes/class47.html\n \n Rabbis Meir and Levi - Afterlife in the Torah\n \n \n Rabbi Meir said: Where can we see that resurrection is derived from the Torah? In the passage: \"Then will Moses and the children of Israel sing this song to the Lord [Exodus 15:1]. It does not say \"sang\" but rather \"will sing\". Therefore, resurrection is deducible from the Torah. Again, Rabbi Joshua b. Levi asked: \"Where can we see that resurrection is derived from the Torah? In the passage Happy are those who dwell in Your house, they will be still praising you [Psalm 84:5]; it is not stated \"they have praised You\" but rather \"will be praising You\"; therefore, resurrection is derived from the Torah [i.e. Psalms]. [Babylonian Talmud, tractate Sanhedrin 91b]\n \n http://www.scheinerman.net/judaism/ideas/afterlife.html\n \n Heaven and Hell in Judaism\n \n \"Yes, there is a Jewish concept of heaven where we will all be together with God. Yes, there is a concept of Hell where those who have done evil things will be punished (for no more than 11 months maximum).\"\n \n http://www10.brinkster.com/butlerd/westjudFAQ.html\n \n Isaiah and Hell? \n \n Isaiah 14:9-17 seems to describe a conscious torment of those \n who are judged in Sheol, with other conscious beings there mocking them. It \n refers to maggots and worms (14:11).....Ezek 32:24,30 describes \"shame\" of the \n wicked judged, though it might be metaphorical. The common OT motif of \n being delivered from Sheol or the \"pit\" (e.g., 1 Sam 2:6, Ps 16:10, 71:20, \n Hos 13:14) implies that the righteous were conscious there, and so by \n extension, one might assume the wicked were also conscious, but not \n delivered.\n \n Samuel as a Spirit from the afterlife!\n \n The king said to her, \"Have no fear; what do you see?\" And the woman said to \n Saul, \"I see a god (elohim) coming up out of the earth.\" He said to her, \"What is \n his appearance?\" And she said, \"An old man wrapped in a robe.\" And Saul knew \n that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did \n obeisance. Then Samuel said to Saul, \"Why have you disturbed me by bringing \n me up?\" (I Sam. 28:13-15)\n \n Hell not a Christian Invention!\n \n \"...the first Rabbinic utterances come to us from the time immediately \n before that of Christ, from the Schools of Shammai and Hillel (Rosh haSh. 16 b last four lines, and 17 a).2 The former arranged all mankind into three classes: the perfectly righteous, who are 'immediately written and sealed to eternal life;' the perfectly wicked, who are 'immediately written and sealed to Gehenna;' and an intermediate class. 'who go down to Gehinnom, and moan, and come up again,' according to Zech. xiii. 9, and which seemed also indicated in certain words in the Song of Hannah (1 Sam. ii. 6). The careful reader will notice that this statement implies belief in Eternal Punishment on the partof the School of Shammai. For (1) The perfectly wicked are spoken of as 'written and sealed unto Gehenna;'\n \n http://ic.net/~erasmus/RAZ304.HTM\n \n \n Gehinnom (g'hee-NOHM); Gehenna (g'HEHN-uh) \n \n A place of spiritual punishment and/or purification for a period of up to 12 months after death. Gehinnom is the Hebrew name; Gehenna is Yiddish. \n \n \n http://www.barmitzvahs.org/dj/judaism/glossary.php\n \n Resurrection in the Torah\n \n Rabbi Simai says: How do we know that the resurrection of the dead can be derived from the Torah? From the verse, \"I also established My covenant with them [i.e., Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob], to give them the land of Canaan\" (Exod. 6: 4), \"To you\" is not written but \"to them.\" Hence, resurrection of the dead can be derived from the Torah (b. Sanh. 90b).\n \n http://www.ctinquiry.org/publications/reflections_volume_6/levenson.htm\n \n Rabbi Maimonedes - Afterlife in the Torah\n \n \"Resurrection of the dead is one of the fundamental\n principles in the Torah of our master Moses.\"\n \n http://www.joshuah.org/Steps/Articles/THIRTEEN%20ARTICLES%20OF%20FAITH.htm\n \n \n Afterlife in the Torah as Taught by Jesus\n \n \"Jesus replied, \"You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God. At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. But about the resurrection of the dead--have you not read what God said to you, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob' ? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.\" Matthew 22:29-32\n \n Obvious Child - no offense but you make a lot of these kinds of statements. I'd just ask if you'd please do some research first. God bless!\n\n \n \n When it comes to an aferlife, you will not find any single set of beliefs common amoung all jews. The afterlife is very non-defined, because the emphasis of the jewish faith is living THIS life. The concept that there might be 'eternal punishement' is very much a minority. The more common idea is that those souls that are unable to be 'purified' are granted oblivation after 1 year.. and no soul is kept in Ghenna for more than one year. Other sects of Judaism (some forms of hascidim for example), believe in reincarnation. \n \n It is the CHristian religion that is obcesses with the afterlife, not the Jewish one.",

(2Samuel 5:9, 2Samuel 5:11) It was in this same palace that, \"David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very beautiful... [and her name was] Bathsheba...\" (2Samuel 11:2, NIV)\n \n \"But one of the main clues in finding King David's palace,\" says Mazar, \"was surprisingly from the Bible itself.\" 2Samuel 5:17 states that: \"When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, they went up in full force to search for him, but David heard about it and went DOWN [from his palace] to the [citadel].\" (NIV, capitalization added for emphases) \n \n http://www.leaderu.com/theology/palacedavid.html\n\n \n Ah yes.. they found a building in Jerusualm that dates from teh proper time frame, and the conservative immediately jump to the conclusion it is the palace of King david.\n \n Right now, they don't even have evidence it was a palace at all.",

YOU CAN'T, BECAUSE I DIDN'T.\n \n You are STILL showing that you can't understand English. \n \n Look again at what I actually said there: NOWHERE in there do I say anything that ALL religions, and NOWHERE in there do I say anything about EACH religion. Get it?\n \n Here, since you have real trouble understanding English, let me try to teach you something. Consider this hypothetical exchange.\n \n \nDamEtel: Scientists study the origin of life. \n\n \n \nJPSartre12: No, not all scientists study the origin of life. \n\n \n \nDamEtel: And where did I say they all did? \n\n \n See? There is no mention of ALL scientists in my first statement. My first statement is correct. The problem lies with the other person STUFFING IN the idea of ALL where it does not belong! \n \n And then, once they've forced my statement to say something it doesn't, claiming that I am wrong. Nope, I am right; the other person is wrong.\n \n And then in comes you.\n \n \nLiminus: You said that each scientist studies the origin of life. \n\n \n \nDamEtel: NO I DIDN'T! Nowhere in there did I say that EACH scientist studies the origin of life. \n\n \n Now, see if you can follow the logic of these hypothetical exchanges. I don't know if you can, judging by your inability to understand English so far, but go ahead and give it a try anyway.\n \n IF you can manage to understand the above hypothetical example, then try applying what I've taught you about ALL, EACH, and unspecified numbers to the actual exchanges. You will see, just as I said, that I am right, and you and JPSartre12 are wrong.\n \n \n *********************************\n A few important points that came up since the above: these points shouldn't be forgotten, so I will repeat them also in each post on this matter.\n *********************************\n \n The fact that YOU, Liminus, could see no alternative except for ALL and EACH shows a shortcoming in YOUR mental abilities, not mine.\n \n Here are just a few alternatives to ALL you apparently didn't know exist.\n SOME\n MANY\n MOST\n FEW\n \n It's not my fault that your vocabulary and mental abilities are so limited.\n \n Besides, look at what you did. There is a way to 'interpret' my statement, without adding EACH or ALL to it, that keeps it correct. And there are ways of manipulating my statement, [i]BY STUFFING CONCEPTS SUCH AS ALL AND EACH INTO IT, that make it wrong. Which is the logical thing to do: (1) to leave it as is, where it makes sense, or (2) to go out of your way to manipulate it so that it ends up not making sense? The first, obviously. So which did you do? The second! The illogical one! No, make that the DOUBLY ILLOGICAL ONE!",

Atheists don't have a set of core beliefs that make up their \"religion\": there is no atheist Bible that we all read and have to follow its teachings; we don't go to atheist church and have a \"minister\" tell us how he thinks we are supposed to live our lives or what he thinks is moral and immoral, based on his interpretation of the Bible.

Firstly, it is obvious not all religions share a single Bible or church. Secondly, not all religions have core beliefs that tie everyone together: there are often Wittgenstenian family resemblances more than anything else. Indeed, 'religious' covers more variety and free thought than 'atheism': there is not a single shared belief for the religious, even the belief in God(s).\n\n \n 1) Nowhere did I say or even imply that ALL RELIGIONS SHARE A SINGLE BIBLE OR CHURCH. In fact, that would be a rather stupid thing to say. Thus, Obvious Child fabricated a ridiculous position, stuffed it into my mouth, then claimed that what \"I\" said was wrong.\n \n 2) I did NOT say the infamous ALL word: I did not say \"Unlike ALL religions, ...\"; it was Obvious Child who stuffed the concept of ALL into there, where it doesn't belong. Obvious Child forced ALL into my correct statement, making his distortion of my original incorrect, then pointed to his mangled version in order to claim that I was wrong.

Watch me now point out another of his errors, and him STILL not be able to see how he is wrong!\n \n \nDamEtel: \n \n *********************************\n Luminus: You were saying that each religion has its set of core beliefs that tie its particular believers together, JP was saying that not every religion is 100% coherently held together by such a set of all-encompassing beliefs. \n *********************************\n \n SHOW ME WHERE I SAID EACH RELIGION ... YOU CAN'T, BECAUSE I DIDN'T.\n \n You are STILL showing that you can't understand English. \n \n Look again at what I actually said there: NOWHERE in there do I say anything that ALL religions, and NOWHERE in there do I say anything about EACH religion. Get it?\n\n \n I mean, how much clearer can I be? It's not my fault that Liminus can't understand a simple English statement, even when his multiple errors are pointed out.\n \n My statements should have been enough, but I could see that Liminus just couldn't understand. So I tried an analogy (it often helps to use analogies to explain something to someone who can't grasp the actual discussion).\n \n \nDamEtel: Here, since you have real trouble understanding English, let me try to teach you something. Consider this hypothetical exchange.\n \n ***************************\n DamEtel: Scientists study the origin of life. \n ***************************\n \n \n ***************************\n Obvious Child: No, not all scientists study the origin of life. \n ***************************\n \n \n ***************************\n DamEtel: And where did I say they all did? \n ***************************\n \n \n See? There is no mention of ALL scientists in my first statement. My first statement is correct. The problem lies with the other person STUFFING IN the idea of ALL where it does not belong! \n \n And then, once they've force my statement to say something it doesn't, claiming that I am wrong. Nope, I am right; the other person is wrong.\n \n \n And then in comes you.\n \n \n ***************************\n Liminus: You said that each scientist studies the origin of life. \n ***************************\n \n ***************************\n DamEtel: NO I DIDN'T! Nowhere in there did I say that EACH scientist studies the origin of life. \n ***************************\n \n Now, see if you can follow the logic of these hypothetical exchanges. I don't know if you can, judging by your inability to understand English so far, but go ahead and give it a try anyway.\n \n IF you can manage to understand the above hypothetical example, then try applying what I've taught you about ALL, EACH, and unspecified numbers to the actual exchanges. You will see, just as I said, that I am right, and you and [Obvious Child] are wrong.\n\n \n Jeez Louise! You think ANYONE with half a brain would get it by now! But no, Liminus STILL can't figure it out! Just sit back and watch!\n \n \nLiminus: The reason I used the word 'each' was to clarify the fact that you obviously didn't mean \"all\" religions have the same core beliefs in common. [which has nothing at all to do with what I've been telling him - he is still incapable of understanding!]\n \n I actually at this point have no idea what you are so upset about.\n \n When you said \"Unlike religions...\", using the plural, you must have either been referring to \n \n **************************\n [Obvious Child] all \n **************************\n \n religions collectively sharing these values (which you obviously didn't), or you meant that individually, \n \n **************************\n Liminus: each \n **************************\n \n religion has its set of values that tie its believers together.\n\n \n Here we see Liminus's mental shortcomings. He is incapable of seeing that any other possibility exists. He even says that I MUST HAVE either meant a or b, completely oblivious to everything I've been telling him!\n \n And here's a neat little trick by him .. trying to blame me for his shortcomings!\n \n \nLiminus: If you didn't mean either of these things, then you weren't expressing yourself coherently. \n\n \n Oh no, I've been coherent. The breakdown in coherency is all on Liminus's side.\n \n But I try ONCE AGAIN to explain it all to him. \n \n \nDamEtel:\n \n *****************************\n DamEtel: SHOW ME WHERE I SAID EACH RELIGION ...

NO! NO!\n \n What I said was coherent. What YOU and Obvious Child did was STUFF INTO my statements concepts that did not belong in there, and then judge your distorted versions of my statement.\n \n Obvious Child's concept of ALL is not found in my original statement.\n \n Your concept of EACH is not found in my original statement.\n \n The problem is NOT my original statement, it is YOU and Obvious Child.\n\n \n And it is at this point - only after Liminus failed to read what I said - that I began posting the \"full story\" in my replies. I won't post it here again, now.\n \n \n \n \n Surely BY NOW Liminus has GOT to understand ... right? NO!!!\n \n \nLiminus: So what did you mean by \"Unlike religions, atheism has no core set of beliefs...\"?\n \n It's either \"Unlike all religions collectively...\"\n \n Or \"Unlike religions individually and within themselves...\" (the 'each' option)\n \n Just saying \"Unlike religions...\" is open to either interpretation.\n \n If there's some other use of the plural that I am unaware of, can you please enlighten me as to what you actually meant.\n\n \n I ALREADY HAD explained to him, MULTIPLE TIMES! But I gave it ANOTHER try!\n \n \nDamEtel:\n \n *********************************\n Liminus: So what did you mean by \"Unlike religions, atheism has no core set of beliefs...\"?\n \n It's either \"Unlike all religions collectively...\"\n \n Or \"Unlike religions individually and within themselves...\" (the 'each' option)\n *********************************\n \n \n \n DamEtel: Wrong. It doesn't have to mean one or other other of those. False dichotomy. \n \n \n \n *********************************\n Liminus: If there's some other use of the plural that I am unaware of, can you please enlighten me as to what you actually meant. \n *********************************\n \n \n DamEtel: I already have several times. I can lead the horse to water, but I can't make you drink. I can show you undeniable logic that shows you to be wrong, but if you are going to close your eyes and pretend it doesnt exist, there's nothing I can do except point out how childish you are being. And, try again.\n \n So here you go. Try reading it this time.\n \n [the long history of our exchanges, explaining why he is wrong, now posted for the third time! Is omitted here]\n \n\n \n \n Now, hold on to your seats ... this is truly amazing! Liminus FINALLY understands why he is wrong! \"And there was much rejoicing ... yeah\"\n \n BUT, instead of his admitting his error, he tries to turn things around.\n \n \nLiminus: Well, if you meant that an unspecified number of religions had, unlike atheism, a set of core beliefs , surely, given your extreme grammatical pedantry, you would have said\n \n \"Unlike some religions, atheism lacks a set of core beliefs...\"\n \n\n \n 1) FALSE: If I had meant ALL religions, then I would have said ALL religions ... but I didn't!\n \n 2) ILLOGICAL: Liminus is saying that I am so particular about everything I say, but this backfires on him: for if he really believes that, then he would be forced to conclude that if I meant ALL religions that I would have said ALL religions! \n \n Liminus has missed the point for the past \"umpteen\" exchanges, and when he finally sees his shortcoming, tries to blame me, using completely lame logic.\n \n \n \nLiminus: The fact that you didn't led to the ambiguous nature of your statement, leading to a misunderstanding in both directions between yourself and [Obvious Child], leading to this ridiculous argument.\n\n \n How childish. Let's look at the facts.\n \n 1) Liminus jumped into the discussion. HE took it upon himself to get involved.\n \n 2) Liminus started off in this discussion with errors.\n \n 3) For HOURS I pointed out how Liminus was wrong, but he didn't get it. Either he didn't bother reading what I wrote before he responded - that's a no no - or he's just, as Jesus would say, \"dull\".\n \n 4) Once Liminus FINALLY sees the simple facts he's been incapable of understanding throughout, he tries to blame me.\n \n \n Oh, Liminus keeps dragging this whole thing out for many more posts. I won't bother posting the rest as the above is sufficient.",

   "Let me expose more foolishness by Obvious Child.\n \n What does the normal person take the following to mean: \"There is essentially no milk in the refrigerator\". \n \n 1) DamEtel. This is a softened version of the statement \"There is no milk in the refrigerator\". This shortened version is 'hard': it's absolute: it indicates that if you go over and look in the refrigerator you will not find any milk. But by adding in the word 'essentially' the statement is 'softened': now, it indicates that if you go over to the refrigerator and look, you might find a glassful (or whatever) of milk in there.\n \n 2) Obvious Child. S/he would have us believe that the original statement instead means something like \"The essence of milk is to not be in the refrigerator\" or \"The essence of milk in the refrigerator is to not be\". Ridiculous.\n \n \n But it's even worse for Obvious Child. In the real \"debate\" it's about what is meant by a particular statement that also includes, as key, the word ESSENTIALLY. But it is not a statement made by an unknown third person: I MYSELF AM THE ONE WHO SAID THAT STATEMENT. So who gets to say what was meant? ME!\n \n There is NO debate about what it meant: it meant what I say it meant. Period. For Obvious Child to prevail he must show that what I myself explain the statement to say doesn't make sense, and that his alternative is the only or better way to take it. He can't do either. \n \n Okay, so my explanation of what my original statement meant makes perfect sense, Obvious Child's doesn't, and I am the ultimate authorigy on what I mean.

I read it as a jab at your use of the English language, but I could be wrong. \n The modifier \"essentially\" is \"essentially\" useless unless one has some cognitive frame of reference on which to evaluate its use.

But if it was used it would mean that if there was milk it was not a meaningful amount. You might say it if faced by an incredibly pedantic person: 'OK, there may be a few spilt drops, but there is essentially no milk'. The essential matter concerning milk is having a drinkable amount.

As well as contradictory,...\n\n \n You, Obvious Child, grossly distorted my statements, then obstinately stuck with your distortion despite the clearcut evidence against you. Regardless how you might have been guilty of originally for you distortion, at this point, after your continued sticking to the distortion, the best fit for the data is that you're doing nothing but lying*: that is, knowingly repeating untrue statements in an attempt to deceive. People should object to your unethical, dishonest actions.\n \n \n *Of course, if you've recently had a massive stroke that leaves you unable to think properly, then you wouldn't be lying.
