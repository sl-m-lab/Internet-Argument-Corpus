   "I'm definitley no economist nor am I a political scientist. That's why I'm asking if the policy know as \"starve-the-beast\" is intended to actually work.\n \n I've read a few articles on the subject, but I am still a bit fuzzy on the whole issue.\n \n I guess I should ask a few questions to see if I get answers and perhaps spark some debate.\n \n 1) Are the tax cuts that Republicans pushed through, and the record deficits that they seem to be complacent about, meant to begin the starving process?\n \n 2) When will the deficits reach such a point that cutting social programs is unstoppable?\n \n 3) How can the beast be starved when the beast becomes the military? I think military spending would be especially difficult for anyone in washington, especially Republicans, to give up, since they and their friends make so much money off it.\n \n Here are a few articles I've read recently to explain it.\n \n What it means - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve-the-beast\n \n an editorial - http://www.ndol.org/print.cfm?contentid=251788\n (something that stuck out from it:\n \nConservative Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.), chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, exemplifies the trend. \"I came to the House as a real deficit hawk, but I am no longer a deficit hawk,\" he told The Hill newspaper in February. \"I'll tell you why. I had to spend the surpluses. Deficits make it easier to say no.\"...\n \n It's clear the \"starve the beast\" theory offers Republicans the political equivalent of a bottomless crack pipe. Tax cuts no longer have to be rationalized by any particular theory of economic growth, efficiency, consistency, or fairness. Politicians are free to defend or extend corporate or other narrow tax subsidies; free to target tax cuts to their favored constituencies; and entirely free from the constraints normally supplied by budgetary arithmetic.\n\n \n opinion as starving the beast relates to SS, etc - http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0208-31.htm\n (something that stuck out: \nTo put that budget into perspective, let's look at the causes of the federal budget deficit. In spite of the expense of the Iraq war, federal spending as a share of G.D.P. isn't high by historical standards - in fact, it's slightly below its average over the past 20 years. But federal revenue as a share of G.D.P. has plunged to levels not seen since the 1950's.\n \n Almost all of this plunge came from a sharp decline in receipts from the personal income tax and the corporate profits tax. These are the taxes that fall primarily on people with high incomes - and in 2003 and 2004, their combined take as a share of G.D.P. was at its lowest level since 1942. On the other hand, the payroll tax, which is the main federal tax paid by middle-class and working-class Americans, remains at near-record levels.\n \n You might think, given these facts, that a plan to reduce the deficit would include major efforts to increase revenue, starting with a rollback of recent huge tax cuts for the wealthy. In fact, the budget contains new upper-income tax breaks. \n)\n \n some at the CATO Institute don't agree with the practice and think it doesn't work - http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v26n2/cpr-26n2-2.pdf\n (\nOne implication of this relation is that a tax increase may be the most effective policy to reduce the relative level of federal spending. On this issue, I would be pleased to be proven wrong. Second, acceptance of the \"starve the beast\" position has led too many conservatives and libertarians to be casual about the sustained political discipline necessary to control federal spending directly and to succumb to the fantasy that tax cuts will solve this problem. President George W. Bush, for example, has proposed and won the approval of most congressional Republicans for large increases in federal spending for agriculture, defense, education, homeland security, and Medicare, and he has yet to veto a single spending bill. As a consequence, real federal spending during the Bush administration is now growing at the fastest rate since the Johnson administration. And Congress has yet to act on the expensive energy and transportation bills or Bush's proposal for a base\n on the moon and manned exploration of Mars!\n)\n \n Well, what do you think?",
