We are talking about millions of people here. What for? \"My religion is the \"true\" religion! That's what for!\n \n Whether you believe in god or not, you cannot deny that civilization has suffered because of religion.\n\n \n A lot of those are about ethnicity and politics. You can't claim the holocaust was about religion because even Jews who were Christian converts or non-religious were still considered Jews. Hitler also killed 4 million others including gypsies, gays, the disabled, trade unionists, socialists, communists, Christians, and many others. \n \n Charles I was not a Catholic monarch (unless you believe the puritan's rumours), and his execution didn't permanently change the face of Europe, the protectorate was a minor experiment that saw the restoration in little more than a decade. It was by no means as simple as puritans vs anglicans either, there were puritans on both sides, it was in part about who ran the country. Sure, at the time, who ran the church was part of that, but to reduce it to \"my religion's better than yours\" is a ridiculous twisting of history. \n \n The conflict in Northern Ireland, while religion is involved, is largely about politics and history, there have been Catholic loyalists and protestant nationalists, and in fact Sinn Fein is marxist in ideology. The crux of the issue in Ireland is the settlement of a large number of Scots in Ulster, who took all the best land and forced the Irish peasants from it. Sure, the Scots were largely presbyterian and the Irish largely Catholic, but the real issue was land and wealth.\n \n I'm not sure what you're referring to in africa but, for example, the Rwandan genocide was a result of the imperial imposition of racial politics - the colonial power (belgium if memory serves) decides that some Rwandans were \"whiter\" than others, so should be in charge. This pseudo-ethnic distinction between minority tutsi and majority hutu groups and the resulting injustice of tutsi rule resulted in the genocide.\n \n The conflict in Sudan is not about religion either. Yes, the two sides are largely different religions, but it is difference, rather than religion, that is the motivating factor. The Muslims in the north are predominantly arab, the Christians in the south are mostly black. Separation and difference are the issue, not religion.",
