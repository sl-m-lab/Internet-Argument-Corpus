When ones values money over life we have a serious problem in this country.\n\n \n I wouldn't say money, resources is a better word. Here's a good example, say you are adopting a baby as you are very emotionally stressed by your (wife's) recent miscarriage; you are offered a healthy baby boy, next you are offered a near-dead baby boy with less than a day to live. Which are you more likely to choose. In this instance, the former would most likely be chosen, as the adopter is looking for something that will last longer than a day. The adopter has put a value on human life, or lack of it.\n \n Now, a functioning human adult should be able to be left in a house with food, water and air and survive. This is not the case with Terry Schiavo, she would have died in about month, probably less. At this point she's not really alive, for instance, if I beat her with a club would she be able to respond? I believe catalyst and response is a requirement of life, and Terry Schiavo showed no evidence of such a thing. You would think that it's a horrible thing to do, but it's the same as putting a dog to sleep; and I for one am just totally against that being legal!

For one to say that the cure for disease is death...this is just sick, makes you wonder what we value these days...money or life?\n\n \n We have always had a price on life. Consider our foregin policy. At what point do we intervene? When 50 die? 500? 5,000? 50,000? 500,000? At what cost do we just sit back and let them butcher each other? Life has always had a price, when that price is higher, we let people die. When that price is lower, we intervene. Of course, who sets that price is important.
