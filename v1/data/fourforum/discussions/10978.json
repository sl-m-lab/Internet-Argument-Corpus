   "admin \n #####istrator Join Date: Jan 2003\n Posts: 244 \n \n I think B should start the thread in the liars corner, then in the original thread post a quote of the accusation and a link to the thread in liars corner. Along with a request to go to the liars corner and prove the accusation.\n \n Not answering the charge will not get you banned but continuing to make the accusation without proving it could get you banned.\n \n \n Kronus:\n Seems to me that people lying is at least as big a problem as people making false accusations of lying, if not more so. If you put in place a process that can weed out the later, then you really need a process to weed out the former as well. If there's no penalty for lying, but there can be for calling someone on their lies, then lying will become a standard debate tactic.\n \n Edit: Sorry, meant to respond, not edit. Not used to admin tools. \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Last edited by Kronus : Yesterday at 07:51 PM. \nIs Kronus=admin?\n \n \n admin posted...Kronus edited\n \n How does this work?",

   "I never said it did. In fact, after a talk with AA, I don't think he's lying at all. I think he's delusional. As I stated, one has to know what they are saying is wrong and passing it off as the truth to be lying. AA genuinely believes that his arguments are true despite being factually wrong. He has stated that he has NEVER been dishonest. Since he has posted a massive misquote of an author, posting tv props as evidence of creation and argued that bees can't fly, and yet he was corrected, he still believes his arguments to be factual. That's not lying. That's delusions. If one is proved by the author of the quote they used themselves to be false, and still believes their misquote is true, they have mental issues. \n \n But how do we prove they lied? \n \n True, I agree. You just reiterated my point. \n \n But there's another problem with that. What if the user genuinely believes you said that? Furthermore, what if the user argues that you got the admin to change the post? They aren't lying. Just delusional.\n \n This entire forum fails due to its inability to separate delusion from actual lying.\n\n \n \nBut how to do we prove that is in fact lying?\n \n For instance, AA claimed that Chimps have virtually no creativity and imagination. I posted a article from a zoologist and a chimp handler who stated otherwise. AA kept posting in that thread. Within a month he then used the exact same argument and yet states he is not dishonest. \n \n It's obvious that he was informed of that argument's falseness yet he keeps using it and claims he's not lying. \n \n One is only lying if what they post is known by them at the time of posting to be false. If one is delusional or rejects all counter arguments to previously used arguments, they are not lying. They may be suffering from something in the DSM IV, but they are not lying.\n\n \n \nHi jim, this link answers his complaint directly on another thread which he still hasn't answered to. Notice the date on that post also, if you will. And yet he repeats the same complaint here as if I'm avoiding him somehow.\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=302937&postcount=19\n \n Here is the direct answer to childs complaint which shows he didn't answer my question at all in reality. But in usual form he claims he did.\n \n [Archangel]I am never dishonest about my beliefs, nor are my arguments dishonest either. That is your debating tactic. And regarding your evidence that chimps are creative? Bullpucky. I was asking why no other animal has every attained creativity on par with human inventiveness and you post a typical link pointing out that chimps use sticks to dig out insects or some such foolishness. Nothing close to meeting what I was referring to. So it wasn't worthy of consideration of any valid evidence of anything. So it is you who is lying and/or delusional.\n \n The rest of that post is very telling also so please read it as I'm still waiting for child to respond to it in two locations now.\n\n \n Why not just answer the linked question rather than running around the forum accusing me of lying about the evidence you posted child? And why haven't you posted the link to the evidence about the chimps and show in context that I ignored the so called evidence you posted? You are making allegations but not supporting them at all with anything. Why is that child?\n \n So here for the third time is the answer to your complaint about the chimp evidence you posted and a whole response to an earlier post by you that demands an answer which you have been ignoring ever since the friendly debate I was I was trying to have with Peeling. \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=302937&postcount=19\n \n I just find it fascinating that not one of you evolutionists has dared to touch that question. Not one of you. Here's the question again so you can't say you didn't see it.\n I just recently asked the whole bunch of you how you can claim so adamantly that the so called primate/hominid fossils such as Lucy, Peking, Java and Neanderthal MAN are related to modern man because of genetic markers that evolutionists claim is evidence of our biological kinship, when chimps share 98% of our DNA, and are contemporary to us currently so we can observe first hand how inferior they are to us in all aspects of intelligence, imagination, creativity and reason. Not one of you dealt with that question at all. you all completely evaded even touching it even though I reposted it repeatedly.\n And please, you know what the meat of the question is, so answer that question and don't get side tracked with irrelevant side questions.",

But as you stated, he could have simply refused to accept that the truth differed from his beliefs.

   "I'm not sure that I see the point of this new forum. When lies, or accusations of lies, occur in other threads people are generally called on it, in one way or another. And, more often than not instead of facts you get rhetoric in response. And, not too surprisingly, we're seeing the same thing here. So, if someone in this forum refuses to either put up or shut up, then what? Is there going to be some consequence if someone can't back up their accusations, because if not then it seems to me that all that we'll see here is the same ground covered in one thread covered inconclusively here.\n\n I think part of the problem is WHO the burden of proof is upon.\n And that can make this whole section completely meaningless...\n \n \n \nIn fact, let me know if you agree with this definition: A lie is when you post something that you know to be false, untrue, or misleading.\n\n As Steeeeve's definition argues, a person needs to KNOW that what they posted is false.\n Ergo, any troll can argue the sun is made of pink flowers, and if you can't prove he does not KNOW what he is saying is false, then you cannot prove he is lying.\n \n In rational debate, a person makes a claim. The person has to prove the claim.\n In THIS forum, a person presents an inaccurate claim, and OTHER people have to PROVE something that is innately difficult to prove. That the person making the claim knows the claim is false.\n You'll notice that the burden of proof has shifted.\n \n There are \"some\" posters who LOVE accusations of \"lies\" cause it shifts the burden of proof off of them and now they can fixate on demanding proof. They can assume \"victimhood\" stance and cry and complain until the cows come home, as the ACTUAL TOPIC of the thread goes ignored.\n It's why I stopped using the word \"lie\" for those who refuse to admit reality, and just proceeded to call them \"falsehoods\".\n \n The amusing thing about such a tactic is even when the topic has shifted to falsehoods about MY OWN OPINION, they insist I cannot label them as \"lying\".\n They cannot show any reason WHY they dishonestly misrepresent my position.\n I can point to statements which clearly prove their misrepresentation as false.\n And yet still, they demur when I label it as a \"lie\" because they can obviously believe that I think X, regardless of what was actually said.\n \n I haven't read all the threads, but seeing \"Steeeeve's\" presence here tells me that a lot of it has probably centered around demanding proof that the other person \"prove\" the liar \"knows\" what he said was wrong.\n \n I suspect this thread is pointless.\n I can't think of anywhere in society where \"honesty\" and accuracy are enforced where \"you don't know he doesn't believe what he is saying\" is a defense.\n For slander or libel, the proof works towards the ACCURACY of the claim. The fact that I may \"believe\" Paris Hilton has done illicit drugs is irrelevant to slander or libel.\n In the academic world, AGAIN the proof works towards the ACCURACY and SUBSTANTIATION of the claim. Is there sufficient evidence to put forth the argument.\n Even in cases of plagiarism, arguing that you didn't \"know\" you were plagiarizing IS NOT A DEFENSE.\n \n I am amused by the moderator's earlier comment, cause I would think that a person would want to cut down on BOTH the accusations of \"lying\" AND on the dishonesty itself.\n No comment about banning somebody who repeatedly demonstrates dishonesty, but CALLING somebody a liar, and then you can't satisfy the herculean task of PROVING them a \"liar\"...\n \n Interesting focus.\n It will cater to those who want to shift the burden of proof for others to disprove something doubly, and all the person who makes the falsehood has to do is put up a stonewall argument of \"I believe\", and it's all for naught.\n \n I would think it should also be relevant to encourage intellectual honesty, and discourage intellectual dishonesty, but that's just my opinion.\n If the moderators have no problem keeping people around who argue AGAINST some issues by blatantly misrepresenting those issues, and refusing to acknowledge that they are blatantly misrepresenting those issues, then that's their choice.",

So there's no need to make up an exchange when we have examples like this one all over this forum.\n\n \n OC was asking if it's a waste of time talking to people like you about the ToE. He nowhere said you were stupid, he said you didn't understand it. You replied with this post, where you proceed to state that anyone who disagrees with you is \"ignorant\", \"dishonest\", a promoter of \"lies and deceptions\", lacking \"discernment\", incapable \"of even determining what is true or a lie\", \"pseudo intellectuals\", \"bankrupt\" (I'll assume you were implying morally bankrupt).\n \n You then showed you have absolutely no understanding of the ToE or science in general with this statement:\n \n...unprovable assumptions that are based on preconceived notions, that have been both failing and conflicting with all of the new discoveries made in each generation to follow, thereby forcing the need to redefine the parameters by which evolution works every 10 years or so. \n \n So evolution isn't a science, it's a working piece of fiction in progress that is constantly being tweaked and shaped to fit the preconceptions no matter what new evidence is discovered that contradicts it.\n\n This actually supports OC's opening post-why should we bother when you have no understanding of the ToE? It wasn't a baiting thread at all. No where do I see him directly addressing you or challenging you. I see him commenting on the failure of certain posters to actually know anything about a subject they vehemently oppose, but that is in no way baiting.\n \n \n If you want people to stop treating you with disdain, how bout you stop the namecalling?\n \n Bah, this is pointless. Either we let AA call us names and slander us, or we stand up and tell him to back it up, making us look just as bad as him.",
