   "Why do you think all of your sources are so much more reliable than mine? Everytime you have a source, you think that any stats given by my sources are totally debunked, no matter what. What is your reasoning in this? Oh, and your baseless accusation that I expect a government website: \n \n \n\n ... or at least a .com.\n \n\n \n Miss that little phrase, did you?",

   "Another obfuscation?\n \n Firstly, the .com thing. I showed you that both the .org (the site that hosted my data) and the .com suffixes are equally available to anyone - as such, there is no reason why you should prefer a .com over a .org. Thus I said only the 'goverment hosted website' because that was the stronger of your two alternatives (.com and .gov). If you want to regress to a position which I have already defeated, feel free...\n \n Secondly, your main point. I don't think that my stats are more reliable than yours; I think that mine say more and that I've already responded to your stats. To recap the debate...\n \n You state that more gun laws reduce crime. To support this, you provide a table and a list of laws. However, I've previously addressed this here:\nFirstly, I don't claim that population density is the only factor.\n Secondly, you didn't show correlation between laws and crime. You showed a few examples in a table of 52 states, which does not show correlation. For that, you're going to need to arrange states in order of lawfullness, plot them against number of killings and show me something like a straight line.\n Thirdly, I have provided actual numerical data which contradicts your qualitative evidence - which you (again) rejected out of hand on the basis that my source was hosted on a .org, not a .com, both of which are freely available to anyone.\n Fourthly, I have explained multiple times that with the exception of DC, there is very little difference between US gun laws. Whether you can buy at 16 or 18 does not change the fact that the majority of the population are over both limits.\n\n \n My reason that my data says more is explained in points 2 and 4 in the above quote. Your data is not organised quantitavely so you have yet to actually show that correlation even exists, and there is such a small difference between gun control laws in US states (DC excepted) that they do not differentiate between a statistically significantly different number of people who can own firearms.\n \n My data, on the other hand, shows statistically and numerically that there is a direct correlation between gun ownership and homicide rate. If you have a problem with what it says, or the methods used to get it, feel free to mention them, but so far you have done nothing but complain about domain names.\n \n To summarise again: My data is not inherantly more reliable than yours. However, I have argued against the relevance of your data multiple times and in multiple ways, but your only argument against mine has been 'I don't like the URL' - something which is entirely irrelevant.",
