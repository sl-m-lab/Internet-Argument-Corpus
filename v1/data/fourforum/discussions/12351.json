   "...for all you Obama supporters.\n \n Do you think he has done well so far?\n\n The man hasn't even been in office for 100 days yet. How can anyone tell yet? To give him his due, he has hit the ground running, he named and vetted most of his cabinet, is in the process of getting a jobs recovery bill through the door when he signs it tomorrow, he's already corrected several of Bush's biggest booboo.\n \n Obama has made a few mistakes but he has done so incredibly much it's impossible to avoid making mistakes. Obama as president has probably already worked harder than Bush did in his entire eight years as president.\n \n Bush was always off on vacation when something needed to be down. He was asleep at the wheel on defending our nation from terrorist attacks, he was asleep at the wheel when Katrina hit. \n \n Obama does not fall asleep at the wheel.\n \nDo you think he told us any lies during the campaign?\n\n If Obama doesn't want to answer a question, he's pretty slick at not answering. He does not have to lie.\n \nDo you think he's actually calling the shots?\nObama is a man who is in command, who knows now to command, who knows how to get people to follow his lead. He doesn't have to have hatchet men like Cheney or Rove to enforce what he wants to do.\n \nDo you think he'll get re-elected in 2012?\nIt all depends on how well he does in the next four years.\n \n Are you afraid that he might succeed?\n \nDo you think Pelosi and Reid are partisan hacks?\nPelosi is finally doing what she ought to be doing for the people. I'm not sure about Reid. I still have a great suspicion that he's secretly a Republican hack.\n \nDo you think you should apologize to the rest of us?\n\n Whatever for?",
