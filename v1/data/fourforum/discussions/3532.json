   "http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=41106\n Be sure to check out the numerous links within this one. If you do, you'll realize why I question the sanity of anyone who plans to vote for this scumbag.\n \n \n \n Posted: October 26, 2004\n 1:00 a.m. Eastern\n \n \n By Art Moore\n \u00a9 2004 WorldNetDaily.com \n \n The first documentary evidence that Vietnamese communists were directly steering John Kerry's antiwar group Vietnam Veterans Against the War has been discovered in a U.S. archive, according to a researcher who spoke with WorldNetDaily. \n \n \n John Kerry testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1971. \n \n One freshly unearthed document, captured by the U.S. from Vietnamese communists in 1971 and later translated, indicates the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese delegations to the Paris peace talks that year were used as the communications link to direct the activities of Kerry and other antiwar activists who attended. \n \n Kerry insists he attended the talks only because he happened to be in France on his honeymoon and maintains he met with both sides. But previously revealed records indicate the future senator made two, and possibly three, trips to Paris to meet with Viet Cong leader Madame Nguyen Thi Binh then promote her plan's demand for U.S. surrender. \n \n Jerome Corsi, a specialist on the Vietnam era, told WND the new discoveries are the \"most remarkable documents I've seen in the entire history of the antiwar movement.\" \n \n \"We're not going to say he's an agent for Vietnamese communists, but it's the next thing to it,\" he said. \"Whether he was consciously carrying out their direction or naively doing what they wanted, it amounted to the same thing -- he advanced their cause.\"",

   "Yes. They were about to give up, so said a North Vietnamese officer.\nAnother unnamed somebody. The same somebody from skylopps61. Well, at least you've finally said that you think we could have won. Since neither of us have a crystal ball...... My heart goes out to everyone that served there. There was a never ending drain of kids that didn't want to go - that didn't see the cause. It broke our hearts too see them leave and risk everything when their heart wasn't in it either. The watching them come home was worse. Not loosing one more solider was the issue. At some point, the losses got so high, that we stepped back and said, \"OK. What's the real tangible value here. What will we have if we win.\" Pride isn't a good enough reason. The fact that we had invested too much already isn't a good enough reason. We couldn't increase the value of one lost life by ending another one. The anger is justified. I'm still angry too. But direct it at a government that didn't ask those question first.\n \n No matter what you think of his opinion, and my opinion, at least John Kerry understood the issues. GWB is still clueless. He's a top-notch state-side cheerleader. And thanks to his 180 we know he didn't take orders very well either. Forgot his physical, huh? You know what immediately comes to mind these days when somebody balks at a physical. Then, when he was useless, had wasted all that training, transferred out early. He got rewarded for \"forgetting\". He came out of his four years with his pride in tact. He'll gladly tell you any time. He's the only soldier that did. And you have no ill-will? He's your guy?",

They will increase the burden on small business forcing a slow down in employment and the economy. They are a step forward into government provided healthcare which has proven to be less effective and more expensive. They are a step towards a smaller and less equip military to defend this country.

   "Explain to me why a service economy cannot pay off a deficiet like the manufacturing economy did in the Reagon era? Why can't we bring manufacturing jobs back to America? You and Kerry want to tax the small manufacturing businesses off to China. Interesting enough I sell made in America products exlusively, so the manufacuting industry here in the USA must not be totally dead. We are shipping our products around the world as well.\n \n I think Kerry is getting votes for all the wrong reasons. The majority of people that intend to vote for him are just like yourself, upset with Bush and will take the only other option. You are not voting for his policy you are voting for him because of your dislike for Bush. Smart choice.\n\n \n Exported products, raw materials preferably with value added labor, are the only means of bringing new wealth to any country. A service economy just churns the same dollar over and over again until transaction taxation makes it disappear.

   "Compare the last 20 years of US history to that of the UK 10 years before WW2 up untill about 1960. \n \n To much of the US economy is currently based on financial churning of money. To many companies are making money by making money and not real products. The selling and reselling of financial instruments is making for some very wealthy people but is not producing any real wealth. \n \n Britain lost its empire because it was heavily in debt, and lost its manufacturing base to the US. The US is heavily in debt and is losing its manufacturing base to the Chinese. The simularities are there to see, ignoring the possible problems will only allow them to manifest. Recognising them and working to avoid them will only help.\n\n \n An excellent example. Rome also comes to mind. Though their demise was primarily caused by droughts in conquered countries reducing tributes (taxes, easily related to our industrial losses), the principle remains the same - a shrinking tax base. In Rome's case, they refused to reduce their standard of living or levels of aggression and were eventually unable to make payroll for the military.",

He had that idea 4 years ago but had to abandon because the stock market was so low. Now it's back. All he'll say on the subject is that it won't hurt the old people and the young ones will love it.\n \n 4. I find his methodology of dealing with others terribly distasteful. In the end, he wins his battles by saying \"because I'm the President.\" He ran as a uniter. He's done a wonderful job with everybody who agrees with him. He shows no desire or ability to compromise with anybody - foreign or domestic. Who's he going to mouth off to next?\n \n 5. He totally lacks fiscal responsibility. It was just 2 weeks ago that Congress stayed in session on Sunday, October 10 and Monday, Columbus Day because they were in such a hurry to spend another $125,000,000,000. That bill started out, I heard it started out as $5 billion dollars that had something to do with exports. It ended with another $120,000,000,000 in pure pork (like tax cuts for importers of Japanese ceiling fans). And GWB will sign it. I can't figure out where he puts financial emphasis because he seems to be open to whatever every member of Congress dreams up.\n \n Also, I don't agree that it's wise to go backrupt while we HOPE that some small business owner, somewhere, will part with a little money and give one of us a job. Guess what. That small business owner could also buy a BMW. I was a payroll rep for many years for ADP. I spent the last few years dealing with companies under 50 employees. I can attest to the fact that BMW's are high on the list. They'd whine and B--ch weekly, make ugly cracks as they handed out a 10 cent raise, then cut themselves an outrageous bonus check on Dec. 31. I saw way too much first hand to have any sympathy. I pray that isn't our future.\n \n 6. The big one - no WMD - no connection to 9/11. The buck has to stop somewhere. Oops! just isn't good enough for me. And I don't know where he's going with that either. Does anybody? Iran? A draft? He denies a draft but common sense tells us this can't go on forever. That's why he can't put it to bed. What he says defies logic. And just will he decide that it takes to spread democracy. And as a second termer, he has nothing to loose. And I have no reason to trust his judgment.\n \n He's quite the salesman. Gotta give him that.",

   "It would be most difficult to imagine anyone outspending this administration. The Medicare prescription plan (unfunded) is so big that increasing estimates change daily, Iraq is a giant sinkhole with no end in sight, we've had record increases in government expansion (without even considering homeland security), tax cuts to buy votes in a declining tax base are the same as spending (booked as lost tax revenue even by federal accounting) and military spending increases so large even my conservative nature fails to understand them. \n \n My desire to see the international community halt their rapidly increasing hatred of the US has nothing to do with catching up on our spending. That's not going to happen without a disaster. I want our remaining exports to stabilize so that interest rates won't be increased just to satisfy foreign investors at the expense of the dollar. \n \n I don't care about the little man or his tax burden, present and future, whether or not he has jobs, the expense of health care he bears through increased taxation or if he has federal or self-amassed retirement capability. That's all going to transpire in a manner designed to harvest votes regardless of who happens to be in office. A depression could be a good thing to bring us to our senses. I can easily hedge that with tax-exempt investments in public safety or hard-money investment pools in distressed property. I do want the dollar to slow it's kamikaze drop and this administration is not working in that direction with their GDP polishing efforts to lull the public into a sense of well-being. I also want us out of the ME and an administration seeking attaboys from the energy industry has no intent of even considering moderate change on that policy.\n\n I'm still waiting for a good reason to vote for Kerry other than Bush Admin hatred.

Bush has dug a deep hole. He nor Kerry will get us out of Iraq tomorrow. In fact it can't be done in the next year. Our finacial troubles will not go away with the pull of an election lever. So knowing and admitting these facts why oh why are you going to give your vote to the man we all know is going to continue heeping on the debt? For a fresh face? Is that it.

He has made a career of blowing in the breeze. His policies are clearly guided by the shifting populas opinion. \n \n His foundamental political position places the world in front of the citizens of America. He will told everyone that would listen that he intends to secure backing from a world organization of crooks and America haters before he makes an offensive move. Defense might be the game winner, but you without offense we can't put points on the board. You can't win without putting points on the board.\n \n IMHO, voting for a man because he is a good talker and thinker is a mistake. We have spent the last 30 years talking and thinking about the Islamic Terrorist threat. In the mean time the islamic terrorist have grown stronger and more brassen in their attacks. Internationalism is not going to defeat the enemy that has declared war on us.\n \n Health care.

He wants to flip the bill for unisured people. That means the Government pays for it. Which means I along with all the other taxpayers pay for it. So yes you are correct, people will get to choose their provider. However, the government is picking up the tab at the end of the meal.

So yes you are correct, people will get to choose their provider. However, the government is picking up the tab at the end of the meal.

Skyrocketing costs, millions with no health care. We are in a sorry state, and we have to do something. Bush's plan of giving everyone, what, $3000 dollars to pay for it? That's nothing for health care. Private organizations like churches paying for it? I really wonder how many would be willing to pay the costs of that. There is nothing, that I see, in the Bush plan to control the costs. Kerry's plan may cost more than I want to spend, and giving health care to illegal immigrants (for example) is something I do not believe in. But we need something, and Bush's plan is stupid.\n \n \n\n I would also like to correct Georged's statement that both candidates are career politicians. Kerry indeed has made a career of politics.

His stint/ownership participation with the Rangers was financed with a bank loan, paid back by a very questionable gain on stock ownership of a separate entity swept under the rug. His Ranger title was managing partner, but he was basically a handshaker while I believe it was Ed Rose who actually ran the business side of the franchise. That ownership participation made his fortune due to public money paying for the Ranger stadium and insider participation with the stadium land, sold to the Ranger syndicate for well under market value. His other 'business' ventures were failures. The majority of his adult life has been spent on working in political campaigns and ingratiating himself into the right circles to develop the financial support to run for president, including frequent use of Enron corporate aircraft before their fall. He's as professional a politician as they get and always tied at the hip to the energy industry.",

Just keep throwing money at it, that will make it better. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n Please, there was worldwide solidarity after 9/11. Bush tanked that. The hatred around the world is aimed, a lot of it, at Bush personally. That will at least be mitigated with someone new in office.\n \n This is false. I worked with and associated with many Europeans in the mid 1990's and the hatred for the American \"world police\" was there and just as strong as it is now. In my experience many Euraopeans did not support the US in the first gulf war. Europeans dislike conservative government hence the leftist government they enpower in their own countries. The founders of this country left there to escape the oppessive governments of Europe and now half of America is willing to vote that government into power here. Obviously I disagree with that decision.\n \n I'd rather have a good talker and thinker than an idiot like Bush. Islamic terrorists are growing stronger because of the foreign policy under Bush. The current policy is a bad way of dealing with terrorists. It justifies their view, it increases their numbers and it creates sympathy for their position. It's just... idiotic. Internationalism is the best way to defeat terrorists, imo.\n \n The same idiot that graduated from two Ivy League schools?\n \n The islamitc terrorist organizations have been growing for the last thirty years. We have tried the ignore them and they might go away approach. It culminated in 9/11. I'm glad we now have a government ready to deal with the situation. Of coarse they responded with high recruitment and more hatered. Did you expect them to lay down there weapons and quake it their boots?\n \n That's different than the implication that the gov't is controlling our health. Certainly health care is a huge issue in this country. Skyrocketing costs, millions with no health care. We are in a sorry state, and we have to do something. Bush's plan of giving everyone, what, $3000 dollars to pay for it? That's nothing for health care. Private organizations like churches paying for it? I really wonder how many would be willing to pay the costs of that. There is nothing, that I see, in the Bush plan to control the costs. Kerry's plan may cost more than I want to spend, and giving health care to illegal immigrants (for example) is something I do not believe in. But we need something, and Bush's plan is stupid.\n \n The company I work for now currently is employing the health savings accounts that Bush is promoting. They work very similar to the other insurance programs I have had with different companies in the past. The diffrence is they encourage fiscal conservatism. It is not a handout. I get penilized if I go to the emergancy room every time I need to see a doctor instead of the insurance company having to flip the bill for me because I am too lazy to make a doctors appointment. I am allowed a certain amount of money to spend each year, before my deducible must be met. I'm covered in the event of major illness and I'm allowed to rollover any money from my account that I don't use which in turn gives me more to use the next year in the event I need it. The program covers preventive check ups and I pay only $15 co-pay at the office visit. The system requires budgeting and the subcriber to be active in managing the finances. Obviously this scares many Americans and a government that picks up the tab is a much easier choice at first glance. When you look back at how the government has managed other social programs it si easy to discredit kerry's government backed plan.\n \n Has Bush had a successful business?\n\n That depends on your definition of successful. Most business are operated to show a break even budget so as to avoid higher taxes.",

During the oil boom years after deregulation the story was that even stray dogs were becoming millionaires just for being there. After Regan put the screws to US oil producers by aligning us with cheap Saud oil to drive the economy and Midland's pipe dream collapsed, only the politically connected received what were very generous amounts of operating capital to lose and bailout money, from, guess who? I also found it interesting that Barbara Bush, then a resident of Midland, saw fit to birth their sons in Connecticut.

I've seen few proposals at those levels that didn't project profits as the investor(s) would be realizing straight income from after-tax profits in the form of dividends. The Ranger deal was probably a LLC or similar as it was an investment pool that included land with K filings among 'good 'ol boys'. His trust(s) are probably held by a 1065 but that would have no effect on his business dealings. I seriously doubt that Bush (or anyone else) other than the dot.com scams ever attracted investment capital using break even proformas. And even the dot.commers promised eventual profits.
