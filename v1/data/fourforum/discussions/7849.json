   "Georgia is rebelling again. It is surprising that Georgians tolerated their lunatic such a long time. I'd myself ripened long ago.\n Now I agree that there should be preschedule presidential and parliamentary elections. But I'm afraid that Saakashvili has too much power and that those elections would be fixed. On the other hand new revolution is fraught with undesirable consequences.\n I've heard that new revolution will be led by two criminal oligarchs Berezovsky and Patarkatsyshvili. And whom those petty criminals will impose us as President? That \"furious oppositionist\" Zurabishvili living in France now! Oh I believe that in France she loves her fatherland very much! I just doubt that she knows anything about Georgian problems and Georgian people's interests!\n There is Georgian oppositionist party that I believe. This is The New Right Forces party. They're gambling on regional fusion of Georgia and won't spend budget money for useless civil wars against brotherly peoples of autonomies. They have rather good sensible social and political program. And we need social support very much for Georgians are in abject poverty.\n Yes, I welcome revolution. But those who're really feeling with our ills should carry it out. We just ask to give us chance to make our own choice.",
