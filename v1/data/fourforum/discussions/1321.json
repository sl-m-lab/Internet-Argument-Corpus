   "Postioning themselves in Churchs....( Part of Agenda?)\n \n \n \n \n Defending the indefensible \n \n \"As Catholics around the globe have been made increasingly aware in the first half of this year, homosexuals in the clerical ranks enjoy a network of support and protection within the hierarchy of the Church. This support remains intact even when teenage boys end up molested and seems only susceptible to the heat of the secular media spotlight. Even then, as we have witnessed, American bishops will go to great lengths to protect their theory that homosexuality of the non-raping variety can be \"healthy\" and \"life-affirming.\" Such a position is very easy to maintain when one's inquisitors are the same secular media outlets that would have us believe that a class of deviants rampant with disease and boasting a life-expectancy half that of the rest of society is somehow a \"healthy alternate lifestyle\" or an inconsequential \"sexual preference.\" \n \n Rather than the recent chain of events shaking this bizarre philosophy to its core, bishops have gone about their business of avoiding the homosexual connection while drawing up a policy focused on how to get their priests to rape fewer children.\"\n \n \n \"Nor is this problem limited to the American episcopacy, as can be seen with the quiet and delayed punishment of Bishop Cawcutt. If those responsible for discipline of bishops are unable or unwilling to take decisive action against an openly homosexual dissident with perverse fantasies, what action can be expected from bishops much more discreet? Worse yet, combining this unlikely prospect of ecclesial discipline with the \"openness\" of American seminaries to homosexuals for at least the past thirty-five years and the unofficial estimate of a 30%-50% \"gay\" clergy, how many of the 300+ bishops or thousands of individuals in positions of Church authority are homosexual themselves? Recall that the past four years have seen seven American Bishops resign over various homosexual controversies\". ....http://www.seattlecatholic.com/article_20020719_The_Fallen_Angels_of_St_Sebastians.html",

These actions do not represent the whole. You seem to be contending that the entire catholic church is a pro gay organization that promotes child molestation. This is a very narrow and ignorant view of reality. You seem to like to make generalizations. (since some priests have molested children, the catholic church must be a gay organization...) Well, catholics are christians, so couldn't we take it a step farther and say a few christians have molested children, therefore christianity itself is a gay child molesting organization? Now of course this is rediculous, but this is the same thing you are doing. You cannot blame the entire catholic church for the actions of a few. You also seem to be under the delusion that all child molestors are gay. This is totally false. They are deviant criminals. There are probably just as many heterosexual pedophiles as there are homosexual pedophiles. Generalizing on subjects such as this does nothing but show ignorance on your part and contribute to false stereotypes.",
