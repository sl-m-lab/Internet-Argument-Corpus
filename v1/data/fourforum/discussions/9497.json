   "Circassian congress of Israel anxious with situation in Adygeya - Caucasus \n \n As the Israeli journalist of the Adygeyan origin Harun Tkhauho informed Natpress on January 24, a sitting of the council of \"Circassian congress\" of Israel at 8.00 p.m. is held. The subject of the sitting concerns the decision of the Supreme court of Adygeya, cancelling the obligatory learning by Adygeyan children their native language at schools. \"Everything that occurs in Adygeya, - the journalist explained, - immediately becomes known to the Adygs of Israel\". \n \n As he said, the Adygs of Israel support the intention of the Adygeya new president Aslan Tkhakushinov to develop the economy of the republic. Moreover, they prepare to participate in that. However they are troubled with the fact that practically every 2 weeks in Adygeya significant changes take place - and not for the benefit of the Adygs. It could concern their rights, property relations, culture, something else, but which, at the end, is directed against Adygeya. \n \n At the meeting, Tkhauho notified, they plan to discuss such facts as the celebrating of the not existing event - 450th anniversary of the voluntary association of Adygeya with Russia, violation of the memory about the lost Adygs during the Russian-Caucasian war, threat against leaders of the national movements, abolition of the structures vital for the republic (for example, custom-house), obstacles, created against learning of the native language by the Adygeyan children. \n \n The decision of the Supreme court of Adygeya, the journalist stated, is considered by the members of Circassian congress of Israel as contradicting the international principles, the federal or republican laws. Such decision can be only a result of the political pressure. And the purpose of that pressure is clear - to deprive Adygs of their rights. \n \n The council of the public organization adopted a resolution, the journalist mentioned: along with development of the economy of Adygeya it is necessary to conduct the coordinated protection of the rights of the Adygs in the republic. The goal of those who want to break the Adygs' rights is a general destabilization of the situation when the best is the worst. \n \n Natpress.net",
