   "Political myopia of our European politicians is something I can't really get. The recent dramatic events in Russian city of Nalchik showed there are no improvements of their political sight. It continues to be poor. Nearly all the newspapers are basking in the exploring of the theory presenting the terror attack in Nalchic as kind of \"democratic will manifestation\" by the locals. They want us to think that those locals have matured to real democracy and .... took to the streets with arms in their hands to kill. This style of \"democracy\" is very much alike the Chechenian one. I gather they are no strangers to what happened in Nalchik. Some na&#1087;ve people think them real profi in \"liberation wars\". I think they are. They are merciless bandits and if not stopped they are to train lots of such \"liberators\" in lots of regions, Europe including. Let's look at it with our eyes widely open. Chechen bandits' leaders find Europe an ideal place to live, which suits very well their vigorous mental activities targeted at most effective \"liberation\". Well, I welcomed it when our politicians made some steps to get them all out of here. I mean major Chechenian agitator in Europe Mr. Zakaev and his sort of people. Now I see Europe made this one step in the right direction and then two in the wrong one. The number of incidents with Chechens involved is increasing rapidly just before our eyes! But our pols continue to stay blind. Recall how it was during London blasts. Now fancy that somebody could call this just \"manifestation of democratic will\" of some Londoners interested in ousting Blair govt. It sounds not sane. And I strongly doubt many Europeans could treat it well.",
