   "It's been a very good day. May be a few spelling errors from being tired and from hanging with Sam Adams....\n \n Here are some initial (very rough) thoughts on the majority opinion. I'm very pleased that the history lesson offered by the majority tracks exactly with what several of us have said here all along (even to the extent of relying on the same quotes) I'll skip the history lesson for now, though, because I think it more important to talk about what the heart of the ruling is today. Non-italics are my incoherent thoughts, and the italics below are quotes from the opinion. Please feel free to agree/disagree with my analysis as you see fit: \n \n 1. The 2nd. Amendment recognizes and protects an individual RKBA that is not restricted to militia service, and self defense is properly viewed as a primary purpose of the right:\n \n Putting all of these textual elements together, we find that they guarantee the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.\n \n As the quotations earlier in this opinion demonstrate, the inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right.\n \n 2. The right is not absolute:\n \n There seems to us no doubt, on the basis of both text and history, that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms. Of course the right was not unlimited, just as the First Amendment's right of free speech was not, see, e.g., United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. ___ (2008). Thus, we do not read the Second Amendment to protect the right of citizens to carry arms for any sort of confrontation, just as we do not read the First Amendment to protect the right of citizens to speak for any purpose.\n \n 3. The vast majority of current gun laws will survive this ruling:\n \n Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\n \n 4. Which apparently, by breathing new life into Miller, will include the survivability of bans of fully automatic weapons:\n \n We also recognize another important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms. Miller said, as we have explained, that the sorts of weapons protected were those \"in common use at the time.\" 307 U. S., at 179. We think that limitation is fairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of \"dangerous and unusual weapons.\"\n \n It may be objected that if weapons that are most useful in military service-M-16 rifles and the like-may be banned, then the Second Amendment right is completely detached from the prefatory clause. But as we have said, the conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment's ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty.\n \n \n 5. No test has been enumerated yet for new challenges to gun laws. There is an absolute rejection of Breyer's new (and I believe fraudulent) \"interest-balancing approach test\" trial balloon. Good language indicating the RKBA should be treated with the same respect as other critical fundamental rights, like 1st. Amendment speech and assembly. (and perhaps the beginning of a \"strict scrutiny\" test consensus???) A great quote for why we put things beyond the reach of impatient people by enshrining them in constitutions.\n \n JUSTICE BREYER moves on to make a broad jurisprudential point: He criticizes us for declining to establish a level of scrutiny for evaluating Second Amendment restrictions. He proposes, explicitly at least, none of the traditionally expressed levels (strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, rational basis), but rather a judge-empowering \"interestbalancing inquiry\" that \"asks whether the statute burdens a protected interest in a way or to an extent that is out of proportion to the statute's salutary effects upon other important governmental interests.\" Post, at 10. After an exhaustive discussion of the arguments for and against gun control, JUSTICE BREYER arrives at his interestbalanced answer: because handgun violence is a problem, because the law is limited to an urban area, and because there were somewhat similar restrictions in the founding period (a false proposition that we have already discussed), the interest-balancing inquiry results in the constitutionality of the handgun ban. QED. \n We know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding \"interest-balancing\" approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government-even the Third Branch of Government-the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges' assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all. Constitutional rights are enshrined with\n the scope they were understood to have when the people adopted them, whether or not future legislatures or (yes) even future judges think that scope too broad. We would not apply an \"interest-balancing\" approach to the prohibition of a peaceful neo-Nazi march through Skokie. See National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U. S. 43 (1977) (per curiam). The First Amendment contains the freedom-of-speech guarantee that the people ratified, which included exceptions for obscenity, libel, and disclosure\n of state secrets, but not for the expression of extremely unpopular and wrong-headed views. The Second\n Amendment is no different. Like the First, it is the very product of an interest-balancing by the people-which JUSTICE BREYER would now conduct for them anew. And whatever else it leaves to future evaluation, it surely elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\n \n 6. Rejection (in a footnote) of the lax and easy to justify almost any infringement law \"rational relation\" test (very good news for gun owners because it is a positive sign that a more restrictive test will be chosen later)\n \n JUSTICE BREYER correctly notes that this law, like almost all laws, would pass rational-basis scrutiny. Post, at 8. But rational-basis scrutiny is a mode of analysis we have used when evaluating laws under constitutional commands that are themselves prohibitions on irrational laws. See, e.g., Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of Agriculture, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 9-10). In those cases, \"rational basis\"is not just the standard of scrutiny, but the very substance of the constitutional guarantee. Obviously, the same test could not be used to evaluate the extent to which a legislature may regulate a specific, enumerated right, be it the freedom of speech, the guarantee against double jeopardy, the right to counsel, or the right to keep and bear arms. See United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152, n. 4 (1938) (\"There may be narrower scope for operation of the presumption of constitutionality [i.e., narrower than that provided by rational-basis review] when legislation appears on its face to be within a specific prohibition of the Constitution, such as those of the first ten amendments. . .\"). If all that was required to overcome the right to keep and bear arms was a rational basis, the Second Amendment would be redundant with the separate constitutional prohibitions on irrational laws, and would have no effect. \n \n 7. Because Americans have overwhelmingly chosen handguns as defensive weapons D.C.'s total ban is unconstitutional:\n \n It is no answer to say, as petitioners do, that it is permissible to ban the possession of handguns so long as the possession of other firearms (i.e., long guns) is allowed. It is enough to note, as we have observed, that the American people have considered the handgun to be the quintessential self-defense weapon. There are many reasons that a citizen may prefer a handgun for home defense: It is easier to store in a location that is readily accessible in an emergency; it cannot easily be redirected or wrestled away by an attacker; it is easier to use for those without the upperbody strength to lift and aim a long gun; it can be pointed at a burglar with one hand while the other hand dials the police. Whatever the reason, handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-defense in the home, and a complete prohibition of their use is invalid.\n \n 8. D.C.'s \"must be rendered inoperable\" restriction is also unconstitutional because of it's infringement on the right of self defense:\n \n We must also address the District's requirement (as applied to respondent's handgun) that firearms in the home be rendered and kept inoperable at all times. This makes it impossible for citizens to use them for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional.\n \n 9. The issue of registration and licensing is left undecided because Heller conceded that being able to register his gun and force D.C. to give him a license satisfies him (but a license law has no teeth where SCOTUS says D.C. MUST give the license so long as the person meets existing possession laws, like being a non-felon):\n \n Respondent conceded at oral argument that he does not \"have a problem with . . . licensing\" and that the District's law is permissible so long as it is \"not enforced in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 74-75. We therefore assume that petitioners' issuance of a license will satisfy respondent's prayer for relief and do not address the licensing requirement.\n \n 10 Many, many issues remain in fact undecided (as expected and as it should be, given the proper SCOTUS role of not issuing advisory opinions but instead following its own constitutional mandate to rule only on the specific issues and controversies presented by each case.) \n \n JUSTICE BREYER chides us for leaving so many applications of the right to keep and bear arms in doubt, and for not providing extensive historical justification for those regulations of the right that we describe as permissible. See post, at 42-43. But since this case represents this Court's first in-depth examination of the Second Amendment, one should not expect it to clarify the entire field, any more than Reynolds v. United States, 98 U. S. 145 (1879), our first in-depth Free Exercise Clause case, left that area in a state of utter certainty. And there will be time enough to expound upon the historical justifications for the exceptions we have mentioned if and when those exceptions come before us.\n \n 11. End result ruling:\n \n In sum, we hold that the District's ban on handgun possession in the home violates the Second Amendment, as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense. Assuming that Heller is not disqualified from the exercise of Second Amendment rights, the District must permit him to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home.\n \n 12. Ending with a tremendous quote: \n \n The Constitution leaves the District of Columbia a variety of tools for combating that problem, including some measures regulating handguns, see supra, at 54-55, and n. 26. But the enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table. These include the absolute prohibition of handguns held and used for self-defense in the home. Undoubtedly some think that the Second Amendment is outmoded in a society where our standing army is the pride of our Nation, where well-trained police forces provide personal security, and where gun violence is a serious problem. That is perhaps debatable, but what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this Court to pronounce the Second Amendment extinct.\n \n I'm a little surprised Scalia wrote this rather that Roberts. I really thought the Chief Justice would want to pull rank (others before him have done so) to put his name at the top of this one. It may be a realization that Scalia is simply the best conservative writer on the Court.\n \n Now excuse me while I stop running my mouth for awhile. I don't want my beer to get warm....(when they put \"brewer\" and \"patriot\" on the lable, isn't that a bit redundant?) \n \n ---\n \n \"The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.\" Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300.\n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, Lecture II, 1921.",

   "The VPC has the inside story on the ruling. It was a conflict of interest. \n \n \nby Josh Sugarmann\n \"Sport Shooting Ambassador Award\" Winner Antonin Scalia's 2nd Amendment Ruling Does His Gun Pals Proud\n \n Fifteen months after receiving the \"Sport Shooting Ambassador Award\" from the World Forum on the Future of Sport Shooting Activities (WFSA), Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has done his part to make sure that, at least in the U.S., the future for his gun industry friends and their lobbying pals is a little bit brighter.\n \n In authoring the opinion overturning Washington, DC's handgun ban, Justice Scalia leaves little doubt as to why he was honored with the Ambassador Award, which offers \"public recognition of the social contribution made by some of the many public figures who have a longstanding interest in the shooting sports.\" The WFSA is an international organization comprised primarily of gunmakers and pro-gun organizations (including the National Rifle Association) from around the world. Scalia was awarded the honor and gave the keynote address during the WFSA's 2007 annual meeting in Nuremberg, Germany, held in conjunction with the Internationale Waffen Ausstellung (IWA), \"the world's leading exhibition for hunting and sporting arms.\" The previous year's winner was Ugo Gussalli Beretta, president of the Italian gun manufacturer Beretta. The award consists of a silver reproduction of a 16th century pistol with powder flask.\n \n According to the April 10, 2007, edition of The New Gun Week, Scalia's keynote address \"focused mostly on trends and threats to the international traditions of sport hunting.\" The cover of the issue features Scalia posing with Second Amendment Foundation founder Alan Gottlieb, a convicted felon who at one time lost the ability to possess guns. (He later regained the ability to own guns through the now-defunded federal \"relief from disability\" program, a multi-million dollar program that re-armed convicted, often violent, felons, at taxpayer expense. The program was defunded after being exposed by my organization, the Violence Policy Center.) In the background of the picture appears to be pro-gun attorney and National Rifle Association grantee Stephen Halbrook (who also authored the amicus brief signed by members of the U.S. House and Senate in support of overturning the DC ban).\n \n While the WFSA Web site has photos and comments from prior \"WFSA Ambassadors,\" no such honors are offered for Justice Scalia, whose name sits unadorned by a photo or additional information.\n \n Perhaps the WFSA will post today's decision on its Web site in his honor.\n",

   "And the ruling said that semiautomatic guns could be banned so its a hollow victory for gun nuts. \n \n \nStatement of Violence Policy Center on Supreme Court Ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller Overturning DC Handgun Ban \n Supreme Court Ruling Overturning DC Handgun Ban Should Allow Ban on Semiautomatic Handguns to Stand\n \n Washington, DC--Following today's 5-4 Supreme Court opinion authored by 2007 Sport Shooting Ambassador Award winner Antonin Scalia (see http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-sugarmann/sport-shooting-ambassador_b_109367.html for more info) overturning Washington, DC's handgun ban, but apparently allowing for the retention of the law's ban on most semiautomatic weapons, including semiautomatic handguns (see background information after statement), Violence Policy Center (VPC) Legislative Director Kristen Rand states:\n \n \"Today's opinion turns legal logic and common sense on its head. As measured in gun death and injury, handguns are our nation's most lethal category of firearm: accounting for the vast majority of the 30,000 Americans who die from guns each year. Handguns are our nation's leading murder and suicide tool. Yet the majority opinion offers the greatest offender the strongest legal protection. It's analogous to the Court carving out special constitutional protection for child pornography in a First Amendment case.\n \n \"In its ruling, the Court has ignored our nation's history of mass shootings, assassinations, and unparalleled gun violence. It has instead accepted an abstract academic argument with dangerous real-world results for residents of the District of Columbia. Thankfully, because the plaintiff in Heller did not challenge the District's ban on \"machine guns,\" Washington, DC's ban on most semiautomatic weapons, including semiauto handguns, should be unaffected.\"\n \n The ruling comes one day after a Kentucky factory worker killed five co-workers with a handgun before taking his own life. For a copy of the amicus brief submitted by the VPC in the case, please see http://www.vpc.org/hellerbrief.pdf.\n \n Background Information\n \n The Court's ruling today does not appear to affect the District's ban on \"machine guns,\" which under DC law includes any gun \"which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily converted or restored to shoot semiautomatically, more than 12 shots without manual reloading.\" This definition would include virtually all semiautomatic handguns. As a result, the District's ban can remain in force for those types of handguns, commonly known as pistols. In essence, the Court's ruling for the most part will only affect revolvers and derringers.\n \n Semiautomatic guns fire one shot per trigger pull, have greater ammunition capacity, and can be quickly and easily reloaded. They are the weapon of choice in mass shootings and police killings, and are the most common type of handgun manufactured in America, representing 73 percent of the 1,403,329 handguns manufactured in the United States in 2006 (the last year for which figures are available). In contrast, revolvers hold only five to six ammunition rounds, fire more slowly, take time to reload, and represent only 27 percent of the handguns manufactured in 2006.\n",

   "Two articles from Josh Sugarman of the VPC which amount to nothing, Brady. \n \n The first is an attempt to discredit the majority opinion because Scalia has been honored by gun right's organizations before. Does this create a conflict of interest? Absolutely not. \n \n SCOTUS' rules governing conflicts of interest are public record. \n \n Why don't you cite us the one Scalia violated, Brady? \n \n After all, Sugarman could use the helping hand. You noticed, didn't you, that Sugarman didn't find one to cite in his article and say \"see, here's the one he violated....\"?\n \n But while you're both still on the conflict of interest high horse, why don't you ask yourselves whether either of you has ever complained about Thurgood Marshall sitting in cases which the NAACP was either a party or filed an Amicus after he was honored (and rightfully so) by the civil rights organization. I bet neither of you did for the same reason-Marshall, like Scalia in Heller, didn't break any conflict of interest rules by doing so.\n \n The second article is also lacking merit. \n \n The term \"machine gun\" means for the Heller majority what it has meant for the entire world for the better part of a century: a firearm which fires more than one round automatically with the single pull of a trigger. SCOTUS clearly implies in Heller that such \"machine guns\" may still be regulated without offending the 2nd. Amendment. \n \n Sugarman is mistaken when he claims there is a D.C. statute on \"machine guns\" which the Heller decision \"does not appear to affect.\" Note that although he quotes from the statute he does not cite it. If he did then you would know it had nothing to do with the Heller decision. \n \n The law he cites is styled the following: \"District of Columbia Assault Weapons Manufacturing Strict Liability Act of 1990, D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 6-2391 to -2393.\" It is a civil strict liability tort act, and it was never an issue in Heller. In this act D.C. chose to call semi-automatic firearms capable of accepting magazines holding more than 12 rounds \"machine guns.\" Sugarman knows, or at least should know, that Heller didn't remotely address this act because Art III sec. 2 of the Constitution forbids it. \n \n Sugarman's analysis is nothing more than this: \n \n There's hope because SCOTUS did not strike down a law it couldn't yet strike down, and we can now use it as a blueprint for future bans which can get around this Heller case. Oh I know that SCOTUS said in Heller Americans overwhelmingly choose handguns for self-defense so you can't ban them, and never mind that I have said the type of weapon I want to ban makes up almost 3 out of every 4 of these overwhelmingly chosen and protected firearms. SCOTUS still says we can ban 'machine guns'-so all we have to do call these protected firearms \"machine guns\" and trust SCOTUS can't see through our ruse.\n \n On its face Sugarman's argument is patently false, and I am surprised you would cite it with such superficial approval. \n \n ---\n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\" Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928) (Brandeis, dissenting)",

   "Given that almost half the Supreme Court disagreed with Scalia (in contrast to the Miller decision which as I understand was unanimous) we would do well to question his analysis. \n \n Justice Breyer wrote in his dissenting opinion:\n \nThe majority does, however, point to one type of confrontation that counts, for it describes the Amendment as \"elevat[ing] above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\" Ante, at 63. What is its basis for finding that to be the core of the Second Amendment right? The only historical sources identified by the majority that even appear to touch upon that specific matter consist of an 1866 newspaper editorial discussing the Freedmen's Bureau Act, see ante, at 43, two quotations from that 1866 Act's legislative history, see ante, at 43-44, and a 1980 state court opinion saying that in colonial times the same were used to defend the home as to maintain the militia, see ante, at 52. How can citations such as these support the far-reaching proposition that the Second Amendment's primary concern is not its stated concern about the militia, but rather a right to keep loaded weapons at one's bedside to shoot intruders?\n\n Wouldn't it make much more sense and be less confusing to begin the Second Amendment with something like \"Self defense against intruders being important for the defense of hearth and home......\" if indeed that was the primary purpose of the Second Amendment as Scalia claims? Scalia could have claimed that the amendment was primarily about the right to keep and bear arms for militia purposes but was broad enough to also encompass a right to own guns for personal self defense. Instead he seems to advocate a right that is not limited to its stated purpose but bafflingly can be more limited than its stated purpose. This becomes apparent when he discusses what kind of arms the Second Amendment protects. He thinks the popularity of a weapon determines whether or not it is protected by the Second Amendment and not if it would be useful for militia purposes. Thus the right can fall short of its civic purpose according to Scalia. Why would James Madison have argued in Federalist 46 that the US would have a military advantage over other nations because its people were armed if the arms people were intended to own would not necessarily be useful in military conflicts? \n \n Justice Breyer continues:\n \nNor is it at all clear to me how the majority decides which loaded \"arms\" a homeowner may keep. The majority says that that Amendment protects those weapons \"typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes.\" Ante, at 53. This definition conveniently excludes machineguns, but permits handguns, which the majority describes as \"the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-defense in the home.\" Ante, at 57; see also ante, at 54-55. But what sense does this approach make? According to the majority's reasoning, if Congress and the States lift restrictions on the possession and use of machineguns, and people buy machineguns to protect their homes, the Court will have to reverse course and find that the Second Amendment does, in fact, protect the individual self-defense-related right to possess a machinegun. On the majority's reasoning, if tomorrow someone invents a particularly useful, highly dangerous self-defense weapon, Congress and the States had better ban it immediately, for once it becomes popular Congress will no longer possess the constitutional authority to do so. In essence, the majority determines what regulations are permissible by looking to see what existing regulations permit. There is no basis for believing that the Framers intended such circular reasoning.\n",

   "Wait a minute:\n \n Not a word was said that related to the words \"well regulated\"? \n \n I had to do a double take when I read this. I clearly remembered reading the majority discuss the words \"well regulated\"-and here is Chester confidently asserting the Heller majority ignored it. I went back to check, and this is what I found (again):\n \n http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf (Opinion of the Court, page 22):\n \n 2. Prefatory Clause.\n The prefatory clause reads: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State . . . .\"\n a. \"Well-Regulated Militia.\" In United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174, 179(1939), we explained that \"the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense.\" That definition comports with founding-era sources. See, e.g., Webster (\"The militia of a country are the able bodied men organized into companies, regiments and brigades . . . and required by law to attend military exercises on certain days only, but at other times left to pursue their usual occupations\"); The Federalist No. 46, pp. 329, 334 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (J. Madison) (\"near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands\"); Letter to Destutt de Tracy (Jan. 26, 1811), in The Portable Thomas Jefferson 520, 524 (M. Peterson ed. 1975) (\"[T]he militia of the State, that is to say, of every man in it able to bear arms\").\n Petitioners take a seemingly narrower view of the militia, stating that \"[m]ilitias are the state- and congressionally-regulated military forces described in the Militia Clauses (art. I, \u00a78, cls. 15-16).\" Brief for Petitioners 12. Although we agree with petitioners' interpretive assumption that \"militia\" means the same thing in Article I and the Second Amendment, we believe that petitioners identify the wrong thing, namely, the organized militia. Unlike armies and navies, which Congress is given the power to create (\"to raise . . . Armies\"; \"to provide . . . a Navy,\" Art. I, \u00a78, cls. 12-13), the militia is assumed by Article I already to be in existence. Congress is given the power to \"provide for calling forth the militia,\" \u00a78, cl. 15; and the power not to create, but to \"organiz[e]\" it-and not to organize \"a\" militia, which is what one would expect if the militia were to be a federal creation, but to organize \"the\" militia, connoting a body already in existence, ibid., cl. 16. This is fully consistent with the ordinary definition of the militia as all able-bodied men. From that pool, Congress has plenary power to organize the units that will make up an effective fighting force. That is what Congress did in the first militia Act, which specified that \"each and every free able-bodied white male citizen of the respective states, resident therein, who is or shall be of the age of eighteen years, and under the age of forty-five years (except as is herein after excepted) shall severally and respectively be enrolled in the militia.\" Act of May 8, 1792, 1 Stat. 271. To be sure, Congress need not conscript every able-bodied man into the militia, because nothing in Article I suggests that in exercising its power to organize, discipline, and arm the militia, Congress must focus upon the entire body. Although the militia consists of all ablebodied men, the federally organized militia may consist of a subset of them.\n Finally, the adjective \"well-regulated\" implies nothing more than the imposition of proper discipline and training. See Johnson 1619 (\"Regulate\": \"To adjust by rule or method\"); Rawle 121-122; cf. Va. Declaration of Rights \u00a713 (1776), in 7 Thorpe 3812, 3814 (referring to \"a well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms\").\n \n I have always found it helpful to take time and actually read an opinion before I try and argue what it says or does not say, particularly when I make statements with as much certainty as you did above Chester. \n \n Now while I'm here let me answer this question for you as well:\n \n Now, when are the gun nuts going to muster in for their one weekend a month and 4 weeks in the summer of training so that they can become \"well regulated\", or did someone take those words out of 2A when no one was looking?\n \n No one took them out, Chester. They merely defined the words while you were not looking.",

Did you really think my answer would change from last time? \n \n I won't report because there is no pre-requisite duty that I do so to exercise my RKBA. I told you this before Heller, and nothing, absolutely nothing, in Heller remotely suggests otherwise. You have never given any solid argument for your particular view that the statement of a militia principle in the preamble somehow imposes a condition on the exercise of the substantive right. Your claim to find justification in language you said didn't exist in the opinion until I cited it to you is unpersuasive. \n \n How can you expect me to accept an argument which says: \"They didn't talk about it at all, but if they did then they agreed with me\"? \n \n Heller says the militia clause is a statement of a laudable goal which can be achieved by protecting the substantive right. It is a byproduct of the right, not the right itself. Recognizing and protecting a RKBA provides a ready pool of armed citizens which can be called forth and formed into regulated militias (a power which Congress already had when the BoR was ratified). For the militia system to work it still requires the States and Congress to exercise their powers to organize and train the arms bearing public into militias. Your argument beings with a false presumption that militia service is the sole function of the right and constitutes a requirement to exercise it. You would grant Congress the power to destroy a right merely by refusing to exercise its power to make use of the advantages it offers. If you will go back and read the constitutional debates, you will find that your argument is exactly what the anti-federalists feared. \n \n If you want I'll dig up a few of their quotes to show you how thoroughly they rejected your argument back then.\n \n Is there anyone else out there that shares this view, Chester? You are the only one I have ever heard make this argument. \n \n No, Chester. I've answered your question again. Now don't use it's repetition as a screen to walk away from your earlier claim so quickly. \n \n The unresolved issue is why you said in the first place:\n \n Not a word was said that related to the words \"well regulated.\" \n \n Either you did read the opinion, saw it was there, and decided to lie about it and hope no one called you on it, or you didn't read the opinion, and just decided to make up the claim because it sounded good at the time. \n \n Which is it, Chester?",

Miller tell the same story. Those in the train band as well as those of age but not in training had a duty to keep arms. The Heller dissent argued for a right that is narrower than the duty to keep arms that was known when the amendment was written, and that doesn't even pass the smell test.\n \n \n The \"idiom\" argument fails because, as Scalia correctly pointed out, the text of the amendment is \"keep and bear arms\" and so \"bear arms\" does not stand alone in the text at issue. Furthermore the contemporaneous usage of the right to bear arms did not follow the supposed idiomatic form. The various state constitutional provisions(i.e. PA 1776) did not follow that form, nor did the Address of the PA minority, nor did Tenche Coxe's newspaper article describing the amendment, nor did contemporaneous statements by Framer's such as James Wilson and Roger Sherman, nor did the earliest state court decisions. Moreover, the dissent does not conclude that the right to bear arms means that there is an individual right to serve in the militia -which one would expect had the dissent taken its \"idiom\" argument seriously. \n \n \n Note that the dissent agreed that the right of the people to keep and bear arms is an individual right -that point won 9-0 in Heller. The disagreement with the majority was in regards to the scope of the right. However, the dssent's arguments in support of a narrow scope simply do not hold water.",

   "Galilio,\n \n Here is another argument put forth by the dissent that is extremely weak, if not simply absurd. In an attempt to downplay any earlier pronouncements by the Supreme Court as to the scope of \"the right to keep and bear arms\", the dissent engages in evidence barring of the oddest sort.\n \n From Heller dissent:\n \"The majority's assertion that the Court in Cruikshank\n \"described the right protected by the Second Amendment\n as ' \"bearing arms for a lawful purpose,\" ' \" ante, at 47\n (quoting Cruikshank, 92 U. S., at 553), is not accurate.\n The Cruikshank Court explained that the defective indictment\n contained such language, but the Court did not\n itself describe the right, or endorse the indictment's description\n of the right.\"\n \n Below is the text from Cruikshank that causes the dissent to lose all sense of reason. \n \n From Cruikshank:\n The second and tenth counts are equally defective. The right there specified is that of 'bearing arms for a lawful purpose.' This is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed; but this, as has been seen, means no more than that it shall not be infringed by Congress. This is one of the amendments that has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government, leaving the people to look for their protection against any violation by their fellow-citizens of the rights it recognizes, to what is called, in The City of New York v. Miln, 11 Pet. 139, the 'powers which relate to merely municipal legislation, or what was, perhaps, more properly called internal police,' 'not surrendered or restrained' by the Constituton of the United States. \n \n \n What is it that the Second Amendment declares \"shall not be infringed\" ?\n \n If the Court in Cruikshank was not equating \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms\" with the right of \"bearing arms for a lawful purpose\" -what does the dissent imagine the Court in Cruikshank was doing?\n \n \n The dissent was either incredibly obtuse, or frighteningly dishonest, in its dismissal of this evidence.",

   "Definitely dishonest: you underestimate your oppressor.\n \n Note:\n \n \nFrom Cruikshank:\n The second and tenth counts are equally defective. The right there specified is that of 'bearing arms for a lawful purpose.' This is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence.

Cruikshank, held that the purpose of the 2nd Amendment was to provide the federal government with a draft-pool of armed citizens to defend the country-- and that therefore no federal statute could prevent citizens from bearing arms.\n \n However this is absurd, in that it protects the federal government from ITSELF, by preventing it from passing laws that hindered its own needs.\n \n In reality, Madison makes the 2nd Amendment's purpose clear in Federalist 46, where he states that the 500,000 militia of the states, could easily handle the 30,000 troops of the federal army:\n \n \nThe only refuge left for those who prophesy the downfall of the State governments is the visionary supposition that the federal government may previously accumulate a military force for the projects of ambition. The reasonings contained in these papers must have been employed to little purpose indeed, if it could be necessary now to disprove the reality of this danger. That the people and the States should, for a sufficient period of time, elect an uninterupted succession of men ready to betray both; that the traitors should, throughout this period, uniformly and systematically pursue some fixed plan for the extension of the military establishment; that the governments and the people of the States should silently and patiently behold the gathering storm, and continue to supply the materials, until it should be prepared to burst on their own heads, must appear to every one more like the incoherent dreams of a delirious jealousy, or the misjudged exaggerations of a counterfeit zeal, than like the sober apprehensions of genuine patriotism. Extravagant as the supposition is, let it however be made. Let a regular army, fully equal to the resources of the country, be formed; and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government; still it would not be going too far to say, that the State governments, with the people on their side, would be able to repel the danger. The highest number to which, according to the best computation, a standing army can be carried in any country, does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number of souls; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. This proportion would not yield, in the United States, an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops. Those who are best acquainted with the last successful resistance of this country against the British arms, will be most inclined to deny the possibility of it. Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. And it is not certain, that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes. But were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves, who could collect the national will and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these governments, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it. Let us not insult the free and gallant citizens of America with the suspicion, that they would be less able to defend the rights of which they would be in actual possession, than the debased subjects of arbitrary power would be to rescue theirs from the hands of their oppressors. Let us rather no longer insult them with the supposition that they can ever reduce themselves to the necessity of making the experiment, by a blind and tame submission to the long train of insidious measures which must precede and produce it.\n\n \n Since the people owned the state government, and not vice-versa, then it had state governments had no power to constrain such sovereign rights against federal abuse.\n \n However the Supreme Court had long joined Leviathan under Texas v. White, and could now only construe the law for its own empowerment.",

   "Definitely dishonest: you underestimate your oppressor.\n\n \n Alright, now I'm intrigued. What then do you suggest is the true nature of the oppressor? What are his/her/its goals? \n \n You seem to support the individual RKBA position, Joel, and if so then we can agree on many things. But I respectfully disagree with the cited arguments you are making.\n \n \n(discussing U.S. v. Cruikshank-Bryan)Here, note the selective convenience by which the Court ignores the Fourtheenth Amendment as applying federal laws to the states, despiting doing this very thing for all other laws--- even the 9th Amendment, thus\n protecting the states against THEMSELVES. \n\n \n I disagree. No SCOTUS decision has ever incorporated the 9th. Amendment to protect the states from themselves. The 9th amendment has nothing to do with the states:\n \n \"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. U.S. Constitution.\" 9th Amd. (1791)\n \n I think you may be confusing the 9th. with the 10th.: \n \n \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.\" U.S. Constitution 10th. Amd. (1791)\n \n I believe the avowed purpose of the 14th. Amendment was to incorporate the individual liberties in the first eight amendments against the states. SCOTUS has over its history engaged in a \"dipping its toe in the water\" method of incorporating rights called \"selective incorporation.\" With this process SCOTUS takes these rights individually as they come before it and decides whether the right should be incorporated. I am not a fan of selective incorporation, but it is the reality we live with. I agree Cruikshank presented an opportunity for incorporation which SCOTUS avoided-rights in both the 1st. and 2nd Amendment were considered in Cruikshank. \n \n But I think we read too much conspiracy theory into Cruikshank when we suggest that it missed the incorporation boat. Cruikshank was merely following established SCOTUS precedent set forth in Barron v. Mayor of Baltimore, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 243 (1883), holding the BoR acts only as a check of the federal power. Although the 14th. Amendment was enacted and ratified in between these cases, the very idea of incorporating rights was still decades away from becoming SCOTUS majority ideology. It was only in 1925 that SCOTUS began incorporating rights (arguments exist for considering other prior cases, but the consensus is Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652 (1925) began the incorporation process-in that case involving 1st. Amendment free speech). Since that time no solid case of state infringement has made it to SCOTUS to force the issue of incorporating the RKBA. \n \n Incorporation was not an issue in Heller, but it was briefly mentioned in dicta in footnote 23 of the decision: \n \n (In the body preceding this quote the majority argues Cruikshank supports the individual right interpretation of the RKBA, then went on as an aside to this footnote--Bryan) \"With respect to Cruikshank's continuing validity on incorporation, a question not presented by this case, we note that Cruikshank also said that the First Amendment did not apply against the States and did not engage in the sort of Fourteenth Amendment inquiry required by our later cases. Our later decisions in Presser v. Illinois, 116 U.S. 252, 265 (1886) and Miller v. Texas, 153 U.S. 535, 538 (1894), reaffirmed that the Second Amendment applies only to the Federal Government.\" District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 64 (2008)\n \n Here the majority is saying Cruikshank is out of date regarding the doctrine of incorporation, and further notes that the current position is the RKBA has not been incorporated (yet). The RKBA is not alone in this context. The 3rd. Amendment right not to have soldiers quartered in your home has also not been incorporated for the same reason-no case has forced SCOTUS to decide the issue yet.\n \n Now here is a point I want to make. All of the cases which exist holding the BoR acts only to limit federal power predate the selective incorporation process begun in Gitlow. The incorporation cases did not consider their logic binding when evaluating whether the 14th. Amendment incorporated the particular BoR liberty interest at issue. If a case can be found involving similar state-imposed restrictions as those in Heller, and if that case came before the same majority of SCOTUS justices, then I believe we would see an opinion using the 14th. Amendment to incorporate the RKBA against the states. \n \n But until that time the states are free to ignore the 2nd. Amendment (at the peril of being involved in THE future incorporation case). Unless and until SCOTUS incorporates the RKBA against the states our only protection for the RKBA against state infringement remains the protections included in the state constitutions and, lacking those, the wayward discretion of state legislators. \n \n \nUS v. Cruikshank, held that the purpose of the 2nd Amendment was to provide the federal government with a draft-pool of armed citizens to defend the country-- and that therefore no federal statute could prevent citizens from bearing arms. \n\n \n I do not agree entirely with this quote. Still, the quote which follows it...\n \n \nHowever this is absurd, in that it protects the federal government from ITSELF, by preventing it from passing laws that hindered its own needs. \n\n \n ...contains a lesson. The result is not absurd if Cruikshank is properly understood to be an individual RKBA opinion. The absurdity results when we apply the collective right theory to the case. \n \n \nHowever since the Civil War, all laws were to be interpreted to the empowerment of the government, not the people. \n\n \n I believe this argument runs contrary to dozens of post-Civil War SCOTUS rulings. Is there any authority to support your claim?\n \n \n Since the people owned the state government, and not vice-versa, then it had state governments had no power to constrain such sovereign rights against federal abuse. \n\n \n I do not understand this argument. Was it meant to read \"then it held\" instead of \"then it had?\" If so, then are you referring to SCOTUS, and if so, then what case? I'm just curious because I have not heard this argument before.\n \n \nHowever the Supreme Court had long joined Leviathan under Texas v. White, and could now only construe the law for its own empowerment. \n\n \n By this I assume you are referring to Texas v. White, 74 U.S. 700 (1869), involving Texas suing to recover U.S. bonds it sold to individuals during the Civil War, which led to a ruling that the Constitution denied the states the right to secede. While not a state's right friendly opinion, I do not see how this case has led to decisions in which SCOTUS becomes part of the \"Leviathan\" construing \"the law for its own empowerment.\"\n \n More than one opinion has cited back to Texas v. White, and they uniformly strike a balance between Federal and State sovereignty. A typical example is the following case (holding unconstitutional portions of Congressional legislation ordering state agencies how to deal with radioactive waste). Note in particular that SCOTUS declares the 10th. Amendment is alive and well:\n \n \"In a case like these, involving the division of authority between federal and state governments, the two inquiries are mirror images of each other. If a power is delegated to Congress in the Constitution, the Tenth Amendment expressly disclaims any reservation of that power to the States; if a power is an attribute of state sovereignty reserved by the Tenth Amendment, it is necessarily a power the Constitution has not conferred on Congress. See United States v. Oregon, 366 U.S. 643, 649 (1961); Case v. Bowles, 327 U.S. 92, 102 (1946); Oklahoma ex rel. Phillips v. Guy F. Atkinson Co., 313 U.S. 508, 534 (1941).\n \n It is in this sense that the Tenth Amendment \"states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered.\" United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 124 (1941). As Justice Story put it, \"[t]his amendment is a mere affirmation of what, upon any just reasoning, is a necessary rule of interpreting the constitution. Being an instrument of limited and enumerated powers, it follows irresistibly, that what is not conferred, is withheld, and belongs to the state authorities.\" 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 752 (1833). This has been the Court's consistent understanding: \"The States unquestionably do retai[n] a significant measure of sovereign authority . . . to the extent that the Constitution has not divested them of their original powers and transferred those powers to the Federal Government.\" Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, supra, at 549 (internal quotation marks omitted).\" New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 156 (1992)\n \n And the portion citing Texas v. White:\n \n The Court has made the same point with more rhetorical flourish, although perhaps with less precision, on a number of occasions. In Chief Justice Chase's much-quoted words, \"the preservation of the States, and the maintenance of their governments, are as much within the design and care of the Constitution as the preservation of the Union and the maintenance of the National government. The Constitution, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union, composed of indestructible States.\" Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725 (1869). See also Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U.S. 514, 523 [Page 163] (1926) (\"[N]either government may destroy the other nor curtail in any substantial manner the exercise of its powers\"); Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U.S. 455, 458 (1990) (\"[U]nder our federal system, the States possess sovereignty concurrent with that of the Federal Government\"); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S., at 461 (\"[T]he States retain substantial sovereign powers under our constitutional scheme, powers with which Congress does not readily interfere\").\n New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 162-163 (1992)\n \n SCOTUS didn't empower the Leviathan in this case. It jumped on the beast and bit him in the tail-not unlike what it did to the District of Columbia in Heller.",
