   "What's the best way to prevent mass shootings? Australia has decided that banning guns is the answer.\n \n In 1996, Martin Bryant used semi-automatic weapons to murder 35 people and injure another 18 in Australia. As a result, in 1997 Australia had a big gun buyback. The Australian government bought back semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, and pump-action shotguns. The Australian government paid about $500 Australian dollars ($300 US dollars) for each gun. \n http://www.guncontrol.org.au/\n \n In October of 2002, a man killed two people and wounded five others with his handguns at an Australian university. Now the Australian government is going to have a national handgun buyback. They are banning 500 different models of handguns. \n http://www.news.com.au/common/printpage/0,6093,5629196,00.html\n \n I'll try to find some links to Australian crime data.",

   "The least costly firearm I own is about $600, there are more that are 2X as much.\n \n If the government forces me to sell them by making them illegal, then I would call that stealing. I don't want to sell them and I surely don't want to sell them for less that what they are worth.\n \n Just because the authority gives you money for your property does not make it right.\n \n A sale is a contract between two parties that agree to exchange money for property or services. That is not a sale, it is stealing.",
