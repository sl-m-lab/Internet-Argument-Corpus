You're breaking up.\n \n Some time about the third century the leaders of the Church met to decide what was and was not the inspired word of God. They kept some and threw out some of the earlier traditional writings. These books were written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. In the 4th century St. Jerome translated the Biblia into the common language of the day, Latin. In the 16th Century the Church again affirmed the books that constituted the Bible. Protestant sects reject some of these books based on the mystical significance of the number of books in the Old Testament and whether Christ was ever represented to have quoted one of these books.\n \n The first English Bible was the Douay-Rhiems translation, used by the Catholic Church until the 1960's. The King James Version was finished in 1611 and is still the predominant version used among fundamentalist christians.\n \n Jewish sacred writings are not called \"the Bible\".
