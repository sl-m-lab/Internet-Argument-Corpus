   " Now you are making assumptions. I said God did not tell them the different categories of animals, I did not say that God deliberately kept information from them. \n\n No, they are the same. God diliberately kept information fro them because He knew they would not understand, just like you would deliberately keep information not pertinent to you children because they will not understand. How we came about wasn't as pertinent as why and who, so thats what He told us. It could kinda be like the stork. You know your kids won't understand (and don't yet need to) about sex and child birth, so when your five year old comes up and asks where do babies come from SOME parents (not all, I know I won't, but SOME do) say that the stork brings babies. They put a myth in place of a fact that the children don't need to know. Furthermore, even if God did explain evolution, if the men He explained it to didn't understand. Which they probably wouldn't have seeing as they had no sense of time, biology, genetics, or even basic anatomy (all pertinent to evolution) then they would have transcribed something VERY different. If God told them \"In the beginning I created the Heavens and the Earth in the first billion years, I said let there be light and I caused a tiny powerful ball of matter with an enormous mass to explode and with that came the heavens and the Earth. At first the Earth w\" Lets see primitive man wouldnt have understood 'billion years' 'tiny ball of matter with an enormous mass' 'explode.' So what do we have left. \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth, He said Let there be Light and there was.\" I know that isn't the Bible verse, but do you see my point. Even if God didn't as you say 'diliberately' (which in my opinion implies malice, but you may use that word in reference to God if you wish to do so) keep the information from us. In the minds of man it could have been simplified enormously to a point of mythological proportions. A modern day example would be the theory of relativity. Have you ever had it explained to you. I have. It is extremely complicated and few people REALLY understand it. Anyway, when my father explained it to me when I was about 16, we talked about it for several hours (literally) and through all his complicated explanations and answers to my questions, my brain pretty much reduced it to \"As you approach the speed of light time slows down compared to things not going that fast. But that does not mean when you slow back down you will not return to their same 'time.' Time IS relative.\" Now I still don't understand how time is relative or how time would slow down as you reach the speed of light, or even how you would return to their same 'time.' I can simply regurgitate the facts. Man back then wouldn't have understand evolution so it would have been simplified similarly. Simplify it to just the facts, ignore the how and put it into a time frame that you can understand and thats good enough.\n \n \nEverything that is in the Bible tells us about creation. For petes sake, CREATION TELLS US ABOUT CREATION! \n\n Huh???\n \nThere is no possible way that we \"evolved\" from microorganisms. Do you know how small the chances are that that happened?! They're barely chances at all at this point.\n\n Again huh??? I don't believe evolution happened by chance, I still believe in ID. I believe evolution was a guided process. He knew what He wanted, but like everything else that He made, He did it in a way that we could one day understand\n \n \n It says that God created man on the sixth day. Not over millions of years. \n\n Are you aware that in the original text the word \"yom\" is what was in place of our english word day. Unfortunately \"yom\" doesn't strictly mean day it is a time period, and the exact meaning is unclear. God gives us the order, we came last. Furthermore, are you aware that God's time is NOT our time. So even if God told them it happened in a day, was it His day or ours???",

But you start this post with a flame, then you continue you it further with an even more irrelevant claim where you even stated that you had read nothing but one of my posts and you base you whole conclusion on out discussion on that???\n \n \n \ni do think there are some figurative language in the bible but genisis 1:1 is not one of those versus. \n\n And you just did what you chastise me for in your next sentence\n \nand to sarah who says that God didnt do this and God did do that im sorry but unless ur God then you cant say what he did/didnt do. \n\n This is a debate forum, key word being debate. We debate things, we give our opinions and we support them. But as everyone is taught when they learn to write essays it is ridiculous to put \"I think\" or \"I believe\" or \"maybe\" in front of everyone of your opinions, Everyone knows it is your opinion and everyone should know that it is not positively true (unless you are stating an empirical fact, but that too should be obvious). But to put \"I believe\" and \"maybe\" and \"I think\" rampid throughout your post is ridiculous because not only does it take time, but it automatically makes your argument sound weak. So if you cannot see the implied \"In my opinion\" I am sorry, but I have no intention of going back on my thouroughly taught writing skills for you.\n \nalso for me creation always wins over evolution because of one big piece of proof. THE BIBLE... it says that God created the heavens and the earth so thats what i believe. \n\n I do too, did I ever say that I didn't\n \nthats what i put my faith in. im not going to put my faith in men(scientists) they were not here when the earth was created. \n \n The men who wrote the Bible weren't here when the world was created either. Only God was, the Bible may be inspired by God, but it was written by men, so it is NOT infallible. \n \nto say that your going to believe what a bunch of men say over what the bible says is stupid. \n\n You are obviously ignorant on the subject of evolution or science.\n \nto say your a christian and tell me that you dont believe that the bible but youw ill believe men?? thats being a hypocrit. \n\n I do believe the Bible, to the furthest extent I can without LYING TO MYSELF. Like I have said before, I choose to follow God's Laws (i.e the Ten Commandments which would have been pretty hard to screw up) before I insist on believing Dogma without knowing why. God gave us brains and intelligence so that we could figure things out.\n \n and to say that some christian denomonations believe and accept evolution then i also must ? \n\n No, you obviously are not reading the arguments in their contexts. I never said you should believe anything. I simply pointed out that Cali's statement about MOST Christians believing in a literal Genesis was false. That was my only point.\n \n next your going to tell me that the bible is not true when it says that accepting Jesus as your personal lord and savior is the only way to heaven. \n\n Strawman argument, totally worthless and unfounded\n \nmaybe they messed that up and some scientists will find a back door somewhere.(yea thats not going to happen) personally it sounds to me like you are idolizing men. \n\n Empty assumptions, you don't know me and you are making empty arguments worth nothing more than emotional appeal to the ignorant\n \nand if this sounds like a \"holy'er than tho\" speech its not because i do look at myself everyday and think of how i can live my life for Him better. think of this as a sunday school lesson.

Ask yourself what makes evolution so \"evil\". \n \n We all agree that God is omnipotent, that is all-powerful. Since when did all-powerful come to mean instantaneous? Would it in any way \"weaken\" God for this creation to have followed a logical creative path of evolution? Of course not, but modern Christianity has demonized logic and reason as tools of the devil and we forget these are two very important creations of God. There was nothing inherently evil on Earth before man came along. \n \n Everything on Earth follows a logical, sensible, and rational order, and I think that it is in this order that God rules and for him to break it would be to break his own laws. the laws he gave this Earth. Many people have this preconception that God is only present in miraculous cures, in red moons, and so forth; but God is in the adherance to to the laws (in my humble opinion). Not that God does not have the ability to break them however. Tell me Calli, what is wrong with God employing his own laws and his own creative mastery in the creation of man instead of just \"poof\" now you have man?

You're acting like a method in which we could have become to be is seperate from God. If evolution happened it could not exist outside of God, just like anything else that is created. He rules and masters it. You completely missed the entire point of what I was saying, I never said that God created the laws of this universe so that he could be ruled by them. I have no idea where you pulled that from. What I said was that people have seperated God from the things that he created.

Spiritually shallow people feed off of miracles, the breaking of these laws, and fail to see the face of God in the everyday adherence to them.

God could have created everything in an instant couldn't He have?? Did he get \"help\" if He did it in 6 days??? No. So what if He did it over a long period of time through guided evolution, that doesn't mean He needed \"help.\" Evolution is a scientific way in which we understand HOW the world came about.

Argon gas, brought up from deep inside the earth within the molten rock, was already present in the lavas when they cooled. We know the true ages of the rocks because they were observed to form less than 50 years ago. Yet they yield 'ages' up to 3.5 million years which are thus false. How can we trust the use of this same 'dating' method on rocks whose ages we don't know? If the method fails on rocks when we have an independent eye-witness account, then why should we trust it on other rocks where there are no independent historical cross-checks?\"\n \n \"Fossils are almost never dated by radiometric methods, since they rarely contain suitable radioactive elements. A common way of dating\n fossils (and rocks which do not contain radioactive elements) is by 'dating' an associated volcanic rock. This is commonly done using the K-Ar method. It depends on the rate at which radioactive potassium decays into the gas argon. The K-Ar method works on the assumption that the 'clock' begins to 'tick' the moment that the rock hardens. That is, it assumes that no argon derived by radioactive decay was present initially, but after the lava cooled and solidified, the argon from radioactive decay was unable to escape and started to accumulate. However, it is well-known that if a radiometric 'date' contradicts a fossil-derived (evolutionary) age, the date is discarded as erroneous.\"\n \n Resource:http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/magazines/docs/cenv22n1_dating_failure.asp\n \n Creation's \"proof\" is that there is no proof for evolution.

I am sorry, I meant the Earth and everything in it. \n \n \nOkay, let's get away from the \"help\" topic we've started here. If you believe in evolution, I want some solid proof. \n\n You were the one who started the argument about if God used evolution it meant He needed Help, I was just refuting it. And I am hardly qualified, nor do I have the time to give you a lesson in evolution, it took 15 weeks, 8 hours a week to convince me. If you don't know the solid proof then you either don't understand science and scientific method, or you haven't REALLY studied the details of evolution. And again high school doens't count, they do a LOUSY job of teaching evolution in highschool (IMHO).\n \n \nWait a minute, I thought you agreed that God was separate from time and space?! (You know, the whole \"yom\" arguement and all.) Try again. \n\n Yes, but we are talking in OUR time. 6 days of OUR time is not instantaneous, of course it could be instantaneous in God's time. Although I beleive it is actually the other way around and our time goes much faster than his. (and the \"whole 'yom' argument and all\" was to point out that the Bible may actually have be written to say that God created the world in long periods, not days. It had nothing to do with what God's time was, it had to do with how HUMANS wrote it for OUR time.) Yes, fine we have established God's time is not our time, He is outside those laws, He is all powerful, blah blah blah, I know all this. THAT is NOT the point or even the question, the question is how long of OUR time did it take him??? So all this it weakens God to say He took longer etc. is irrelevant b/c like you said God is outside our time and space. So how do we know it took 6 of OUR days??\n \n [quote}1)What scientific facts? Give me some proof. \n 2)What?! (What was that supposed to mean?) \n\n 1) If you have no proof then you have lied about having studied evolution in detail\n 2)It is an argument some creationists make when presented with evidence that undoubtably indicates an old Earth...they claim that God created the Earth in 6 days, 4000 years ago, and He created it to appear old with all the fossils already in it. Which is fine with me, it just doesn't seem too likely, but then again I guess it is as likely as anything else.\n \n And Cali, you didn't respond to this...\n \n Evolution is a scientific way in which we understand HOW the world came about. Just like blood vessels, and nerves, and internal organs are a way we understand HOW a body works. The Bible mentions blood and disease, but anatomy and biology let us really understand it. If evolution is bad and wrong then are those also?? Just like photosythesis is a way we understand HOW plants live. Just because these things work in a complex way that we can understand doesn't mean God needs \"help\" to make them work. He could of course just make people exist, no organs, no blood, no complicated nerve systems to make us work, we could just magically and instantaneously work, but we don't. Same with plants, but they don't. It could just rain, but no, He made it so we understand how it rains. Same with a million other things in the world. So why couldn't God have done the same thing with Creation. Yes, God created the world. But why couldn't God have done it in a way that we could one day understand how, like He did everything else. \n\n Tell me, why is it that we understand everything else God made scientifically whether or not it was mentioned in the Bible, but we can't do the same with creation?? Or do you not believe in ANY science???",

THAT is NOT the point or even the question, the question is how long of OUR time did it take him???

There is no proof that it took trillions of years. Evolutionists have been searching for missing links in fossils since Darwin invented the idea of evolution. Have they found any? No!

They (the fossils) should show a slow process of evolving into a bird. But they don't. All we find is a half bird half reptile thing.

It doesn't make sense to me. \n\n \n This is the 3rd and last time I am going to say this I NEVER EVER  said ANYTHING about you giving me proof. There did that catch your attention because I have already said it twice and you keep insisting that you shouldn't have to give me evidence if I don't give you any. You are ABSOLUTELY correct, you shouldn't give me evidence because I haven't asked you for any. I never said I wanted evidence from you I just said that I have neither the time nor the degree to teach you evolution...if you are really that interested in hearing it take a class. If not more power to you. Because it doesn't affect me one way or another.\n \n \nYeah, us creationists talk about missing links because you evolutionists can't find any! \n\n Can't find any missing links?? So there are no missing links, so all the links are filled we;ve proved our point GREAT!! ;) See how much quote mining can change the meaning of a quote...\n \n \nWhy aren't missing links necessary?

Or are YOU afraid that your \"faith\" is too fragile to stand a class on creation? \n\n Oh wait, I have...I was a creationist for 18 years of my life. 10 of which I was coherent enough to understand some aspects of science and about 5 of which I understood the more complex ones. I know all the Creationist arguments, I have used them. And I used to be a darn good creationist debater...I could almost convince atheists who just didn't understand enough science to refute me. I had learned evolution in high school. I could repeat the facts, but I didn't believe them. I never argued with high school biology teachers becasue they didn't know enough about it to argue back. Then cam college. I took a course in evolution, because I am a curious and open-minded person. I went to class I took the notes and I talked to my prof. during his office hours. For each of the proofs he gave me, I gave him reasons (creationist arguments) that they weren't proof or that they were wrong, and he was able to easily refute any argument I gave him. I always questioned him and refuted things in the book, but he always refuted mine right back, and he did a better job and used undeniable empirical evidence. (No I am not going to give you any here I have neither the time nor the degree) At this point I was a very confused Christian, I talked to other Christians, I found sites online and then I found a creationist debate site. I asked what they thought and after hearing points from all sides: atheist, hard-core creationist, theistic evolution, self-righteous butt heads. I came to my own conclusion with all the facts that I had. Since then I have seen Kent Hovind speak...and I uh...won't go there. The fact of the matter is...can my belief in an old evolved earth withstand creationist arguments...I would say so. Have I taken classes in Creation...heck yeah. Will I take more in the future...sure if I think they have anything to add to my knowledge. In fact there is a professor at my college who is a creationist and if he ever speaks I will certainly go to hear him. So am I close minded or afraid to learn something new or change my opinion...no. I look to find the truth through facts and knowledge. Because after all when you find truth you find God. So instead of attempting to turn my question back to me, why don't you actually ask yourself...are you afraid to take a detailed class in evolution taught by someone with a PhD...could Creationism stand up to it. I can't answer that question for you, and I can't even tell you whether you should try to find the answer or not, it's your choice. But don't forget, whenever you believe something don't just belive it because someone said so, find out WHY you believe it to make sure that you should\n \n \n \nOnce again, I say that I \"know\" the evidence but it is faulty and incomplete. It is YOUR JOB to try and convince me otherwise. \n\n Nope, not my job I could care less. If you want to remain ignorant, please do, it just irritates me that so many Christians are so amazingly close minded. I looked back at how this thread was started and we are so far off now. The fact of the matter is that this thread was started with a flame calling CHristians who believed in evolution hypocrits. No one proved we were hypocrits. Whether we are right is not necessarily the point, the better question is whether we are wrong. Can you prove I am wrong...nope. Can I prove your wrong...nope. COuld I throw evidence for an old Earth and evolution at you and see if you could explain it all away with creationist arguments, sure couldm but I don't have the time. I could try to prove that evolution (theistic evolution) is more probable, but thats the limit. No one knows the final truth and that is it.\n \n \n(Well, I guess I could debate with myself, but that's not very much fun.) \n\n Why not? You are doing that already by only half answering most of my points.\n \n \nI was not being defensive, I was simply saying that I don't necessarily believe in the \"old earth\" theory. \n\n Ok, but I didn't say you did, at all...\n \n \n Even if God guided evolution, there would be fossils to prove it. \n\n There are fossils. (and please don't ask me for the specific ones, I have already told you I don'thave the time, if you are really interested take a class)\n \n \n You have no proof that God gave us a \"second stomach\" to digest hard things.\n\n SUre I do, its called the appendix, what else do you think it is for?\n \n \n That proves my point because it means that evolutionists can't explain everything. (Although they may try to.) \n\n You are absolutely right, evolutionists don't know everything, in fact there is a TON they don't know. I don't have a problem with that I never said they were 100% right, I just said that there is too much evidence for an old Earth, and evolving species to belive in a 4000 year old Earth made in six days \n \n \n You know what, you may be on to something with that Satan idea. Maybe he worked through Darwin to effectively divide believers over the issue of creation. \n\n Wow and I was being sarcastic. His doing that would acomplish what exactly??? And don;t even say to \"separate the true believers from the fake ones\"\n \n \nI am going to ask you one more time, where is the proof for evolution? Where are the milllions of fossilized links with slow and obvious changes supposedly caused by the \"evolving process\"? \n \n And I am going to say to you one more time, take a class, I am not going to give it to you. There are millions of fossilized links showing slow and obvious changes. Horse fossils show a very gradual evolution to what is today considered the horse (but oh wait you knew that since you studied evolution so well with such and open mind.) There is also this little thing called punctuated equilibrium where there is a sudden large change (usually thought to have been caused by mutation) But again, since you studied evolution you knew about that.\n \n \n It is useless to debate with you if you aren't going to give me any CONCLUSIVE evidence. \n\n You are absolutely right, I am not going to provide you with CONCLUSIVE evidence, if you were that interested and/or that open minded you would go take a class and get it on your own. And you are right about this debate being useless, we are at a stalemate, saying the same things over and over again (and you are ignoring parts of my posts). One thing I have learned about debating, is when you have to repeat one thing 8 times in one post in hopes of your opponent catching it finally after already having posted it twice before...the discussion is over.",
