   "Hamas leader Abdel Aziz Rantisi has been killed today in Gaza City. I'm sure this is just another attack that will further the cycle of violence. Since the killing of the former Hamas leader Sheik Yassin, many Palestinian women and children have been killed or injured. The unilateral decision for Israel to oppress and punish it's neighbor continues on. Curfews, restrictions of water, the building of the wall, people beaten and shot at peaceful rallies, demolition of homes, jailing of children, I could go on forever. One leader was killed today, but Palestinians die all the time. Contrary to what Sharon says, the Palestinian people do not have a partner in peace, Israeli's have only shown means of oppression and terror. It is a shame that through media related propaganda, the victims, the Palestinians have had little to no coverage. I understand that the Israeli's suffer from the fear and the horror of suicide bombings. However the Palestinians go through anguish and collective punishment on a daily basis, they have witnessed the destruction of their economy by the Israeli government, they have seen there towns and facilities taken away from them before their eyes. They have seen their children, wives, husbands and relatives die. They live under an oppressive force that has no compassion or remorse. This latest killing is just another attempt to unilaterally destroy the hopes of a two state solutions, the hopes of preserving order, and the hopes of viable peace.\n \n Remi\n Check out my new website, poeticinjustice.net, the underground voice in politics",

Are you already forgetting there was a suicide bombing just hours before the assasination of this terrorist?\n \n Its a case of self-defense. Its very simple to see that. \n \n Unlike this terrorist, the IDF wished to kill the leader of a terrorist orginization but this terrorist wished the kill innocent civilians in markets, buses and schools. \n \n Of course the world outcries condemnation. The PA and PLO both headed by Arafat (a well known terrorist) have refused to do anything to combat terror so it should be no suprise to them that Israel is forced into this position of self-defense.\n \n I hope this conflict ends.

   "One point that I would like to make regarding HAMAS in general; it seems that we Americans often misunderstand the actual nature of HAMAS and its appeal to the Palestinian people. In its organizational style, HAMAS <and Hezbollah incidentally< are far more similiar to the Black Panther Party in America or the African National Congress in South Africa <when they were still violent and Nelson Mandela was a \"terrorist\"<. HAMAS only has a small militant wing know as Izzadeen Qassam;this is the people we get to know on the evening news as suicide bombers. They are also part of the organization which organizes violence both against the occupation and Israeli civilians. The main portion of HAMAS <receives over 90% of the organization's funds< is actually a social welfare organization which operates hospitals, schools, clinics, shelters, etc. in addition to providing food relief, immunizations, scholarships, etc. Because neither the Israeli occupiers, nor the Palestinian Authority provides these basic and necessary services, HAMAS finds strong support in the dispossessed Palestinians living in abject poverty. \n \n Just as a disclaimer, I have no love for violence against civilians and dispise HAMAS attacks against Israeli civilians as much as I dislike Israel's brutal occupation and indescriminate attacks against civilians",

There is some evidence that Iran provides funding to Hamas's military wing; the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimates that US$3 million flows between Iran and Hamas each year. The organization operates a complex network of fund-raising activities that focus on raising money for charitable activities. Some of the money is raised through Western-based Hamas aid agencies such as the Texas-based Holy Land Foundation, the Palestinian Development and Relief Fund based in Great Britain, Germany's Al-Aqsa Foundation, and France's Comit\u00e9 de Bienfaisance et Solidarit\u00e9 avec la Palestine. Funds donated through these organizations are ostensibly for charitable purposes, including funding sewing and weaving centers and cattle farms. But Western intelligence sources have determined that some of the aid earmarked for \"orphans and the needy\" is distributed to families of Hamas suicide bombers and those in Israeli prisons arrested for terrorist activities. In December 2001, President George W. Bush issued an executive order freezing the U.S. assets of individuals and groups with links to Hamas.\n \n In addition to funding its military or terrorist operations, Hamas devotes much of its $70 million annual budget to an extensive network of social services, which includes schools, orphanages, mosques, health care clinics, soup kitchens, and sports leagues. According to Israeli scholar Reuven Paz, approximately nine-tenths of its funding is for social, welfare, and educational activities. Since the Palestinian Authority often fails to provide such services, Hamas's efforts in this area further explain much of its popularity.\"\n \n Here is the link for the website if you wish to explore more the organization, they elaborate even further on the main, social-welfare aspect of HAMAS then I stated in my previous post.\n \n http://www.routledge-ny.com/religionandsociety/war/hamas.html\n \n \n as for your second point:\n \n ummmm yep....thats what all governments do....gain favour with their people, \"educate\" children, spread propaganda, and recruit soldiers. emoticon_xkill",
