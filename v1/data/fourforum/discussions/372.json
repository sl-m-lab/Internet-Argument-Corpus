   "I can only tell you that Hans Blix failed to mention the new revelation that Iraq has converted two L-29 Drones into biological and chemical weapons delivery systems, and that the Iraqis later tried to dismantle the evidence, in his latest report to the U.N.. \n \n source: Defense Tech\n \n Furthermore, Blix also ignored that fact that inspectors have found cluster bombs that put Iraq in further violate of the countless resolutions regarding disarmament. The cluster bombs that were found are perfect for chemical and biological dispersal.\n \n source: Fox News\n \n The credibility of Blix is waning, as is the credibility of the U.N. Security Counsel. Why would he downplay such important discoveries in his latest report? Is Blix enjoying the lime-light a little too much?",
