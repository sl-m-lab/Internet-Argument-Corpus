   "For David Horowitz to call former President Carter \"a Jew Hater\" is slander in its purist form. Zionists supporters such as David Horowitz are the real anti-Semites that feed the flames for more wars. President Carter's book \"Palestine Peace Not Apartheid\" is a book that criticizes the policies and actions of the State of Israel. If the American taxpayers understood the true reality of the Palestinian-Israeli Crisis and its connection to the rage and hate of the people in the Middle East towards the United States and Israel. In the Iraq Study Group Report in the Executive Summary; \"The United States cannot achieve its goals in the Middle East unless it deals directly with the Arab-Israeli conflict and regional instability\". \n \n The tide is beginning to turn of the American people's understanding of the problems and realities on the ground in the Middle East. There will be no peace in the Middle East until the Palestinian-Israeli Crisis is resolved in a satisfactory manner for both sides. At an Arab League summit on March 28, 2002 Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah who now is King of Saudi Arabia introduce and passed a resolution to normalize relations with the State of Israel with all Arab states, if the State of Israel will conform to United Nation Resolutions 194 and 242. The Israeli Defense Forces on the next day takeover control and destroy the office compound of Prime Minister Yasir Arafat in Ramallah. The Israelis have only convinced the American public and government that the Palestinians are the terrorists and they the victims while the majority of nations and people in the world see Israel as a terrorist state. \n \n Just in the Twenty-First Century alone the governments of Israel and United States have done more to undermined peace and security in the Middle East. The United States unconditional financial and military support of the State of Israel makes the American people responsible for Israel military offensive actions taken against her neighbors. With Israel and the United States winning the military battles while losing the hearts and minds of the people in the region and world. As long as the United States and Israel destroy more bridges than they build there will be no peace and security in the Middle East and for that matter the world. \n http://www.globalcrier.blogspot.com/",

   "Unthinkable things are happening in Iraq! Yankees are creating and approbating their new types of weapons (radiological and chemical ones including) in Iraq. I've seen such info in the world web btw. Now it is getting much worse! Islamic rebels are burgling into some top secret American chemical labs or stores to later terrorize local population by using the stuff at crowded places thus making situation unstable. They say the latest such use of poisonous substances took place in the centre of Baghdad!! Damned Yankees!! They can't preserve peace and safety in Iraq. Fancy they just seized all the Iraqis and other people in that market place including kids and aged people, stuffed them into transport vehicles and took them away to some unknown destination. \n I am a foreigner in Iraq. I witnessed the scene and luckily escaped that seizure. I couldn't grasp it first but locals explained to me that Americans \"were doing cleansings to cover traces of a test or terror attack\" this way. It was hard to tell for sure what was it exactly that time. Many Iraqis are fearful to go marketing 'cause this not the first such case they say. \n I am about to leave Iraq but something must be done to stop this!!",

   "As reported by the governor of Helmand, Asadullah Wafa at least 700 militants of the Taliban have recently crossed Afghano-Pakistani border. Due to data, confirmed by US military intelligence, they planned to destroy Kajaki dam, which is an important source of water and electricity in this southern province of Afghanistan. There were militants of Pakistani, Uzbek and Chechen origin. \n Moreover, according to reports of Allied command in Iraq Talibs, leaded by Chechen rebels, plan to attack water-power stations there, too. The activization of Taliban militants' actions became possible, because Chechen field commanders began to receive constant financial help from Goldfarb's fund, established in UK and operated on money of notorious exiled Russian oligarch, B. Berezovsky, who is famous for his close relations with Chechen militants and their leaders...\n Well, I wonder what our British pals from US-led coalition troops (who venture their lives every day in Iraq and Afghanistan) will be saying when they get to learn that British government gives shelter for such persons as Berezovsky and his Chechen \"partners\"!",

   "Jews are living in Iran and other countries in the Middle East. Jews have lived where the current state of Israel stands for 2000 years under Arab rule.

The country? Saudi Arabia, our allie in the war on terror. Iran?? Iran has over 2 million Jews living there with little to no complaint (They visit us, so we actually know). Lebanon and Syria has massive Christian populations and the Palestinians have a fair Christian population as well. Afghanistan currently has laws preventing the conversion to Christianity and we own the place. It seems to me that the last people on earth that will find an Antichrist are Christians because in Afghanistan and Iraq, they had to flee, they are gone where we have won.

   "There is no doubt today that al-Maliki's time in office is getting over. During last year, he proved very skillfully that the only thing he is not concerned about is the security and tranquility in Iraq. During this period, the violence and slaughter of innocent citizens climbed to its maximum. The militias found enough latitude to infiltrate into all governmental organizations, and in fact, rule the country. If not all, most of these militias are one way or the other associated with Iran, and have paved the path for Iran's hidden occupation of Iraq. \n Maliki's background shows that he has had close ties with Iran's Quds force, and commanded terrorist battalions when he was in Iran before Saddam's fall.\n Today, even Bush is not willing to back him, and yet, what still delays his dismissal is that Bush refrains to acknowledge that investing on him was a grave mistake from the outset. In fact it has been betting on a dead horse.\n \n The question today, however, is what are the alternatives for the future of Iraq? \n Before thinking of individuals, the current political situation in Iraq suggest two main alternatives for post-Maliki's era. Each of these alternatives illustrates a totally different future for Iraq and the Middle East region:\n \n One alternative is the continuation of the policy that started with Ibrahim Ja'fari, and was 'promoted' to al-Maliki. Due to its affiliation to Tehran, it has been basically in the service of Iran's government and to pursue its policies in Iraq. This alternative was born with the foundation of Islamic republic, and its ultimate goal has been to establish an Islamic fundamentalist empire in the region. To this end, Iraq has been the first and vital target. Because of its nature, this alternative can advance only via terrorism, turmoil and violence. Therefore, peace, calm and democracy are dreadful threats for that.\n \n The other alternative, which has been created vis-\u00e0-vis the first alternative, is a young alternative with completely different characteristics. Contrary to the first one, it believes in democracy and participation of all sectors of the society in governing the country. Its deeply against sectarianism and religionism. The period of Ayad Allawi as prime minister was a sample of this alternative in power when the situation in Iraq was more peaceful than any other time.\n \n The first alternative has the support of Iran. If the second one lacks support, it cannot resist before the Iran-backed conspiracies. \n \n The gravest mistake of Bush's administration was to invest on al-Maliki, an anti-democratic alternative, to establish stability in Iraq. \n \n These days, the political circles usually offer two figures as alternatives for the future of Iraq: Ayad Allawi and Adel Abdul Mehdi.\n \n Because of his close relations with Iran, Abdul Mehdi undoubtedly belongs to the anti-democratic alternative. He is the second figure in Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution in Iraq(SCIRI) that was formed in Iran in is in very close interrelations with the Quds force that is going to be inserted in the terror list. \n On the other side, Ayad Allawi is the most suitable representative of the democratic alternative. Despite being a Shiite, he has never been a puppet of Iran. During his time in office, Iraq lived its most democratic era. \n \n Today, deciding about the future of Iraq and the region goes through selecting one of these alternatives: Adel Abdul Mehdi or Ayad Allawi",

   "Alborz Taha, your closing in on the story.\n \n You can't paint the whole picture without discussing Ahmad Chalabi. Who gave us most of our WMD data pre-war and who gave Iran damaging secrets during the war.\n \n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5040831/\n \n (News Week)\n \n What most people haven't grasped yet is the fact that Saddam was hated by all the Islamic terror groups and the focal point of Iran's distain. Saddam limited all worship of Islam in Iraq. Saddam was baathist and a secular leader mirroring a Stalinist type regime. In factl; Saddam's attacks on his own people which gave him the death sentence was an attack on a Hezbollah type terror group supported by Iran.\n \n Iraq is:\n \n 60% Shia\n 15% Sunni (very low percentage)\n 20% Kurdish (which can be grouped because of their ethnic alliance before religious)\n \n Nearly the whole Shia parliament in Iraq had found refuge in Iran. Iran is a Shia religious state. Ahmad Chalabi was a spy for Iran which is mind boggling knowing he sat with Mrs. Bush right at the state of the Union address. It wouldn't be rocket science to consider a connection between Ahmad Chalabi and Iran. Iran and the Shia (and Sunni) resistance groups both wanted Saddam removed from power and that aim was how we got into the war to begin with. Basically Iran fed us everything we wanted to hear to justify an attack on Iraq. Iran was and is being fed all our Iraqi intelligence so they can counter our moves to block their interference even now. We have determined (in my mind) this basically can't be stopped due to the heavy alliances the Shia have with Iran.\n \n The Sunni block in Iraq is relatively small, smaller than the Kurdish block in the north. The Shia have laws preventing large portions the Sunni from ever gaining any real citizenship in Iraq (Basically Saddam's old Baathist group). The Shia are also cutting the oil revenue from the Sunni. This is what we have asked the Current Government to address now for than a year.\n \n The Sunni feel justification for providing a resistance to the current government and due to the construction of the Iraqi Parliament and their current laws, a natural divide occurred that is fueling Religious sectarian strife. The strife is so bad that even the Golden Mosque has been struck more than once (Shia religious monument). \n \n AL Qeada being a Sunni terror group is naturally rushing to the aid of the Sunni in Iraq. AL Qeada has fought Shia groups in the past (lost every time). Hezbollah has attacked AL Qeada in Lebanon once for attacking Israel. Not for any love of Israel, just to stop any uncontrolled aggression in the region.\n AL Qeada would be crushed in short order if the Shia Militias where allowed to mobilize. Any argument that our stay in Iraq is to address AL Qeada is a diversion. AL Qeada can not survive without the suppression of the Shia Militias in Iraq.\n \n There is no way to untie the influence Iran has in Iraq. We are coming to realize this some years later (wish someone would have asked). This is why our current commanders are now addressing alternatives to democracy in Iraq.",

   "Let's just think for a moment and play a game of prophecy and see if we can determine what is in store for us.\n \n We are basically led by a Zionist group that plays the democracy card which is the last card you would play if you wanted a peaceful restoration of the old Israeli state. The single worst move you could make if that was your aim.\n \n Turkey is a secular state with a Muslim majority. What can we foresee here? Naturally Turkey is going to vote for and install Islamic fundamental leaders. It's a given. The secular minority will be suppressed causing a possible civil war. (Gosh, I'm a seer)\n \n Saudi Arabia is under the control of a kingship which suppresses the populations by a minority group. Like Saddam, but the titles are a little different and the aims of the leadership is more capitalistic. The Saudis will see the democratic liberties of their brothers in the faith, all over the region and this will develop civil strife the Royals will have to suppress. So we will get to witness the birth of Saddam II, the better armed tyrant! (Should I give the future away?)\n \n Egypt is already voting in a heavy religious block into their Parliament and their intentions for the state have been made quite clear (Oh I'm good, I must be talking to God or something)\n \n The Palestinians living in camps voted for a leadership that wants them out of the camps at all costs. (This was clearly a shock. Who could have expected such an outcome? I mean, besides the whole civilized world)\n \n All the Nations listed will be at odds with a growing Israeli expansion into the occupied territories. The nations will grow. Turkey is currently an active trading partner with Israel. Will that remain? Egypt has a treaty with Israel. Lucky, no one ever backs out of a treaty. Hmm???\n \n Maybe History is made before the first shot is fired??",
