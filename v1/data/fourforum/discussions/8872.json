   "Look, some time ago I heard about secret tests of new US weapons during military conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Bosnia and Herzegovina but now Americans agreed with Taiwan. The fact is that between those countries there's secret agreement about delivering of new US ray weapons.\n It's well known that Taiwan is arming actively for defense from Chinese. It's not a secret that China concentrated against Taiwan 784 ballistic and 36 cruise missiles. In this connection Taiwan crated Anti-Tactical Ballistic Missile. But it seems it's going to be more an American test ground in Asia. Well, as I know Pentagon tested ray weapon lower-power. It can strike or be more exact paralyze enemy troops within range of 2 km. But now American has high-power ray weapon for longer distances and they are interested to test it. What if Chinese will be target?",
