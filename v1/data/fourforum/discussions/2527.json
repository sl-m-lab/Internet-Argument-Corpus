Where did you learn that \"You have a right if your government tells you that you do\". The government never gave me my rights. The government does not tell me or the People what to do. The government exists to serve the People and exists at the pleasure of The People. Have you ever read the Declearation of Independane and the Constitution?

I have them from the Creator and not any earthly man or power gave them to me or can take them away.\n \n The law says I don't need to justify \"need\" to own a gun. The only justification I need is \"I want one\". That is the nature of the right to own a gun or all the other rights. The only justification I need is \"I want it\" or \"I want to do it\". Quite frankly Sir even you asking the question \"why do you need a gun\" is insulting and undemocratic. The democratic principles, by which we all live by, I never have to just \"need\" to do any thing that is a right.\n \n I don't need to justify my \"need\" to:\n \n Vote.\n Own property.\n Peacfully gather in church.\n Dance.\n Publish a political paper.\n Buy a stick of gum or an expensive diamond.\n Have my house or person private.\n and own a gun.\n \n The only justification I \"need\" to do any of those rights is \"I want it\" or \"I want to do it\". According to democratic principles of rights I need no other justification. Even you trying to ask the question violates my 4th Amendment right to privacy.

   "Why do we have a \"right\" to carry or own guns we dont need ?\n\n \n Second Ammendment\n \n \n \nYou have a right if your government tells you that you do. If it changes it mind, that right no longer exists.\n\n \n From exactly what legal or historical precedent do you draw this conclusion? The rights laid down in the bill of rights are not gifts from our government, they are official recognition of pre-existing rights. The governement does not have the power to remove those rights, though they have at times illegally (as recognised by the supreme court) infinged upon them.\n \n If some choose to disregard the bill of rights, and by default the rest of the constitution, that is, I suppose, their privelage. I seriously doubt you will find the government wishes to do this, as the constitution provides the ONLY legal justification for the existance of our government. Without the constitution, there IS no government. \n \n While there are some who trust our government implicetly and wish for the creation of a nanny state, no reasonable person could possibly take this position. All governements throughout history, democratic or not, have eventually turned corrupt and fallen. There is no reason that we should believe the US government will not eventually end up the same. The RKBA, like many of the other rights recognised in the bill of rights, was put in place as a tool, reserved for the people, to use against a corrupt or tyranical government. \n \n \nFirearms do little good, unless you \n A: Happen to have your home invaded by an intruder\n\n \n This is not the purpose of the second Ammendment\n \n \nB: are well trained and psychologically prepared to shoot said intruder\n\n \n I am going to take this in two parts, first the \"well trained\".\n \n Anti gunners who use this argument must be, bar none, the stupidest people on the planet if they cannot learn to use a firearm without extensive training. I have taught 8 yr old kids to use a gun in less than 10 minutes, and had them firing decent scores at the end of 20 minutes. I have seen 14 yr old african kids who are illeterate and have spent their entire lives in little dirt villages without power, books, or modern conveniences, operate squad support class machine guns (and operate them well). \n \n Any adult with an IQ higher than your average house plant should be able to pick up and correctly operate your average weapon with only a cursory examination of the controls. In addition, an owners manual which explains the operation of the weapon is packaged with every new firearm sold in this country. If you purchase a used one which does not include the owners manual, every American manufacturer (and most foreign manufaturers) will provide you with one free of charge. \n \n Are you people really so stupid that you can't figure out how to fire a gun? You would have to be an absolut XXXXX to be unable to figure it out. As far as hitting what you are aiming at, when you are talking about the short ranges involved in home defense, anybody with even marginal hand eye coordination can do this with no problem.\n \n As far as the second part \"psychologically prepared\", every living creatures strongest instinct is that of self preservation. People are no different. While it is true that some people have seemingly managed to \"deprogram\" their instincts to the point that they will stand stupidly by and allow themselves to be killed rather than to defend their lives, this is just another fine example of darwinism. Let them die, the gene pool will be stronger without them polluting it.",

You want to know the biggest problem with certified gun owners. They are never willing to give an honest opinion regarding why they keep guns. Their only real defense is that the consitution says they have the right to bare arms (and this is such a vague declaration that it can be twisted to mean many things).\n \n So, to any gun owners, let me ask some questions, and please answer honestly.\n \n How many guns do you own?\n What kind of guns are they?\n Do you have children that are or were under the age of 19?\n If yes, Have your children ever touched or played with your gun?\n If yes, Have your children ever touched your gun outside of your supervision?\n If yes, Do you have a means of knowing whether or not you children has accessed your gun without your knowledge or consent? \n If yes, have your ever educated or punished your child for inquiring or infringing up on your gun?\n Do you believe a family with a child should own a gun?\n Do you believe it is necessary to own more than one gun?\n Do you believe it is necessary to own an assault rifle over say a shotgun?\n Do you live in a neighborhood were violence and break-ins occur on a regluar basis?\n Do you own guns simply as a hobby, recreation, or means of protection?\n In the event that you own a gun as a hobby, what is so interesting about them? Do you use the hobby guns?\n In the even that you own a gun for recreation, why?\n In the event that you own a gun for safety, do you keep it loaded?\n If you keep your gun loaded, is it locked up, away from you, or nearby?\n If it is locked up away from you, how does it protect you?\n If it is near you, is it possible for someone to steal it?\n If it is unloaded, do you keep it near you?\n If not, how does it protect you?\n Have you ever shot your gun while drunk?\n Have you ever shot your gun while under the influence of drugs?\n Do you think that many gun owners are negligent?\n Have you ever been negligent with a gun?\n How do you think guns and assault rifles get circulated?\n How does a gun owner propose that we stop unecessary gun violence?\n Does your proposal consider all of your answers above?\n Can you propose any other self-defense options other than owning a gun?\n Are you a member of the NRA?\n Are you white?\n -----------------------------\n \n I'm pretty lenient regarding the right to bare arms. I hate guns and I think they are wrong and should be banned entirely or else no one is safe, but I will recognize them as a fundamental of our consitution. My thought is that no one should be able to own more than one gun, and it must be a shotgun for defense or recreation.\n \n Assault rifles are far to deadly in the hands of children, whether it be in schools or on the street. Their high fire rate makes them too great a hazard, particularily in the hands of those who know how to use them. There is also no reason that anyone needs to protect themselves from 400 yards away. This is ludicrous.\n \n Hand guns should also be outlawed. They are too small and easy to conceal. Anyone could easily whip one out in a school or a convenient store. \n \n A shotgun is difficult to conceal except in large pants or a trenchcoat and is also clumsier to pull out when attacking. Furthermore, they are generally effective only at shorter ranges. Depending on the type, a shotgun generally holds 1-8 rounds. 8 rounds is more than plenty to protect your home. If you want to go hunting at longer ranges, be a real hunter and buy a bow.\n \n Let's be realistic here, you are more likely to get shot up out on the street, at work, or at school rather than by someone breaking into your home.",

   "Watch bowling for columbine and then try to formulate an intelligent opinion. You won't be able to. Kids are going to get a hold of guns as long as they exist in this country. You want to know the biggest problem with certified gun owners. They are never willing to give an honest opinion regarding why they keep guns. Their only real defense is that the consitution says they have the right to bare arms (and this is such a vague declaration that it can be twisted to mean many things).\n\n \n \n Moore is a liar. Moore is a propagandist... Put the kool-aid down and learn:\n \n \n BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE\n \n Documentary or Fiction?\n \n -David T. Hardy-\n \n Michael Moore's \"Bowling for Columbine\" won the Oscar for best documentary. Unfortunately, it is not a documentary, by the Academy's own definition.\n \n The injustice here is not so much to the viewer, as to the independent producers of real documentaries. These struggle in a field which receives but a fraction of the recognition and financing of the \"entertainment industry.\" They are protected by Academy rules limiting the documentary competition to nonfiction.\n \n Bowling is fiction. It makes its points by deceiving and by misleading the viewer. Statements are made which are false. Moore leads the reader to draw inferences which he must have known were wrong. Indeed, even speeches shown on screen are heavily edited, so that sentences are assembled in the speaker's voice, but which were not sentences he uttered. Bowling uses deception as its primary tool of persuasion and effect.\n \n A film which does this may be a commercial success. It may be entertaining. But it is not a documentary. One need only consult Rule 12 of the rules for the Academy Award: a documentary is a non-fictional movie. \n \n The point is not that Bowling is biased. No, the point is that Bowling is deliberately, seriously, and consistently deceptive.\n \n 1. Willie Horton. The first edition of the webpage had a section on falsification of the election ad regarding Willie Horton (the convict, not the baseball star). This was one of the earliest criticisms of Bowling--Ben Fritz caught it back in November, 2002.\n \n To illustrate politicians' (and especially Republican politicians') willingness to play the \"race card,\" Bowling shows what purports to be a television ad run by George Bush, Sr., in his race against Governor Dukakis. For those who weren't around back then -- Massachusetts had a \"prison furlough\" program where prisoners could be given short releases from the clink. Unfortunately, some of them never came back. Dukakis vetoed legislation which would have forbidden furlough to persons with \"life without parole\" sentences for murder, and authorities thereafter furloughed a number of murderers. Horton, in prison for a brutal stabbing murder, got a furlough, never returned, and then attacked a couple, assaulting both and raping the woman. His opponents in the presidential race took advantage of the veto.\n \n The ad as shown by Moore begins with a \"revolving door\" of justice, progresses to a picture of Willie Horton (who is black), and ends with dramatic subtitle: \"Willie Horton released. Then kills again.\"\n \n Fact: Bowling splices together two different election ads, one run by the Bush campaign (featuring a revolving door, and not even mentioning Horton) and another run by an independent expenditure campaign (naming Horton, and showing footage from which it can be seen that he is black). At the end, the ad ala' Moore has the customary note that it was paid for by the Bush-Quayle campaign. Moore intones \"whether you're a psychotic killer or running for president of the United States, the one thing you can always count on is white America's fear of the black man.\" There is nothing to reveal that most of the ad just seen (and all of it that was relevant to Moore's claim) was not the Bush-Quayle ad, which didn't even name Horton.\n \n Fact: Apparently unsatisfied with splicing the ads, Bowling's editors added a subtitle \"Willie Horton released. Then kills again.\"\n \n Fact: Ben Fitz also noted that Bowling's editors didn't bother to research the events before doctoring the ads. Horton's second arrest was not for murder. (The second set of charges were aggravated assault and rape).\n \n \n I originally deleted this from the main webpage, because in the VHS version of Bowling Moore had the decency to remove the misleading footage. But as Brendan Nyhan recently wrote in Spinsanity, he put it back in in the DVD version! He did make one minor change, switching his edited-in caption to \"Willie Horton released. Then rapes a woman.\" Obviously Moore had been informed of the Spinsanity criticism. He responded by correcting his own typo, not by removing the edited in caption, nor by revealing that the ad being shown was not in fact a Bush-Quayle ad.\n \n 2. NRA and the Reaction To Tragedy. A major theme in Bowling is that NRA is callous toward slayings. In order to make this theme fit the facts, however, Bowling repeatedly distorts the evidence.\n \n A. Columbine Shooting/Denver NRA Meeting. Bowling portrays this with the following sequence:\n \n Weeping children outside Columbine;\n \n Cut to Charlton Heston holding a musket and proclaiming \"I have only five words for you: 'from my cold, dead, hands'\";\n \n Cut to billboard advertising the meeting, while Moore intones \"Just ten days after the Columbine killings, despite the pleas of a community in mourning, Charlton Heston came to Denver and held a large pro-gun rally for the National Rifle Association;\"\n \n Cut to Heston (supposedly) continuing speech... \"I have a message from the Mayor, Mr. Wellington Webb, the Mayor of Denver. He sent me this; it says 'don't come here. We don't want you here.' I say to the Mayor this is our country, as Americans we're free to travel wherever we want in our broad land. Don't come here? We're already here!\"\n \n The portrayal is one of an arrogant protest in response to the deaths -- or, as one reviewer put it, \"it seemed that Charlton Heston and others rushed to Littleton to hold rallies and demonstrations directly after the tragedy.\" The portrayal is in fact false.\n \n \n Fact: The Denver event was not a demonstration relating to Columbine, but an annual meeting (see links below), whose place and date had been fixed years in advance.\n \n \n Fact: At Denver, the NRA cancelled all events (normally several days of committee meetings, sporting events, dinners, and rallies) save the annual members' voting meeting -- that could not be cancelled because the state law governing nonprofits required that it be held. [No way to change location, since under NY law you have to give 10 days' advance notice of that to the members, there were upwards of 4,000,000 members -- and Columbine happened 11 days before the scheduled meeting.] As a newspaper reported:\n \n In a letter to NRA members Wednesday, President Charlton Heston and the group's executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, said all seminars, workshops, luncheons, exhibits by gun makers and other vendors, and festivities are canceled.\n \n All that's left is a members' reception with Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., and the annual meeting, set for 10 a.m. May 1 in the Colorado Convention Center.\n \n Under its bylaws and New York state law, the NRA must hold an annual meeting.\n \n The NRA convention April 30-May 2 was expected to draw 22,000 members and give the city a $17.9 million economic boost.\n \n \"But the tragedy in Littleton last Tuesday calls upon us to take steps, along with dozens of other planned public events, to modify our schedule to show our profound sympathy and respect for the families and communities in the Denver area in their time of great loss,\" Heston and LaPierre wrote.\n \n \n Fact: Heston's \"cold dead hands\" speech, which leads off Moore's depiction of the Denver meeting, was not given at Denver after Columbine. It was given a year later in Charlotte, North Carolina, and was his gesture of gratitude upon his being given a handmade musket, at that annual meeting.\n \n Fact: When Bowling continues on to the speech which Heston did give in Denver, it carefully edits it to change its theme.\n \n Moore's fabrication here cannot be described by any polite term. It is a lie, a fraud, and a few other things. Carrying it out required a LOT of editing to mislead the viewer, as I will show below. I transcribed Heston's speech as Moore has it, and compared it to a news agency's transcript, color coding the passages. CLICK HERE for the comparison, with links to the original transcript.\n \n Moore has actually taken audio of seven sentences, from five different parts of the speech, and a section given in a different speech entirely, and spliced them together. Each edit is cleverly covered by inserting a still or video footage for a few seconds.\n \n First, right after the weeping victims, Moore puts on Heston's \"I have only five words for you . . . cold dead hands\" statement, making it seem directed at them. As noted above, it's actually a thank-you speech given a year later in North Carolina.\n \n Moore then has an interlude -- a visual of a billboard and his narration. This is vital. He can't go directly to Heston's real Denver speech. If he did that, you might ask why Heston in mid-speech changed from a purple tie and lavender shirt to a white shirt and red tie, and the background draperies went from maroon to blue. Moore has to separate the two segments.\n \n \n \n Moore's second edit (covered by splicing in a pan shot of the crowd) deletes Heston's announcement that NRA has in fact cancelled most of its meeting:\n \n \"As you know, we've cancelled the festivities, the fellowship we normally enjoy at our annual gatherings. This decision has perplexed a few and inconvenienced thousands. As your president, I apologize for that.\"\n \n Moore then cuts to Heston noting that Denver's mayor asked NRA not to come, and shows Heston replying \"I said to the Mayor: As Americans, we're free to travel wherever we want in our broad land. Don't come here? We're already here!\" as if in defiance.\n \n Actually, Moore put an edit right in the middle of the first sentence, and another at its end! Heston really said (with reference his own WWII vet status) \"I said to the mayor, well, my reply to the mayor is, I volunteered for the war they wanted me to attend when I was 18 years old. Since then, I've run small errands for my country, from Nigeria to Vietnam. I know many of you here in this room could say the same thing.\"\n \n Moore cuts it after \"I said to the Mayor\" and attaches a sentence from the end of the next paragraph: \"As Americans, we're free to travel wherever we want in our broad land.\" He hides the deletion by cutting to footage of protestors and a photo of the Mayor before going back and showing Heston.\n \n Moore has Heston then triumphantly announce \"Don't come here? We're already here!\" Actually, that sentence is clipped from a segment five paragraphs farther on in the speech. Again, Moore uses an editing trick to cover the doctoring, switching to a pan shot of the audience as Heston's (edited) voice continues.\n \n What Heston said there was:\n \n \"NRA members are in city hall, Fort Carson, NORAD, the Air Force Academy and the Olympic Training Center. And yes, NRA members are surely among the police and fire and SWAT team heroes who risked their lives to rescue the students at Columbine.\n \n Don't come here? We're already here. This community is our home. Every community in America is our home. We are a 128-year-old fixture of mainstream America. The Second Amendment ethic of lawful, responsible firearm ownership spans the broadest cross section of American life imaginable.\n \n So, we have the same right as all other citizens to be here. To help shoulder the grief and share our sorrow and to offer our respectful, reassured voice to the national discourse that has erupted around this tragedy.\"\n \n \"NRA members are, above all, Americans. That means that whatever our differences, we are respectful of one another and we stand united, especially in adversity.\"\n \n \n \n I recently discovered that Moore has set up a new webpage to respond to a chosen few points of criticism, one of which is his, er, creative editing of Heston's speech. Click here for a link to his page, and for my response to his attempted defense of what he did. Basically, Moore contends that he didn't mean for the viewer to get the impression that \"cold dead hands\" was spoken at Denver -- that just \"appears as Heston is being introduced in narration.\"\n \n B. Mt. Morris shooting/ Flint rally. Bowling continues by juxtaposing another Heston speech with a school shooting of Kayla Rolland at Mt. Morris, MI, just north of Flint. Moore makes the claim that \"Just as he did after the Columbine shooting, Charlton Heston showed up in Flint, to have a big pro-gun rally.\"\n \n \n Fact: Heston's speech was given at a \"get out the vote\" rally in Flint, which was held when elections rolled by some eight months after the shooting ( Feb. 29 vs Oct. 17, 2000).\n \n Fact: Bush and Gore were then both in the Flint area, trying to gather votes. Moore himself had been hosting rallies for Green Party candidate Nader in Flint a few weeks before.\n \n Here's the real setting, as reported in the Detroit Free Press one day after Heston's speech:\n \n What do Al Gore, Charlton Heston, Jesse Jackson, Lee Iacocca, and George W., Laura and Barbara Bush all agree upon?\n \n That Michigan is a really big deal right now. The candidates, their wives, mothers, and pals are here this week, as post-debate spin control ebbs and political ground control overtakes Michigan with 20 days left to Election Day.....Democratic nominee Gore is to campaign in Flint tonight; Texas Gov. Bush is to visit a Macomb County factory Thursday. . . . . For Republicans, other surrogates include former auto executive Lee Iacocca touting Bush at a luncheon today in Troy, and Tuesday's visit by National Rifle Association President and movie-Moses Charlton Heston.\n \n For the Democrats, the Rev. Jesse Jackson is seeking to mobilize black voters for the Gore ticket Thursday at Detroit's King High School, and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson will do the same at an Arab-American Chamber of Commerce dinner Friday in Livonia.\n \n How does Moore trick the viewer into believing that this speech, given in this context, was actually a defiant response to a shooting in a nearby town months before?\n \n Moore creates the impression that one event was right after the other so smoothly that I didn't spot his technique. It was picked up by Richard Rockley, who sent me an email.\n \n Moore works by depriving you of context and guiding your mind to fill the vacuum -- with completely false ideas. It is brilliantly, if unethically, done,. Let's deconstruct his method.\n \n The entire sequence takes barely 40 seconds. Images are flying by so rapidly that you cannot really think about them, you just form impressions.\n \n Shot of Moore comforting Kayla's school principal after she discusses Kayla's murder. As they turn away, we hear Heston's voice: \"From my cold, dead hands.\" [Moore is again attibuting it to a speech where it was not uttered.]\n \n When Heston becomes visible, he's telling a group that freedom needs you now, more than ever, to come to its defense. Your impression: Heston is responding to something urgent, presumably the controversy caused by her death. And he's speaking about it like a fool.\n \n Moore: \"Just as he did after the Columbine shooting, Charlton Heston showed up in Flint, to have a big pro-gun rally.\"\n \n Moore continues on to say that before he came to Flint, Heston had been interviewed by the Georgetown Hoya about Kayla's death... Why would this be important?\n \n Image of Hoya (a student paper) appears on screen, with highlighting on words of reporter mentioning Kayla Rolland's name, and highlighting on Heston's name (only his name, not his reply) as he answers. Image is on screen only a few seconds.\n \n Ah, you think you spot the relevance: he obviously was alerted to the case, and that's why be came.\n \n And, Moore continues, the case was discussed on Heston's \"own NRA\" webpage... Again, your mind seeks relevance....\n \n Image of a webpage for America's First Freedom (a website for NRA, not for Heston) with text \"48 hours after Kayla Rolland was prounced dead\" highlighted and zoomed in on.\n \n Your impression: Heston did something 48 hours after she died. Why else would \"his\" webpage note this event, whatever it is? What would Heston's action have been? It must have been to go to Flint and hold the rally.\n \n Scene cuts to protestors, including a woman with a Million Moms March t-shirt, who asks how Heston could come here, she's shocked and appalled, \"it's like he's rubbing our face in it.\" (This speaker and the protest may be faked, but let's assume for the moment they're real.). This caps your impression. She's shocked by Heston coming there, 48 hours after the death. He'd hardly be rubbing faces in it if he came there much later, on a purpose unrelated to the death.\n \n The viewer thinks he or she understands ....\n \n One reviewer: Heston \"held another NRA rally in Flint, Michigan, just 48 hours after a 6 year old shot and killed a classmate in that same town.\"\n \n Another:\"What was Heston thinking going to into Colorado and Michigan immediately after the massacres of innocent children?\"\n \n Let's look at the facts behind the presentation:\n \n Heston's speech, with its sense of urgency, freedom needs you now more than ever before. As noted above, it's actually an election rally, held weeks before the closest election in American history.\n \n Moore: \"Just as at Columbine, Heston showed up in Flint to have a large pro-gun rally.\" As noted above, it was an election rally actually held eight months later.\n \n Georgetown Hoya interview, with highlighting on reporter mentioning Kayla and on Heston's name where he responds.\n \n What is not highlighted, and impossible to read except by repeating the scene, is that the reporter asks about Kayla and about the Columbine shooters, and Heston replies only as to the Columbine shooters. There is no indication that he recognized Kayla Rolland's case. It flashes past in the movie: click here to see it frozen.\n \n \"His NRA webpage\" with highlighted reference to \"48 hours after Kayla Robinson is pronounced dead.\" Here's where it gets interesting. Moore zooms in on that phrase so quickly that it blots out the rest of the sentence, and then takes the image off screen before you can read anything else.\n \n \n \n (It's clearer in the movie). The page is long gone, but I finally found an archived version and also a June 2000 usenet posting usenet posting. Guess what the page really said happened? Not a Heston trip to Flint, but: \"48-hours after Kayla Rolland is pronounced dead, Bill Clinton is on The Today Show telling a sympathetic Katie Couric, \"Maybe this tragic death will help.\"\" Nothing to do with Heston. Incidentally, if you have the DVD version and the right player, you can freeze frame this sequence and see it yourself. Then go back and freeze frame the rally, and you'll make out various Bush election posters and tags.\n \n Yep, Moore had a reason for zooming in on the 48 hours. The zooming starts instantly, and moves sideways to block out the rest of the sentence before even the quickest viewer could read it.\n \n By the way, when interviewed by a reporter for the Times of London, Moore had to admit the point: \"When I spoke to Moore last week, he confirmed Hardy's point about the date of the speech, but angrily denied the allegation that he had misled viewers.\" Link to Times webpage (charge for download).\n \n If this is artistic talent, it's not the type that merits an Oscar.\n \n C. Heston Interview. Having created the desired impression, Moore follows with his Heston interview. Heston's memory of the Flint event is foggy (he says it was an early morning event, and that they then went on to the next rally; in fact the rally was at 6 - 7:30 PM. and the last event of the day.). Heston's lack of recall is not surprising; it was one rally in a nine-stop tour of three States in three days.\n \n Moore, who had plenty of time to prepare, continues the impression he has created, asking Heston misleading questions such as: \"After that happened you came to Flint to hold a big rally and, you know, I just, did you feel it was being at all insensitive to the fact that this community had just gone through this tragedy?\" Moore continues, \"you think you'd like to apologize to the people in Flint for coming and doing that at that time?\"\n \n Moore knows the real sequence, and knows that Heston does not. Moore takes full advantage.\n \n As noted above, Moore's deception works on reviewers. In fact, when Heston says he did not know about Kayla's shooting when he went to Flint, viewers see Heston as an inept liar:\n \n \"Then, he [Heston] and his ilk held ANOTHER gun-rally shortly after another child/gun tragedy in Flint, MI where a 6-year old child shot and killed a 6-year old classmate (Heston claims in the final interview of the film that he didn't know this had just happened when he appeared).\" [Click here for original]\n \n Bowling persuaded these viewers by deceiving them. Moore's creative skills are used to convince the viewer that things happened which did not and that a truthful man is a liar when he denies them.\n \n A further question: is the end of the Heston interview faked?\n \n 3. Animated sequence equating NRA with KKK. In an animated history send-up, with the narrator talking rapidly, Bowling equates the NRA with the Klan, suggesting NRA was founded in 1871, \"the same year that the Klan became an illegal terrorist organization.\" Bowling goes on to depict Klansmen becoming the NRA and an NRA character helping to light a burning cross.\n \n \n \n This sequence is intended to create the impression either that NRA and the Klan were parallel groups or that when the Klan was outlawed its members formed the NRA.\n \n Both impressions are not merely false, but directly opposed to the real facts.\n \n \n Fact: The NRA was founded in 1871 -- by act of the New York Legislature, at request of former Union officers. The Klan was founded in 1866, and quickly became a terrorist organization. One might claim that while it was an organization and a terrorist one, it technically became an \"illegal\" such with passage of the federal Ku Klux Klan Act and Enforcement Act in 1871. These criminalized interference with civil rights, and empowered the President to use troops to suppress the Klan. (Although we'd have to acknowledge that murder, terror and arson were illegal long before that time -- the Klan hadn't been operating legally until 1871, it was operating illegally with the connivance of law enforcement.)\n \n \n Fact: The Klan Act and Enforcement Act were signed into law by President Ulysess S. Grant. Grant used their provisions vigorously, suspending habeas corpus and deploying troops; under his leadership over 5,000 arrests were made and the Klan was dealt a serious (if all too short-lived) blow.\n \n Fact: Grant's vigor in disrupting the Klan earned him unpopularity among many whites, but Frederick Douglass praised him, and an associate of Douglass wrote that African-Americans \"will ever cherish a grateful remembrance of his name, fame and great services.\"\n \n Fact: After Grant left the White House, the NRA elected him as its eighth president.\n \n Fact: After Grant's term, the NRA elected General Philip Sheridan, who had removed the governors of Texas and Lousiana for failure to suppress the KKK.\n \n Fact: The affinity of NRA for enemies of the Klan is hardly surprising. The NRA was founded by former Union officers, and eight of its first ten presidents were Union veterans.\n \n Fact: During the 1950s and 1960s, groups of blacks organized as NRA chapters in order to obtain surplus military rifles to fight off Klansmen.\n \n .4. Shooting at Buell Elementary School in Michigan. Bowling depicts the juvenile shooter who killed Kayla Rolland as a sympathetic youngster, from a struggling family, who just found a gun in his uncle's house and took it to school. \"No one knew why the little boy wanted to shoot the little girl.\"\n \n \n Fact: The little boy was the class thug, already suspended from school for stabbing another kid with a pencil, and had fought with Kayla the day before. Since the incident, he has stabbed another child with a knife.\n \n \n Fact: The uncle's house was the family business -- the neighborhood crack-house. The gun was stolen and was purchased by the uncle in exchange for drugs.The shooter's father was already serving a prison term for theft and drug offenses. A few weeks later police busted the shooter's grandmother and aunt for narcotics sales. After police hauled the family away, the neighbors applauded the officers. This was not a nice but misunderstood family.\n \n \n Links:1., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, \n \n 5. The Taliban and American Aid. In discussing military assistance to various countries, Bowling asserts that the U.S. gave $245 million in aid to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan in 2000 and 2001.\n \n \n Fact: The aid in question was humanitarian assistance, given through UN and nongovernmental organizations, to relieve famine in Afghanistan. [Various numbers are given for the amount of the aid, and some say several million went for clearing landmines.]\n \n 6. International Comparisons. To pound home its point, Bowling flashes a dramatic count of gun homicides in various countries: Canada 165, Germany 381, Australia 65, Japan 39, US 11,127. Now that's raw numbers, not rates -- Here's why he doesn't talk rates.\n \n Verifying the figures was difficult, since Moore does not give a year for them. A lot of Moore's numbers didn't check out for any period I could find. As a last effort at checking, I did a Google search for each number and the word \"gun\" or words \"gun homicides\" Many traced -- only back to webpages repeating Bowling's figures. Moore is the only one using these numbers.\n \n Germany: Bowling says 381: 1995 figures put homicides at 1,476, about four times what Bowling claims, and gun homicides at 168, about half what it claims: it's either far too high or far too low. ( J\u00f6rg Altmeppen has emailed me a link to a German site putting the figure at Moore's 381, in 1998 -- I have to depend upon his translation here, as German is one of the languages in which I can only curse.).\n \n Australia: Bowling says 65. This is very close, albeit picking the year to get the data desired. Between 1980-1995, firearm homicides varied from 64-123, although never exactly 65. In 2000, it was 64, which was proudly proclaimed as the lowest number in the country's history.\n \n US: Bowling says 11,127. FBI figures put it a lot lower. They report gun homicides were 8,719 in 2001, 8,661 in 2000, 8,480 in 1999. (2001 UCR, p. 23). Here's the table:\n \n \n \n [You can download the entire report, in .pdf format, by clicking here; look for pt. 2 at p.23.] To be utterly fair, this is a count of the 13,752 homicides for which police submitted supplemental data (including weapon used): the total homicide count was 15,980. But what weapon, if any, was used in the other homicide is unknown to us, and was unknown to Moore.\n \n After an email tip, I finally found a way to compute precisely 11,127. Ignore the FBI, use Nat'l Center for Health Statistics figures. These are based on doctors' death certificates rather than police investigation.\n \n Then -- to their gun homicide figures, add the figure for legally-justified homicides: self-defense and police use against criminals. Presto, you have exactly Moore's 11,127. I can see no other way for him to get it.\n \n Since Moore appears to use police figures for the other countries, it's hardly a valid comparison. More to the point, it's misleading since it includes self-defense and police: when we talk of a gun homicide problem we hardly have in mind a woman defending against a rapist, or a cop taking out an armed robber.\n \n Canada: Moore's number is correct for 1999, a low point, but he ignores some obvious differences.\n \n Bias. I wanted to talk about fabrication, not about bias, but I've gotten emails asking why I didn't mention that Switzerland requires almost all adult males to have guns, but has a lower homicide rate than Great Britain, or that Japanese-Americans, with the same proximity to guns as other Americans, have homicide rates half that of Japan itself. (And, after posting this, got an email saying that Switzerland doesn't require all adult males to own guns -- not everyone is in the national militia. Here's an encyclopedia reference to their system. 36% of entire population is enrolled in the militia -- which must mean a very great part of the adult male population, \" All of Swiss society celebrates shooting, and skill with the rifle. For example, each year Zurich shuts down a whole day for its \"Boys' Shooting Festival.\"\" Sounds like a plan to me.)\n \n And, oh, yes, there is an extremely interesting paper by Canadian criminologist Gary Mauser, presented at a colloquium in, appropriately enough, the Tower of London, and addressing international comparisons of firearms laws and firearm crime rates. I highly recommend reading, if you're interested in serious research rather than Moore's flashing numbers. Okay, they're mentioned, now back to our regularly scheduled program.\n \n Actually, international comparisons lead to some interesting points. Here's a webpage which gives worldwide homicide rates. The U.S. comes in at 23rd place. It only made the list by edging out Armenia and Bulgaria. Its former rival as a superpower, the states of the former Soviet Union, absolutely flatten it in this competition. Russia has four times the US rate. Ukraine and Estonia have twice its rate. Even Poland ranks higher. South Africa's showing is ten times the US rate! Hmm-- another point from a different section of that site. In rape rates per 1000 population, the US ranks ninth, at .32, just ahead of Iceland and Papua New Guinea. Canada is fifth, at .75, over double the US rate, and Australia is third with .80.\n \n 7. Miscellaneous. Even the Canadian government is jumping in. Bowling shows Moore casually buying ammunition at an Ontario Walmart. He asks us to \"look at what I, a foreign citizen, was able to do at a local Canadian Wal-Mart.\" He buys several boxes of ammunition without a question being raised. \"That's right. I could buy as much ammunition as I wanted, in Canada.\"\n \n Canadian officials have pointed out that the buy is faked or illegal: Canadian law has since, 1998, required ammunition buyers to present proper identification. Since Jan. 1, 2001, (sorry--link broke--it was a Canadian government info site) it has required non-Canadians to present a firearms borrowing or importation license, too. (Bowling appears to have been filmed in mid and late 2001).\n \n While we're at it: Bowling shows footage of a B-52 on display at the Air Force Academy, while Moore scornfully intones that the plaque under it \"proudly proclaims that the plane killed Vietnamese people on Christmas Eve of 1972.\"\n \n The plaque actually reads that \"Flying out of Utapao Royal Thai Naval Airfield in southeast Thailand, the crew of 'Diamond Lil' shot down a MIG northeast of Hanoi during 'Linebacker II' action on Christmas eve 1972.\" This is pretty mild compared to the rest of Bowling, but the viewer can't even trust Moore to honestly read a monument.\n \n (As Spinsanity notes, Moore goes even farther in his add-on DVD. There, he tells us, \"And they've got a plaque on there proudly proclaiming that this bomber, this B-52, killed thousands upon thousands of Vietnamese -- innocent civilians.\")\n \n 8. Race. Moore does not directly state that Heston is a racist--he is the master of creating the false impression --but reviewers come away saying \"Heston looks like an idiot, and a racist one at that\" Source. \"BTW, one thing the Heston interview did clear up, that man is shockingly racist.\" Source.\n \n The remarks stem from Heston's answer (after Moore keeps pressing for why the US has more violence than other countries) that it might be due to the US \"having a more mixed ethnicity\" than other nations, and \"We had enough problems with civil rights in the beginning.\" A viewer who accepts Moore's theme that gun ownership is driven by racial fears might conclude that Heston is blaming blacks and the civil rights movement.\n \n But if you look at some history missing from Bowling, you get exactly the opposite picture. Heston is talking, not about race, but about racism. In the early 1960s, the civil rights movement was fighting for acceptance. Civil rights workers were being murdered. The Kennedy Administration, trying to hold together a Democratic coalition that ranged from liberals to fire-eater segregationists such as George Wallace and Lester Maddox, found the issue too hot to touch, and offered little support.\n \n Heston got involved. He picketed discriminating restaurants. He worked with Martin Luther King, and helped King break Hollywood's color barrier (yes, there was one.). He led the actors' component of King's 1963 march in Washington, which set the stage for the key civil rights legislation in 1964.\n \n Here's Heston's comments at the 2001 Congress on Racial Equality Martin Luther King dinner (presided over by NRA director, and CORE President, Roy Innes). More on Heston.\n \n Most of the viewers were born long after the events Heston is recalling. To them, the civil rights struggle consists of Martin Luther King speaking, people singing \"We Shall Overcome,\" and everyone coming to their senses. Heston remembers what it was really like.\n \n If Heston fails to explain this in Bowling, we've got to note that Moore (despite his claim that he left the interview almost unedited) cut a lot of the interview out. Watch closely and you'll see a clock on the wall near Moore's head. When it's first seen, the time is about 5:47. When Heston finally walks out, it reads about 6:10. That's 23 minutes. I clocked the Heston interview in Bowling at 5 1/4 minutes. About three-quarters of what Heston did say was trimmed out. [Why the clock indicates six o'clock, when Moore is specific that he showed up for the interview at 8:30 AM, will have to await another investigation!]\n \n 9. Fear. Bowling probably has a good point when it suggests that the media feeds off fear in a search for the fast buck. For an interesting analysis of this, showing how crime news skyrocketed (largely displacing international coverage) even as crime fell, click here.\n \n Bowling cites some examples: the razor blades in Halloween apples scare, the flesh-eating bacteria scare, etc. The examples are taken straight from Barry Glassner's excellent book on the subject, \"The Culture of Fear,\" and Moore interviews Glassner on-camera for the point.\n \n Then Moore does exactly what he condemns in the media.\n \n Given the prominence of schoolyard killings as a theme in Bowling for Columbine, Moore must have asked Glassner about that subject. Whatever Glassner said is, however, left on the cutting-room floor. That's because Glassner lists schoolyard shootings as one of the mythical fears. He points out that \"More than three times as many people are killed by lightning as by violence at schools.\" \n \n This is as close as Moore comes to having a thesis, an explanation for homicide rate differences. But here he falls flat on his face. As one of his interviewees notes, over a period when homicide rates were falling, media coverage of murder increased by 600%. Okay, flip it around. When media coverage of homicides increased 600%, homicide rates fell. So much for Moore's explanation. In fact, so much for all of his attempted explanations. During the 1990s, homicide rates in the US went into their steepest decline in decades, with handgun homicides leading the way. That was the same period that saw the welfare reform laws, the bombing in Serbia, several million firearms sold each year -- everything, in short, that Moore condemns. (For one source, just go back up the page to the FBI statistics: between 1997 and 2001, firearm homicides fell from 10,729 to 8,719, and 1997 was after the biggest drop had occured.\n \n I suppose we might go farther, and ask if Moore's film is not illustrative of what it condemns. Moore argues that the media (a) distorts reality, and (b) hypes fear of other Americans, because (c) fear is good for a fast buck. Moore distorts reality, hypes fear of other Americans (\"are we nation of gun nuts, or just nuts?\") and, well, made several million fast bucks.\n \n 10. Guns (supposedly the point of the film). A point worth making (although not strictly on theme here): Bowling's theme is, rather curiously, not opposed to firearms ownership.\n \n After making out Canada to be a haven of nonviolence, Moore asks why. He proclaims that Canada has \"a tremendous amount of gun ownership,\" somewhat under one gun per household. He visits Canadian shooting ranges, gun stores, and in the end proclaims \"Canada is a gun loving, gun toting, gun crazy country!\"\n \n Or as he put it elsewhere, \"then I learned that Canada has 7 million guns but they don't kill each other like we do. I thought, gosh, that's uncomfortably close to the NRA position: Guns don't kill people, people kill people.\"\n \n Bowling concludes that Canada isn't peaceful because it lacks guns and gun nuts -- it has lots of those -- but because the Canadian mass media isn't into constant hyping of fear and loathing, and the American media is. (One problem).\n \n Which leaves us to wonder why the Brady Campaign/Million Moms issued a press release. congratulating Moore on his Oscar nomination.\n \n Or does Bowling have a hidden punch line, and in the end the joke is on them?\n \n One possible explanation: did Bowling begin as one movie, and end up as another?\n \n Incidentally, Moore has issued a webpage responding to criticism. In so doing, he actually admits that much of the above criticism is accurate. He did splice the Willie Horton ad, and Heston's \"cold dead hands\" was never spoken at Denver, and his statistics do stem from those of the Center for Disease Control, which include self-defense and police shootings of perps. As far as the rest of the criticisms above -- strange, but Moore doesn't have an answer. Here's my response.\n \n Conclusion\n \n The point is not that Bowling is unfair, or lacking in objectivity. The point is far more fundamental: Bowling for Columbine is dishonest. It is fraudulent. To trash Heston, it even uses the audio/video editor to assemble a Heston speech that Heston did not give, and sequences images and carefully highlighted text to spin the viewer's mind to a wrong conclusion. If there is art in this movie, it is a dishonest art. Moore does not inform his readers: he plays them like a violin.\n \n A further thought, on a topic far broader (no pun intended) than Moore. Moore's film is unquestionably popular. He's attracted an almost-cult following. And judging from the emails I've received, plenty of his followers don't care a bit about whether they were misled. Can broader lessons be learned from this?\n \n Suppose for a moment that Moore's behavior can be explained as a product of Narcisstic Personality Disorder, that he fits the clinical symptoms to a T, that indeed Bowling is a grand acting out of this character disorder. Does its popularity suggest something of far greater concern than one more narcissist in Hollywood? And does that in turn hold a key to mass slayings?Click here for some thoughts on that score.\n \n David T. Hardy [an amateur who has for the last year been working on a serious bill of rights documentary], to include the Second Amendment.\n \n dthardy at mindspring.com [\"at\" instead of \"@\" used to confuse those blasted spam robots]\n \n P.S.: I don't have Moore's $4 million budget (and wound up paying over a thousand in bandwidth overruns, before I found a new host), but if you could see the way to contribute ten or twenty dollars to this research, and to preparing a real documentary, please click below.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A few additions:\n \n Links to other Moore & Bowling sites.\n \n Some criticisms not given on this page.\n \n Did Moore appropriate large portions from a webpage?\n \n Equal time: emails critical of this page.\n \n A brief reply to two responses I've received:\n \n Objectivity: (sample email): \"Your entire article is retarded. We're talking about making FILM. ALL film is subjective. Have you not even taken an entry level course in film before?\"\n \n Response: The point is not that Bowling is non-objective, or biased. The point is that it is intentionally deceptive.\n \n Nothing is real: The camera changes everything, etc., so in video there can be no truth or falsity. Sample: \"tv and movies, newspapers or even documentaries *are* constructions, not \"the truth\" (\"truth\" is subjective personal opinion/experience, which would be impossible to commit to videotape or celluloid).\" \n \n \n Response: This certainly has given me some insight into how some in the media view things! Can we agree upon one core premise: to deliberately deceive a viewer is wrong?\n \n Talk basic ethics. Is that what you teach your kids? Truth and lies are ultimately the same, all that matters is whether you're good at it?\n \n And don't give me the claim that filmmaking is somehow different, all filming departs from reality, so truth and lies exist for written media and not for film. All communication is symbolic; the use of verbal and written symbols to convey ideas. If anything, a documentary film purports to be less symbolic and more real: the viewer is shown things, and assumes he is himself seeing reality, rather than hearing a speaker's description, possibly unfair or deceptive, of it. If anything, this should imply a greater duty to avoid conscious deception than would apply to the written and spoken word.\n \n Equally to the point: Moore himself repudiates these defenses, insisting that every iota of his film is objectively true. \"I can guarantee to you, without equivocation, that every fact in my movie is true. Three teams of fact-checkers and two groups of lawyers went through it with a fine tooth comb to make sure that every statement of fact is indeed an indisputable fact.... [F]aced with a thoroughly truthful and honest film, those who object to the film's political points are left with the choice of debating us on the issues in the film or resorting to character assassination.\" Source.\n \n Moore makes people think. This at least has some merit to it. But deception is not the way to inspire clear thinking. For that matter ... if the purpose is to inspire thought, how about giving some data? Homicide, firearm homicide, and gun use in self-defense have been extensively studied for forty years now. Kleck, Zimring, Bordua -- there is no shortage of experts here. And there is a lot of data on other matters, such as relationship of media coverage to crime. Yet the viewer hears none of this: in terms of substance, Bowling is thin as an oil slick. The viewer is left with Moore the criminologist looking at a TV screen and proclaiming TV news just has to be the answer -- and not stopping long enough to reflect that if homicide rates fell when news coverage of them went up 600%, this is a most peculiar answer.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n -----------------------------\n \n I'm pretty lenient regarding the right to bare arms. I hate guns and I think they are wrong and should be banned entirely or else no one is safe, but I will recognize them as a fundamental of our consitution. My thought is that no one should be able to own more than one gun, and it must be a shotgun for defense or recreation.\n\n \n Which shows you are anything but leniant. What have my guns or myself as a law abiding citizen done to deserve your hoplophobic scorn?\n \n \n \nAssault rifles are far to deadly in the hands of children, whether it be in schools or on the street. Their high fire rate makes them too great a hazard, particularily in the hands of those who know how to use them. There is also no reason that anyone needs to protect themselves from 400 yards away. This is ludicrous.\n\n \n \n this is a very ignorant statment. 1st an assault weapon I assume you mean an AK-47 or an m-16 type rifle as an example, are designed to be effective out to 300 yards. Now a .308 winchester, the most common hunting round is effective out 800 yards or more, do you want to ban that too? 2nd how many childeren have used your \"assault weapons\" in crimes? \n \n Your right this IS ludicrous.\n \n \n \nHand guns should also be outlawed. They are too small and easy to conceal. Anyone could easily whip one out in a school or a convenient store. \n\n \n Cars kill more people, ban them too? should the government, cops have guns?\n \n \n \nA shotgun is difficult to conceal except in large pants or a trenchcoat and is also clumsier to pull out when attacking. Furthermore, they are generally effective only at shorter ranges. Depending on the type, a shotgun generally holds 1-8 rounds. 8 rounds is more than plenty to protect your home. If you want to go hunting at longer ranges, be a real hunter and buy a bow.\n\n \n judging by the ignorance of this paragraph you have never been hunting and have never fired a rifle with any consistancy. Are you saying home defense is only good if the weapon has a short range? As for con cealment have you ever heard of a \"sawed off shorgun\"?\n \n \n \n \nLet's be realistic here, you are more likely to get shot up out on the street, at work, or at school rather than by someone breaking into your home.\n\n \n \n Actually both are statistically nill. But that does not mean that propaganda and fear mongering should be the call of the day to find a reason to violate another citizens civil rights.....",

Do you use the hobby guns?\n \n =====they are finely crafted, precision machines. My oldest gun was used in a political assasination, thus changing the course of history.

I also like to do comptition shooting\n \n In the event that you own a gun for safety, do you keep it loaded?\n \n =====Of course, an unloaded gun is a paperweight.\n \n If you keep your gun loaded, is it locked up, away from you, or nearby?\n \n =====It is under my bed. I also keep one in my desk drawer, and when I am carrying large sums of money I have one in a pancake holster\n \n If it is locked up away from you, how does it protect you?\n \n =====Palm print access. Slap hand on reader, case pops open. Grab Uzi, commence firing.\n \n If it is near you, is it possible for someone to steal it?\n \n =====Not without cutting off my hand\n \n If it is unloaded, do you keep it near you?\n \n =====If it is unloaded, there is little point\n \n If not, how does it protect you?\n \n =====Hmmm, I can see where you are going here. Unfortuantly it is way down the road to ignorant land. You can load an automatic pistol in less than 3 seconds. Clip in, slide back, safty off, you are ready to go. Generally, you are going to have more than 3 seconds notice of an impending threat\n \n Have you ever shot your gun while drunk?\n \n =====No\n \n Have you ever shot your gun while under the influence of drugs?\n \n =====No\n \n Do you think that many gun owners are negligent?\n \n =====Don't personally know ANY gun owners who are negligent\n \n Have you ever been negligent with a gun?\n \n =====No\n \n How do you think guns and assault rifles get circulated?\n \n =====They are sold based on free market principals\n \n How does a gun owner propose that we stop unecessary gun violence?\n \n =====By lowering crime. \n \n Does your proposal consider all of your answers above?\n \n =====Yes, and then some, unlike most GG's proposals, which do not address ANY of the above (background checks, scary looking gun bans, trigger locks, etc...)\n \n Can you propose any other self-defense options other than owning a gun?\n \n =====Not any that is as effective\n \n Are you a member of the NRA?\n \n =====Nope. They are traitors to the American gun owners\n \n Are you white?\n \n =====Yep\n -----------------------------\n \n \nI'm pretty lenient regarding the right to bare arms. I hate guns and I think they are wrong and should be banned entirely or else no one is safe, but I will recognize them as a fundamental of our consitution. My thought is that no one should be able to own more than one gun, and it must be a shotgun for defense or recreation.\n\n \n This is rediculous. First off, a shotgun is not a good weapon for most hunting. While it is nice to use on birds, it is wasteful to use on small mammals (rabbits, squirells, etc...) and incredibly difficult (and downright foolish) to use on some big mammals (elk, bear, etc).\n \n Don't punish the rest of us for the fact that you doubt your ability to safely store or fire a weapon. \n \n \nAssault rifles are far to deadly in the hands of children, whether it be in schools or on the street. Their high fire rate makes them too great a hazard, particularily in the hands of those who know how to use them. There is also no reason that anyone needs to protect themselves from 400 yards away. This is ludicrous.\n\n \n Can you actually prove that assault rifles are deadly in the hands of children? We don;t seem to have a real problem with it to date (at least, not according to the DOJ). They are responsible for a statistically insignificant number of deaths. \n \n The US military, after years of experience in conflict situationas, has determined that the best personal defense weapon is an assault trifle ( only theirs are real assault rifles, not the black scary loooking guns that the GGs have labled \"assault rifles\"). I am willing to take their word for it (thus the uzi under the bed). Assault rifles are capable of reaching out and touching somebody, they are no less capable of killing somebody from across the room. \n \n There are a couple different studies out there about the average number of rounds fired by criminals in violent acts, and the average is around 3, whether you are talking a wheel gun (revolver), or a hlock capable of holding 20 rounds. An assault wepon ban is a solution in search of a problem. Do more research before you formulate opinions.\n \n \nHand guns should also be outlawed. They are too small and easy to conceal. Anyone could easily whip one out in a school or a convenient store. \n \n \n Yes, and they could use that handgun they whipped out to kill a bad guy. \n \n \nA shotgun is difficult to conceal except in large pants or a trenchcoat and is also clumsier to pull out when attacking. Furthermore, they are generally effective only at shorter ranges. Depending on the type, a shotgun generally holds 1-8 rounds. 8 rounds is more than plenty to protect your home. If you want to go hunting at longer ranges, be a real hunter and buy a bow.\n\n \n A shotgun is incredibly easy to conceal. Take a hacksaw and move it in a back and forth motion over the barrel, and you will have a concealable shotgun. Devestating firepoer at short range.\n \n Who the helll are you to tell me how many rounds I need to defend my home? Are you planning on breaking into my home? If not, you don;t have to concern yourself at ALL with how many rounds my defensive weapon of choice holds. If you are, you should know that I have 3 32 rd clips ready to go. Average police response time in my area is over 15 minutes. That is a long time to hold the fort so to speak. And that is assuming that the criminals are not bright enough to take the phones out of comission (in whihc case there will be no police). \n \n In most amjor metropolitan areas, response time is generally 5 minutes+ (International association of Police Chiefs).

If you are talking more than one guy, and they do not run off the minute they realise you are armed, 8 rounds is not enoguh.

Why should ahomeowner, who has no backup, be forced to rely on 8 rounds?\n \n \nLet's be realistic here, you are more likely to get shot up out on the street, at work, or at school rather than by someone breaking into your home.\n\n \n Which is why concealed carry needs to be allowed.

   "First, bowling sucked. Second, the second ammendment is not at all vague, and if there is any question as to what it means, it is explained quite clearly not only in the feederalist papers but also in the other writings of the founders.\n \n Honestly, I had always believed that everybody clearly understood what the meaning of the second Ammendment was and that the false confusion was beign spread by the GGs. Now I know that many people are either not bright enough, or not interested enough int he history of their country to even recite all teh ammendments, much less attempt to fully understand them. It is a sad world in which we live.\n \n \n \n I'll bite\n \n How many guns do you own?\n \n =====Over 300\n \n What kind of guns are they?\n \n =====Differnt stuff, ranging from modern assault rifles w/ composite stocks and titanium recievers to 15th century italian jobbers with ivory grips and gold inlaid triggers.\n \n Do you have children that are or were under the age of 19?\n \n =====Yes\n \n If yes, Have your children ever touched or played with your gun?\n \n =====Yes\n \n If yes, Have your children ever touched your gun outside of your supervision?\n \n =====No, though they someday will. I got my first gun when I was 8. My kids will probably have to waiut until they are 12 (wife). by 15 they will be more than welcome to go out hunting on their own if they wish.\n \n If yes, Do you have a means of knowing whether or not you children has accessed your gun without your knowledge or consent? \n \n =====Yes\n \n If yes, have your ever educated or punished your child for inquiring or infringing up on your gun?\n \n =====n/a\n \n Do you believe a family with a child should own a gun?\n \n =====Absolutly\n \n Do you believe it is necessary to own more than one gun?\n \n =====Absolutly. A rifle, a shotgun, a pistol and an \"assault rifle\". I have lots mor than that, but that is because I collect them. You really only need 3 (the assault rifle is optional)\n \n Do you believe it is necessary to own an assault rifle over say a shotgun?\n \n =====It is a better home defense weapon, but it is a matter of choice\n \n Do you live in a neighborhood were violence and break-ins occur on a regluar basis?\n \n =====Nope, that may very well be because I live in the sticks, and everybody knows that farmers are all armed.\n \n Do you own guns simply as a hobby, recreation, or means of protection?\n \n =====Both\n \n In the event that you own a gun as a hobby, what is so interesting about them? Do you use the hobby guns?\n \n =====they are finely crafted, precision machines. My oldest gun was used in a political assasination, thus changing the course of history. I generally do not use pieces from my collection. They are too old and too valuable to risk blowing up.\n \n In the even that you own a gun for recreation, why?\n \n =====I like to hunt. I also like to do comptition shooting\n \n In the event that you own a gun for safety, do you keep it loaded?\n \n =====Of course, an unloaded gun is a paperweight.\n \n If you keep your gun loaded, is it locked up, away from you, or nearby?\n \n =====It is under my bed. I also keep one in my desk drawer, and when I am carrying large sums of money I have one in a pancake holster\n \n If it is locked up away from you, how does it protect you?\n \n =====Palm print access. Slap hand on reader, case pops open. Grab Uzi, commence firing.\n \n If it is near you, is it possible for someone to steal it?\n \n =====Not without cutting off my hand\n \n If it is unloaded, do you keep it near you?\n \n =====If it is unloaded, there is little point\n \n If not, how does it protect you?\n \n =====Hmmm, I can see where you are going here. Unfortuantly it is way down the road to ignorant land. You can load an automatic pistol in less than 3 seconds. Clip in, slide back, safty off, you are ready to go. Generally, you are going to have more than 3 seconds notice of an impending threat\n \n Have you ever shot your gun while drunk?\n \n =====No\n \n Have you ever shot your gun while under the influence of drugs?\n \n =====No\n \n Do you think that many gun owners are negligent?\n \n =====Don't personally know ANY gun owners who are negligent\n \n Have you ever been negligent with a gun?\n \n =====No\n \n How do you think guns and assault rifles get circulated?\n \n =====They are sold based on free market principals\n \n How does a gun owner propose that we stop unecessary gun violence?\n \n =====By lowering crime. \n \n Does your proposal consider all of your answers above?\n \n =====Yes, and then some, unlike most GG's proposals, which do not address ANY of the above (background checks, scary looking gun bans, trigger locks, etc...)\n \n Can you propose any other self-defense options other than owning a gun?\n \n =====Not any that is as effective\n \n Are you a member of the NRA?\n \n =====Nope. They are traitors to the American gun owners\n \n Are you white?\n \n =====Yep\n -----------------------------\n \n \n \n This is rediculous. First off, a shotgun is not a good weapon for most hunting. While it is nice to use on birds, it is wasteful to use on small mammals (rabbits, squirells, etc...) and incredibly difficult (and downright foolish) to use on some big mammals (elk, bear, etc).\n \n Don't punish the rest of us for the fact that you doubt your ability to safely store or fire a weapon. \n \n \n \n Can you actually prove that assault rifles are deadly in the hands of children? We don;t seem to have a real problem with it to date (at least, not according to the DOJ). They are responsible for a statistically insignificant number of deaths. \n \n The US military, after years of experience in conflict situationas, has determined that the best personal defense weapon is an assault trifle ( only theirs are real assault rifles, not the black scary loooking guns that the GGs have labled \"assault rifles\"). I am willing to take their word for it (thus the uzi under the bed). Assault rifles are capable of reaching out and touching somebody, they are no less capable of killing somebody from across the room. \n \n There are a couple different studies out there about the average number of rounds fired by criminals in violent acts, and the average is around 3, whether you are talking a wheel gun (revolver), or a hlock capable of holding 20 rounds. An assault wepon ban is a solution in search of a problem. Do more research before you formulate opinions.\n \n \n \n Yes, and they could use that handgun they whipped out to kill a bad guy. \n \n \n \n A shotgun is incredibly easy to conceal. Take a hacksaw and move it in a back and forth motion over the barrel, and you will have a concealable shotgun.

I think you've over rated your safety.\n \n There is little I can say regarding guns that I can defend myself against. The fact is that 11,000 people died to gun crime in America (2002) so obviously guns are part of the problem here. That isn't a columbine demographic, it is a real government statistic. 380,000 crimes committed in America in 2002 involved a firearm. These numbers don't disturb you? You really believe you're safer because you have guns? And you'd feel safer than that if everyone carried a concealed one? Am I missing something here? Is this a crisis of sanity?",

You are right about being mowed down at a quickie mart, which is why I look bothe ways before crossing the street or stepping out into a parking lot. As far as the wacked out kid killing my daughter at school, I don't generally worry about that (since they are more likely to be hit by lightning). If soemthing liek that did happen here (columbine type shooting), I would certainly hope that a teacher or principal who is armed would take care of the problem. I hapen to know that several of our teachers have guns, as well as 3 of the principals at our local schools because I am on the school board and drafted the letter we all signed recognising that it was illegal in this state, but the school board would not take any action against any teacher or principal that had participated in a marksmanship program who wished to be armed while on the job.

Outside of that, I just have to take faith in the fact that I take sensible precautions to safegaurd my childrens safety. I have taught them as best I can. They don't wander around town alone, and when they wander around at home, it is with a 120 LB german shepard. Hopefully, the kidnappers will skip over them and go after your kids, since you apparently seem to think that since you cannot absolutly gaurantee their safety no precautions shou ld be taken.\n \n This is perhaps the stupidist and most nonsensical argument I have ever heard. Sure, you cannot protect yourself against every threat, that does not mean you should not take steps to protect yourself against the ones you can. This is like somebody saying \"A meteor could fall out of the sky and hit you, so you should not bother keeping a first aid kit around since it won't help you if the meteor hits you\".\n \n Pathetic logic.\n \n \nThere is little I can say regarding guns that I can defend myself against. The fact is that 11,000 people died to gun crime in America (2002) so obviously guns are part of the problem here. \n \n \n 11,000 out of 293,027,571. That is about .00003%. WHOA. .00003%, sounds like a pretty major problem to me.\n \n Lets look at this another way. Lets say that EACH of those 11,000 deaths was from a seperate incident. The, we will say that each of those incidents was commited by a legally owned gun (though we know this is untrue, the VAST majority of gun deaths are criminal on criminal). Now, using a LOW number of leagally owned guns, we can calculate how many legal gun owners killed somebody in the comission of a crime. We will use 60,000,000. This is generally considered a good baseline number. That means that .0001% of legal gun owners killed somebody last year during the comission of a gun crime.\n \n Now, keep in mind that the actual number is going to be MUCH lower, since the majority of gun crimes are commited using an illegally posessed gun.\n \n So, by using the numbers most favorable to your argument, we quickly see that your argument is a bunch of bunk, and the number of gun deaths in America is statistically insignificant. \n \n This is wht the GGs like to quote statistics the way they do. 11,000 dead sounds like a big number. Taken in context, you quickly see how trivial it is. 11,000 dead an people go \"WOW , we have to do something about that\". If you said .000003% of the population dead, people would go \"WOW, that is great, you would think it would be more for all the fuss people are making\".\n \n \n \nThat isn't a columbine demographic, it is a real government statistic. 380,000 crimes committed in America in 2002 involved a firearm. These numbers don't disturb you? \n \n \n By your own statistics, firearms incidents were only 7% of all violent crime. No, these numbers don't particularly disturb me. More violent crimes were commited using knives, or fists (By FAR the highest incident of violent crime involves people using their fists). Just saying \"380,000\" gives you no sense of scale whatsoever, Look at it in context, and it doesn't seem so bad.\n \n \nYou really believe you're safer because you have guns? And you'd feel safer than that if everyone carried a concealed one? Am I missing something here? Is this a crisis of sanity?\n\n \n I personally probably don't need a gun, since as your statistics point out they are used in a very small percentage of violent crimes, and VERY VERY few people are killed by guns each year. I have quite a bit of faith in my ability to defend myself unarmed. Of course, this does make me think maybe I should be a little more insistant about my wife carrying a gun all the time, since she is only 5'4\" and only weighs about 120. She would not do so well aginst fists and feet. \n \n Of course, I probably don't need a spare tire either. I have been driving for a lot of years, and have only ever had two flats. If you figure the total number of hours I have driven, and then figure in the flat tires, flat tires are statistically insignificat (though far more significant that gun deaths). I think I will keep the spare tire, though. I also probably really don't need a first aid kit, either. IT is pretty rare that people actually egt hurt and need first aid. I will probably still keep it. \n \n I have an epinepherine shot in my refrigerator (you give epinepherine to people who are allergic to bee stings so they don;t go into anaphalactic shock and die). I keep it aournd because I have a couple of Alfalfa fields around my house, and bees are draw to alfalfa, and the kid up the road is allergic to bee stings. Of course, if you calculate the toatl cubic feet of air around the house and the fields, then factor in the number of bees, you will find that the odds of him occupying the same space as a bee is pretty slim. Should I throw it away? I think I may just hold on to it. Why? Because chance favors the prepared man. \n \n If you are going to try to debate this, you need a better argument.",

   "Nor has anybody ever managed to prove they are not. Common sense dictates that those with the tools and skills to protect themselves are more likely to be able to do so effectively. \n \n \n \n \n This is not playing around with the numbers to make them seem insignificant. This is statistical analysis. This is why statistics are discussed so often (and quoting raw numbers is NOT statistics). They give some perspective to the numbers. This is also why the GG's don't discuss statistics, becaue when you look at this \"problem\" in context it quickly becomes apparent that the \"problem\" does not exist, and we would be far better off spending our money elsewhere.\n \n You are right, from a loss of life standpoint, the 9/11 attacks were nothing. From a financial standpoint (over 1 trillion lost) they were pretty significant. From an idealogical standpoint, they were devestating. Your point, please?\n \n I am not going to bother to respond to your closing emotional plea but to say \"perhapse if you had a family member saved by a gun you would feel different\". You might also ask yourself how many innocent people are killed each year (thoygh we have already established that it is a statistically insignificant number, a number so small that any good statician would zero it out, and justly so, in the mane of cleaning up his data) that might have been saved had they posessed an effective tool with which to defend themsleves.\n\n Your claim that \"the GG's don't discuss statistics\" if false. Michael Moore says in his book Stupid White Men \"The idea that having a gun is the only way to ensure 'home protection' is a myth. Fewer than 1 out of 4 violent crimes is committed while the victim is at home. Among all the instances when guns are fired during a break-in while the owner is at home, in only 2 percent are guns used to shoot the intruder. The other 98 percent of the time, residents accidentally shoot a loved one or themselves- or the burglars take the gun and kill them with it....The vast majority of guns in America are purchased and owned- that is introduced into society- by white people. Each year about 500,000 guns are stolen, mostly from these same white people in the suburbs. And the vast majority of those guns end up in the inner city, sold cheaply or traded for legal or illegal goods and services. These white guns have caused an enormous amount of death and suffering among African-Americans. Gunfire is the number one cause of death among young blacks....So if you're white, and you'd like to help reduce the number one cause of death among young black men, here's the answer: Don't buy a gun. Don't keep one in your house or car. No guns laying around means no guns stolen to be resold in poor black neighborhoods....If you're truly concerned about your protection, get a dog. Bad guys generally don't want to tussle with a crazy barking animal with sharp teeth. You don't need a gun.\" (pages 78-79)\n \n I wonder if Daewoo will try to dismiss the fact that \"Gunfire is the number one cause of death among young blacks\" as statistically insignificant. How about the fact that guns are used to commit most murders in the US? Will Daewoo show up at a meeting of MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) and announce that the number of people killed by drunk drivers (less than 20,000) is statistically insignificant and so no one should worry about the problem. \"President\" Bush and Cheney might approve since they both have been arrested for drunk driving.",

That is why it is so important to ensure that every state allows concealed carry. that way, at home or not, you have the tools available to protect yourself and your family. \n \n \nAmong all the instances when guns are fired during a break-in while the owner is at home, in only 2 percent are guns used to shoot the intruder.

Typical moore, edit the speaches, edit the statistics, do what it takes to twist things to your viewpoint. \n \n The number of people who actully shoot an intruder is incredibly low. They don't have to. While somebody might be willing to die trying to protect their property, very few are willing to die trying to steal somebody elses VCR. The thing to look into is not the nuber of intruders killed, but the number captured or scared off by armed homeowners. Homeowners actually capture more burgalrs each year than the police do nationwide. way to go, guys. \n \n \nI wonder if Daewoo will try to dismiss the fact that \"Gunfire is the number one cause of death among young blacks\" as statistically insignificant. \n \n \n I won't dismiss it as statistically insignificant (though it is). I will dismiss it beacuse I simply don't care. Let's think about this for a second, why do you suppose that gunfire is the number one cause of death among young blacks? Could it be becuase we already know that over 90% of shootings are criminal on criminal, and young blacks have by far the highest rate of violent crime in the US? It probably also has something to do with the fact that the highest incidents of drug use and drug dealing is found in the young black community.\n \n So, in a nutshell, I could care less if a bunch of gang banger crack heads want to kill each other. It makes society a better place and ensures that they do not breed. Crack babies who will grow up to be gang members and crack dealers just like daddy is about the last thing we need.\n \n This is not an argument for gun control. This is more an argument for handing out free ammo in the inner city. \n \n \nHow about the fact that guns are used to commit most murders in the US? \n \n \n Again, not significant. They have outlawed guns in Australia, now they are apparently having problems with people being killed by swords. No country that has enacted bans on guns has enjoyed a long term decline in murder rates. Briatain and Australias murder rates are apparently climbing. The murder rate in S Africa, where posession of a gun can get you the death penalty, is one of the highest in the world.\n \n I don't particulalrly care how people kill each other, that is not the issue. The problem is that they do kill each otehr, and that has nothing to do wtih guns.\n \n \nWill Daewoo show up at a meeting of MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) and announce that the number of people killed by drunk drivers (less than 20,000) is statistically insignificant and so no one should worry about the problem. \"President\" Bush and Cheney might approve since they both have been arrested for drunk driving.\n\n \n You are right, and apparently getting the hang of the whole \"statistics\" thing. 200,000 in a population of almost 300 million is statistically insignificat.

Madd was an excellent program, it was created to push for stricter drunk driving laws. They accomplished their goal. Rather than disbanding after the goal had been accomplished, they continue to harass people for donations because by the time they had finished their useful function, it had become a multi million dollar operation. \n \n So now, even with laws in many states that punish drunk drivers more severely than first time rapists, we still have to listen to MADD screeching about what a problem it is and how we still need to do something about it. \n \n \n You seem to have a real problem getting your head around the scale we are talking here. 300 million people is a LOT. you are going to loose 20,000 here, and 10 thousand there to various causes each year, and it is no big deal.

The \"drop\" is the result not of less crime, but the result of cooked reporting parctices designed specifically to show less crime. \n \n You can get a spredsheet with all the data at:\n \n http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/703chap3.xls",

It's not like you go hunting duck with a machine gun, well, unless you like swiss duck. \n \n \n Not really. Most assault weapons used in crimes are never fired, and when they are, the death toll is generally no higher than whith regular weapons. The exception is the school massacre type scenario, in which case a teacher with a pistol could handle the situation quickly and easily. An assault weapon is no more dangerous tnah a standard pistol, and in many ways less dangerous, since they lack concealability and maneuverability.\n \n \nBut your weapons won't save you from tanks and attack helicopters, not to mention cruise missiles. I'll conced you that point however. However, this can be prolonged. \n \n \n Yes, they potentially could. A squad support class machine gun is more than capable of taking down a low flying helicopter if used correctly. That same gun can be used to harass a tank crew and keep their heads down while you get somebody on foot up to the vehicle itself in order to disable it. In addition, machine guns are commonly used to destry reactive armor, so you can take the tank with your garden variety RPG. \n \n Take a look at the Afghanis strategy against the soviets, the RUFs strategy against ECOMOG troops, and the columbian guerillas strategy against government troops. All of these groups have routinely used man protable machine guns effectively against aircraft and armored vehicles. In addition to the ability to take down a helicopter in the air, a meduim to heavy machine gun can be devestating against aircraft on the ground, particularly a belt or link fed unit. \n \n Yes, we can prolong the inevitable, but it is still inevitable. The problem with this is that it is rarely apparent to the citizens of any particular country that their government is turning tyrannical until it is too late to do anything about it. Then, you end up withan unarmed citizenry facing a tyrannical government.\n \n This is why our constitution is so difficult to change. Our founding fathers, in their wisdom, realised that if they made it too easy there was a danger that we would squander rights today that we may someday wish we still had. Trading liberty for percieved security is a poor bargain.\n \n \nNope.

The argument presented on this notion is that these weapons will secure our lives aganist a tyrannical government. What a joke, what good will your assualt rifle do when you're facing a 90 ton tank armed with a barrel wider then your body? \n \n \n Maybe, maybe not. Tyranny has been resisted sucessfully many times throughout history.\n \n If you ever need to take out a 90 ton tank with a barrel wider than your body (you must be pretty thin), here is how you do it. You have to concentrate fire on the tank, preferably the front of the tank. You need to give enough fire to keep everybodies head down and their attention focused. Position somebody on foot with either a shaped charge or a heavy sachel charge to the rear of the tank. They have to come up on the rear of the tank and position that chage either where it will take the tread and belly out (in the case of a satchel charge) or take out either the engine or the turrent (in the case of a shaped charge). I have an awesome video of some RUF gusy doing this on an ECOMOG armored troop transport. Works great. An armored vehicles greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. You have 180 degree protection, but limited speed and visibility.\n \n \nWhat good will a USAS do aganist a bomber that's releasing 500 lb bombs from 30,000 feet? No good. There is no argument here. You will die if the government turns tyrannical. They have more weapons, better weapons and more supplies. You can't fight a jet fighter with a AK. \n \n \n This is true. Bomber at 30,000 ft, not a whole lot you can do about it. Bomber on the ground is easy to handle, assuming you are well enough armed. I think if you want to see guys with small arms taking on the greatest military the world has ever seen, you just need to turn on one of the news channels. We couldn't even get falujja back, instead havingt o withdraw our troops and send in an Iraqi who was buddy buddy with the insurgents. You really thinkt eh US military would do any better at home? Iraqs has a realtively small population when compared to the population of the US, and we can't handle the guerillas there. How do you think we would deal with guerilla fighters here?\n \n \nThe key to preventing tyrannical governments is open government and active citizen participation.

The right to own guns is not granted by the US government, and they cannot remove it. That is the differnce between a right and a privelage. By definition a right is untouchable.

If you want to kill a bunch of people with a firearm, aimed fire is the only way to go. You spray bullets into a crowd, you might expect to kill 3 people and wound 6 more with a 30 round clip.

The odds of being shot by the main gun are pretty low. IT moves too slow (unless you are quite a wys out, you can outrun the turrent swing on ANYT tank). Yes, you can already control the machine gun from below on many tanks as well. The machine gun is generally the first thing to go in such a firefigt. It only takes a singe round in the reciever to put it out of comission. I think you are missing the part about the firing on the tank simply being a diversinary tactic to let your guy get in close enough to use his charge. We know this has worked literlaly thousacnds of times in Afgahanistan, korea, and several places in africa. Trust me, it works.\n \n \nAre you actually supporting owning weapons designed for war as a civilian? Remind me not to live by you. \n \n \n I already own several weapons designed for war. I own several machine guns, a flamethrower, and 2 grenade launchers. Pls, don't come live by me. Around here, we enjoy the relative security that comes from not having a bunch of unarmed folks around. Our crime rate is negligeble, but our firearm ownership rate is through the roof. We must be doing something right, and frankly don't need folks like yourself screwing up our decent community.\n \n Irrevelant to gun control. It only worked because we supplied them top of the line military grade weapons. \n \n BS. We supplied the Afghanis with NATO weapons, which were inferior to the soviets weapons. The only \"top of the line military grade weapons\" we ever supplied them in any number is stinger missiles. \n \n \nExactly how can a machine gun take out a plane that is not only flying at MACH 2, but is several thousand feet above you?\n\n \n You can't. I have said this at least 8 times now. You have to hit them ont he ground.\n \n \nOften with the support of a foreign power. \n \n \n Sometimes yes, sometimes no.\n \n \nAnd how are you suppose to take out a 90 ton tank that has infantry and air support? \n \n \n Tanks don't have infantry support. Tanks support infantry, not the other way around. Air support is somewhat problematic, but not extremely. When fighting an enemy with air support the key is to either hit and run, or over run their position or get so close that their air support can't hit you without taking them, too. If you are right in there with them, their air support units have to get right on top of you in order to distinguish friend from foe. If you were smart, you kept a couple of heavy machine gunners in reserve to take down the choppers (since planes are worthless in such a situation, it is unlikely they would use them). There are several variations on this that have been shown to work. You aren't much of a tactician, are you?\n \n \nAs for the bomber, if they considered you a threat, and if they were tyrannical, odds are, it's carpet bombing time. We didn't do that in Iraq for OBVIOUS reasons. Your point is only valid if the government is trying to keep collateral damage down and wants to keep the populace in its favor. A tyrannical govenment doesn't care either. \n \n \n This is just ignorant. No government in the history of the world ahs carpetbombed its own population. The business of governemtn is to consolidate power, and the more people you have power overm the greater your power is. If youkill of huge numbers of your own population by carpet bombing them, you have effectively lost the war, since there is nobody left to govern. Who want to be the government of nothing?\n \n \n \nTrue, but we still have some rational, fiscal conseravatives in power. Not many, defintitely not in the whitehouse, but they are still there. However, we do know where 60% of the money is going. It's mandated by law. Simply go look it up. it's not like 80% was going into black ops. That would be scary and justification to own pretty much anything.\n\n \n I am not sure there is a tru fiscal conservative left on the hill anywhere. There are many that calim to be, but none that vote that way consistently. \n \n We do knwo what departments and in some cases what projects 60% of the budget goes to, but still less than half is open to direct public scrutiny (think public audit).",

I don't need to have any more qualification than that because, unlike lambert, I am not trying to pass myself off as an expert. You are quoting a layman as a source. This is bad form (to put it lightly). It destroys the credibility of your entire argument. \n \n No, \"violence against the person\" crime as reported by the home office has continued to rise every year, and is up 28% netween 2001/2002 and 2002/2003. Their \"violent against the person\" does not include sexual assaults, which are up 18% on their own. These are results combining the BCS (british crime survey) and the NCRS (national crime reportig standard). The NCRS is resonsible for the \"drop\" in crime that the GG's keep citing.

I was more than a little shocked to hear my fellow Americans, many of them ardent supporters of individual rights, making excuses and argument for being able to detain men without trial, charges, or access to the courts.

The majority of the founders were christian, but recognised that otehrs must also be given the freedom to worship as they see fit.\n\n Ok, but unless you are such a \"diest\" yourself, you then cannot say that the founding father's very own belief about these rights being granted by their creator is relevant today.\n \n \nA government that fails to recognise that there are basic human rights which cannot be tampered with is a dangerous one indeed.\nAgreed.\n The problem remains though: Is being allowed to own firearms such a basic right? I think not. \n However, i think we all can agree that the decision if a certain right is a basic one that doesn't need to be stated somewhere is something that is mostly up to personal belief, and that debates about this are quite pointless.\n \n Let's analyze it:\n \n So far i see several different viewpoints about this:\n \n 1. - Owning firearms is a (1a) natural/basic or (1b)god given right. This currently being endorsed by the Bill of Rights is nice but not really neccessary. Without the Bill of Rights, someone would still have that right\n \n 2. - Owning firearms is in the Bill of Rights, therefore it is some kind of holy right. No further justification required.\n \n 3. - Owning firearmy is someone's right because it's in the Bill of Rights. It's in the Bill of Rights because the Bill of Rights is the written form of the opinion of the majority of \"the people\". These people believe in owning firearms to be a right for a multitude of reasons, but the only actually relevant thing is that enough people do believe that it is someone's right to own firearms.\n \n *raises hand*\n I obviously belong to group three. I of course agree that you currently have a legal right to own firearms (that's kinda indisputable), but that this is not a basic right in a moral or natural sense, and that the legal right should be either removed or *severely* restricted (i.e. crime register checks, mandatory safety training, unexpected checks if the weapon is kept at a safe place).\n So if the others in this thread belong to group 1a, then we don't need to continue, as it's a matter of personal belief, and that's not really debateable.\n 1b would be debateable, as there are \"hard facts\", in scripture and the preamble of the Constitution that can be used to argue about. All that realistically might be achieved from my point of view is a shift to group 1a or 2 though. I certainly won't change my position either.\n \n Group 2 seems not to be present here, fortunately. Debating with them is pointless.\n \n If you belong to group 3 as i do, but on the opposite side, then again it's a matter of personal belief. We then have no hard facts to debate about, and it's just rhetorics.",

Some exceptions do, of course, exist, like a 9mm UZI, which is no more or no less powerful than a 9mm singleshot.\n \n The .223 is a \"hypervelocity\" round, which seems to imply to some that it is something special.

So, since you can very easily build a full auto weapon in a matter of an hour or 2 (depending on how good you want it) using a CNC mill and a few pieces of stock material, should we also outlaw CNC mills and metal stock?

If you think that's the case, then we need to ban motorcycles because you can get somewhere just as easily in a car, but motorcycles are more dangerous. However, I do feel that there should be very strict laws on who can purchase assault weapons. Having very thorough background checks on ALL gun purchases is the only way to prevent these types of crimes. Just banning guns in general will only make it worse. Then you will have all the criminals who still have their guns, and the innocent people who want to protect themselves won't be able to because they can't buy guns. It is like underage drinking. It is illegal, however they ignore this and drink anyway. Guns will always be around no matter what happens. So get over it...GUNS WILL NEVER BE BANNED!!!!",

   "You can collect whatever you want bud, I couldn't give a :xcensored .\n \n BTW a \"gat\" is slang for a HANDGUN, any HANDGUN not just the 9mm.\n \n You aren't going to stop anybody with a shotgun in your house.

I would see that big barrel coming around the corner, and I would cap you thru the wall, wayed to go hero! I dont keep assault rifles for home protection.

You could not hit a moving target with a bolt action. Many highly trained snipers cannot hit moving targets. Have you even tried shooting a moving target with a handgun, while your moving....very hard,and takes alot of practice.

   "Can you point me to the law on this? \n \n Haven't seen you argue why you need it. \n\n \n Sure, gun control act of 1968 pertinent text reads:\n \n (\n1) any firearm or ammunition to any individual who the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe is less than eighteen years of age, and, if the firearm, or ammunition is other than a shotgun or rifle, or ammunition for a shotgun or rifle, to any individual who the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe is less than twenty-one years of age;\n\n \n Have to be 21 to purchase a handgun, 18 for a rifle or shotgun. \n \n You probably don't need it. Of course, could you please demonstrate for me why you need the right to vote, or the rigth to free speech? You probably really don't. For some reason, though, I have this idea ticking around in my head that these are important.\n \n You need it because guns are power. Some peoples claim that free speech is power, or the right to vote is power. This is nothing, though folks who are speaking or voting can easily be shot. Power in the united states is ultimatly supposed to lie with the citizens, therefore the citizens need to have enough guns, and guns of suitable design, to ensure that power remains with the people. 60 million people talking creats a lot of hot air. 60 million people shooting creates change.\n \n \n \nAs are you. A tyrannical government will simply carpet bomb you, you make like it hasn't happend in the past. Explain to me how a assualt weapon will be able to stop a bomber at 30,000 feet. Oh wait, you can't. \n \n \n Uh, no, I am well versed in modern military tactics. No government in history has ever carpet bombed their own population. No government ever will. That would almost certainly turn even more of your own against you, and there is no point in being a tyrannical government if you have no one to rule. you keep tossing out this \"carpet bombing\" thing. It has never, ever, even once, in all of history, happened. Lets quite harping on it. Even in the event that it DID occur, it is not as effective as many seem to think. we carpet bombed the hell out of vietnam, and we still lost. \n \n \n \n \nLast time I checked, civilian life wasn't based around war. Weapons used in war and weapons used to defend your house are very different. As for Shotguns, they do bring them, but the automatic type, such as a USAS (but a stabler version, considering the mishaps with that one). \n \n \n Weapons used in war and weapons used to defend your house are not at all different when it comes to standard arms. Maneuverable weapons with high capacity magazines are the best option for defense. End of story.\n \n The current standard issue shotgun for the US military is the M1014. It is made by benelli and based on the popular super 90 (which is available for civilian consumption at most gun stores. Prior to this, the remington 870 and Mossberg 500 were the official issue combat shotguns. The USAS was made in S Korea and was never oficially issued to US troops. The reson for the switch fromt he 807 and 500 is that they determined that they were too combersome to use in a restrictive environment (I.E inside a building). They will still not be general issue combat weapons (nor have they ever) and instead will be reserved for special forces and perimeter security operations.\n \n \n \nThis makes me wonder if you know anything or are just a really good bser. A gat is a .9 mm common knowledge. \n \n \n Actually, I looked it up. The definition I saw did not say 9mm, just that it was \"common urban slang for a handgun\". I am too old to bother keeping up with the current verbal idiosyncracies in use by inner city youth. I am guessing that, from your viewpoints, you are not from the inner city. Apparently poor english is leaking out and infecting the rest of us. Sad.\n \n \nSo you'd have no problem with me pointing SAWs and LAWs at your house? Or morters as well? Perhaps tank cannons?\n\n \n Actually, yes, sicne pointing a wepaon at somebody is a crime. If you wanted to store them in a safe manor and in accordance with the law, I have no problem with this.\n \n \nNO ONE HERE HAS PRESENTED A NEED FOR A WEAPON OF WAR. \n \n \n a. several legitimate uses have been presented\n b. there is absolutly no reason for anybody to present a \"need\". it is a right, that is all the justification that is required.\n \n Perhaps you could present the argument for doing away with these weapons (that you apparently know little or nothing about). Pls, take into account the fact that this IS indisputably a right.\n \n \nNone that you accept. There is no need for weapons on war in civilian life. Two, making more avaliable simply allows criminals to steal them and go on highly publicized rampages. Three, The arguments FOR it are pathetic. The government will kill you if it goes tyrannical. The \"you have no right to decide what I need\" is yelled at when it goes back at you, doublestandard. \n \n \n You calim there is no need, but you have shown nothing to back this up.\n \n No criminal has EVER used a stolen assault rifle to go on a rampage. Nt once, not ever, not one, single time. So this argument is pretty much worthless. \n \n Throughout history, tyranical governments have ALWAYS met their downfall due to an uprising in the general population. Every single one. The romans were destroyed by an army led by a foreigner, but composed of disgruntled former subjects. The beginning of the end for the USSR was their defeat in Afghanistan. This showed others that they could be beat, and it wasn;t longt before they spent themsleves to death just trying to secure their nation. You have yet to provide any factual data to support this point. \n \n We are right, you have no right to tell us what we need when we are discussing a right. Perhapse you could better explain this \"double standard\". I am not understanding what you are talking about, but would be interested to hear the explanation.\n \n \n \nThis simply furthers the hypocracy of the right. They say the liberal media is a lying about tyrannical government yet want weapons to defend aganist this \"lie.\" If it wasn't a lie, why are they saying the claims of it are lies? \n \n \n Wow, this seems to be a lot of double think and gross generalizations all wrapped up in one poorly punctuated sentence. \n \n I don't recall anybody making a statement about the liberal media in this entire thread. Perhapse I missed it along the way. \n \n I don't think, at the end of the day, that people are concerned about defending themselves against biased media. Most newscasters and reporters I am aware of would probably make poor combatants. I thisk that people are concerned about having the ability to protect theri homes and their familes from threats, including tyrannical governments.\n \n \n \n \nIt's actually not that hard, assuming you don't suck. Simply pop out of a doorway and shoot, then move back, or into another room. Do you really expect simpyl to just stand there? As for a bolt action, you must really suck if you can't take out a moving target 50-100 feet from you. I can. Apparently you can't. I'm not saying that you should shoot them from a moving helicopter. \n \n \n The problem is maneuverability. It is more difficult to take down a bad guy at close range with a long barreled gun. Same reason it is realtively easy for a guy on foot to take out a tank which has only a main gun. Going through a doorway with a pistol, or an SMG is simple. You can get through the door while holding the weapon in a fire ready position and the short barrel length makes target acquisition simpler and quicker. Long gun changes this. Not only does the longer barrel require a longer swing to get on target, if the bad guy can get inside the effective length of the weapon, it is essentially useless. \n \n Inside a house, a handgun or SMG is a much better weapon than a shotgun or a long barreled rifle. In the open, the best weapon at short range (<200 meters) is undoubtedly an assault rifle of some kind. Against multiple targets or in an extended engagement, a fully automatic weapon has it merits...\n \n \nChrist sakes. None of you are even listening. Hmm, first swarm I've hit in some time. \n \n \n We are all listening, your arguments are nonsense. You have no factual or historical evidence that supports your position. Your argument seems to be based entierly in ignorance of the subeject you are attempting to debate.\n \n \nI'll leave you with this question (but you all seem to ignore it): would you like it if I stockpiled assault weapons, RPGs, LAWs, SAWs, nade launchers, tank weapons, assorted charges, thousands of rounds of ammo, and body armor and I lived next to you?\n\n \n Really couldn't care less. Personally, I feel better knowing that the folks who live nearest to me are well armed and know how to use their weapons. I live far enough from town that it takes the sheriffs department over 15 minutes to get here. It is nice to know that if needed, I can count on the guy up the road to help me out in a tight spot, and if that may involve the need for firearms, he has the tools and the skills required.",

I said \"no criminal has ever used a stolen assault weapon to go on a rampage\". In context:\n \n \nNo criminal has EVER used a stolen assault rifle to go on a rampage. Nt once, not ever, not one, single time. So this argument is pretty much worthless. \n \n \n This is direct from the DOJ statistics using all years fro which data is available. It has NEVER, EVER happened. There have been stolen assault weapons used in commiting crimes. 3 in the last 18 years (no data available before that). So, you want to ban these weapons because 2 times in the last 18 years they have been stolen and used in crimes? Are you smioking crack? Looking at teh numbers, we should encourage people to buy assault weapons instead of handguns. The simple fact of the matter is, assault weapons are an exceptionally poor choice of weapon fro commiting crime.\n \n \nAnd if I had a questionable past, it would be okay with you if I have a apache outback, numerous SAM missiles, tatical nukes, rows and rows of RPGs, SAWs, LAWs, Dragon missiles, several hundred thousand rounds of ammunition, automatic shotguns, automated machine guns, mine fields, trip wires connected to assorted charges, laser guided tatical neutron missiles, gernade and motar launchers, Vx launchers, Sarin dispensers, mustard gas canisters, and all of it was pointed at your house? After all, you have no right to decide what I can need. \n \n \n Yes, that would bother me greatly, sicne it would be illegal for you to have any of that pointed at my house. Further, it would be illegal for you to posess a neutron missile, since there is no company producing those that sell to civilians, whcih means you STOLE it or bought it hot. Vx Launchers are jsut empty tubes, so that doesn;t bother me, I have a \"sarin dispenser\" in my barn. It is a crop sprayer (that is actually what they used for direct dispersion, weird, huh? they ordered them directly from new holland). Mustard gas cannisters are not even a problem as long as they are empty. Posession of chemical weapons by the united states government or any citizen of the uniteds states is illegal. \n \n As far as \"questionable background\", are you a felon? Are you mentally deficient? Those are the only two things that can, in this coutry, curtail your rights. \n \n \nThe Russians carpet bombed Afgani towns and cities during its occupation of the region. \n \n \n Yes, they did. We are not discussing invaders carpet bombing during their invasion. This is what we did in vietnam. Wait.....the russians LOST in afghanistan and were froced from the country by a militia that did not posess a single fighter plane, had very few AA missiles (until the last 2 years of the war, when it became incredibly apparent that they were going to win and we sent stinger missiles, they did not manage to shoot down a single russian plane). We also lost in vietnam, against an enemy without an air force, or even air support, and lacking anything that could knock down our planes effectively. I am seeing a pattern here, and it is saying \"carpet bombing is not that effective\".\n \n \nSudan rountinely carpet bombed the population centers in the South for years. \n \n \n Really? hard to believe since sudan has NO medium or heavy bombers. Their last bomber went non operational in 1991, it was a mig 23 (foghter/bomber). Fighter/bombers are not capable of carpet bombing anything. do you even know what \"carpet bomb\" means? The sudanese have been using eithe mig 17s configured for ground attack, or Su-22's borrowed from libya since then. They have even stooped to using cargo planes and literally having two guys toss bombs out the back. The highest casualty count of any sudanese air attack is less than 100. You do not carpet bomb population centers for years and never manage to kill more than 100 people in a shot. \n \n \n \nRussia carpet bombed Chechnya.\n\n \n No, they didn't. They threatened to crapet bomb Grozny, but never did it. Take a look at http://www.hrw.org/reports/1997/WR97/HELSINKI-13.htm if you are interested in what has transpired in Chechnya so far in regards to Russian war crimes. It is a report form Human Rights Watch. They have people on the ground there. Carpet bombing is a pretty serious deal, if it wqas going on, you can bet your great aunt mauds girdle that tey would have reported it.\n \n Chechnya is kind of a differnet situation than anything you would ever be likely to find in America. They declared their independance, have no backing, no materials, and only weapons that they have managed to obtain on the black market. They are fighting an enemy with some pretty serious international support (though publicly we condem what is going on there, we turn a blind eye and even offer some degree of support. This has to do with 41 nukes that were in Chechnya when they declared independance that have yet been unaccounted for).\n \n I think maybe you are confused as to what \"carpet bombing\" is, kind of like you apparently had no idea at all waht an assault weapon was, you just thought they sounded scary.\n \n I have noticed that your posts keep getting shorter and shorter, and you leave more and more unanswered. Are you getting tired of being beat of ther head with the rediculousness of your argument? This last post is nothing more than a pathetic emotional plea.

They would not be covered under the second ammendment anyway, since they are purely offensive weapons, while things like rifles, RPG's, etc... do have a defensive role. Same with tactical nukes. You do not use nukes or chemical weapons on your home turf, since they kill large numbers of people indiscriminatly and killing off a large segment of your population or irradiating a large section of your landmass is not a step that would concievably be taken in the course of defending your country within your own borders. \n \n Note the \"within your own borders\" because that is the only place that our FF's intended for us to defend our country. We were never meant to have a trillion dollar military standing around waiting for orders to ship off to bosnia to quell the civil war there, or to somolia to do battle with eveil warlords. this was decidedly NOT within the percieved scope of the united states (playing cop to the world). This is a duty the federal government has taken upon itself, much to the detriment of the entire world, including our own nation (just trying to keep the \"what if you wanted to launch a nuke against another nation to defend America\" idiocy in the trash can where it belongs).\n \n Conflicts overseas are strictly the responsibilty of the federal government. No single citizen of the united states has the right or the duty to engage in such conflicts, therefore there is no need, or roght, for American citizens to own weapons of a purely offensive nature that would not concievably be used in a domestic situation in defense of the nation.",

   "Why are chemical and biological weapons illegal? Because we signed a non-proliferation treaty. They would not be covered under the second ammendment anyway, since they are purely offensive weapons, while things like rifles, RPG's, etc... do have a defensive role. Same with tactical nukes.\n\n \n And why did we sign the pact? I disagree with \"offensive weapons\" stance. Many countries in the past have maintained nuclear, biological and chemical weapons as deterrents aganist attacks. A deterrent is a form of defense. Therefore, a tactical nuke, anthrax, mustard gas, and VX are all considered defensive weapons. \n \n \nYou do not use nukes or chemical weapons on your home turf, since they kill large numbers of people indiscriminatly and killing off a large segment of your population or irradiating a large section of your landmass is not a step that would concievably be taken in the course of defending your country within your own borders\n\n \n On the contrary, Interceptor missiles, a form of defense, are armed with nuclear weapons. And, if I recall correctly, Saddam used chemical weapons aganist invading Iranians on his home turf. As for normal people, should you be facing a large army of enemy troops on your home turf, the simplest way to removing them, and thereby removing the threat would be to realease a tatical, or chemical attack. Also, Castro, backed by the USSR, was planning to use tatical nukes in Cuba in the senario of a large US marine invasion.\n \n So Using Rev. HellH0und 's logic, I have every right to own every military weapon ever created because you have no right to decide what I need. Rev.

(Cook, Philip J., \"Robbery Violence,\" Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, 78-2, (1987):357-376.) For assaults, a crime which includes threats, the most widely cited estimate of the fatality rate is derived from a 1968 analysis of assaults and homicides committed in Chicago. The study, prepared for the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, reported that gun attacks kill 12.2 percent of their intended victims. This is about 5 times as often as in attacks with knives, the second most deadly weapon used in violent crimes.(Newton, G.D., and F.E. Zimring, Firearms and Violence in American Life: A Staff Report Submitted to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, Washington, D.C.: National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, 1969.)\" \n http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~zj5j-gttl/guns.htm\n \n So guns make it easier to kill.

   "I have not read every post in this thread, but since it started on a theme of confiscation of private arms, I thought some here might find the history of how our Continental Congress sought to justify a call to armed resistance once hostilities broke out relevant to the thread. On July 6, 1775, the Congress published a DECLARATION OF THE CAUSES AND NECESSITY OF TAKING UP ARMS. I think these portions of that Declaration are pertinent to this debate (In particular, note the disdain for the first attempt to confiscate private arms by a registration and secured storage scheme):\n \n The Congress first made the following complaint:\n \n But why should we enumerate out injuries in detail? By one statute it is declared that parliament can 'of right make laws to bind us in all cases whatsoever.' What is to defend us against so enormous, so unlimited a power? Not a single man of those who assume it, is chosen by us; or is subject to our control or influence; but, on the contrary, they are all of them exempt from the operation of such laws, and an American revenue, if not diverted from the ostensible purposes for which it is raised, would actually lighten their own burdens in proportion, as they increase ours. We saw the misery to which such despotism would reduce us. We for ten years incessantly and ineffectually besieged the throne as supplicants; we reasoned, we remonstrated with parliament, in the most mild and decent language.\n \n It then noted the Government's response:\n \n Administration sensible that we should regard these oppressive measure as freemen ought to do, sent over fleets and armies to enforce them.\n \n Which was followed by the first attempt to seize weapons:\n \n General Gage . . . sent ought from [Boston] a large detachment of his army, who made an unprovoked assault on the inhabitants of the said province, at the town of Lexington, as appears by the affidavits of a great many persons, some of whom were officers and soldiers of the detachment, murdered eight of the inhabitants, and wounded many others. From thence the troops proceeded in warlike array to the town of Concord, where they set upon another party of the inhabitants of the same province, killing several and wounding more, until compelled to retreat by the country people suddenly assembled to repel this cruel aggression.\n \n Which was followed by an attempt to seize private arms in Boston by a sham \"registration\" and \"secured storage\" scheme:\n \n The inhabitants of Boston being confined within that town by the general their governor, and having, in order to procure their dismission, entered into a treaty with him, it was stipulated that the said inhabitants having deposited their arms with their own magistrates, should have liberty to depart, taking with them their own effects. They accordingly delivered up their arms, but in open violation of honor, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even savage nations esteemed sacred, the governor ordered the arms deposited as aforesaid, that they might be preserved for their owners, to be seized by a body of soldiers; detained the greatest part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their most valuable effects behind.\n \n Which was followed by the following proclamation:\n \n The general, further emulating his ministerial masters, by a proclamation bearing date on the 12th. of June, after venting the grossest falsehoods and calumnies against the good people of these colonies, proceeds to '[D]eclare them all, either by name or description, to be rebels and traitors, to supersede the course of the common law, and instead thereof to publish and order the use and exercise of the law martial.'\n \n WHAT WAS THE RESPONSE TO THESE COMPLAINTS?\n \n We are reduced to the alternative of choosing an unconditional submission to the tyranny of irritated ministers, or resistance by force. The latter is our choice. We have counted the cost of this contest, and find nothing so dreadful as voluntary slavery. Honor, justice, and humanity, forbid us tamely to surrender that freedom which we received from our gallant ancestors, and which our innocent posterity have a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the infamy and guilt of resigning succeeding generations to that wretchedness which inevitably awaits them, if we basely entail hereditary bondage upon them.\n \n Our cause is Just. Our Union is Perfect. Our internal resources are great, and, if necessary, foreign assistance is undoubtedly attainable. - We gratefully acknowledge, as signal instances of the Divine favor towards us, that his Providence would not permit us to be called into this severe controversy, until we were grown up to our present strength, had been previously exercised in warlike operation, and possessed of the means of defending ourselves. With hearts fortified with these animating reflections, we most solemnly, before God and the world, declare, that, exerting the utmost energy of those powers, which our beneficent Creator hath graciously bestowed upon us, the arms we have been compelled by our enemies to assume, we will, in defiance of every hazard, with unabating firmness and perseverence, employ for the preservation of our liberties; being with one mind resolved to die freemen rather than to live slaves.\n \n We fight not for glory or for conquest. We exhibit to mankind the remarkable spectacle of a people attacked by unprovoked enemies, without any imputation or even suspicion of offence. They boast of their privileges and civilization, and yet proffer no milder conditions than servitude or death.\n \n In our own native land, in defense of the freedom that is our birthright, and which we ever enjoyed till the late violation of it - for the protection of our property, acquired solely by the honest industry of our fore-fathers and ourselves, against violence actually offered, we have taken up arms. We shall lay them down when hostilities shall cease on the part of the aggressors, and all danger of their being renewed shall be removed, and not before.\n \n What effect, if any, can we describe this document as having upon the debates for ratification of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights? In my opinion, you can see some of the same fire in Anti Federalist rhetoric:\n \n My great objection to this Government is, that it does not leave us the means of defending our rights; or, of waging war against tyrants. . . .The Honorable Gentleman who presides, told us, that to prevent abuses in our Government, we will assemble in Convention, recall our delegated powers, and punish our servants for abusing the trust reposed in them. Oh, Sir, we should have fine times indeed, if to punish tyrants, it were only sufficient to assemble the people. Your arms wherewith you could defend yourselves, are gone. . . . Did you ever read of any revolution in any nation, brought about by the punishment of those in power, inflicted by those who had no power at all? You read of a riot act in a country [England] which is called one of the freest in the world, where a few neighbors cannot assemble without the risk of being shot by hired soldiery, the engines of despotism. We may see such an act in America. A standing army we shall have also, to execute the execrable commands of tyranny: And how are you to punish them? Will you order them to be punished? Who shall obey these orders? Will your Mace-bearer be a match for a disciplined regiment? In what situation are we to be? . . . .What resistance could be made? The attempt would be madness.  Patrick Henry, Speeches of June 5 and 7, 1788, before the Virginia Ratifying Convention, reprinted in The Anti-Federalist Papers and the Constitutional Convention Debates, pages 199-216, Mentor Books, 1986, edited by Ralph Ketchum.\n \n What was the Federalist response? Here are a few examples I find illustrative:\n \n Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power, and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive. Noah Webster, \"An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution\" (1787) in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).\n \n The power of the sword, say the minority of Pennsylvania, is in the hands of Congress. My friends and countrymen, it is not so, for the powers of the sword are in the hands of the yeomanry of America from sixteen to sixty. The militia of these free commonwealths, entitled and accustomed to their arms, when compared with any possible army, must be tremendous and irresistible. Who are the militia? Are they not ourselves? Is it feared, then, that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom? Congress shall have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birth-right of an American ....[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People. Tench Coxe, Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.\n \n Many people have forgotten that Tench Coxe was a close friend of James Madison. To assist Madison win approval for his Bill of Rights, Coxe wrote a treatise entitled: Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. In his \"Remarks\", Coxe described the 2nd. Amendment as follows:\n \n As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms. Tench Coxe, Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. Published under the pseudonym, \"A Pennsylvanian\" in the Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 at 2 Col. 1.\n \n Coxe forwarded his work to Madison, who at the time was campaigning in New York to influence the citizens of that state to accept his amendments. Coxe, realizing that his Remarks could help sway popular opinion in New York, wrote to Madison saying:\n \n It has appeared to me that a few well tempered observations on these propositions might have good effect. . . .It may perhaps be of use in the present turn of the public opinions in New York State. .  . Tench Coxe, 12 Madison Papers, pp. 239-240 (Rutland Ed. 1979) [Letter from Coxe to Madison, June 18, 1789].\n \n Madison responded by thanking Coxe, and he noted that Coxe's printed remarks enclosed are already I find in the Gazettes here....  He then went on to state that his proposed amendments (including the 2nd.) were therefore already indebted to the co-operation of your pen. James Madison, 12 Madison Papers, p. 257 (Rutland Ed. 1979) [Letter from Madison to Coxe, June 24, 1789].\n \n I guess my question is this: How can any of this be squared with the \"collective right\" theory?\n ---------------------------------------------------------------\n Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding. Justice Louis Brandeis, Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928).",

   "I had to respond to this one.\n \n So, to any gun owners, let me ask some questions, and please answer honestly.\n \n How many guns do you own?\n \n Two. Why is this important to you?\n \n What kind of guns are they?\n \n Legally owned and obtained pistols. Is that alright, or do you think I should exchange them for a different type? If so, why?\n \n {N/A}\n Do you have children that are or were under the age of 19?\n If yes, Have your children ever touched or played with your gun?\n If yes, Have your children ever touched your gun outside of your supervision?\n If yes, Do you have a means of knowing whether or not you children has accessed your gun without your knowledge or consent? \n If yes, have your ever educated or punished your child for inquiring or infringing up on your gun? {N/A}\n \n Do you believe a family with a child should own a gun?\n \n That's completely up to them. I wouldn't presume to form beliefs about what someone else's family chooses to do. If they want to own a gun, that's their business. What do you think, and why?\n \n Do you believe it is necessary to own more than one gun?\n \n For me, yes. Do you believe it is necessary for me to own less than one gun?\n \n Do you believe it is necessary to own an assault rifle over say a shotgun?\n \n Given the choice, I'd take the assault rifle. I have owned a shotgun before and since I don't hunt or shoot trap much I have little use for it. If you had the opportunity to shoot one, which would you be most interested in shooting?\n \n Do you live in a neighborhood were violence and break-ins occur on a regluar basis?\n \n I wouldn't say regular, but they are more frequent now than they were in the past. How's your neighborhood?\n \n Do you own guns simply as a hobby, recreation, or means of protection?\n \n All of the above. Primarily as a hobby, but since they are already there, I'd use them for defense over a baseball bat or kitchen knife since I believe I could hurt or kill an attacker before they got close enough to do me significant harm. Of your hobbies and sources of recreation, which would you find most useful in a life threatening situation?\n \n In the event that you own a gun as a hobby, what is so interesting about them? Do you use the hobby guns?\n \n I find it hard to distinguish between hobbies and recreation. I suppose guns appeal to the same part of me that hotrods do car enthusiasts. If you asked a car guy the same question, his answer would likely be just as intangible.\n \n In the even that you own a gun for recreation, why?\n \n See my answer above. I guess they satisfy the part of me that wants to do something interesting with the time I don't spend working or sleeping. Why do you do whatever hobbies or recreational activities you participate in?\n \n In the event that you own a gun for safety, do you keep it loaded?\n \n That's a tough question. It could be interpreted to imply that keeping a loaded gun for safety is illogical because an uloaded one is safer than a live one. If your intent is to ask whether I store my gun loaded, the answer is no. If you want to know if would attempt to protect myself from an attack with an unloaded gun, the answer is, again, no. \n \n If you keep your gun loaded, is it locked up, away from you, or nearby?\n \n Locking up a loaded gun renders it useless for defense. Away and nearby are relative. My proximity to my guns varies from direct physical contact to hundreds of miles. \n \n If it is locked up away from you, how does it protect you?\n \n I protect myself. What protects you?\n \n If it is near you, is it possible for someone to steal it?\n \n No, unless I'm already dead.\n \n If it is unloaded, do you keep it near you?\n \n I'm not sure why the answer to this question is important to you, but I'll indulge. If I kept it near me unloaded, and kept it far from me loaded, I'd have to hire someone to do all the loading and unloading for me. Generally, if it's loaded and I performed the loading, it's near me.\n \n If not, how does it protect you?\n \n Again, I protect myself. If a gun makes that easier, then it follows that a loaded gun in close proximity will be better than an unloaded one locked in a basement.\n \n Have you ever shot your gun while drunk?\n Have you ever shot your gun while under the influence of drugs?\n \n The above two questions are so closely related I'll answer them simultaneously. No, that would be unsafe and illegal. Have you ever done anything that required concentration to be safe while under the influence of drugs or alchohol?\n \n Do you think that many gun owners are negligent?\n \n I think that the percentage of negligent gun owners will parallel the percentage of negligent people. What constitutes \"many\" could differ with your perspective.\n \n Have you ever been negligent with a gun?\n \n No. I wouldn't do anything that could cause my guns to be taken from me. Have you ever been negligent with something that was important to you?\n \n How do you think guns and assault rifles get circulated?\n \n I think they are circulated the same way all merchandise and property is circulated. I do find it interesting that you make a distinction between guns and assault rifles. \n \n How does a gun owner propose that we stop unecessary gun violence?\n \n What then, is necessary gun violence?\n First, I propose that we quit making the ridiculous distinction between \"gun violence\" and violence in general. Is violence involving a gun in some way more repugnant than basball bat violence, or car violence, or fist violence, or tire iron violence? Interesting that most people reading this will have never heard the term \"fist violence\", yet it occurs more frequently than \"gun violence\". The next thing I wpould propose is that we encourage an emphasis on honor, courtesy, hospitality, ettiquette, individual responsibility for our actions, and common sense.\n \n Does your proposal consider all of your answers above?\n \n After reviewing my answers, I don't think there is a conflict of interest.\n \n Can you propose any other self-defense options other than owning a gun?\n \n I am open to any suggestions that will allow me to immediately kill or render completely harmless anyone who attacks with intent to injure or kill me or those I care about.\n \n Are you a member of the NRA? \n \n No, but supposedly Michael Moore is. Could one infer that Michael Moore shares the sentiments of other NRA members based solely upon his membership? If not, then this question has no merit.\n \n Are you white?\n \n I'm not going to answer this one. By the time you have read this far, you probably already have a mental image of me based upon your associations of my responses with preconceived stereotypes. I ask that you tell me what race you think I belong to, and how you arrived at that conclusion. I believe we can learn a lot more about your way of thinking from your response than you could possibly hope to learn about me based upon my race.\n \n \n On a completely different note, and in response to all the talk of military uses of firearms, I find it fascinating that the same people who are adamantly opposed to the preemptive disarmament of hostile nations wish to disarm their friends and neighbors at a time which an armed populace might become necessary if the war on terror makes it onto American soil again.",

Going through life making quick risk calculations about every passing stranger is not the way most of us want to live. (I realize you're just being silly.) :)\n \n What is it about a navy seal that makes them safer with a gun? Training? You said yourself (in another thread) that it requires very little knowledge to understand how a firearm operates.\n Perhaps you are a strong person with some martial arts training, and that makes you confidant in your ability to defend yourself against a non-projectile weapon. Well, criminals know karate too. It isn't even illegal. Since I have no formal martial training, (in fact, I have only been in three fights in my life, two of which were in school and I avoid physical confrontations if at all possible) I feel safer if I have an \"equalizer\" to help protect myself.\n \n Why are you less scared of a person with a baseball bat? Almost every young person has easy access to them, they are cheap, easily available, unregulated, and deadly. A convicted violent felon can walk into any sporting goods retailer and buy one immediately with no waiting period or background check. And even though they are hard to conceal, cops are unlikely to stop someone for carrying one. I can walk into a local convenience store with a bat without anyone batting an eye. :D \n Schools usually have plenty of them on site, and hand them out to children as if it's perfectly safe to do so. In fact, many schools have archery programs! You'd think the temptation to drve a bat through their classmates skulls, or implale them on an arrow would drive them to unheard of levels of rage and violence. Is a bow not a weapon? Was it not \"designed\" to kill at long range? Yet we trust that most shool children (who have access to powerful deadly weapons at school) won't bash each other's brains out. They apparently don't want to go around killing each other. I'll bet that the same kids who refuse to succumb to the temptation of slaying each other with bows and arrows, driving sharpened spikes of wood and lead (pencils) into each other's flesh, and crushing each other's bones with baseball bats would refuse to shoot each other with guns as well.\n \n Columbine? Those kids were plotting violence for a long time, and if guns weren't available, they would have used something else. What's to stop them from poisoning the food in the cafeteria? They could have killed even more people that way. Perhaps guns made their murderous rampage less effective, and poison is even more readily available. \n \n The fact is, there is something very different about people who murder, and access to weapons isn't it.",

   "\n The fact is, there is something very different about people who murder, and access to weapons isn't it.\n\n \n Maybe, but it doesn't exclude the fact that someone with a gun is potentially more deadly than someone without one. And you can never tell who has the capacity and who doesn't. It's just an arms race. So criminals have guns, now if you want to feel safe you might feel you also need a gun. If it were left at knives and such, someone that most everyone has if they have a stocked kitchen, or a $20 bat, would be even in the arms race. And more importantly, the range is hand-to-hand range, again, making it less likely that you won't have chance to defend yourself, and fleeing is much more effective.\n \n Even knives have laws against how long the blade is. There is, and should always be, laws against the \"type\" of weapons that civillians are allowed to own. So you want a Stinger Missle? It's an \"arm\", yet I think you understand why that's not something you want civillians to have.\n \n Much of this is devil's advocate. The issue for many gun control supporters is handguns and assault weapons. Owning a rifle or shotgun, long barrel guns, at least according to statistics, is no more common for killing than a knife. There's also the issue, as you point out, about WHO should be allowed to own a gun, and what upkeep/training do you have to keep up with.

And more importantly, the range is hand-to-hand range, again, making it less likely that you won't have chance to defend yourself, and fleeing is much more effective.\n \n \n The fact is, people vary greatly in their capacity to defend themselves in hand-to-hand combat. If a firearm saves one person's life from being beaten to death, it's worth it. \n I agree that a person walking down the street with a military style firearm would raise some eyebrows, but how often do you see that happen? I've never seen it happen before. What I have experienced is another story entirely.\n I used to work for a land surveyor. The section of town that my crew was assigned to has some of the worst crime in the city. One of our crew chiefs was shot in the stomach, and had over 14 inches of his intestine removed, and months of recovery. The way it happened was the crew chief, his son, and one other employee were measuring a house when a man rode up to the son on a bicycle. He pulled a gun on the boy and demanded his wallet. The crew chief was close enough to hit the gun with his clipboard to give his son a chance to run. The attacker turned and fired all six shots out of his revolver at the crew chief, and hit him twice in the abdomen. \n After discussing it with him months later, he told me that if he had had a gun, he would have had enough time to shoot the attacker (as is evident in the fact he was able to hit the attacker's gun out of the way with the clipboard) before anyone got hurt.\n On several occasions, the crew I worked on was threatened by the very type of thugs you described with racial slurs and threats of \"I'll hack you up ------\".\n Another time, we were working three blocks away from a shooting. I was behind the theodolite reading off the side of a house, and I heard several gunshots. I quickly stepped under the awning of the house for a minute or so in case any bullets might have gone into the air. After we completed the job about a half hour later, we drove over to see what had happened. Wouldn't you know it, we beat the police there. We saw a car riddled with bullets wrecked against a telephone pole, and nobody in sight. I guess whoever was driving wasn't hit, so they abandoned the scene.\n I began to carry a weapon when we had to work in those areas, and felt much more secure. My job performance improved, and I was much less stressed out at work. If we allow police to defend themselves with firearms, they should be good enough for citizens as well.\n \n I can tell you with complete candor that I would feel no safer if there were a complete ban on guns. That would not stop a group of thugs from attacking me. As an instrument man, I am in charge of a stationary instrument on a tripod that cannot be moved without wasting time and money on the job re-establishing a baseline. In addition, the machine is worth more money than the truck we use to drive to job sites. Often, an instrument man is left alone for several minutes at a time while the rest of the crew goes in search of monumentation several blocks away. A lone man, unarmed, in a hostile neighborhood where he is unwanted by the residents is an easy target. It's a wonder that in the six years I worked for the company, there was only one attack. \n \n Why is this so disturbing to you? \n Are you really concerned that law abiding gun owners will flip out and start shooting people for no good reason? Or are you upset that you can't go around picking fights with people without risking getting shot? \n \n So, to counter your point, yes. I am potentially as deadly as anyone who might attack me when I am armed with a gun. I wouldn't have it any other way.\n I don't have to spend money I can't afford, and time I don't have to learn how to defend myself in hand-to-hand combat, I can simply pull out my gun, and blow an attacker away without breaking a sweat. And because anyone can be potentially deadly by carrying a handgun, criminals will be less inclined to go around attacking innocent people. If they give the slightest care about their life, they will think twice before attacking someone.\n \n In a world where everyone is armed, nobody has an advantage. It stikes me odd that the same people who come down on the gun control side of issues do everything they can to make life fair and even for everyone. Overtaxing the wealthy, affirmative action, minumum wage increases... All are aimed at making things \"fair\". Why not give people a fair chance at defending themselves?\n Interestingly, these same people who would disarm their fellow Americans are rigidly opposed to preemptive disarmament of hostile nations armed with WMD's! If another nation who would kill us all if they could can be trusted with nukes and bioweapons, I'll go ahead and trust the guy across the street with a revolver. Why can't you?",

I believe you will find the law to be thorough and reasonable. If it were actively enforced without any changes, the very people you are most concerned with wouldn't have access to guns. As it is now, they are in violation of the law, it's only a matter of enforcing it.\n \n I'll agree that my co worker could have fared better if everyone had been armed with knives. Still, people did a good job of conquering nations before guns were invented. Presumably edged weapons were available to most nations, yet wars still occurred. It is the nature of humans to make war, on scales ranging from global conflicts to little gang fights in the streets.\n \n If the shootings would have been replaced with slashing from knives and swords, leaving many people alive but disfigured, and causing slow, painful deaths from blade wounds, imagine the public outrage then. No wonder death by firing squad was considered a humane form of execution, it's far less painful and barbaric than death by knifing squad. Given the choice, I'd rather die from a gunshot than any other weapon. I stand a better chance of dying quickly. \n \n Think about this. Dulling was a common practice in this country (particularly where I come from) for quite a while. It was mostly illegal, but people continued the practice anyway. As mass produced firearms became more accurate, more powerful, more affordable and more readily available, the practice was abandoned. Obviously laws weren't enough to prevent dulling. However, the ability to survive a duel became very difficult. Just another example of how modern firearms help prevent violence. Before, skill with a sword was often the deciding factor. Now, anyone could win a duel, so those people who used their superior fencing skills to bully others were stopped in their tracks. It's not as romantic, but it's a heck of a lot more civilized.\n \n Depending on which country you choose as your model, firearms laws (or lack thereof) can be used to demonstrate that people do (or do not) participate in more (or less) murders. I read somewhere that Australia has a growing problem with sword homicides! People are resourceful, they will find ways to kill each other with whatever means is available.\n \n I also believe that most people who pass the federal requirements for gun ownership will not choose killing as a first option. I know plenty of people who own guns. I have discussed defense scenarios with all of them. I don't believe any of them would not do their best to avoid shooting someone unless there was no other option.\n I, for instance, changed jobs. I no longer work in those crime infested areas. I have made a drastic change in my life to make myself safer. While I did feel much safer while working armed, I now no longer have to lug a heavy, bulky, uncomfortable pistol to work to feel safe anymore. Still, I like the fact that if the neighborhood where I now work went downhill fast, I have the right to use a gun to protect myself. I don't know what the statistics are for concealed carry permitees in my state are, but I read that since it's inception there are over 10,000 legal carriers, and only 3 shootings. All of them involved the permitee defending themselves and charges were either dropped or considered justifiable homicide. \n \n The law states that it is illegal to take a life under any circumstances, unless you have a reason to believe you are in immediate danger and using deadly force is the only way to prevent it. I believe that anyone who is willing to go through all the proper legal channels to obtain a gun and a carry permit will not suddenly break down at the last minute and kill someone without doing their best to avoid it first. If this is the government's position, then it can be taken to mean that we do have a right to self defense, even if it means breaking a law (homicide) to do it. \n \n If nobody broke the law, there would be no fear of violence. Violence is a problem of law enforcement, not legislation. We don't have enough honest, good policemen to enforce every little nitpicking law on the books. Since it's impossible to catch every person for every crime, I think leaving personal defense up to the individual's discretion is a wise decision. You can't sue the police if you get attacked, after all. Since your individual safety is left up to you, so should your options for ensuring it. The police seem to think handguns are an effective means of doing so. If police can't be there when we need them, at least their equipment can.\n You might ask how to get guns out of the hands of criminals before asking how to get guns out of the hands of people in general. You'd have to collect a lot less guns, and your efforts would be vastly more effective at reducing crime.\n \n I enjoy shooting targets very much, and even bought a small caliber target pistol (which is worthless as a weapon) for that purpose. However, I would feel horrible if I ever had to shoot someone, and I believe most legal gun owners would as well. In fact, the only way I'd shoot someone is if they threatened to kill me and were in the process of carrying out their threats. Believe me, it's the last thing I'd want to have to live with on my conscience. Still, I find that infinitely more palatable than dying because I didn't do everything in my power to stay alive. \n \n Finally, strong feelings on the topic or not, I enjoy debating with you. Keep up the good work! :)",

In public space, I have just as much right as anyone to do what I please so long as I am doing no harm to another person. That's why it's called public space. What if the government banned public assemblies or public churches. Would this not violate our right to peacfully assemble or worship in the manner we choose?

Chances are things will be very different when seen that way. Removing firearms from society does not prevent crime, it prevents crime conducted with firearms (although not completely). Criminals then find suitable substitutes and continue with their lives. At the same time, you also severaly cut the public's ability to defend itself and society will see an increase in both criminal/victim confrontations and daylight home invasions due to lack of fear. This is all evident in the UK following their gun control.",

   "These have nothing to do with the topic at hand, they can all be debated in their own right. You suggest that gun control advocates want to remove ALL guns, that's simply not true. They want more restrictions and a decrease in handguns for the most part. Basically, no one that really wants a gun for non-criminal reasons should be denied one, but they can't just say \"yeah, I want one.\", and get it without proving they can responsibly weild it. You know, same as going to fly a plane. You can't just get in one and legal start zooming around. You need to be trained, coached, get expensive experience flying, etc., etc. before you GET to take advantage of that right. No different.\n \n -Mach\n\n \n You can fly a plane without a license or training. Your can buy a plane without a license or training. Who says that you need one? A plane is private property. Just pay the right taxes and the plane is yours. Then take the plane to your PRIVATE PROPERTY and take off and fly over your own private property, just as long as you don't fly over civil air space. You can do anything you want on your private property and the space above it that does not incur civil air space.\n \n Your arguement would make sense if you need a licence to fly a plane. You don't.",

   "I'm not worried about them banning all guns. That would never happen. I'm worried about them banning handguns or other certain firearms not used for hunting. They'll keep chipping away until we are at the same level the UK and Australia is. Crime in the UK is huge, they might not have the firearm deaths, but other instruments replaced firearms. Australia even had heavily regulate swords recently, because people were taking them to pubs and chopping off arms.\n\n \n Slippery slope? I understand this psychological fear, that giving an inch, even if it's the right thing to do, is bad because you fear you'll lose it all because...well, it's debatable. But it's not constructive IMO. If it's the right thing to do, you do it, and it doesn't mean a slow \"erosion\" of anything. I know in the polarized political arena, any inch given is an inch your opposition gains and therefore it's \"evil\". But we're the citizens, we generally have a much better understanding of where the sweet spot is with restrictions or allowances of the law.\n \n \nYou can buy an plane and operate it over uninhabited land. Many of people do it each year without a problem in ultra lights. No license or training needed. For future reference, flying is a privilege not a right.\n \n I see no entitlements to flying on planes in the Constitution. Fell free to point it out to me.\n\n \n Correct me if I'm wrong, but there was no such thing as \"flying on a plane\" when it was written, so it's maybe not the best example.\n \n \nNo, it doesn't need proof of guilt. On the other hand, any law violating the Constitution, no matter how good or bad, is null and void. You want to limit or ban certain firearms? Have the 2nd Amendment changed in the constitution so that it says you can. That's the proper and right way of doing it, like it or not.\n\n \n The proper way is whatever legistlation passes, don't confuse yourself with absoultes, since there are none. You must also think a number of laws currently on the books are \"null and void\", and since they aren't \"null and void\", I don't buy the argument that they \"are\". You can't own certain guns right now, and it's not null and void...\n \n \nIgnorant people will always be so, there is not stopping them with laws. In public space, I have just as much right as anyone to do what I please so long as I am doing no harm to another person. That's why it's called public space. What if the government banned public assemblies or public churches. Would this not violate our right to peacfully assemble or worship in the manner we choose? They, just like restrictions on the 2nd Amendment, or violations of the Constitution.\n\n \n There is no stopping what ignorants/criminals will do, but you can certainly minimize the damage they do.\n \n \nI want to see overall numbers, resulting from any source of violence, not just firearms. Chances are things will be very different when seen that way. Removing firearms from society does not prevent crime, it prevents crime conducted with firearms (although not completely). Criminals then find suitable substitutes and continue with their lives. At the same time, you also severaly cut the public's ability to defend itself and society will see an increase in both criminal/victim confrontations and daylight home invasions due to lack of fear. This is all evident in the UK following their gun control\n\n \n From what I've read last night, I saw a number of statistics that pointed out that crime doesn't shift from one bracket to another like you might be pointing to. The link web site I linked above may have some of that, I'll certainly keep my eye out for that too. Much of comitting a crime is a threshold, guns can lower that threshold.\n \n People say things like \"well get a better population that doesn't want to commit so many crimes.\" That's fine, we can work TOWARDS that too, but right now we're living with a high homicide rate with handguns, it's not enough to \"hope for a more responsible population.\" \n \n -Mach",

   "Look here Numbers out of context and with no comparison don't tell the whole story.\n\n \n I've been reading a lot due to this topic (well, with what little evening time I have), and I noticed that a particular series of \"contextual analysis\" were done and linked all over the place. When I found the sources it either a private organization that supported gun rights, or the NRA, which is even more obviously polarized. \n \n While reading last night I found two frequent sources. One that talked about \"the facts\", and \"the real deal\", and their sources all linked backed to priviate pro-gun groups or directly to the NRA, like your link. A number of others, on the opposite side, were hardcore anti-gun sites. I don't really think either are useful as a single source. I looked hard (in the short time I have in the evenings!) to find fairly neutral sources, like raw statistics or in the above case, the CDC. It did have a number of comparison rates, and I don't know what context we need than the clear definition of what the statistics were measuring. If you read the first site and not just the pic, you'll the analysis, but it doesn't say \"this is because of this.\" It sites some references, and doesn't make broad statements as if they were fact.\n \n The rate for firearm-related deaths among children in the United States (1.66) was 2.7-fold greater than that in the country with the next highest rate (Finland, 0.62)\n \n I think this is the key, I've seen other posters say similar things: (From same CDC link)\n \n \"Editorial Note: The findings in this report document a high rate of death among U.S. children associated with violence and unintentional firearm-related injuries, particularly in comparison with other industrialized countries. Even though rates in all other countries were lower than those in the United States, rates among other countries varied substantially and were particularly low in some countries. Although specific reasons for the differences in rates among countries are unknown, previous studies have reported on the associations between rates of violent childhood death and low funding for social programs (6), economic stress related to participation of women in the labor force (7,8), divorce, ethnic-linguistic heterogeneity, and social acceptability of violence (9). \"\n \n Shoot! If I ever wanted to get serious about gun laws my wife would have to quit work??? OK, I throw in the towel!! ;)\n \n Seriously though, makes you wonder if we should be supporting more stringent immigration laws, social programs, and something to ease tensions between culture/race. That is, if we want to save those statistical lives. And another disclaimer - I'm just providing some devil's advocate on a very interesting topic. I really do think civilillians not being completely without the power to resist the military is a profoundly positive thing. We all know what happens when power gets into too few hands...\n \n -Mach",

But we're the citizens, we generally have a much better understanding of where the sweet spot is with restrictions or allowances of the law.\n\n \n We gave an inch, they took 5 miles. Gun control is a fairly new concept in this nation starting in the '30s with the NFA. Regulated and defined firearms, some more heavily then others. That's OK, we can handle that. The laws got even more strict in the late '60s with the GCA. Ok, you commit a Felony (not all of which are violent), you don't deserve a firearm, further restrictions are listed, but it's still ok. In the '80s, EOs and FOPA based on these two former laws actually banned firearms, before then they were just regulated. Whoops, looks like after they defined them and limited them to non-criminals, it just wasn't enough. We can handle it though, I don't own a machine gun and we can buy firearms like those banned from import here in the US. Fast forward to the '90s and they have banned AWs based on features, some of which effect target and hunting rifles and have no effect on firearm leathality. Yet you can accidently violate the law and land yourself 10 years in prison. Now they are even trying to ban .50 caliber target rifles because they're deadly and the military uses them. Any firearm can be deadly and we developed those rifles. The military thought it was a good idea and adopted them in the '80s. A bill submitted to reauthorize and make the AWB stricter by Feinstien basically bans all semi-auto rifles and gives authority to one figure to ban any firearm they please. These are all federal laws, and yes it is a slippery slope and it's going downhill at a 90 degree angle.\n \n \nThe proper way is whatever legistlation passes, don't confuse yourself with absoultes, since there are none. You must also think a number of laws currently on the books are \"null and void\", and since they aren't \"null and void\", I don't buy the argument that they \"are\". You can't own certain guns right now, and it's not null and void...\n\n \n Any law violating the Constitution is null and void. The 2nd Amendment clearly states \"...shall not be infringed.\" Anyone can tell that banning something from ownership is infringement. Since banning firearms started in the '80's, we would need SCOTUS case where firearm ownership was an issue. There hasn't been one to my knowledge and they keep not accepting such cases to prevent having to rule on such a controversial subject.\n \n \n \nThere is no stopping what ignorants/criminals will do, but you can certainly minimize the damage they do.\n\n \n At what price? No current gun control law, since GCA (with the exception of Brady) has done a damn thing that can even be recognized in making a dent in crime. The CDC, the people from the link you posted, can't even determine whether gun control is effective via a report they made late last year. If you ban handguns, they move to sawed off rifles and shotguns, plus they're easier to buy. It doesn't matter that it's illegal to go below a 26\" AOL, they're criminals. Ban full-auto (we already have) or semi-auto? They'll smuggled them from Mexico and Canada, the Hollywood shootout was a perfect example of this (full-auto).\n \n \nFrom what I've read last night, I saw a number of statistics that pointed out that crime doesn't shift from one bracket to another like you might be pointing to. The link web site I linked above may have some of that, I'll certainly keep my eye out for that too. Much of comitting a crime is a threshold, guns can lower that threshold.\n\n \n Look at crime rates in the UK, not just homocides. Then compare to crime rates in the US. Are their crime rates lower, if any?\n \n \nPeople say things like \"well get a better population that doesn't want to commit so many crimes.\" That's fine, we can work TOWARDS that too, but right now we're living with a high homicide rate with handguns, it's not enough to \"hope for a more responsible population.\" \n\n \n You have it all backwards. Don't ban the handguns, work towards improving society through laws first. Not only are you treating the source problem, you'll not be violating any constitutional rights in the process. Once you lose a right, the chances of getting it back are almost nothing. The AWB sunsetting was a one in million chance due to politician foresight, and the fact that they couldn't get it passed without it.\n emoticon_rolleyes",

Taking guns away is what we are discussing. Many of us don't believe that is the right thing to do. \n I feel very strongly about 2nd amendment rights. In fact, I think the current laws are too restrictive. I'd love to get my hands on a full auto mac 10 and go out on my friend's land and rip through a couple of high capacity magazines just for the sheer delight of it. I wouldn't be hurting anyone, but we can't do this because it's illegal. Heck, I think it'd be awesome if you could buy RPG's and go shoot them at junk cars as long as you're on private property. As long as you aren't hurting anyone, what's the problem? Well, the problem is that some people misuse guns. Most people do not. I'll happily support any legislation that attacks the problem at it's source, the people that misuse guns. Leave the band-aid solutions for skinned knees. I agree that there is too much violence in America. I agree that something drastic needs to be done about it. But I don't agree that chiiping away at freedom is the right thing to do. \n \n Democracy is supposed to be majority rules, right? Well, if the majority of guns never get used in a crime, then I don't think there is a good reason to do away with any of them. Since it's not illegal to talk about breaking a law that doesn't exist, I can tell you with complete candor that should a law be passed that required me to turn in my guns, I'd go bury them in a sealed container somewhere. And I'll bet you'd have more holes dug in the woods by otherwise law abiding citizens than any other time in the history of men digging holes.\n \n American gun owners don't want to give an inch, because most of us feel like we have already conceded too much. We are your neighbors and relatives, your co-workers and friends. We are normal people who lead normal lives and don't want to hurt anyone any more than you do.
