   "Obama Administration Under Mounting Pressure for Botched Gun Trafficking Investigation - FoxNews.com\n \n \nCongress and the Department of Justice appear to be headed for a showdown this week over documents detailing Operation Fast and Furious, the botched gunrunning sting set up by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that funneled more than 1,700 smuggled weapons from Arizona to Mexico.\n \n The Justice Department has until Wednesday to deliver to congressional investigators a stack of records and emails naming the individuals responsible for the gun trafficking operation that may have killed dozens, if not hundreds of Mexicans, and is becoming a growing embarrassment for the Obama administration.\n \n Under Project Gunrunner and the Phoenix off-shoot, dubbed Fast and Furious, the ATF encouraged gun store owners to sell to straw buyers -- consumers who they suspected of working on behalf of Mexican drug cartels. \n \n Project Gunrunner purposely allowed the straw buyers to illegally buy and export guns only to see where they surfaced in Mexico. Using this investigative technique, the ATF hoped to take down the entire gun trafficking organization. Instead, records show it allowed more than 1,700 guns, including hundreds of AK-47s and high-powered, armor-piercing .50-caliber rifles to be trafficked to Mexico\n \n Buying guns for non-personal use is illegal. Yet gun store owners were assured by ATF agents the buyers were under investigation and the guns were being intercepted before crossing into Mexico. \n \n nstead, whistleblowers say the guns were allowed \"to walk.\" \n \n President Obama, speaking for the first time about the growing scandal, conceded last week Fast and Furious may have been \"a serious mistake,\" but he claimed, \"I did not authorize it; Eric Holder, the attorney general, did not authorize it. He's been very clear that our policy is to catch gunrunners and put them into jail.\" \n \n But an investigation by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, could show otherwise. \n \n The ATF operates under Justice Department, and two assistant U.S. attorneys in Phoenix authorized virtually every wiretap, affidavit and investigation conducted in Operation Fast and Furious. \n \n Some, like Issa, wonder how Holder could not have known about an investigation that size. \n \n \"One of the questions we always ask is who is lying,\" Issa told Fox News. \"We lose our credibility if we don't come clean and make the changes necessary to save lives on both sides of the border.\" \n \n If the Justice Department and ATF refuse to deliver the records Issa requested, as it already has done with similar requests by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, Issa can subpoena the records. \n \n \"We will subpoena if we have to, we'll hold hearings if we have to, we'll call in officials if we have to. But at the end of the day, the two Americans likely to have died as a result of this action pale in comparison to the countless numbers of Mexicans who have been killed,\" said Issa. \n \n He is referring to Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent Jamie Zapata. The guns used to kill both men were bought in the U.S. and investigators will now see if they are linked to Project Gunrunner. \n \n Humberto Trevino, a senior Mexican lawmaker, says at least 150 people have been shot with ATF-monitored guns. \n \n Two of the gun stores involved were Carter's Country in Houston and J&G Gun Sales in Prescott, Ariz. \n \n \"Let me tell you something about Carter's Country. They have been co-operating with ATF from the get-go,\" says Carter's County attorney Dick Deguerin. \n \n \"They were told to go through with what they considered to be questionable sales. They were told to go through with sales of three or more assault rifles at the same time or five or more 9-mm guns at the same time or a young Hispanic male paying in cash. It's all profiling, but they went through with it.\" \n \n Both gun stores felt burned by the ATF -- first by leaked records to The Washington Post that showed the two stores responsible for dozens of guns found at Mexican crime scenes, and now by Operation Fast and Furious. \n \n \"You assumed they had your back,\" added J&G President Brad Desaye. \"Absolutely, we felt like partners with ATF in a lot of ways.\" \n \n Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich said in a Feb. 4 letter the operation's purpose was \"to dismantle the entire trafficking organization, not merely to arrest straw purchasers.\" \n \n \"The allegation -- that ATF 'sanctioned' or otherwise knowingly allowed the sale of assault weapons to a straw purchaser who then transported them into Mexico -- is false,\" he wrote.\n \n Holder also says his department policy is not to \"let guns walk.\"\n\n \n Another article showing that the ATF isn't to be trusted, nor should their powers be expanded to any degree.\n \n However there's something very interesting about this article that isn't mentioned. Take a look at the picture at the top. Supposedly those are examples of guns that have been recovered from Mexico. Amongst them are a lot of .22 rimfire rifles. There's one lever action rifle, at least seven bolt action rifles, and one Ruger 10/22, all of them .22 rimfire in chambering. That hardly qualifies as high powered weaponry. Even a 9mm handgun has more punch than them.\n \n If the drug cartel is fighting this battle with .22 rimfire rifles then somebody has a lot of explaining to do.",

   "ATF chief won't appear at Senate hearing in wake of \"gunwalking\" scandal - CBS News Investigates - CBS News\n \n \nSo far, Congress and the media haven't had much luck getting answers on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' ongoing \"gunwalking\" controversy.\n \n The Department of Justice and ATF have missed repeated deadlines to turn over information and documents to Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), who's investigating. ATF Acting Director Kenneth Melson (at left) was scheduled to appear before a Senate hearing Thursday, in which he would likely have been asked questions about the scandal. However, CBS News has confirmed Melson has now been pulled from the hearing witness list.\n \n We contacted the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to ask why Melson is no longer scheduled to appear. They referred us to the office of Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) who chairs the subcommittee holding the hearing. A press spokeswoman at the senator's office said it was Melson's decision not to testify, and that the subcommittee doesn't have jurisdiction over ATF.\n \n Later, a spokesman told us in an email, \"The Subcommittee had invited, but not confirmed, Mr. Melson as well as other officials from ATF to testify at the hearing this week. In the end, ATF declined to send a representative.\"\n \n The gunwalking investigation may also have derailed any chance for Andrew Traver, President Obama's nominee to be the permanent head of the ATF, to have confirmation hearings anytime soon. Mr. Obama made Melson, a former Justice Department attorney, acting director in April 2009. Sources on the Senate Judiciary Committee believed confirmation hearings for Traver were about to be scheduled before the gunwalking scandal broke. Now, they believe confirmation hearings for Traver will not happen in the near future.\n",

   "Project Gunrunner: Obama's Stimulus-Funded Border Nightmare - Michelle Malkin - Townhall Conservative\n \n \nBuried in Barack Obama's failed trillion-dollar stimulus program was a $10 million bloody border racket that has now cost American lives. This goes far beyond the usual waste, fraud and abuse underwritten by progressive profligacy. It's bloodstained government malfeasance overseen by anti-gun ideologues -- and now anti-gun ideologue Attorney General Eric Holder will \"investigate.\"\n \n Welcome to Project Gunrunner. Prepare for another Justice Department whitewash.\n \n First, some background. Like so many border programs run amok, Project Gunrunner was the spawn of Beltway bipartisanship. It was established in 2005 as a pilot project under the Bush administration and run by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The intended goal of the program's sting operations: stop illicit firearms trafficking along the Southwest border through close surveillance of undercover gun purchases and coordinated intervention with Mexico. The deadly result: federally sanctioned gunwalking of high-powered weapons from U.S. officials right into the hands of drug cartel killers.\n \n By 2008, Project Gunrunner's bureaucratic fiefdom had expanded rapidly along the U.S.-Mexico border and into the nine U.S. consulates in Mexico. The office raked in $2 million more through the little-scrutinized Merida Initiative, which Hispanic vote-pandering Republicans rammed through in a war supplemental bill. Despite warnings from the DOJ inspector general that tracking and assessment measures needed improvement, the payroll exploded from a few dozen to more than 200 by 2009. Under the Obama administration, ATF reaped another $21.9 million to expand Project Gunrunner (nearly half from the stimulus boondoggle), and the White House has requested almost $12 million more in fiscal year 2011 appropriations for the program.\n \n Project Gunrunner's reach and authority continues to grow despite dire, prolonged warnings from insiders and whistleblowers that countless monitored guns have been passed on to violent criminals without being intercepted as planned. Following up on leads first published at www.CleanUpATF.org | Homepage and the blogs of gun rights advocates David Codrea and Mike Vanderboegh, CBS News reported last month that Project Gunrunner \"allegedly facilitated the delivery of thousands of guns into criminal hands.\"\n \n One of those guns was used by Mexican gang thugs who murdered U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry last December. At least six veteran ATF agents and executives stepped forward to expose how ATF presided over the purchase of hundreds of high-powered rifles and pistols -- over the objection of the very private gun shops that the Obama administration's anti-gun zealots have vilified.\n \n One whistleblower familiar with Project Gunrunner's Phoenix offshoot, dubbed \"Operation Fast and Furious,\" told CBS News: \"The numbers are over 2,500 on that case by the way. That's how many guns were sold -- including some 50-calibers they let walk.\" The weapon used in the Mexico slaying of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Special Agent Jaime Zapata has also been linked to Project Gunrunner surveillance operation subjects.\n \n As investigative watchdog Republicans Sen. Charles Grassley and Rep. Darrell Issa step up pressure on the administration to come clean this week about who knew what and when, Obama denied any knowledge of Project Gunrunner on Spanish-language Univision TV. He blithely allowed that \"there may be a situation here in which a serious mistake was made. If that's the case, then we'll find out and we'll hold someone accountable.\"\n \n Coming from a man who appointed crime-coddling, accountability-evading, open-borders corruptocrat Eric Holder to uphold the law, that is a bloody, cruel joke.\n",

I am sure they think that would cut into their bidness too. I for one do NOT consider them a Constitutional enterprise and if they were stupid enough to think that the AFT would protect them instead of selling them out that is the same as admission for criminal intent.

   "Things just keep looking worse and worse. And the ATF is looking evermore corrupt and arrogant.\n \n Article\n \n \nWASHINGTON &#8211; Senator Chuck Grassley today requested information from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) about guidance it may have given to agents in the field in responding to Grassley&#8217;s requests.\n \n Grassley&#8217;s inquiry comes in response to documents that the ATF released through the Freedom of Information Act. Within those documents was an email to the Deputy Director of the ATF, Billy Hoover, regarding suggestions on how ATF agents should be directed to respond to congressional requests, like those from Grassley. \n \n &#8220;Since our investigation began, I&#8217;ve continued to be contacted by agents and others within the ATF about wrongdoing regarding Fast and Furious at the ATF and the Justice Department. If people have concerns they should be able to express themselves without feeling pressure from their bosses,&#8221; Grassley said.\n \n Grassley has been investigating a program led by the ATF where assault weapons were sold to straw buyers who then transported the weapons across the border to resell them to Mexican drug cartels. Grassley learned of the wrongdoing from courageous whistleblowers. He has sent letters and asked questions inquiring about the policy, but has yet to be provided a substantive response from the Departments of Justice and State and the ATF.\n \n Grassley is a champion of whistleblowers and is the co-author of the first Whistleblower Protection Act in 1989. This week, Grassley introduced legislation with Senators Daniel Akaka of Hawaii, Susan Collins of Maine and Joe Lieberman of Connecticut to update the law.\n \n &#8220;Whistleblowers stand up for truth and help to fight wrongdoing, injustice, and waste, fraud and abuse in government. They shouldn&#8217;t be subject to retaliation, from either higher ups or colleagues, for coming forward with important information,&#8221; Grassley said. &#8220;Without whistleblowers, we&#8217;d know a lot less about what goes on in government. They are key to unlocking secrets deep in the closets of the bureaucracy.&#8221; \n \n Here&#8217;s a copy of Grassley&#8217;s letter sent today to Acting Director of the ATF Kenneth Melson. For copies of all of Grassley&#8217;s letters, please visit his website, Grassley.senate.gov and click on the Judiciary Committee link.\n\n \n http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/apr/8/grassley-says-emails-suggest-atf-blocking-senate-g/?page=all#pagebreak\n \n \nThe Senate Judiciary Committee&#8217;s ranking Republican, who has questioned whether the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allowed suspected gun smugglers to purchase assault rifles that later were used to kill a U.S. Border Patrol agent, wants to know whether ATF ordered its agents not to cooperate in his investigation of the shooting.\n \n In a letter Friday to ATF Acting Director Kenneth E. Melson, Sen. Charles E. Grassley said emails obtained through the Freedom of Information Act &#8220;appear to contain proposed guidance&#8221; on how to respond to questions from the senator&#8217;s office, including instructions that agents were &#8220;in no way obligated to respond&#8221; and should refer inquiries to ATF&#8217;s office of congressional affairs.\n \n The Iowa Republican described the emails as &#8220;further attempts to prevent direct communications with my office&#8221; by telling agents they were &#8220;not authorized to disclose nonpublic information.\n \n &#8220;It is of grave concern because, as you know, such attempts to prevent direct communications with Congress are not a lawfully authorized activity of any officer or employee of the United States whose salary is paid with appropriated funds,&#8221; he wrote.\n \n Mr. Grassley has raised questions on whether ATF allowed gun smugglers to purchase and keep assault rifles that later were used to kill Border Patrol Agent Brian A. Terry, and if the agency allowed the sale of the weapons to &#8220;known and suspected straw purchasers for an illegal trafficking ring near the Southwest border.&#8221; He said two of those weapons reportedly were recovered at the site of the Terry shooting.\n \n The senator said ATF agents told his staff that the agency, as part of &#8220;Project Gunrunner&#8221; and its &#8220;Fast and Furious&#8221; component, allowed guns to &#8220;walk&#8221; across the border, despite warnings from agents in the field the policy would result in somebody getting killed. Fast and Furious was a gunrunning sting set up by ATF that funneled more than 1,700 smuggled weapons from Arizona to Mexico.\n \n Terry, 40, was attempting to arrest bandits who prey on illegal aliens when he was fatally shot about 10 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border.\n \n Mr. Grassley said ATF had been tracking the gun purchases of one of those arrested in the shooting, Jaime Avila, since November 2009 when he made his first buys at a Glendale, Ariz., gun shop. He said Avila bought three more weapons at the same dealer on Jan. 9, 2010, and three AK-47 assault rifles on Jan. 16. Over the next several months, he said, ATF continued to track his multiple firearms purchases, including two .50-caliber rifles in June 2010.\n \n While at least one Arizona gun dealer wanted to stop participating in sales &#8220;like those to Avila,&#8221; he said ATF encouraged the dealer to continue selling to suspected traffickers.\n \n After the Terry shooting, law enforcement officials recovered from the scene two assault rifles that were traced by the agency and matched two of the three rifles purchased by Avila &#8220;and tracked by ATF nearly a year earlier.&#8221;\n \n The Justice Department, which oversees ATF, has denied that guns sold in purchases sanctioned by federal firearms agents were later used in the shootout that left Terry dead.\n \n In his letter, Mr. Grassley said for Congress to exercise its oversight authority, it is &#8220;crucial&#8221; that agency employees are free to communicate directly with members of Congress and their committee staffs. He said without such unfiltered communications, &#8220;Congress would still be unaware of and unable to inquire&#8221; about allegations involving the Terry death.\n \n &#8220;If people have concerns, they should be able to express themselves without feeling pressure from their bosses,&#8221; Mr. Grassley said, noting that one agent who contacted him was George Gillett, assistant special agent in charge of the ATF&#8217;s Phoenix field division.\n \n He said Mr. Gillett chose to tell ATF he had protected contacts with Congress and described his information as &#8220;an essential component of our inquiry.&#8221; He said Mr. Gillett participated in two meetings with staffs from the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n \n &#8220;As you know, retaliation for such communications is prohibited by law,&#8221; Mr. Grassley said in the letter.\n",
