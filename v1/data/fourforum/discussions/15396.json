It's not by accident that the middle class make up the vast majority of the working population, nor that the education system and media is aimed towards perpetuating middle class citizens. \n \n I agree with atlas though. Wealth earned is a measure of the value you have added to society, not the amount of dollars you can procure from others. Its not a transfer from those who have to those who have more, but exactly the opposite. Those who have more are those that are offering more.",
