   "Leave it to you to attack and insult someone for responding to your own thread premise. It is you who said that Bin Laden was told by his god to kill infidels. I'm just responding to that premise. See?\n\n \n No, you take on face value that Bin Laden is telling the truth. I don't, nor do most of the people here. Most of us understand the premise here, which is why we are arguing on a level you can't even see. \n \n \nThe Crusaders were following the orders of the Pope and Men who claimed to speak for God, but not for God or Christ in reality which you would know if you had the most basic understanding of what Jesus taught us.\n\n \n Come again? The Crusades were enacted by such men calling for others to do what God commanded them. It is irrelevant that the Crusades were actually for the Vatican to grab secular power and land. The people who went to fight did so because they believe God commanded them to do so. How does that differ from Bin Laden? Bin Laden believes or at least appears to believe that God wants him to kill infidels. \n \n As for you knowing what Jesus taught, that has yet to be seen. There are days when I oscillate between thinking you're a fanatic and someone just trying to make Christanity look like a religion of a billion fools.\n \n \nBut why would I expect you to be able to separate the actions of men from the God they claim to speak for.\n\n \n This leads back to my first point, the premise which you fail to understand. \n \n And you didn't get around the hypocrisy. You accuse Islam of being evil because of its followers, yet you refuse to do that for Christanity. That's a double standard and its hypocrisy. \n \n \nThis is senseless gibberish. What point are you trying to make?\n\n \n I realize you cannot read between the lies or understand anything above a laymen's terms, so here's the point. What is the difference between Bin Laden's 'spiritual' rational and the rational behind a drug user in their statements? Can we prove either are in fact wrong? Or right? If we dismiss Bin Laden for being crazy why can't do the same to others who claim God exists because he talks to them?\n \n \nI responded directly to your OP and even posted your opening post above as evidence of answering it directly. Don't blame me that you don't like my answer. That's your problem.\n\n \n No, what your problem is a severe lack of understanding of most issues. The fact that you used that is rather amusing as you completely don't understand what we are talking about. You use rational that were are questioning as valid. How do you expect that to work when we are questioning if we can call someone crazy for using it? \n \n \nThen why did you start this thread then?\n\n \n Read other people's posts. They understand. You do not. I do not regularly make threads to make you look stupid. It's not about you.\n \n \nYou just admitted that this is a baiting thread started by a flaming troll and was designed as a weapon to attack anyone who claims to respond to a living God through a personal relationship. Thanks for revealing your own hypocrisy and double standard.\n\n \n No I did not. I wanted to see if others had different opinions that were relevant and reasonable. I have no problem with others saying they believe in a personal God. I have a problem with others saying that is why they are right and that other people of other faiths who do the same are wrong. Furthermore if we can dismiss another religion and other people because of so called talks with God, why can't we do it to other religions? That is not a double standard. What is a double standard is what you do. \n \n \nWOW, how thick must one be to never get that when these people commit their brutal and inhuman atrocities, they are accurately following the example set by Mohammed, the founder of islam, but when people have committed atrocities in the name of Christianity, none of their actions were founded in or supported by what Jesus taught us. That is the difference but you will never get that either.\n\n \n In your opinion. That's the grand thing about radical fundie Christians. The whole true scottsman fallacy is all they have. That's not a True Christian because they wouldn't do X. But when other religions do that they are all evil. \n \n \nExactly. That's the God I'm referring to. Yahweh, the God of Israel. emoticon_xagree\n\n \n So Islam is evil when Muslims kill because that's what Islam is but when Christians kill in the name of their religion despite you admitting their God is blood thirsty and deliberately commanded his followers to murder and commit genocide Christanity isn't evil?\n \n You're either a really good anti-Christian troll or a complete whackjob.",
