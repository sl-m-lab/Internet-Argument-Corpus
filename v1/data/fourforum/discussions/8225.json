   "I think if this option was presented to girls who are pregnate but are to young to have the responsibilty of a child or their bodies are to young to carry a child, then i think it would be a great oppertunity. It helps people who cant have children and it helps the girls who were pregnate, they dont have to be mentally pained or burdened b/c they killed an inocent life. But if people do this to get money, or think, \"oh its okay to have unsafe sex b/c i can just sell my kid with no pain to me\" then this oppertunity is bad. It also may create more children w/o parents b/c people will get the surgery instead of adopting. But i dont know, it may help more then hurt.",

   "I once heard of an interesting scenario in which an egg had been fertilized externally (in a \"test tube\") for a couple that then split up. So, there was a valid zygote / embryo alive where one partner wanted it to continue and another wanted it destroyed. If I remember correctly, it was the father that wanted it to continue - be implanted in a willing woman, and brought to term. Therefore, it was never an issue of a woman's control over her own body. Apparently, the mother claimed that she had more right to the zygote since the procedure for taking out the egg was far more difficult than getting the man's sperm. \n \n Either way, this brings up the issue of parent's rights of reproduction. I have no doubt that everyone who is pro-life would choose that the zygote be allowed to continue in a host woman and, personally, I am leaning that way also. What are your views?",

There are multiple possibilities and I should have brought that up. I don't really have much respect for father figures but I know there are good dads out there.",
