   "NYT on the 3 Americans Who Inspired Uganda 'Kill the Gays' Bill - Towleroad, More than gay news. More gay men\n \n \n \n The NYT looks at the three Americans who participated in Stephen Langa's Uganda conference on homosexuality last March, and, by their discussions of \"ex-gay\" therapy, pedophilia, and dangers to traditional marriage, set in motion the process which ultimately led to the \"kill the gays\" bill:\n \n Lively The three Americans who spoke at the conference - Scott Lively, a missionary who has written several books against homosexuality, including \"7 Steps to Recruit-Proof Your Child\"; Caleb Lee Brundidge, a self-described former gay man who leads \"healing seminars\"; and Don Schmierer, a board member of Exodus International, whose mission is \"mobilizing the body of Christ to minister grace and truth to a world impacted by homosexuality\" - are now trying to distance themselves from the bill.\n \n \"I feel duped,\" Mr. Schmierer said, arguing that he had been invited to speak on \"parenting skills\" for families with gay children. He acknowledged telling audiences how homosexuals could be converted into heterosexuals, but he said he had no idea some Ugandans were contemplating the death penalty for homosexuality.\n \n \"That's horrible, absolutely horrible,\" he said. \"Some of the nicest people I have ever met are gay people.\"\n \n Mr. Lively and Mr. Brundidge have made similar remarks in interviews or statements issued by their organizations. But the Ugandan organizers of the conference admit helping draft the bill, and Mr. Lively has acknowledged meeting with Ugandan lawmakers to discuss it. He even wrote on his blog in March that someone had likened their campaign to \"a nuclear bomb against the gay agenda in Uganda.\" Later, when confronted with criticism, Mr. Lively said he was very disappointed that the legislation was so harsh.\n \n At this point it's such disingenuous XXXXXXXX for Holocaust-revisionist Lively and these other dangerous clowns to be saying they have no idea how their misinformed theories might hurt people.\n \n Uganda The paper also features a companion piece on gays in Uganda and how they're suffering:\n \n Anti-gay sentiments are one thing, and hardly unique to Uganda. But what seems different here is the level of official, government-sponsored anti-gay hate speech.\n \n \"I detest gays in my heart,\" said Kassiano E. Wadri, a member of Parliament and the chief whip of the opposition. \"When I see a gay, I think that person needs psychotherapy. You need to break him.\"\n \n It's no surprise, then, that many homosexual people here insisted on being interviewed anonymously, including one car salesman who goes by Bob. He lost his job working in a hotel a few years ago after the Red Pepper, a Ugandan tabloid, published a list of names of homosexuals, including his.\n \n \"When your boss finds out you're gay, you get harassed,\" he said. \"Then you start getting scolded in front of others. Then fired.\"\n \n It is hard finding a boyfriend, he said, \"because you don't know who to trust.\"\n \n He took a deep breath and looked down at his hands. \"It's a very big mess to be gay in Uganda,\" he said.",

   "On HuffingtonPost.com, Jason Linkins comments on the NYTimes article: \nTen months ago, three American evangelicals trooped off to Uganda and, using the power of their words, helped convince officials there to create the Anti-Homosexuality Bill of 2009, that would make it illegal -- and punishable by death -- to be gay. If you hang in long enough while reading today's New York Times article on the matter, the reporter eventually gets around to naming them!\n \n The three Americans who spoke at the conference -- Scott Lively, a missionary who has written several books against homosexuality, including \"7 Steps to Recruit-Proof Your Child\"; Caleb Lee Brundidge, a self-described former gay man who leads \"healing seminars\"; and Don Schmierer, a board member of Exodus International, whose mission is \"mobilizing the body of Christ to minister grace and truth to a world impacted by homosexuality\" -- are now trying to distance themselves from the bill.\n \n At this point, that's sort of like the Velvet Underground attempting to distance themselves from \"rock music.\" \n \n But for his part, Don Schmierer says he feels \"duped,\" and that he had \"no idea some Ugandans were contemplating the death penalty for homosexuality\" and that \"some of the nicest people I have ever met are gay people.\"\n \n Yes, surprise, surprise: you go off to Uganda to talk about how \"the gay movement is an evil institution\" and how they have an agenda of \"defeat[ing] the marriage-based society\" and somehow, people take this to mean that homosexuals should be killed or something. How terrible that things like this get misconstrued. Right, Scott Lively, who said this on his website?\n On the positive side, my host and ministry partner in Kampala, Stephen Langa, was overjoyed with the results of our efforts and predicted confidently that the coming weeks would see significant improvement in the moral climate of the nation, and a massive increase in pro-family activism in every social sphere. He said that a respected observer of society in Kampala had told him that our campaign was like a nuclear bomb against the \"gay\" agenda in Uganda. I pray that this, and the predictions, are true.\n Today's Times article mentions the \"nuclear bomb\" comparison, but leaves out the perhaps important part where Lively \"prays\" that his campaign is like a massive explosion that kills tens of thousands of people in a disintegrating rain of atomic fire.\nAnti-Gay Evangelicals Attempt To Distance Themselves From Ugandan Anti-Gay Bill They Inspired",
