   "Very cool, indeed.\n \n It's amazing the amount of venom that the righties have directed against Bair.\nVery true! Many supposed right-wingers were out there saying how horrific her plan(s) was(were) and yet had no great plan of their own. In fact the TARP was the solution many had and it was even worse of an idea.\n \n Bair did have a really bad plan though. She first wanted to freeze all adjustable mortgage rates. I guess she failed to realize that people were already defaulting on mortgages BEFORE the rates adjusted. Others had interest-only loans which are hard to deal with.",
