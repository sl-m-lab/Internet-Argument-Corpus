   "Behind the whole business is military intelligence (http://www.news24.com/News24/World/...1520513,00.html), and/or mercenaries (http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Stor...1206725,00.html), no doubt about it. There's no chance, that abuses on such scale could pass unnoticed. If they weren't directly ordered, they were at least intentionally tolerated.\n Quote:\n \n Its such an utterly bizarre thing to do that I wonder if they thought it was acceptable and I wonder how they got that impression. \n \n http://www.informationclearinghouse...article6108.htm:\n Quote:\n ``I questioned some of the things that I saw ... such things as leaving inmates in their cell with no clothes or in females' underpants, \n \n Generalette Karpinski or someone at MI must have seen too much Jerry Springer. Or maybe they got the idea around here somewhere http://www.frocks.nu/\n \n We must certainly ask ourself why would anyone go, and take pictures of that ****. There are two possible explanations: tomfoolery, and blackmail. In the latter case, the plan probably was to gradually get POWs from staged to real kink, with their faces uncovered, breaking them pychologically in the process. Then, the pictures could be used for blacmail, like \"you tell us everything, and do what you are told, or else we'll show theese pictures to everyone in your village\". Very effective for traditional, patriarchal society like Iraqi, and not too bloody. A couple of additional collaborators can always come in handy.\n \n This is pretty important question too: How and why did theese pictures leaked? Possibilities are as follows\n Accidentaly, unplanned, probably by some consciencefull guy, who didn't wanted to have anything with it.\n Purposely, to justify ineviteable failure of \"winning the Iraqi hearts and minds\".\n Now, if we take into account logistical problems US army seems to be into (http://slate.msn.com/id/2099408/), there are two possible future courses of events:\n USA pulls out of Iraq, and blames everything on the abovementioned useful XXXXXX.\n USA negotiates a couple of Fallujah-like ceasefires, to restock the weapon, ammo, spareparts, fuel, and food supply. Then it proceeds to subject Iraq by a brute force. This would be a very nasty war. For obvious reasons, there will be no surrendering. No prisoners will be taken, no mercy will be expected, and none will be given.\n Generalette's gang of rednecks will be scapegoated in any case. They are probably just a manipulated executants, but they don't deserve no pity anyway. They certainly did enjoy being manipulated. But make no mistake about it: Deterioration in Iraq is NOT their fault. They are not that important.",
