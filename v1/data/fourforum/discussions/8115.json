   "I'm not 100% sure about the various aspects of this argument, but I just wanted the opinion and thoughts of people who may know more about it than I. I've read and seem to comprehend this argument, and I believe it's true, but I'm not sure what the responses to it are. The way I'm interpreting the argument is not that there cannot be any form of evolution at all, but rather that the evolution may have been started at some point by a higher power that created the first building blocks for the evolution to occur. Anyways, here's how the argument goes...\n \n The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that \"The entropy of a closed system cannot decrease.\" In other words, the universe is continuously progressing towards more and more chaos and disorder. If this were true, the universe may not have existed indefinitely, because it would have entered a state of total entropy long ago. Since the universe must have had a finite existence, it must have been created. This creation must have been enacted by another power, because to claim that something may create itself is highly circuitous and is the epitome of false logic. It's like saying a chicken was able to lay the egg it hatched from. If the universe was created at some point, it must have been by a Creator whom is able to transcend time and space.",

   "The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that \"The entropy of a closed system cannot decrease.\"\nNot exactly. The 2LoT states that it is impossible for any system to operate in such a way that the sole result would be an energy transfer by heat from a cooler to a hotter body. Stated in other words, the 2LoT states that it is impossible for any system to operate in a thermodynamic cycle and deliver a net amount of work to its surroundings while receiving energy by heat transfer from a single thermal reservoir.\n \n Now, about entropy. Something is said to be a property of a system if, and only if, its change in value between two states is independent of the process of that change. The Clausius inequality states that the integral of the heat transfer at a part of a system boundary during a given cycle divided by the absolute temperature at that part of the boundary, when the integral is performed over all parts of the boundary and over the entire cycle, is less than or equal to 0. Now, it can be demonstrated (this is a fact, by the way) that for any internally reversible process between two states of a system that the value of the integral depends on the end states only. It can be concluded, therefore, that the integral defines the change in some property of a system (an extensive property, by the way). That property is called entropy.\n \n Notice the part above that begins with \"The Clausius inequality...\" and ends with \"...is less than or equal to 0.\" In other words the change in the described property cannot be greater than zero. So you see, it is the Clausius inequality that says that entropy cannot decrease, and this is a property of of the operation of thermodynamic cycles.\n \nIn other words, the universe is continuously progressing towards more and more chaos and disorder.\nIs your bait and switch intentional? Perhaps you don't mean to say 'chaos'. Are you sure that you know what it is? Maybe it would help if you defined what you are saying. Are 'chaos' and 'disorder' the same? Please define the two terms.\n \n Please explain how you think that your statement is an \"in other words\" statement of the 2LoT.\n \nIf this were true, the universe may not have existed indefinitely, because it would have entered a state of total entropy long ago.\nRight. If this were true. And of course, you mean 'infinitely' rather than 'indefinitely', don't you? You should understand that I do think that the entropy of the universe is growing and in a universe of infinite age entropy would be at a maximum, unless of course, the universe were not a closed system and some process (as described above) acted in such a way so as to decrease the entropy of the universe. I don't think that it's true simply because there isn't any evidence of it. \n \nSince the universe must have had a finite existence, it must have been created.\nYou mean that it must have has a beginning, don't you?\n \nThis creation must have been enacted by another power, because to claim that something may create itself is highly circuitous and is the epitome of false logic.\nBut you don't think that it is circuitous to say that this other power didn't have a beginning?\n \nIt's like saying a chicken was able to lay the egg it hatched from.\nOr that God created himself.\n \nIf the universe was created at some point, it must have been by a Creator whom is able to transcend time and space.\nOr it came about by some natural means that is beyond our ability to know at the present time. If you wish to invent some magical Creator, you are free to do so, but I see no purpose in inventing magical beings as the answer to questions for which we don't have answers. It's a bit like inventing Thor to throw lightening bolts because we don't understand the process that causes lightning.",

Please define the two terms.\n\n \n I'm not meaning to \"bait and switch\" I meant only disorder, but was applying another term which I thought might be similar and would provide clarity, obviously it did the opposite. I don't understand what you're talking about with the Clausius inequality. It seems like it acts as an exception to the 2lot which makes it work fine with evolution, but I'm not sure where the argument is coming from here.\n \n \nPlease explain how you think that your statement is an \"in other words\" statement of the 2LoT.\n\n \n Since we do not live in a perfect world that is able to maintain entropy at no positive gain, the universe is continuously reaching more and more entropy. What I mean by this is that since disorder is continually increasing in the universe, we would have have reached maximum entropy long ago (even though \"long ago\" has no context in a universe which has existed forever, I mean that we would have already reached it.)\n \n \nRight. If this were true. And of course, you mean 'infinitely' rather than 'indefinitely', don't you? You should understand that I do think that the entropy of the universe is growing and in a universe of infinite age entropy would be at a maximum, unless of course, the universe were not a closed system and some process (as described above) acted in such a way so as to decrease the entropy of the universe. I don't think that it's true simply because there isn't any evidence of it. \n You mean that it must have has a beginning, don't you?\n\n \n Correct, I sort of mixed up the conclusions I was reaching. I mean that since the universe has had a finite existence, it must have had a beginning. In order to have a beginning, there must have been a point in time which it did not exist, and then a point at which it did exist. If this is true, there must have been some force which was present before the creation of the universe, which was able to act upon it in such a way that caused its creation to occur.\n \n \nBut you don't think that it is circuitous to say that this other power didn't have a beginning?\n Or that God created himself.\n\n \n It is not circuitous because the conception of God is one of a supernatural being who transcends time and space. God does not apply because he does not have to have a finite existence, as the universe does, and therefore does not need a separate acting force to create Him, He has always been.\n \n \nOr it came about by some natural means that is beyond our ability to know at the present time. If you wish to invent some magical Creator, you are free to do so, but I see no purpose in inventing magical beings as the answer to questions for which we don't have answers. It's a bit like inventing Thor to throw lightening bolts because we don't understand the process that causes lightning.\n\n \n I'm not sure why you're now attacking the Christian faith rather than focusing on the 2LOT. I'm saying that there is a Creator because the universe has had a finite existence, if all you're saying against that is \"I don't have an explanation, but it's not a Creator because I think you're making up a magical figure\" then you might as well not type the last paragraph. I won't get into separate arguments reasoning the existence of God, but it's quite different from the Greco-Roman religous beliefs simply due to the complexity and reasonable application of events which took place. The Greek and Roman gods never had prophets who performed miracles and certainly never had the Son of God come to earth and preach to thousands with not one witness objecting to the validity and truth in His actions.",

   "I'm not sure why you're now attacking the Christian faith rather than focusing on the 2LOT.\nI covered the 2LoT and why fundy christian objections to science because of it are nonsense. I am not attacking christian faith, but merely pointing out that supernaturalism has no foundation in reality.\n \nI'm saying that there is a Creator because the universe has had a finite existence, if all you're saying against that is \"I don't have an explanation, but it's not a Creator because I think you're making up a magical figure\" then you might as well not type the last paragraph.\nRight. You are inventing a supernatural being for whom there is no evidence just because the origin of the universe is unknown to you. Since I know of nothing in the universe that cannot be explained by natural causes, I see no need to assume that the origin of the universe was caused by non-natural causes. I see no need to throw my hands up and scream \"POOF\" - a magical, invisible being did it.\n \nI won't get into separate arguments reasoning the existence of God, but it's quite different from the Greco-Roman religous beliefs simply due to the complexity and reasonable application of events which took place.\nAs pointed out, Thor was not Greco-Roman. And there is no argument that \"reasons\" the existence of God. Such a belief is faith only. The very concept of natural evidence that logically demonstrates the existence of the supernatural is silly.\n \nThe Greek and Roman gods never had prophets who performed miracles\nDon't be silly. They did too.\n \nand certainly never had the Son of God come to earth and preach to thousands with not one witness objecting to the validity and truth in His actions.\nAside from the fact that it cannot be verified that the Son of God ever came to earth, which Son of God that came to earth are you talking about? There were many - one myth of such a Son of God was supposed to have lived a couple hundred years before the one you are probably talking about. Some scholars think that Christianity actually originated from the previous Son of God - a cult to which Saul of Tarsus belonged. Saul, as you know, is actually the founder of christianity.\n \n And if such a person as the Son of God never existed, then there wouldn't be any witness to object to his actions. You see, you are making claims of fact for mythology. You can't even demonstrate the existence of God much less a Son of God.",

My only objection to that term has to do with the insistence by most religions to define or describe this infinite being. You can't define or describe infinity, so God can only be that which is totally beyond our limited human understanding. As such, it is useless to consider God in any scientific theory or religious dogma. You can still experience the feeling that there is a power greater than us, but you can't intellectualize it so it's irrelevant to this discussion.",

Of course, \"before time\" or \"preexistent\" are oxymorons because infinity cannot be described in terms of finite time frames. But that's my point. You just can't describe infinity in words. And that's essentially why you can never pin down \"God\" in a way that will allow for he/she/it to be part of any empirically derived scientific theory. In short, all attempts to describe the infinite must be framed in language that is based on finite concepts & words. That's also why I consider all references to \"God\" / \"Jehova\" in the Bible to be metaphorical - and not to be taken literally.",
