   "N.J. off-base in gun-purchasing approach\n \n By David Dirks\n For the Times Herald-Record\n \n New Jersey is a perfect example of a state that has gun laws that have no effect on a criminal's ability to get whatever he wants.\n What has been labeled as \"progressive\" gun control is arguably the most backward legal contraption ever created.\n This recently became very clear when a friend of mine tried to purchase a new deer rifle for the upcoming season. Having spent most of his life residing and hunting in Pennsylvania, he had never purchased a rifle in New Jersey. \n So he went to a local gun shop and found a nice .35-caliber rifle that met his requirements and at a good price. The decision to purchase the .35 was easy. What happened next floored him. \n \"You'll have to apply for a gun purchase permit,\" the fellow behind the counter said.\n Gun purchase permit?\n \"You won't be able to get this rifle until you've received your permit,\" the clerk added. \"It may take up to three months for you to get this. Then you can actually take possession of this rifle.\"\n Permit to purchase a hunting rifle? Up to three months to get the permit? Hunting season will be over by then!\n In New York, we can go to the local gun shop, pick out a new hunting rifle, complete the federal registration paperwork, and be on our way within a short time.\n Of course, gun control fanatics would have you believe laws like those in New Jersey are designed to, well, control guns. Does anyone really think criminals go through the same permit process to purchase a gun? Apparently the politicians in New Jersey do.\n Common criminals can purchase any rifle or pistol they want at any time, anywhere from other criminals.\n The frustration of most law enforcement agencies lies in trying to catch these criminals who make a living selling weapons to other thugs on the street. \n Politicians, feeling the same frustration, decide to lash out and create new \"progressive\" gun control measures.\n If they can't control the criminal activity around guns, whom can they control? The answer: you and I. We're the common people, who just want to freely purchase a rifle for hunting or competitive shooting. \n This kind of legislative logic rates right up there with suing gun companies for criminal liability for the products they sell. That made sense, didn't it? \n In the meantime, we can be thankful that in New York, we can purchase hunting rifles and be sighting them in on the same day. However, don't let the point be lost that if you let down your guard, you could be subjected to the same backward gun laws as our fellow sportsmen and women in New Jersey are.",
