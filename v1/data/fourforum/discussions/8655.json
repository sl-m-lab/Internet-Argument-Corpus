That is why Iraq has been so expensive for us. \n \n You can argue all you like about whether they were morally justified in attacking and invading, but at the end of the day, it was illegal for them to do so, and it was certainly illegal for them to blow up roads, bridges, airports, and power plants. \n \n Of course, Israel will not pay for it, and the US will keep them from being held accountable. The Lebanese will end up living in abject poverty for the next 25 years while they work to replace their infrastructure, and the US, and the Israleis, will practice looking innocent and saying \"I don't knw why they hate us\".",

   "...damages in Lebanon and Israel resulting from this latest conflict?\n\n Let me piece by piece each idea.\n \nHezbollah\n\n Now I was under the influence that this group actually led to the start of the conflict. If I'm mistaken, please say so.\n \nIsrael\n\n They are the one's fighting.\n \nSyria\n\n Middle Eastern countries will all end up paying in due time. That's not a threat, (and no, not a promise either) that's just how I see things.\n \nIran\n\n See Syria\n \nUnited States of America\n\n Thankfully, we never got involved with this one...unless no one bothered to tell me.\n \nFrance\n\n Yes, because obviously, the fighting started over some badly made French Toast. :p\n \nGreat Britain\n\n Is it necessary to touch on the events of the ending of Europe part in World War II?\n \nEgypt\n\n Read Syria\n \nJordan\n\n Read Syria\n \nUN\n\n Did the UN have anything to do with it in the first place?\n \nBill Gates\n\n Considering that the ones doing the fighting got their training from the latest war game put out by Microsoft. :p\n \nOther\n\n Well, you left out Lebanon. They will be one group paying the most but not with money.\n \nNone of the above\n\n Correct. No one should pay because there should be no fighting. There never should be any fighting. There never should have been any fighting. But the people of the world aren't exactly perfect and there isn't always a Walgreen's on every corner.\n \nI saw somebody argue the other day that we should let all them mexicans come to the US, then give mexico to the Israelis and the palestenians can have israel back.
