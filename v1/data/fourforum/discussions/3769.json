   "All mutations are not evolutions,\n\n Quite correct. One must consider the biological definition of evolution. Evolution is a change in the allele frequencies in a population over time. Thus, a mutation in a somatic cell cannot be considered evolution by any means. Such a mutation cannot be passed into the population. Whether for good or bad, such a mutation dies with the organims in which it occurred.\n \n So the first requirement for a mutation to be part of an evolutionary process is that it take place in a germ cell. Second it needs to be passed on to a succeeding generation. In other words, the organism in which the mutation occurred must reproduce and the particular germ cell that contains the mutation must be passed on. Even then, evolution requires that the 2nd generation offspring reach maturity and also reproduce, and, of course, again pass on the mutation to succeeding generations. An elementary understanding of genetics will make it clear the about 1/2 of the offspring of the 2nd generation will receive the mutation. Thus, a new allele is introduced into the population and evolution has taken place.\n \n...but all evolutions are mutations.\n\n Not by any means. There are six generally recognized mechanisms of evolution, mutation being only one. Of those six, three tend to increase genetic variability and three tend to decrease it. Over time, the result of the action of these six mechanisms is a change in the heritable makeup of a population. In other words, the relative frequencies of the various alleles changes with time.\n \n As I mentioned, mutation is one of the mechanisms that increases genetic diversity in a population. Two others are recombinatiion and gene flow. Neither of these later require a mutation but both may effect (i.e., cause) evolution. Of the mechanisms that tend to decrease genetic variability, natural selection is the most famous, being Darwin's most famous theory. Another of Darwin's theories of evolution was sexual selection. A third mechanism that tends to reduce the genetic diversity in a population is genetic drift. This last is an especially strong influence in small populations.\n \n Of course, the actual situation is much more complex than I have explained.",
