   "How about that stegosaurus you so richly admire? Radiometric dating hurts, doesn't it?\n \n \n http://oregonstate.edu/dept/ncs/photos/rare2.jpg\n\n \n Nope. Radiometric dating is one of the famous lies of teh religion of Darwinism.\n \n RATE shows the lies of radio dating\n A few years ago an initiative was undertaken to research thoroughly the whole area of Radioactivity and the Age of The Earth. The RATE project began as a cooperative venture between the Institute for Creation Research (ICR), the Creation Research Society (CRS) and Answers in Genesis (AiG). (Our contribution was mostly providing the expertise of geologist Dr Andrew Snelling; however, when he commenced work with ICR, the project rightly reverted to a joint project of ICR/CRS.) \n \n With the release of several key peer-reviewed papers at the recent ICC (International Conference on Creationism), it is clear that RATE has made some fantastic progress, with real breakthroughs in this area. \n \n The main ones of these will be described and summarized in this paper, but first I want to give congratulations and credit to ICR. Even though a substantial proportion of the scientists working on this project have not been actual ICR staff, ICR's initiative and perseverance, and in particular the patient skilful coordination of their Dr Larry Vardiman had the major role in getting things to this point this quickly. \n \n Exciting news on 'ancient' granites \n When physicist Dr Russell Humphreys was still at Sandia National Laboratories (he now works full-time for ICR), he and Dr John Baumgardner (still with Los Alamos National Laboratory) were both convinced that they knew the direction in which to look for the definitive answer to the radiometric dating puzzle.\n \n Others had tried-and for some, the search went on for a while in the early RATE days-to find the answer in geological processes. But Drs Humphreys and Baumgardner realized that there were too many independent lines of evidence (the variety of elements used in 'standard' radioisotope dating, mature uranium radiohalos, fission track dating and more) that indicated that huge amounts of radioactive decay had actually taken place. It would be hard to imagine that geologic processes could explain all these. Rather, there was likely to be a single, unifying answer that concerned the nuclear decay processes themselves. \n \n Since, from the eyewitness testimony of God's Word, the billions of years that such vast amounts of radioactive processes would normally suggest had not taken place, it was clear that the assumption of a constant slow decay process was wrong. There must have been speeded-up decay, perhaps in a huge burst associated with Creation Week and/or a separate burst at the time of the Flood. \n \n There is now powerful independent confirmatory evidence that at least one episode of drastically accelerated decay has indeed been the case, building on the work of Dr Robert Gentry on helium retention in zircons. The landmark RATE paper1, though technical, can be summarized as follows:\n \n When uranium decays to lead, a by-product of this process is the formation of helium, a very light, inert gas which readily escapes from rock. \n \n Certain crystals called zircons, obtained from drilling into very deep granites, contain uranium which has partly decayed into lead. \n \n By measuring the amount of uranium and 'radiogenic lead' in these crystals, one can calculate that, if the decay rate has been constant, about 1.5 billion years must have passed. (This is consistent with the geologic 'age' assigned to the granites in which these zircons are found.)\n \n There is a significant amount of helium from that '1.5 billion years of decay' still inside the zircons. This is at first glance surprising for long-agers, because of the ease with which one would expect helium (with its tiny, light, unreactive atoms) to escape from the spaces within the crystal structure. There should surely be hardly any left, because with such a slow buildup, it should be seeping out continually and not accumulating.\n \n Drawing any conclusions from the above depends, of course, on actually measuring the rate at which helium leaks out of zircons. This is what one of the RATE papers reports on. The samples were sent (without any hint that it was a creationist project) to a world-class expert to measure these rates. The consistent answer: the helium does indeed seep out quickly over a wide range of temperatures. In fact, the results show that because of all the helium still in the zircons, these crystals (and since this is Precambrian basement granite, by implication the whole earth) could not be older than between 4,000 and 14,000 years. In other words, in only a few thousand years, 1.5 billion years' worth (at today's rates) of radioactive decay has taken place. Interestingly, the data have since been refined and updated to give a date of 5680 (+/- 2000) years.\n \n The paper looks at the various avenues a long-ager might take by which to wriggle out of these powerful implications, but there seems to be little hope for them unless they can show that the techniques used to obtain the results were seriously (and mysteriously, having been performed by a world-class non-creationist expert) flawed. \n \n More great news on radiocarbon\n It's long been known that radiocarbon (which should disappear in only a few tens of thousands of years at the most2) keeps popping up reliably in samples (like coal, oil, gas, etc.) which are supposed to be 'millions of years' old. For instance, AiG has over the years commissioned and funded the radiocarbon testing of a number of wood samples from 'old' sites (e.g. with Jurassic fossils, inside Triassic sandstone, burnt by Tertiary basalt) and these were published (by then staff geologist Dr Andrew Snelling) in Creation magazine and TJ. In each case, with contamination eliminated, the result has been in the thousands of years, i.e. C-14 was present when it 'shouldn't have been'. These results encouraged the rest of the RATE team to investigate C-14 further, building on the literature reviews of creationist M.D. Dr Paul Giem.\n \n In another very important paper presented at this year's ICC, scientists from the RATE group summarized the pertinent facts and presented further experimental data. The bottom line is that virtually all biological specimens, no matter how 'old' they are supposed to be, show measurable C-14 levels.3 This effectively limits the age of all buried biota to less than (at most) 250,000 years. (When one takes into account the likely much lower ratio of radioactive to 'normal' carbon pre-Flood4, it brings it right down to within the biblical 'ballpark'.) \n \n Interestingly, specimens which appear to definitely be pre-Flood seem to have C-14 present, too, and importantly, these cluster around a lower relative amount of C-14. This suggests that some C-14 was primordial, and not produced by cosmic rays-thus limiting the age of the entire earth to only a few thousand years. \n \n This latter suggestion about primordial C-14 appears to have been somewhat spectacularly supported when Dr Baumgardner sent a diamond for C-14 dating. It was the first time this had been attempted, and the answer came back positive-i.e. the diamond, formed deep inside the earth in a 'Precambrian' layer, nevertheless contained radioactive carbon, even though it 'shouldn't have'. \n \n This is exceptionally striking evidence, because a diamond has remarkably powerful lattice bonds, so there is no way that subsequent biological contamination can be expected to find its way into the interior. \n \n The diamond's carbon-dated 'age' of <58,000 years is thus an upper limit for the age of the whole earth. And this age is brought down still further now that the helium diffusion results have so strongly affirmed dramatic past acceleration of radioactive decay.5\n \n C-14 labs have no real answer to this problem, namely that all the 'vast-age' specimens they measure still have C-14. Labelling this detectable C-14 with such words as 'contamination' and 'background' is completely unhelpful in explaining its source, as the RATE group's careful analyses and discussions have shown. But it is no problem or mystery at all if the uniformitarian/long-age assumptions are laid to one side and the real history of the world, given in Scripture, is taken seriously. The C-14 is there, quite simply, because it hasn't had time to decay yet. The world just isn't that old! \n \n The C-14 results are an independent but powerful confirmation of the stunning helium-diffusion results. 2003 looks like going down as a bad year for megachronophiles (lovers of long ages), but a good year for lovers of the Word of God. \n \n Postscript: In addition to the book expected in 2005 reporting the final results of the RATE project, the project expects to publish a book for laymen summarizing the project shortly thereafter. Dr Don DeYoung will be the author. He has written several popular books on creation science and has been on the RATE since its inception. His grasp of the details of the project and his excellent writing skills should combine to produce a highly readable book for creationist laymen.\n \n Here's another: Radioactive 'dating' in conflict.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n --\n Now that we're done with this changing of the subject, why don't you explain the lies of Darwinistic religion made by Richard Leakey?",

The truth is, the pre-Darwinian view of nature--a Creationist view--fits the data that science continues to uncover much better than today's evolutionary paradigm.\nThe fossil being discussed in KNM-ER 1470. It is an indication of the scientific authority of the article that the specific name of the fossil is not mentioned. Such detail is required in any meaningful discussion. I'm sure that Dr. Bromage actually did so in his paper, but popular \"science\" articles many times don't. It is a sign of the scientific sophistication of the readership since is is likely that such readership wouldn't know what KNM-ER 1470 meant.\n \n There are a couple of inaccuracies in the linked article. 1st is the implication that there was no disagreement as to the angle of the face in relation to the skull. That just isn't true and I'll return to this point. 2nd, the implication is that Richard Leakey did the reconstruction. That isn't true either. In fact, Leakey didn't even find the fossil. The fossil was discovered by Bernard Ngeneo who had only recently been promoted from cook's helper to a member of the hominid gang, the fossil finders on Leakey's team. Leakey was head of the expedition and he supervised the excavation. It was then turned over to team members with some experience in hominid anatomy (Leakey had very little), Alan Walker and Mauve Leakey. They did the reconstruction, not Richard.\n \n The skull was in several hundred small pieces that when reconstructed yielded two major sections, the skull (shaped much like some H. habilis skulls - namely KNM-ER 1813 and OH 24), and the face. The fractures at the eye sockets and across the bridge of the nose are such that the exact angle of the face in relation to the skull was difficult to determine.\n \n However, Walker commented on this fact in 1997, saying, \"Once we established a solid bony connection between the face and the braincase, the skull's shape was very different, with a long, sloping face that emphasizes the australopithecine affinities of 1470.\" Walker's final representation of the skull is almost exactly the same as that of Dr. Bromage.\n \n Some of the problem may be from the way that the initial skull is represented in the article. It is rotated forward to a significant degree in order to make the face seem more vertical than it really is (or was), certainly more vertical than Dr. Walker represented it.\n \n Nevertheless, there may be truth to Dr. Bromage's point. Such computer simulations were not available to Walker and (Mauve) Leakey in 1972 and the following years as they reconstructed the skull. I'm sure that there is considerable value in such studies. Certainly, Walker recognized the possibility that his reconstruction was not exactly right. He said so.\n \n As for the problem in the dating of the KBS Tuff, it wasn't a matter of excess argon. Wouldn't it be nice if you actually learned what you were talking about before you spoke.\n \n Also, only a fool would call KNM-ER 1470 an extinct ape. I guess that comes from the creationists insistance that humans have no ancestors, so anything found must be either human or ape. But not only do fossils like KNM-ER 1470 present a problem, there are others like KNM-ER 3733, KNM-WT 15000, OH 24, KNM-ER 1813, etc.\n \n If you want to learn enough to discuss the issue, you should read:\n \n Lewin, Roger. 1987. Bones of Contention: Controversies in the Search for Human Origins. University of Chicago Press. Chicago. 366 p.\n \n The above book is old but it does devote 79 pages to the dating of the KBS Tuff. Possibly you wouldn't make silly claims if you actually learned what you were talking about.\n \n Walker, Allan and Shipman, Pat. 1997. The Wisdom of the Bones: In Search of Human Origins. Vintage Books. New York. 336 p.\n \n The above book discusses many of the hominid fossils discovered by Richard Leakey's team, including KNM-ER 1470, and most especially, KNM WT-15000 (Turkana or Nariokotome Boy).\n \n Other recommended books:\n \n Tattersall, Ian. 1995. The Fossil Trail: How We Know What We Think We Know about Human Evolution. Oxford University Press. Oxford. 276 p.\n \n Tattersall, Ian and Schwartz, Jeffrey. 2000. Extinct Humans. Westview Press, Boulder, CO. 256 p.\n \n Johanson, Donald and Edgar, Blake. 1996. From Lucy to Language. Simon & Schuster Editions. New York. 272 p.\n \n Tattersall wasn't involved in the discovery, reconstruction or description of any of the fossils. He is, however, a renowned paleoanthropologist. Donald Johanson, also a respected paleoanthropologist, has been a rival of Leakey for many years. They disagree on the significance and meaning of several significant fossils. Johanson's discovered Lucy (A.L. 288-1).\n \n Finally, you could learn a lot by a careful reading of The Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian Institution.",

   "Radiocarbon is nevr used for 'millions of years'. It's used to measure human developments.\n \n I suggest you read this.\n \n Radiometric dating--the process of determining the age of rocks from the decay of their radioactive elements--has been in widespread use for over half a century. There are over forty such techniques, each using a different radioactive element or a different way of measuring them. It has become increasingly clear that these radiometric dating techniques agree with each other and as a whole, present a coherent picture in which the Earth was created a very long time ago. Further evidence comes from the complete agreement between radiometric dates and other dating methods such as counting tree rings or glacier ice core layers. Many Christians have been led to distrust radiometric dating and are completely unaware of the great number of laboratory measurements that have shown these methods to be consistent. Many are also unaware that Bible-believing Christians are among those actively involved in radiometric dating.\n \n This paper describes in relatively simple terms how a number of the dating techniques work, how accurately the half-lives of the radioactive elements and the rock dates themselves are known, and how dates are checked with one another. In the process the paper refutes a number of misconceptions prevalent among Christians today. This paper is available on the web via the American Scientific Affiliation and related sites to promote greater understanding and wisdom on this issue, particularly within the Christian community.",

   "Exactly this topic was posted on IIDB yesterday by (in)famous creationist spammer afdave, in this thread.\nIsn't it funny that EDO provides a link to an article by Marvin Lubenow at AIG, specifically, an Appendix to his book, Bones of Contention (not the same book I cited by Roger Lewin). While EDO claims that KNM-ER 1470 was just an extinct ape, Lubenow claims that KNM-ER 140 was human. I was reminded of this by the table from Talk Origins that graphically represented the opinions of various creationists about several fossils. It seems that there is considerable difference of opinion as to which are apes and which are humans (the only two possibilities for creationists). And yet, EDO tries to make hay from a minor disagreement about physiology by real scientists.",

(location is disputable) Spawned bacteria(?) that evolved into forming colonies. That formed etc.etc. Very well researched.

Your belief that life came from oozing gunk is irrational.\n \n \n\n It doesn't say that dinosaurs didn't live with humans. Al though it has been proven without a shadow of a doubt that they didn't. It says that \"assumes\" that humans who evolved from creatures who lived in the same geological area as the dinosaurs. \n\n What proof? Look at the stegosauris thread to see proof that they DID live together.\n \n \n\n Yep... oh wait. No that's Atheism. Silly you. It could be said that God made the world and started a process called evolution. Which continues still, through genetic mutation and sexual selection. Aka you have your dad's this and your mum's that and that mixed and created you. Sexual selection, and genes that work together to produce a new and unique lifeform. emoticon_xhoho \n Yeah for you being a unique creation. \n\n \n But that isn't what god tells us in the Bible, so it COULDN'T be said that.\n \n \n\n You ASSUME that it says something about Jesus. I don't know where you got that but I think some neurons made you jump to wrong conclusion. I think atheism says Jesus isn't the son of god. Nothing about him not existing though. \n\n Just look at the \"Does Jesus Exist\" thread in the Religion forum to see how wrong you are. At least nine people (all atheistic Darwinists) have said Jesus idn't exist even as a man (many who do do not accept the fact that he is God's Son).\n \n \n\n My personal view is that a God of freedom wouldn't give us restrictions in the form of a bible. But would give us freedom to be the best we are and hopes for us to be good people. It could be argued that the bible is a work of Satan. \n Now that would be the greatest hoax ever played on true believers of christ.

You obviously know nothing about evolution theory if you think it says \"monkeys mated with humans\". If you're going to criticise something, at least learn what it does and doesn't say. If you're thinking of humans and monkeys having a common ancestor which was neither a human nor a monkey, this is the very opposite of an assumption, it is a conclusion based upon huge amounts of evidence from paleontology, comparative anatomy, and most recently and most conclusively, genetics. \n \n 2. \"People came from oozing gunk in the ocean\" has nothing to do with evolution, which is about life once it already exists. This is abiogenesis which is not as strong as evolution (few sciences are) but again this is not an assumption, it is a likely hypothesis, a very-well-educated guess. There are a multitude of abiogenesis hypotheses which all explain the chemical steps necessary to evolve chemicals to replicators, to protocells and beyond. At the moment we don't know which (if any) are correct.\n \n 3. The fact that dinosaurs didn't live with humans is another conclusion based upon ridiculous quantities of evidence, to the extent that it is literally crazy to argue about it.\n \n 4. Evolution theory has absolutely nothing to say about the existence of God or Jesus (I really don't get the Jesus reference). The only people who say that it does are religious people. You will never see a scientist arguing that evolution proclaims that there is no God. Even Dawkins, renowned evolutionary biologist and evangelical atheist does not argue this. If I were to claim that evolution falsifies the idea of God, you would be able to prove me wrong in about 5 seconds. Watch this:\n \n Me: Evolution shows there is no God, therefore your religion is false.\n \n You: Science, being a naturalistic study, by definition makes no claims either way about the supernatural.\n \n Me: Oh. Yeah. You win.\n \n You see how that works?\n \n Religion requires faith. Absolutely no faith is required to understand evolution, or any other science. If someone were to claim that they did have faith in science, I would know that they knew very little about it.\n \n What I find astonishing is the very notion that there even is a controversy about evolution. Such a controversy simply doesn't exist in my country, or even in much of Europe as far as I am aware. I only became aware of it after discovering creationism via the internet a few years ago, and then on boards like this and IIDB. There simply is no controversy, except in the minds of biblical literalists. All your arguments have been heard before, and they have been thoroughly debunked. The only reason people like myself bother to respond is that we can't abide unchallenged displays of ignorance, and we don't want random lurkers to be convinced (even a tiny bit) by the crazy, illogical, unsubstantiated claims of creationists.\n \n Nothing in evolution theory, or even the whole of science, entails even the most remote challenge to the idea that your God (or any other God) created the universe, or that Jesus died for our salvation. What much of science does show is that a literalist view of the Bible is contradicted at every turn by what we observe. Why this is a problem is utterly beyond me.",

   "I really wonder sometimes how so many people fallow [sic] Darwinism. I think it is a lack of knowledge of histry - they don't realize that Darwinism is responsible for the atrocities commited by hitler, Stalin, and other communist leaders.\nI guess you are unaware that Hitler claimed to be a christian. There is also the fact that Lysenko, Stalin's director of biology and agriculture, rejected Darwinian evolution and Mendelian genetics. He is responsible for the failure of the failure of Soviet agricultural programs under Stalin. Maybe you should read some history before you accuse others of lack of knowledge of history. You're not going to learn history from religious zealots who lie to you. You only make yourself look foolish.",

   "Up before dawn, saw this and I thought - has christmas come early?\n \n Before I dissect your 'argument' EDO, aren't there many other points you have left hanging on other threads that deserve your attention lest you lose all credibility? I think yes. \n \n Oh and one other point - I genuinely think now that you are actually a parody. Either that or you are very young and therefore ignorant. This is not an insult, as should be clear from the very important quote that I have chosen as my signature. You don't see me debating aspects of the Bible, because I am IGNORANT in that field.\n \n \nI really wonder sometimes how so many people fallow Darwinism. I think it is a lack of knowledge of histry - they don't realize that Darwinism is responsible for the atrocities commited by hitler, Stalin, and other communist leaders. I think it is said that evos support these mass murderers - they are reprobate people who lack faith in God\n\n \n Hilarious creationism 101 argument, that makes me genuinely doubt your seriousness as a poster here. But, given Poe's Law and lurkers, and the fact that I have nothing to do for 2 hours, I must respond: \n \n 1) Hitler was not a communist.\n 2) Stalin was not a communist.\n \n OK, basic factual errors out of the way.\n \n 3) Given that neither of your examples can be lumped under one worldview, and given that atrocious dictatorial regimes have existed throughout history, exhibiting in every historical example almost exactly the same traits, it is hard to see how a relatively modern science could be blamed for standard human extremism. \n \n 4) Taking the moral issue to hand, the argument that 'Darwinism' leads to a sociopathic moral compass is asinine. 'Darwinism', or rather, the theory of evolution, is an observation of facts and events that exist and take place in the real world. The fact that someone makes such an observation does not mean that they have to extend such a philosophy to their own personal morals. We humans are not such simplistic creatures as to do this. \n \n 5) 'Darwinism' (also known as the theory of evolution) is equally at home with co-operation as it is with competition. What this means is that the regularly misused (mainly by those who are ignorant of evolutionary theory) phrase 'survival of the fittest' has nothing whatsoever to do with the idea that each of us individually should pursue a ruthless strategy of dominance over our ecological peers. Such a strategy may work for bacteria, but for the vast majority of life would result in evolutionary failure. This is especially true of the social lifeforms that are mammals. \n \n \nAlso, if evolutionism was true, bullet-proof deer wouldexist:\n In survival of the fittest, we should be finding more critters that are adapting by becoming bullet proof. Hunters have been around from speers and firearms onward. The conclusion is that we can shoot a species and it can be come extinct. We should find fish hook resistant fish also.\n\n \n OK, this has to be a p**s-take. Or so I would have thought a couple of years ago. I have had enough experience of severely ignorant creationists as to be inured to surprise at their arguments. This last paragraph is barely worth responding to, beyond noting that:\n \n 1) It is practically impossible for organic life to become bulletproof, therefore we will not notice any evolutionary change in this direction, because reproductivity rates will never be affected enough by [tissue-thickness] vs [bullet-velocity] to create trait fixing.\n \n 2) \"We can shoot a species and it can become extinct\" well yes. Because there are 6 billion of us and we are outperforming our ecological niche, to an unhealthy degree. \"Hook resistant fish\"? U am a trol.\n \n \n1 million years from now the evolutionists will say the surviving species evolved from the extinct one.\n\n \n Only if they have forgotten all that we have learned so far.\n \n \nThe only thing we observe is evolution of avoidance behavior.\n\n \n Care to elaborate?\n \n \nBehavioral adaption is not biological.\n\n \n I think that one was worked out at least 100 years ago if not before.\n \n \nStudy the business of raising rodeo bulls.\n\n \n Not until you study even the most elementary basics of evolution. Such as what the theory says, and what it doesn't say. Until then, give me an idea of what you're trying to talk about and I'll get back to you.\n \n Have a nice day.\n \n \n ON EDIT: Just wanted to add this: While I in no way intend to demean GiantOreo as our new Mod, I don't think the Evo/Creo forum is a place that Mods are necessary. It is incredibly easy to argue these points and anyone who uses ridiculous language and/or pathetically stupid arguments will only make themselves look ridiculous and/or pathetically stupid. The only time I can see Mod action being necessary is if someone insults somebody's religion. I for one am quite happy for anyone to insult evolution, scientists and/or atheism as they will only ridicule and demean themselves. Good morning.",

   "Yes, I did correct you as well.\n \n But in Edo's case, he has broken a rule: His statements were broad-brushed, and completely negative and inflammatory ( both calling a broad group of people \"reprobates\", and saying that a broad group of people \"supports mass murderers\"). This sort of broad-brushing and inflammatory generalizations do nothing for the debate at hand, and are also rather off-topic from this thread, now that I think of it.\n \n I have no doubt that the Admin will agree on this - I am not \"nit-picking\", I am attempting to remove off-topic, divisive, and inflammatory statments, and get back to actual debating of the issues, just as Bassman is.\n\n \n Broadbrushed statements are a problem, and they do break forum rules when, which is almost always, they can be shown to be false. It is often not true when you say a whole group of people believe or do something.",
