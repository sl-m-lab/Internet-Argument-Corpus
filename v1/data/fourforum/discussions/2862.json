   "Here is an email that was forwarded to me, What do you think?\n \n -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Please pause a moment, reflect back, and take the following Multiple\n Choice test. The events are actual cuts from past history. They\n actually happened!\n \n \n Do you remember?\n \n 1. In 1972 at the Munich Olympics, athletes were kidnapped and\n massacred by:\n a. Olga Corbitt\n b. Sitting Bull\n c. Arnold Schwarzenegger\n d. Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40\n \n 2. In 1979, the U.S. embassy in Iran was taken over by:\n a. Lost Norwegians\n b. Elvis\n c. A tour bus full of 80-year-old women\n d. Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40\n \n 3. During the 1980's a number of Americans were kidnapped in Lebanon\n by:\n a. John Dillinger\n b. The King of Sweden\n c. The Boy Scouts\n d. Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40\n \n 4. In 1983, the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut was blown up by:\n a. A pizza delivery boy\n b. Pee Wee Herman\n c. Geraldo Rivera\n d. Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40\n \n 5. In 1985 the cruise ship, Achille Lauro, was hijacked and a 70 year\n old American Passenger was murdered and thrown overboard in\n his wheelchair by:\n a. The Smurfs\n b. Davy Jones\n c. The Little Mermaid\n d. Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40\n \n 6. In 1985 TWA flight 847 was hijacked at Athens, and a U.S. Navy\n diver trying to rescue passengers was murdered by:\n a. Captain Kidd\n b. Charles Lindberg\n c. Mother Teresa\n d. Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40\n \n 7. In 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 was bombed by:\n a. Scooby Doo\n b. The Tooth Fairy\n c. Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid\n d. Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40\n \n 8. In 1993 the World Trade Center was bombed the first time by:\n a. Richard Simmons\n b. Grandma Moses\n c. Michael Jordan\n d. Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40\n \n 9. In 1998, the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed by:\n a. Mr. Rogers\n b. Hillary Clinton, to distract attention from Wild Bill's women\n problems\n c. The World Wrestling Federation\n d. Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40\n \n 10. On 9/11/01, four airliners were hijacked; two were used as missiles\n to take out the World Trade Centers and of the remaining two,\n one crashed into the US Pentagon and the other was diverted and\n crashed by the passengers. Thousands of people were killed\n by:\n a. Bugs Bunny, Wiley E. Coyote, Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd\n b. The Supreme Court of Florida\n c. Mr. Bean\n d. Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40\n \n 11. In 2002 the United States fought a war in Afghanistan against:\n a. Enron\n b. The Lutheran Church\n c. The NFL\n d. Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40\n \n 12. In 2002 reporter Daniel Pearl was kidnapped and murdered by:\n a. Bonnie and Clyde\n b. Captain Kangaroo\n c. Billy Graham\n d. Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40\n \n Nope, .........I really don't see a pattern here to justify profiling,\n do you? So, to ensure we Americans never offend anyone,particularly\n fanatics intent on killing us, airport security screeners will no\n longer be allowed to profile certain people. They must conduct random\n searches of 80-year-old women, little kids, airline pilots with proper\n identification, secret agents who are members of the President's\n security detail, 85-year old Congressmen with metal hips, and Medal of\n Honor winning former Governors, and leave Muslim Males between the ages\n 17 & 40 alone because of profiling.\n \n Let's send this to as many people as we can so that the Gloria Aldreds\n and other dunder-headed attorneys along with Federal Justices that want\n to thwart common sense, feel doubly ashamed of themselves - if they\n have any such sense.\n \n As the writer of the award winning story \"Forrest Gump\" so aptly put\n it, \"Stupid is as stupid does.\"\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Well, should we leave young male muslims alone?\n \n How can we tell if someone is muslim? \n Do muslim people have a certain look about them? \n Or should the test really have read \"Male arab-looking people\"?\n Recently, my girlfriend went on a flight by herself and there was a large group of Afghanis on board, with the hats, jackets, and beards. I'll bet these guys were watched intently. Or were they? The passengers sure stared, my gf said. But were the pilots and stewardesses keeping an eye on them? Were they thoroughly searched before getting on board? \n \n I don't think it's too much to ask. When I get on a plane at the Shreveport, La. airport (close to Barksdale AFB), they make everyone open their car trunk, take off their shoes, they search everything of american looking folks. But at the Nashville, Tn. airport security is much more lax, hardly anyone is stopped and searched. I doubt that these Afghani-looking people (maybe taliban?) were searched very thoroughly. What if.........",

I recommend reading the entire report, but here's the brief summary (as ably picked out by U. Chicago Poly Sci Professor Daniel Drezner).\n \n This transparency is the Achilles' Heel of CAPS; the fact that individuals know their CAPS status enables the system to be reverse engineered. You... know if you're carryons have been manually inspected. You know if you've been questioned. You know if you're asked to stand in a special line. You know if you've been frisked. All of this open scrutiny makes it possible to learn an anti-profile to defeat CAPS, even if the profile itself is always kept secret. We call this the \"Carnival Booth Effect\" since, like a carnie, it entices terrorists to \"Step Right Up! See if you're a winner!\" In this case, the terrorist can step right up and see if he's been flagged. \n",

   "all this is true, and for the sake of public safety, some people are going to be violated or have their privacy invaded. at the cost of potentially saving thousands of innocent lives, i think the price is reasonable. the reason why places have security is because certain areas are sensitive targets to attacks that are real. on entering any federal building anywhere in nyc, you have to go through a metal detector and have your bags x-rayed. they took my cell phone when i went to city hall a few weeks ago. it may feel like a violation, and perhaps some people will be detered. the thing is, if your business in the building it that urgent, you'll overlook that security procedures and do what you have to do. not everywhere is protected, and not everyone can be scanned in public, and the real threat of attacks from within the us will remain. \n \n on the one hand we are fighting for the government to stand-down the police state and stop invading our privacy. on the other hand we are upset that no intellegence on the terrorists right in our country was available to prevent a tragedy like 9/11\n \n you cant have it both ways",
