   "New Hampshire state law is pretty clear about protecting its citizens' rights to carry firearms in public. Carrying a pistol or revolver openly is permitted without a license; carrying a concealed weapon requires a license from the state or local police. \n \n William Kostric took advantage of that law on Tuesday to show up outside President Obama's Portsmouth, N.H. town hall meeting and hold a sign saying \"It Is Time To Water The Tree Of Liberty.\" That invokes a phrase from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson: \"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\" \n \n Kostric did not immediately respond to an interview request from CBSNews.com.\n \n Portsmouth police spokesman Lt. Frank Warchol told the Boston Globe that because Kostric was on private property -- it belongs to a church near the school with the town hall meeting -- he would not be arrested. \"We can't do anything about it,\" Warchol said. \"Obviously he's on our radar screen at this time.\"\n \n Kostric was there around 11 a.m. ET, before Mr. Obama even left the White House en route for the Granite State, and there's no indication he ever laid eyes on the president. Nevertheless, around that time (11:35 a.m., to be precise) MSNBC's Carlos Watson called for Kostric to be forcibly disarmed: \"I cannot imagine that there aren't enough lawyers in New Hampshire who can't file some sort of emergency injunction.\" One of his guests added: \"Why can't we get rid of him now?\"\n \n MSNBC's Chris Matthews invited Kostric on his show and wondered why \"you're carrying a XXXXXXned gun at a presidential event?\" (Kostric's reply: He was there peacefully, guns aren't unusual in New Hampshire, and Americans lose rights unless they exercise them.)\n \n One MSNBC.com report indicates that Kostric was approached by a detective, possibly a Secret Service agent, who told him he could be arrested within 1,000 feet of a school with a weapon under a federal law.\n\n Gun-Toting Man Draws Scrutiny Outside Obama Town Hall - Political Hotsheet - CBS News\n \n Remember that game some kids played where one would put a finger next to another kid, and insist \"I'm not touching you\", until mom would come along and tell the first kid to knock it off?\n \n Where's mom when you need her?\n :xbanghead",

It's perfectly ok. \n It's really irrelevant here.\n\n I swear.\n It is comical watching some of these apologists trying to pretend that carrying a gun, and a sign with a clear threat to the president, at an area where Obama is having a town hall, is the same thing as just opening your mouth and talking...\n \n Tell you what. Try an experiment for me.\n Have you and your friend walk up to a cop.\n Your friend can start talking about how he doesn't like Obama's healthcare plan.\n You carry the sign that this man had, and expose a gun in front of the cop.\n Maybe the cop can explain the difference to you...\n \n \n \nSorry, but the constitution doesn't cease to apply when the president is in town. Too bad for you, since you clearly don't want to honor it. \n\n Who said anything about not honoring the constitution?\n Wasn't me.\n Another strawman.\n \n I am simply pointing out the brazen nature at which some people will threaten the president.\n And just as repugnant, the absurd methods that other people will go to ignore and/or excuse the inexcusable.\n Quite frankly, I would be really interested if somebody were to carry a sign threatening you to your place of work, with an open gun, and to see you just say *it's okay and nothing wrong*.\n \n A little while back, we had a black professor who was arrested for yelling at a police officer.\n And here we have an open, armed threat against the president...\n Comparing the reaction between the two is amazing!\n \n \n \nIt's funny how your analysis pretends that the presence of the president somehow nullfies constitutional rights ...... \n\n It's funny how I never said it did.\n \n \n \nemoticon_rolleyes\n You're being quite the drama queen this evening I see.\n First, the sign wasn't \"asking for the president's blood.\"\n\n Did you even read the first post in this thread?\n No. Of course not. You don't read up on what people are talking about before you weigh in...\n The sign he was carrying was a clear reference to a Thomas Jefferson comment about watering the tree of liberty with the \"blood of patriots and tyrants\".\n You can bet this man didn't think Obama was a patriot...\n \n \n \nSecond, yes, carrying a gun legally is indeed a reasonable thing to do.\n\n Again, you confuse the issue of \"legality\" with \"reasonable thing to do\".\n Gay sex is legal.\n Do you think it's a reasonable or moral thing to do?\n \n \n \nIf you're ever in a situation where you need one to save your life, I suspect you'd find yourself in agreement.\n\n Again, you're incapable of discussing the actual merits of this situation.\n He wasn't there to save anybody's life.\n He was there to threaten a president's life.\n \n \n \nYou're conflating two different actions here, when there's no evidence the two actions are even related. \n\n ROFLMAO!\n OMG. At times you are too funny for words.\n You talk about the man defending his family, and saving other people's lives, with respect to THIS ISSUE, and you complain that I am \"conflating two different actions\"???\n \n I've already presented the evidence.\n Predictably, you have failed to respond to it.\n \n \n \nExcept in the mind of people who think of guns as some evil boogyman .... emoticon_rolleyes\n\n And again you go in with the strawmen arguments.\n I have not argued that guns themselves are evil boogymen.\n I have CLEARLY stated that it is the combination of the president and the carrying of the gun (not to mention the threat) which is problematic.",

The appropriate personnel have checked his birth certificate.\n The \"birthers\", with absolutely no evidence (other than a few birth certificates which were later proven to be forgeries) are claiming that Obama's Hawaiian birth is a fraud.\n They claim his birth certificate, which again has been verified by the appropriate personnel, is a forgery.\n They claim that his NEWSPAPER ANNOUNCEMENTS (of Obama's birth) are forgeries...\n The claim of the newspaper announcements being forgeries are hilarious. Did his mother, AT THE TIME OF HIS BIRTH, think that maybe her inter-racial kid could be president someday, and thus made a conscious effort to commit fraud with the newspapers???\n \n The two issues are nowhere in the same court, except at a rudimentary glance. (Which is probably why you're confused...)\n \n In Obama's case, people are claiming he was born in Kenya and calling him (again with no facts) a liar for saying he was born in Hawaii.\n In McCain's case, we have FELLOW REPUBLICANS working on the facts of the situation, trying to make legal arguments that his uncontested conditions of birth do not qualify to fit the constitutional requirements.",

The big bad black man whose going to come for the scared Republican guns. And they are bending over backwards for civil rights ...\n :xbanghead\n Good luck getting the Republicans to acknowledge the significance of that...\n \n \n \nemoticon_rolleyes Banning guns and therefore infringing rights isn't the right way to stop the \"inevitable.\" \n\n Who the heck said anything about \"banning guns\"?\n Not me.\n \n And what's your \"right way to stop the 'inevitable'\"?\n By your enforcing your policies and reactions, would ANY president's historical assassination have been affected in any way?\n Republicans want the government to violate the fourth amendment and wiretap American citizens without a warrant, with no oversight...\n ... but their right to wear guns and ask for the President's blood? THAT has to be protected at all costs... :xbanghead\n \n \n \nThe problem I see with your take on the situation is that you seem to be about infringing rights on non-violent people (like this man) as the answer. Yes, I certainly do have a problem with that. It's unconstitutional.\n\n I want a comfortable safe zone around the president where firearms are controlled.\n Airports are able to control citizens rights to carry firearms.\n Schools used to have a law, before the gun \"enthusiasts\" struck it down...\n In our ordinary lives, people understand such clear limits. They exist.\n And Republicans are habitually silent, cause they are afraid terrorists could use a gun in such a criminally heinous manner.\n \n But when it comes to the president??? :xbanghead",
