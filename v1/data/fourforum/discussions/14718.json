   "We Americans truly love and adore war for we engage in it time after time after time. Here is our national prayer:\n \nO Lord our Father, \n our young patriots, idols of our hearts, go forth to battle -- be Thou near them! With them -- in spirit -- we also go forth from the sweet peace of our beloved firesides to smite the foe. \n \n O Lord our God, \n help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells; \n help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead; \n help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain; \n help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief; \n help us to turn them out roofless with little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames of summer and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it -- \n for our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast their hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their steps, water their way with their tears, stain the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet! \n \n We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the Source of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that are sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen. \n\n From Mark Twain",

   "What would you know about evil? People LIKE YOU go home every day while the innocent unborn are being butchered and do nothing about it. Hypocrite.\n\n \n No, I am not a hypocrite. I dont think that abortion is necessarily wrong. If you have been around enough to recall some of my earlier posts here, I have advocated putting real, already born humans into thermal depolymerization units in order to bring down the price of gas. I just dont have it in me to get worked up about a clump of cells being scraped out after a too drunk night at the bar. I dont think that is a baby. \n \n On the up side, if it turns out that I am wrong, I may someday have to stand in front of god and say \"Sorry, my bad\". Since I am one of gods creatures and by his design imperfect, I expect he will likely give me a grin, shrug, and say \"Ok\".\n \n YOU, on the other hand, will stand in front of god having believed that millions of babies were slaughtered while you sat by and did NOTHING. Sorry, that just isnt going to go well for you. \n \n You, sir, will be spending eternity in the pit. \n \n \nYou radical liberals can start by refusing to vote for more liberals who advocate and defend mass infanticide and who put radical left judges in the courts.\n\n \n ROTFLMAO. Sorry, Easy, I am one of the most conservative posters here. You just dont know what the term means. \n \n \n\n Now, which one of you BLEEDING HEART LIBERALS is going to do the right thing and start by voting the pro abortion butcher-enablers out of office?\n\n \n \n This is pathetic. So it is the liberals fault for putting abortion supporters in office? Uh, the republicans just had control of BOTH houses of congress AND the white house. They could have passed any law they wanted and the democrats could have done squat about it. What did they do about abortion??? Not a damn thing. \n \n Easy, a lot of other people dont see this issue the way you do. I am one of them. I dont think that most abortions kill babies, and the ones that do, I think that it may be for the best in most cases. You dont have to like it. If you really believe that millions of babies are being killed, sitting around waiting for an election to maybe put a stop to it is an act of absolute cowardice and greed. \n \n As far as what I know about evil....I know a LOT abut evil. I have lied, cheated, stolen, and killed. I have destroyed more lives than I care to remember or admit to. I have done and seen things so evil that even now, over a decade later, I wake up screaming more nights than not.\n \n I am a monster. I know what I am and I make no apologies for it. YOU, on the other hand, apparently seem to think that it is possible to stand by and do nothing while millions of infants are killed, and still be a good man. Not only do you think you are a good man, you actually believe that God will find favor in your actions. \n \n I honestly dont know how you live with yourself. If I was in your position, I literally could not do it. I would either have to take action or kill myself. I could not live with the shame of being such a dishonorable coward as to stand by and do nothing while millions of INFANTS are killed. And I am a monster. What does that make you??",
