   "In an interview on Sunday night's 60 Minutes, the president offered a stern response to the former vice president's criticism that Obama has somehow made Americans \"less safe.\"\n \n \"... The vice president is eager to defend a legacy that was unsustainable,\" said Obama, characterizing Cheney's politics as a line of thought which \"has done incredible damage to our image and position in the world.\"\n \n \"I fundamentally disagree with Dick Cheney,\" said Obama. \"Not surprisingly. You know, I think that Vice President Cheney has been at the head of a movement whose notion is somehow that we can't reconcile our core values, our constitution, our belief that we don't torture, with our national security interests. I think he's drawing the wrong lesson from history. The facts don't bear him out.\n \n \"I think he is ... That attitude, that philosophy has done incredible damage to our image and position in the world. I mean, the fact of the matter is, after all these years, how many convictions actually came out of Guantanamo? How many ... How many terrorists have actually been brought to justice under the philosophy that is being promoted by Vice President Cheney? It hasn't made us safer.\n \n \"What it has been is a great advertisement for anti-American sentiment, which means that there is constant effective recruitment of Arab fighters and Muslim fighters against U.S. interests all around the world.\"\n \n \"Some of it being organized by a few people who were released from Guantanamo,\" said interviewer Steve Kroft.\n \n \"Well, there is no doubt that we have not done a particularly effective job in sorting through who are truly dangerous individuals that we've got to make sure are not a threat to us, who are folks that we just swept up,\" Obama replied. \"The whole premise of Guantanamo promoted by Vice President Cheney was that, somehow, the American system of justice was not up to the task of dealing with these terrorists.\"\n \n \"... This is the legacy that's been left behind and, you know, I'm surprised that the vice president is eager to defend a legacy that was unsustainable. Let's assume that we didn't change these practices. How long are we going to go? Are we going to just keep on going until, you know, the entire Muslim world and Arab world despises us? Do we think that's really going to make us safer? I don't know a lot of thoughtful thinkers, liberal or conservative, who think that was the right approach.\"The Raw Story | Obama fires back at Cheney on 60 Minutes\n \n The Bush administration has not made us safer.\n They have made matters worse.\n \n When we invaded Afghanistan going after al Qaeda, we had the support of essentially the world.\n When we invaded Iraq under false pretenses, and were busted for illegal torture, we gave the terrorists talking points to increase recruitment.\n \n Bush has NOT made us safer.",

   "WASHINGTON &#8212; A stark assessment of terrorism trends by U.S. intelligence agencies has found that the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq has helped spawn a new generation of Islamic radicalism and that the overall terrorist threat has grown since the Sept. 11 attacks.\n \n The classified National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) attributes a more direct role to the Iraq war in fueling radicalism than that presented either in recent White House documents or in a report released Wednesday by the House Intelligence Committee, according to several officials who were involved in preparing the assessment or have read the final document.\n \n The intelligence estimate, completed in April, is the first formal appraisal of global terrorism by U.S. intelligence agencies since the March 2003 invasion of Iraq, and it represents a consensus view of the 16 disparate spy services inside government. Titled \"Trends in Global Terrorism: Implications for the United States,\" it asserts that Islamic radicalism, rather than being in retreat, has metastasized and spread around the globe.\n \n An opening section of the report, \"Indicators of the Spread of the Global Jihadist Movement,\" cites the Iraq war as a reason for the diffusion of jihad ideology.\n \n The report \"says that the Iraq war has made the overall terrorism problem worse,\" one U.S. intelligence official said.\n The Seattle Times: Politics: Spy agencies say Iraq war worsened terror threat\n \n And note, this is the GOVERNMENT'S OWN study which says this. Not \"moveon.org\" sponsored junk, but the GOVERNMENT'S OWN RESEARCH!\n \n And McCain didn't care if we were in Iraq for 100 more years???\n :xbanghead",

   "War has been around as long as there has been recorded history. I understand the sentiment that we, as a species, need to \"evolve\" beyond the need to carve each other up at a whim. However, as long as there are elements willing to do us harm, ie; 9/11, with reasonable, cause I support taking out who ever they are, by what ever means available.\n \n To say Bush's War on Terror is a failure is being somewhat disengenious since there have been no attacks on US soil since 9/11. I would also add that there are a couple million Iraqi Kurds that are somewhat thankful for the US intervention. As for comments like a \"misguided\" war and the myth that Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction, I would implore anyone to research the history leading up to the Gulf War.\n \n While it is true that Saddam did not have nuclear weapons, he did have chemical weapons and he was the first to use them in the course of a war. He also destroyed an entire city in Iraq with these weapons of mass destruction in March of 1988, and he used them liberaly against the Iranians during the war with them.\n \n To the casual observer I would support your views against war if they were based solely on your distaste for violence, however I stand ready to wage verbal war against anyone who just hated the war because it was \"Bush's\" war and you raise no objections to the 17000 American son's and daughter's who are being sent to Afganistan by order of our \"Dear Chairman Mao-bama\"\n \n There is no objective in Afganistan, and no exit strategy that I have heard in the last 100 days. I believe there is no chance for victory there.\n \n And here we are again, BOTH Democrats and Republicans know that the only chance possible for this economy to pull itself out of the toilet is for us to be involved in an active conflict.... and that is the TRUE battlefield boys and girls.",

Whenever they come together to oppose something, you know it would probably be beneficial to most people.\n \n You should read \"Economics in One Lesson,\" by Henry Hazlitt. He explains very well why war doesn't really help the economy overall. I happen to be reading it right now and it's quite interesting.\n \n Although, you shouldn't really have to read a book to tell you that the \"war on terror\" has left us weaker financially.\n \n Also, I would be careful about making that \"there haven't been any attacks on our soil\" argument. If there is an attack, your entire argument gets flushed down the toilet and you will be forced to admit the failure which you so vehemently deny. The worst part about that argument is it only works in that direction - in other words, no attacks on our soil does not equal success, but one attack equals failure.",

   "Off-topic because the \"war doesn't support the economy\" comments sparked my interest.\n \n I feel that perhaps you're generalizing a little too much. Remember Germany in the few years before Hitler raised an army? It went from being in one of it's worse depressions in history to one of the biggest powerhouses on the face of the earth in a mere two years. If Obama pulled America out of the toilet and not only brought our economy on level, but put us at our strongest moment in recorded history economically in a mere two years, I'm pretty sure we'd say \"oh wow, whatever he did sure did work!\" Guess what Hitler did? He prepared for war.\n \n Now, when your planes cost 1.7 millions dollars for the fighters and much much more for your bombers and you're tossing out multiple-thousand and million dollar explosives like their you're own personal killer raindrops, you stand to lose a bit more money than the person who created the actual thing gained by having a job.\n \n In Hitler's war, he gained because he sought to conquer. In conquering you are gaining, and ideally you are using immediately less physical wealth to gain than you are actually obtaining at the moment; an example could be shown as the amount of ordinance and military spending to conquer a country should be less than the value of that country in total whether through immediate wealth or raw materials.\n \n In the United States recent wars, we do not seek to conquer. We either seek political relations by removing the head of power and establishing our own system (which works in some cases with Germany and Japan as examples), or use of the countries raw materials by killing those stopping the country from trading with us and then putting someone in power who seeks to profit from the United States in which case we still lose profit.\n \n As long as the initial investment was worth the end sum, war is profitable. In times when a man's salary was worth more than his weapons, this made sense. For the United States, this is no longer the case. And pardon me, but the southerner in me has to say this- As much as our military doesn't make sense fiscally, we sure can unload a can of whoopass when we have to.",
