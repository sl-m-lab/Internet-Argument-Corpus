While education can help get you out of poverty, education also costs money. That's a bit of a catch-22. Your opinion on education really don't matter if you can't afford to go to college in the first place.\n\n \n While that is true to large degree, I also know of specific incidences where people had the OPPORTUNITY to get to college, but because they scorned 'book learning', they did not do so (My cousin married a person like that). Either that, or rather than go to a place where they could get an education to get ahead, they squandered their educational opportunities to go to such places as 'Alabama Bible College', or the 'Florida Thelogical Seminary', and wasted their change on being educated.",

   "What? About your bigotry against religion? Dude, one of your posts above starts with \"Religion kills babies.\" Unless you were kidding (with a not-so-funny joke), then that sort of sweeping, generalized, irrational comment is indicative of the sort of things people have said about every group that there's been prejudice against: blacks, gay people, Jews, etc.\n\n Why jyoshu, why?\n \n Why must you hurt me this way?\n \n Do you think it's easy being this evil?\n \n Would you rather someone else do the job?\n \n Before we go any further little jyoshu, I must say this:\n \n Religion is a thing young jyoshu, a thing.\n \n Your feeble attempt to connect your self to truly persecuted people is really sweet but...\n \n Bless you little hart. emoticon_love",
