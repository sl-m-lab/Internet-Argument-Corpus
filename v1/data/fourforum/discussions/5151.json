   "Of course the left will deny this report.\n =============================\n AP: Ethnic Rifts Tearing at al-Qaida\n May 10, 2005 1:41 PM EDT\n \n ISLAMABAD, Pakistan - American and Pakistani intelligence agents are exploiting a growing rift between Arab members of al-Qaida and their Central Asian allies, a fissure that's tearing at the network of Islamic extremists as militants compete for scarce hideouts, weapons and financial resources, counterterrorism officials say.\n \n The rivalry may have contributed to the arrest last week of one of Osama bin Laden's top lieutenants, a Libyan described as al-Qaida's No. 3 and known to have had differences with Uzbeks. Captured Uzbek, Chechen and Tajik suspects have been giving up information about the movements of Arab al-Qaida militants in recent months, four Pakistani intelligence agents told The Associated Press, leading to a series of successful raids and arrests.\n \n \"When push comes to shove, the Uzbeks are going to stick together, and the Arabs are going to stick together,\" said Kenneth Katzman, a terrorism expert with the Congressional Research Service in Washington. \"I think the Uzbek guerrillas have had no home. Some of this could be a battle for survival.\"\n \n The Pakistani agents, who hold sensitive jobs in various military and intelligence agencies in several cities, all spoke on condition their names not be used...\n \n (Snip)\n \n Pakistani security agents say they're confident they have broken al-Qaida's back, although bin Laden and al-Zawahri remain at large.\n \n \"Al-Qaida is no longer intact in Pakistan as a network,\" said Gen. Shaukat Sultan, the chief army spokesman. \"Every organization needs a command structure and communication, and we have effectively destroyed both of them.\"\n \n http://start.earthlink.net/article/int?guid=20050510/428031c0_3ca6_15526200505101991149667",

   "Have you noticed the misinformation that has always been apart of the Bush tenure. How many times had we \"found\" wmd? Remember the mistake that was Salmon Pak? remeber those bogus connections to Al Qaeda? How about that report of 70% of Iraqis voting? Or the more recent one about a number three man being captured? \n \n http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-1602568,00.html\n \n THE capture of a supposed Al-Qaeda kingpin by Pakistani agents last week was hailed by President George W Bush as \"a critical victory in the war on terror\". According to European intelligence experts, however, Abu Faraj al-Libbi was not the terrorists' third in command, as claimed, but a middle-ranker derided by one source as \"among the flotsam and jetsam\" of the organisation.\n \n \n \n My, my you just can't trust sources that put out stuff to support the adminstration. Hard to say how such misinformation gets out, but I suspect I better hand in my liberal media card. They are just not on top of this stuff. ;) \n \n \n So, no, I have little reason to accept your story, but I'll keep listening and watching NPR and PBS. If there is any truth to it, it'll turn up there. emoticon_cool",

Again: Terrorism up; Iraq a training ground where it wasn't before; terrorist group recruitment up; all measurables say Iraq made things much worse.\n \n The good news is other countries have been doing it correct and using good intel and police work. Someone else pointed that out earlier today. But Bush is lost.",
