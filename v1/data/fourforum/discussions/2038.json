   "How many times have you heard the Democratic scare tactic...that the Republicans want to take away your Social Security?\n \n \n FYI!*** \n \n \n Social Security....\n \n (This is worth the read... It's short and to the point.) \n \n Since many of us have paid into FICA for years and are now receiving a \n \n Social Security check every month -- and then finding that we are \n getting taxed on 85% of the money we paid to the federal government to \"put away,\" \n \n you may be interested in the following: \n \n Q: Which party took Social Security from an independent fund and \n * put it* in the general fund so that Congress could spend it? \n \n A: It was Lyndon Johnson and the Democratic-controlled House \n and Senate \n \n \n Q: Which party put a tax on Social Security? \n \n A: The Democratic party.  \n \n \n \n Q: Which party increased the tax on Social Security? \n \n A: The Democratic Party with Al Gore casting the deciding vote.  \n \n \n \n Q: Which party decided to give money to immigrants? \n \n A: That's right, immigrants moved into this country and at 65 got \n SSI Social Security. \n \n The Democratic Party gave that to them although they \n never paid a dime into it.  \n \n \n Then, after doing all this, the Democrats turn around and tell you \n the Republicans want to take your Social Security \n \n And the worst part about it is, people believe it!  \n \n \n 2004 Election Issue",
