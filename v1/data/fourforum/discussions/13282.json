   "Finally, people are starting to wise up about ACORN. And it took two Conservative \"kids\" to bring the facts to light...with the help of FOX NEWS. \n \n\n SEPTEMBER 12, 2009 Census Bureau Cuts Its Ties With Acorn \n By JAKE SHERMAN \n WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Census Bureau on Friday dropped Acorn as a partner for the 2010 Census after two separate hidden-camera videos captured four employees of the community organization giving tax advice on running a brothel to a man posing as an aspiring politician and a woman posing as his girlfriend and a prostitute.\n \n The Census Bureau earlier this year signed up the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, one of the nation's largest community groups, as a national partner for the decennial census, a role that entails helping to publicize the importance of the count and encouraging people to participate.\n \n In a letter to Acorn President Maude Hurd, Census Director Robert Groves said Acorn had become a distraction.\n \n Acorn's deputy national director, Brian Kettenring, said the organization won't stop promoting the 2010 Census. \"We will continue to do what we've said we'll do, which is encourage people in communities to participate fully in the census,\" he said.\n \n News reports have identified the filmmaker as 25-year-old James O'Keefe, an activist for conservative issues. His identity couldn't be independently verified. In the videos, posted on YouTube, he posed as an aspiring politician and told the Acorn workers that he planned to use his girlfriend's prostitution income to fund future campaigns. One video was filmed at the community organization's Baltimore office, and another, a day later, in Washington, D.C.\n \n The workers, who Acorn said were fired after it learned of the videos, instructed the couple to set up a company to prove they had enough income for a house that would serve as a brothel and home for teenage prostitutes. The couple purported to be seeking help to obtain a housing loan.\n Census Bureau Cuts Its Ties With Acorn - WSJ.com\n \n",

   "Finally, people are starting to wise up about ACORN. And it took two Conservative \"kids\" to bring the facts to light...with the help of FOX NEWS.\n\n \n This is all good news, and a step in the right direction of hopefully investigating this organization finally, and holding it responsible for its criminal ethos. These 2 young people were very smart in their tactic of going to three separate offices to expose their corruption and then releasing the tapes slowly so each time Acorn attempted to defend themselves by attacking the kids documenting their corruption. The third incident in NY put the nail in their proverbial coffin, so to speak. \n \n But now the liberal Pelosi House of Representatives must vote on this issue. I can't wait to see for documentation purposes how many democrats will vote to ignore what Acorn obviously represents as they vote against punishing them in any way, investigating them, or cutting off funding for them. It will speak volumes to millions of americans from all political parties just how corrupt the democratic party is as it aligns with Acorn against the people they were elected to represent. Their elitist attitudes will surely be their undoing come 2010 & 2012 when this criminal president if thrown out on his ear as yet one more one term liberal president in the image of Jimmy Carter. May God help us to survive until then. emoticon_xgood",

   "And it continues with the Senate:\n \n\n SEPTEMBER 15, 2009 \n Senate Acts to Deny Acorn Aid \n By COREY BOLES \n WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly Monday to prevent Acorn, an umbrella group of community organizers, from being able to bid for federal grant money.\n \n The 83-7 vote came as Acorn -- the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now -- has been in the spotlight for hidden-camera videos in which Acorn employees give tax advice to a couple posing as a prostitute and her pimp. Prosecutors in Florida last week issued warrants for several Acorn employees on allegations they falsified voter-registration records last year, and on Friday, the Census Bureau severed ties with the organization as it prepares for the 2010 count.\n \n A spokesman for Acorn didn't return an email seeking comment on the vote. Earlier, a spokesman said Acorn would have no comment until the Senate acted.\n \n Acorn received $1.6 million to provide housing assistance in its current fiscal year, which expires Sept. 30, and according to Republican lawmakers, the group has received $53 million in federal funding since 1994. It has been involved in advising lower-income people as the mortgage foreclosure crisis has deepened.\n \n The measure preventing Acorn from qualifying for federal grant money was introduced by Sen. Mike Johanns (R., Neb.) as an amendment to a spending bill funding the departments of Housing and Urban Development and Transportation in fiscal 2010. The House-passed version of the spending bill doesn't include such language.\n Senate Acts to Deny Acorn Aid - WSJ.com\n \n",

   "\"Although the organization prides itself for its registration efforts, it also has a long history of scandal. In the state of Missouri in 1986, 12 ACORN members were convicted of voter fraud. But that case was not an isolated incident in the state. In December 2004, in St. Louis, six volunteers pleaded guilty of dozens of election law violations for filling out registration cards with names of dead people and other bogus information. Authorities launched an earlier investigation after noticing that among the new voters was longtime St. Louis alderman Albert \"Red\" Villa, who died in 1990. The volunteers worked for \"Operation Big Vote\" - a branch of ACORN - in St. Louis.\n \n On February 10, 2005, Nonaresa Montgomery, a paid worker who ran Operation Big Vote during the run-up to the 2001 mayoral primary, was found guilty of vote fraud. Montgomery hired about 30 workers to do fraudulent voter-registration canvassing. Instead of knocking on doors, the volunteers sat at a St. Louis fast food restaurant and wrote out names and information from an outdated voter list. About 1,500 fraudulent voter registration cards were turned in.\n \n In October 2006, St. Louis election officials discovered at least 1,492 \"potentially fraudulent\" voter registration cards. They were all turned in by ACORN volunteers.\n \n In November 2006, 20,000 to 35,000 questionable voter registration forms were turned in by ACORN officials in Missouri. Most all of these were from St. Louis and Kansas City areas, where ACORN purportedly sought to help empower the \"disenfranchised\" minorities living there. But the ACORN workers weren't just told to register new voters. The workers admitted on camera that they were coached to tell registrants to vote for Democrat Claire McCaskill.\n \n In 2007, in Kansas City, Missouri, four ACORN employees were indicted for fraud. In April of this year eight ACORN employees in St. Louis city and county pleaded guilty to federal election fraud for submitting bogus voter registrations.\n \n And, that was just Missouri.\n \n North Carolina - State Board of Elections officials have found at least 100 voter registration forms with the same names over and over again. The forms were turned in by ACORN. Officials sent about 30 applications to the state Board of Elections for possible fraud investigation.\n \n Ohio - The New York Post reported that a Cleveland man said he was given cash and cigarettes by aggressive ACORN activists in exchange for registering an astonishing 72 times. The complaints have sparked an investigation by election officials into the organization, whose political wing has supported Barack Obama. Witnesses have already been subpoenaed to testify against the organization.\n \n Nevada - Authorities raided the headquarters of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now on Tuesday October 7, 2008, after a month-long investigation. The fraudulent voter registrations included the Dallas Cowboys starting line-up.\n \n Indiana - More than 2,000 voter registration forms filed in northern Indiana's Lake County filled out by ACORN employees turned out to be bogus. Officials also stopped processing a stack of about 5,000 applications delivered just before the October 6 registration deadline after the first 2,100 turned out to be phony.\n \n Connecticut - Officials are looking into a complaint alleging ACORN submitted fraudulent voter registration cards in Bridgeport. In one instance, an official said a card was filled out for a 7-year-old girl, whose age was listed as 27. 8,000 cards were submitted in Bridgeport.\n \n Missouri - The Kansas City election board is reporting 100 duplicate applications and 280 with fake information. Acorn officials agreed that at least 4% of their registrations were bogus. Governor Matt Blunt condemned the attempts by ACORN to commit voter fraud.\n \n Pennsylvania - Officials are investigating suspicious or incomplete registration forms submitted by ACORN. 252,595 voter registrations were submitted in Philadelphia. Remarkably, 57,435 were rejected - most of them submitted by ACORN.\n \n Wisconsin - In Milwaukee ACORN improperly used felons as registration workers. Additionally, its workers are among 49 cases of bad registrations sent to authorities for possible charges, as first reported by the Journal Sentinel.\n \n Florida - The Pinellas County Elections supervisor says his office has received around 35 voter registrations that appear to be bogus. There is also a question of 30,000 felons who are registered illegally to vote. Their connections with ACORN are not yet clear.\n \n Texas - Of the 30,000 registration cards ACORN turned in, Harris County tax assessor Paul Bettencourt says just more than 20,000 are valid. And just look at some of the places ACORN was finding those voters. A church just next door is the address for around 150 people. More than 250 people claim a homeless outreach center as their home address. Some listed a county mental health facility as their home and one person even wrote down the Harris County jail at the sheriff's office.\n \n Michigan - ACORN in Detroit is being investigated after several municipal clerks reported fraudulent and duplicate voter registration applications coming through. The clerk interviewed said the fraud appears to be widespread.\n \n New Mexico - The Bernalillo County clerk has notified prosecutors that some 1,100 fraudulent voter registration cards were turned in by ACORN.\"",

But while running down this outfit, they skipped town on their office space rent, and moved out of state (Nevada), and the CBS affiliate indicates that they might have moved their operation to Oregon.\n \n We also learn not too long ago, that Sproul & Associates, which is based out of AZ, was misrepresenting itself as being under contract with the legitimate nonpartisan group America Votes, while trying to get permission to do voter registration sign-ups in Southern Oregon libraries. A sharp librarian down in Medford double-checks with America Votes, and finds out that the Sproul group which had sent a letter to the public library seeking the permission, are not under contract or affiliated with the non-partisan group America Votes. It should also be noted that because of this, some confusion is circulating in the news media and conflating America Votes with the shady Sproul outfit.\n \n We now know that Sproul & Associates is a directly funded RNC consultancy firm.\n \n Then we learn that a \"traveling team\" hired signature gatherer is caught in downtown Portland's Pioneer Square, the night before Edwards is planned to hold a debate watching rally, refusing to register Democrats, and admits to throwing out forms filled out by people registering as such.\n\n Daily Kos: RNC TIED TO MULTI-STATE REGISTRATION FRAUD\n \n The doings in Nevada:\n \nInvestigation into Trashed Voter Registrations\n (Oct. 13, 2004) -- Federal, state, and local officials are gathering information about allegations of voter registration fraud that were first raised Channel 8 Eyewitness News.\n \n An employee of a private voter registration firm alleges that his bosses trashed registration forms filled out by Democratic voters because they only wanted to sign up Republican voters.\n \n The allegations have set off a political firestorm stretching from Las Vegas to Washington D.C., and beyond. \n\n http://www.klas-tv.com/Global/story.asp",

   "On Oct. 7, Nevada authorities raided the Las Vegas offices off the community group ACORN - Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now - on allegations that the group submitted fraudulent voter registration cards. , featuring nonexistent addresses, duplicate applicants and in at least some cases, the names of the Dallas Cowboys football team. The McCain campaign has also released an ad linking Barack Obama to ACORN, reiterating the voter fraud allegations and claiming the organization \"forced banks to issue risky home loans, the same types of loans that caused the financial crisis we're in today.\"\n \n ACORN was founded by community organizer Wade Rathke in 1970, in Little Rock, Arkansas. Rathke, who had worked as an organizer for the National Welfare Rights Organization in Missouri, wanted to start a group that worked with an entire community, not just welfare recipients. The early version of ACORN helped people obtain clothing and furniture; it campaigned for schools to provide healthy, affordable lunches and promoted Vietnam Veterans' rights. Since then the organization has branched out into housing and workers' rights advocacy; it has helped hundreds of thousands of working-class and poor citizens obtain home loans, register to vote and fight for better wages. The Arkansas-based organization now has hundreds of affiliates in 41 states and claims to have registered 1.3 million people to vote in the 2008 election. Although the group is technically nonpartisan, its registration drives focus on impoverished minorities, most of whom are likely to vote Democratic, and the organization regularly endorses Democratic political candidates, including Barack Obama.\n \n ACORN has been involved in politics since 1972, when it endorsed two of its members running for the Little Rock School Board. Over the next few years, the group expanded its ambitions beyond Arkansas - opening its first multi-state offices in Texas and South Dakota - and into national politics.\n \n ACORN has also been plagued with a long series of lawsuits and scandals:\n \n \u0095 In 1995, it unsuccessfully sued the state of California, claiming that it should be exempted from minimum wage laws because paying its workers more would require the group to reduce headcount and would make its workers less sympathetic to the poor. (ACORN publicly supports the living wage and has led coalitions to win minimum wage increases in several states.)\n \n \u0095 In 1999 and 2000, Dale Rathke, Wade's brother, embezzled almost $1 million from ACORN and affiliated organizations. When his actions were discovered, the Rathke family agreed to pay the money back, but ACORN didn't alert members of its board or law enforcement; Dale Rathke remained on the company's payroll until June 2008 when the news of his wrongdoing came out. Wade Rathke resigned from his post, although he remains chief organizer for ACORN International.\n \n \u0095 In 1998, an Arkansas employee was arrested for falsifying voter registration forms. A year later, Philadelphia authorities flagged hundreds of registration forms, alleging that they were all written by the same person. In 2007, more than 2,000 fraudulent voter registration cards were submitted in Washington; three ACORN employees pleaded guilty to the crime.\n \n In addition to the Nevada raid, voter registration drives in several other states have been scrutinized, while the group's campaigns to demand fair housing loan practices has opened it up to charges that it advocated risky subprime mortgages. On its website, ACORN has called the allegations of voter fraud \"bogus\" and \"unfounded.\" The organization says it works with authorities and identifies all the fraudulent forms that it can, and that the campaign against its registration drives is a ploy to \"disparage our work and help maintain the status quo of an unbalanced electorate.\"\n \n The Democratic candidate's connections to ACORN are fairly well documented, and the group's field of endeavor - community organizing - makes it a tempting target for GOP strategists. In Chicago in 1992, Obama headed the Project Vote campaign - an organization affiliated with ACORN - which registered 150,000 voters on the city's the south side and helped elect Carol Moseley Braun, the country's first female African-American Senator. As an attorney, Obama worked on the team of lawyers that represented ACORN in a 1995 lawsuit in which it accused the state of Illinois of violating federal polling laws, and spoke at two leadership training sessions for ACORN employees a few years later. In February, the Obama campaign paid $800,000 to Citizen Services Inc. - a consulting firm affiliated with ACORN - for what the New York Times called \"get-out-the-vote efforts\", and erroneously reported it on campaign filings. It's interesting to note that John McCain has connections to ACORN as well; he was the keynote speaker at a 2006 rally co-sponsored by the organization, to build support for a comprehensive immigration reform bill that he co-sponsored with Sen. Edward Kennedy.",

   "Grain Valley, MO - On April Fools Day, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) accused the MoCRI of \"fraud,\" trying to play the media and Missouri voters for fools while knowing full well their own employees had plead guilty to voter fraud. It's true; federal prosecutors announced eight ACORN employee convictions the very next day. St. Louis election officials have said they have had problems with ACORN submissions in past years.\n \n \"How can anyone take accusations seriously from a group that has a record of election fraud, not only in Missouri but around the nation?\" asks Tim Asher, Executive Director of the Missouri Civil Rights Initiative. \"ACORN workers have been convicted of election fraud. By accusing MoCRI of like behavior they are hoping to divert attention away from their own record. If they repeat the lie accusing MoCRI behaving like ACORN long enough and loud enough, they hope the truth will be obscured.\"\n \n \"We know ACORN has hired workers to harass and intimidate pedestrians attempting to sign the MoCRI petition, they have admitted it on video,\" Asher said. Reports of verbal abuse and theft of petitions containing voter signatures by ACORN employees have been cited by MoCRI petitioners in and around the St. Louis and Kansas City metropolitan areas. Police reports have been filed. \"I wonder if these ACORN employees are willing to go to jail for ACORN as their predecessors have done,\" Asher mused.\n \n The Missouri Civil Rights Initiative is currently collecting signatures statewide to place a ballot initiative before the people in November that would put an end to race preferences in the public sector. Similar initiatives have passed in every state where they have made the ballot. MoCRI organizers, and more importantly the opposition, believe the measure will pass in Missouri as well and this explains the heavy-handed tactics by the opposition to keep it off the ballot.\n \n The Missouri Civil Rights Initiative Committee (MoCRI), a Missouri-based ballot initiative committee, is dedicated to providing the people of Missouri the opportunity to end discrimination and preferential treatment based on race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin by state or local governments. MoCRI will make Missouri a place of equal opportunity for all, not a state that uses discrimination as a tool to create \"diversity.\" Achieving \"diversity\" should never be an excuse to discriminate!",

   "Dates? Citations?\n\n \n \n\n Three plead guilty in fake voter scheme\n Three of seven defendants in the biggest voter-registration fraud scheme in Washington history have pleaded guilty and one has been sentenced...\n \n By Keith Ervin\n \n Seattle Times staff reporter\n \n Californian pleads not guilty in voter-registration-fraud case \n Three of seven defendants in the biggest voter-registration fraud scheme in Washington history have pleaded guilty and one has been sentenced, prosecutors said Monday.\n \n The defendants were all temporary employees of ACORN, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, when they allegedly filled out and submitted more than 1,800 fictitious voter-registration cards during a 2006 registration drive in King and Pierce counties.\n Local News | Three plead guilty in fake voter scheme | Seattle Times Newspaper \n\n \n A special investigation was held in Wisconsin \n http://media2.620wtmj.com/breakingnews/ElectionResults_2004_VoterFraudInvestigation_MPD-SIU-A2474926.pdf \n in which they found widespread fraud in registration, voting, following polling place rules, etc., but they admitted that prosecutions were difficult because Milwaukee kept such poor records in the first place.\n \n \n\n Fake names get voter registration workers investigated\n By LARRY SANDLER \n \n Posted: Aug. 7, 2008\n Criminal investigations could be launched against at least six voter registration workers who tried to add dead, imprisoned or imaginary people to the voter rolls, according to the Milwaukee Election Commission and the organization that employed them.\n \n Officials are reviewing some 200 to 300 fraudulent voter registration cards, Sue Edman, the commission's executive director, said Wednesday.\n \n And even though the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now caught the fraud and reported it before the cards were turned in, the incident revived a four-year-old partisan debate over the integrity of Wisconsin's voter registration process, as political groups step up efforts to sign up voters for the Nov. 4 presidential election.\n \n \"One woman called us to complain because her husband has been dead for 10 years and a voter registration was submitted,\" Edman said.\n \n In about 12 cases, deputy registrars paid by ACORN were \"making people up or registering people that were still in prison,\" said Carolyn Castore, ACORN's state political director.\n \n And in other cases, workers used the same address for numerous voters or used driver's license numbers that did not fit the voters' birth dates, Edman said. But most of the fraud involved submitting duplicate cards for voters who were already registered, and forging the voters' signatures, Castore said.\n \n ACORN found the problems and fired a dozen workers, Castore said. Five of them appeared to be working together, she added.\n Fake names get voter registration workers investigated - JSOnline \n\n \n In this instance, ACORN fired 12 workers caught committing fraud.",
