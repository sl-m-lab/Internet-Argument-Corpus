   "GOP fires another shot at Kerry's boat \n Sunday, August 08, 2004 \n DAVID SARASOHN \n J im Rassmann has been a Green Beret in Vietnam, a 20-year detective for the Los Angeles County Sheriff, and now an Oregon retiree campaigning with John Kerry, whom he credits with saving his life under fire on the Mekong River. \n \n He keeps getting new experiences. \n \n \"Coming back from the convention,\" Rassmann marvels, \"for the first time in my life I've been called a traitor to my country.\" \n Rassmann is a collateral casualty in last week's assault on Kerry's Vietnam record by Swift boat veterans who never served on his boat, but insisted that Kerry's, and the Navy's, account of his Vietnam service is a lie. The group is led by a veteran who has attacked Kerry since being chosen by the Nixon administration to do so, is financed by a major Houston Republican contributor, and uses a public relations consultant who previously worked on a similar campaign against Sen. John McCain -- oddly, when McCain was running against George W. Bush in the 2000 South Carolina primary. \n \n ... \n \n Spokesman John O'Neill, who's been attacking Kerry since 1971, was quoted on a right-wing Web site as saying the real point wasn't the story of Kerry's medals but his opposition to the war when he returned home, when he \"grossly and knowingly distorted the conduct of the American soldiers, Marines, sailors and airmen of that war\" by saying American troops had committed war crimes. \n \n On the other hand, Gen. Tommy Franks recently said about Kerry's 1971 comments, \"He was a young officer over there, and I'm not sure that -- that activities like that didn't take place. In fact, quite the contrary. I'm sure that they did take place.\" \n \n Snip\n \n http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/david_sarasohn/index.ssf?/base/editorial/1091880140213030.xml",

O'Neill is still nursing a grudge from this debate. \n The people who say they served \"on Kerry's boat\" are talking about the nautical vessel itself.

That has been proven in many posts. So that is not being hypocritical. If the Swift Boat Vets are in fact true, they have all the right in the world to put out an ad like they are doing now. Moveon.org is pure propaganda. They have links on there to fire Rumsfeld and censure Bush. They also have a link that says \"Communists have Pravda. Republicans have FOX.\" Fox is not a Republican TV show. They have some programs that are more right wing than others, but then they have some that are more left wing than others. O'Reilly is more right wing, On the Record with Greta is more left wing, and Hannity and Colmes has a bit of both. Moveon.org even explain what their function is...\"Our nationwide network of more than 2,000,000 online activists is one of the most effective and responsive outlets for democratic participation available today.\" So, as you can see, Moveon.org is about as partisan as it gets. FOX at least caters to all audiences. Once again, propaganda. Explain to me how I was hypocritical? I simply said Moore's lies and propaganda and Moveon.org's propaganda were extremely partisan. I never said the Swift Boat Vets were telling the truth or lying; I said they deserve the right to say what they saw in Vietnam until someone proves all 60+ of them wrong. I proved many of Moore's statements wrong, and proved many of Moveon.org's statements as lies. So until the Swift Boat Vets ads are proven to be lies, I am by no means being hypocritical. I said if you make an ad, it should at least be true. So far, I have seen nothing showing me that they are lying.",

I read your Kerry/Edwards links and found them nothing more than noble sounding statements that we need to change, with some lofty goals but no specific answers. Kerry's suggestion of a stronger military seems to go against his record of support for the military. Kerry's suggestion that a regime change in Iraq was Bush's goal is misleading. It was Clinton's goal, too. If Bush has failed to make his case for the rationale of starting the war, why did Kerry vote to grant him the power to do so? Kerry seems to suggest several costly increases in foreign aid...where will the money come from other than taxes?\n \n Now it's your turn to read.\n \n Here's what Kerry did for the CIA.\n August 08, 2004\n The CIA's Plaster Disaster: How Kerry Crippled Intelligence\n The CIA's Plaster Disaster: How Kerry Crippled Intelligence \n by Karen H. Pittman \n \u00a9 July 9, 2004 \n \n Victims. That's what we've become, a society of victims. \n \n But when we wallow in victim hood, we deny natural law. We shun nature. We reject the simple truth of cause and effect. But we do so at our peril. \n \n Consider the current brouhaha over the intelligence failures preceding 9/11 and leading up to the war in Iraq. (Case in point: If we blame the CIA, we--we who voted the CIA-degraders into office--cleverly sidestep taking responsibility. Thus we anoint ourselves victims. How convenient. How conscience-salving.) \n \n Here's how the tortuous illogic goes: \n \n First, we strip the CIA buck-naked, and then say, \"Why weren't you wearing your clothes?\" \n \n Next, we build a wall between the CIA and FBI, and then say, \"Why weren't you guys talking?\" \n \n And when the CIA is embarrassed by its nakedness; when the FBI is caught hunkering down behind that wall; when those inevitable chickens come home to roost, whom do we blame? \n \n Do we blame ourselves? Do we blame the people who took the CIA's clothes off and who laid that wall brick by brick in the first place? Do we blame the legislators, like John Kerry, who--in the nineties, under Clinton--hamstrung the CIA by eviscerating its human intelligence-gathering capabilities (which now must be painfully and painstakingly rebuilt, even as the wall between that agency and the FBI is being loudly torn down)? \n \n No. We blame the people who were working on the day when the system--which the strippers and separators by their actions flawed--\"failed.\" \n \n Let's say you're a craftsman and your specialty is plaster. Let's say, for whatever reasons, you can only get your plaster from one source--and that source has decided to water down your product. (The manufacturer says it's cheaper, more profitable, and possibly more humane to the production workers because the process requires fewer chemicals.) \n \n The point is: When you water down plaster, you get mud. Your plaster is now undeniably weak. It ain't what it used to be. It might now make a hut, whereas in the past it would have made a castle. \n \n But you don&#8217;t have any choice: It&#8217;s all you&#8217;ve got to work with. So you dab it on anyway, hoping against hope nobody will notice. And the whole time your hands are tied because you can&#8217;t get the kind of plaster you really need to do the job right. Nobody makes it. You aren&#8217;t allowed to use it. It&#8217;s illegal. (Remember, it contains &#8220;potentially&#8221; harmful additives. It might give offense.) \n \n And so you apply your flimsy film, layer by layer. But over time the cracks begin to show. The cheap plaster degrades and starts to craze. Eventually, the entire structure crumbles. \n \n Now, who's responsible, you or the plaster manufacturer? Who do you think John Edwards would hold accountable in a court of law--you, \"the little plaster worker,\" or the big corporate mill who decided for you how the plaster would be made, ad which (not irrelevantly) had a monopoly on its design and manufacture? Whom do you think he would sue for those huge horty-torty damages? \n \n I rest my case. \n \n The question before us is simple: Having made obviously wrong choices in the nineties, will we make them again, in 2004? Having seen close-up the consequences of those choices, are we brazen--are we foolish--enough to take the chance? \n \n And if we are, and if those choices turn out to be wrong--dead wrong, yet again--will all the excuses and defenses in our psychic arsenal ever be enough to grease our collective guilt? Will any commission or panel answer the fury of grief? Will our victim hood help us then? \n \n Knowing all we know now, are we really going to vote the very man who was one of the principal drafters of the CIA&#8217;s Plaster Disaster into this nation&#8217;s highest office on November the 2nd? \n \n If we do, then we had better not wail in five, ten, or twenty years when the sticky (stinky) stuff hits the fan. We had better not whine about how \"miserably\" the CIA and FBI \"failed.\" It is we who failed. We failed ourselves--miserably. And for God's sake, whatever we do, we've got some nerve if we blame the poor stiff who happens to be on watch, as President, when the big one strikes. \n \n Please. The people who work for the CIA aren't XXXXXX. They didn't \"fail.\" They weren't allowed to succeed! Their tools were taken away! Their plaster was watered down. \n \n By whom? By the XXXXXX in Congress, that's who. XXXXXX like John Kerry.  \n \n I'm tempted to say the people who elected these XXXXXX are XXXXXX, too. But they can be forgiven for their transgressions--if they don&#8217;t repeat them. Anybody can make a mistake or misjudgment once. But if you make the same mistake twice . . . well, you're the one at fault, then. You get the government you deserve. The next time the planes hit, don't act shocked and appalled. Don't caterwaul to the heavens as if you hadn't a clue, \"How on earth did this happen? Why do they hate us?\" \n \n If the American electorate does it again--if it votes Democrat while talking Republican (\"We need a strong defense and reliable intelligence!\")--then this time it can't be forgiven. And--in the face of such naked inanity--we as a people will have no choice: We&#8217;ll have to call a spade a spade. We&#8217;ll have to admit we&#8217;re XXXXXX. \n \n Michael Moore knows this. He knows we're gullible. (Actually, his word for it is \"stupid.\") He knows he can make us believe a silk purse is a sow's ear--just by saying so, often enough and loud enough, on film. (Ah, you see, for the unwashed rabble, the image is the key: Put it on [M]TV!) \n \n Well, when you get what you wanted all along, don't bitch about it when it turns out not to be everything you thought it was going to be! \n \n Today we're suffering the consequences of poor governance. On 9/11 we paid in blood for the bad choices made under Carter and Clinton, with their encouragement. Kerry personally yanked the pants off the CIA.  And now he wants you to absolve him. He wants you to pretend you didn&#8217;t see him do it. He wants you to believe it was Bush who undid the belt. No: He wants more than that. He wants you to make believe it was Bush who undid the belt--even if you know better (as does he, as does Edwards, as does Moore). \n \n And he wants you to get rid of Bush, who is outfitting the CIA as never before, so he can yank its pants off all over again! But he will do this only after a respectable period of time has passed. You see, he must first make you believe he really wants the CIA fully clothed. Then, when your defenses are down, when you aren't looking, down come the pants again, too! \n \n People, get a clue! In a democracy, the government you get is the one you earn. If we go back on Bush now, we go back to the era that brought us 9/11. We then set in motion the next 9/11. \n \n Actions have consequences. No matter how good a trial lawyer you are, no matter how persuasive your argument, you cannot alter this immutable law of nature. As night follows day, effect follows cause. You vote for Clinton and Kerry, you get a stripped-down CIA. You get a stripped-down CIA, you get 9/11. You get 9/11; you get exaggerated data about WMD. You water down plaster, you get mud. Go figure. \n \n We are not victims. We make choices, and then we live--or die--with the consequences of those choices. \n \n You have a choice to make. You can, if you choose, choose change. Or you can choose the path of least resistance. You can choose stasis. You can choose to take us back down the same dead-end road that got us here. \n \n It's up to you. All I can say is: If you get in Kerry's car and you end up upside-down in a ditch, don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn you. And this time, you've forfeited your right to whine. &#9642;\n \n TO DISCUSS VISIT WWW.STARRJOURNAL.COM/FORUMS/\n \n Posted by Karen H Pittman at August 8, 2004 09:51 AM \n \n \n \n \n I agree with some of the things Kerry and Edwards say we need to establish as goals, but I do not see in their history where they have done much in those directions.

   "Kerry on intelligence\n Robert Novak (archive)\n \n \n June 10, 2004 \n \n \n WASHINGTON -- Under attack by Republicans for proposing deep cuts in the intelligence budget a decade ago, John Kerry is trying to justify them as efforts to slice away pork. The problem is that during the Senate debate on Feb. 19, 1994, Kerry was taken to task by two pillars of the then Democratic majority: Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Daniel Inouye of Hawaii.\n \n DeConcini, the Intelligence Committee chairman, and Inouye, the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee chairman, assailed Kerry's unsuccessful efforts to cut the intelligence budget. DeConcini calculated it would cost $1 billion in intelligence spending that year and $5 billion over the next five years. Both senators suggested Kerry did not recognize the dangers existing then after the first terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. In opposing Kerry's amendment, DeConcini declared, \"We no longer seem immune from acts of terrorism in the United States.\" Inouye asked: \"Is this the time to cut the satellite programs that give our forces warning of attacks?\"\n \n Since George W. Bush's re-election campaign has made this dispute an issue, Sen. Kerry has faced a choice. He could admit an error in past judgment, which is never easy or perhaps prudent for a presidential candidate. Or, he could defend what seems a politically vulnerable position. Kerry has taken the latter course. When this column asked about Kerry's past position this week, campaign spokesman Chad Clanton replied: \"You bet, John Kerry voted against business as usual in our intelligence community. It is no secret that we've got some serious problems with our intelligence.\"\n \n The issue, first raised by Bush in March, has been revived by published accusations that the president's campaign has distorted the senator's record. This is a question worth exploring because it addresses Kerry's judgment as an experienced public servant. His unfortunate charges of American war crimes in Vietnam can be excused as the excesses of an angry 27-year-old war veteran. In 1994, he was 50 years old with 10 years experience as a U.S. senator and was a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n \n The defense by the campaign is that Kerry's proposed intelligence cuts were aimed at what \"was essentially a slush fund for defense contractors.\" Clanton added: \"Unlike George Bush, John Kerry does not support every special spending project supported by Halliburton and other defense contractors.\" \n \n While the Kerry campaign suggests the senator somehow foretold the 1995 \"slush fund\" scandal over the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) hoarding $1 billion in unspent funds, he never mentioned the NRO in 1994. His amendment, offered without co-sponsors, would have cut intelligence across the board.\n \n In the floor debate, DeConcini said his committee had pruned the intelligence budget by $1.2 billion for that fiscal year, and that is \"as deep as the intelligence community can withstand.\" He added \"it makes no sense for us to close our eyes to developments around the world.\" Noting imminent bombing in the Balkans, Inouye warned \"we are putting blindfolds over our pilots' eyes.\"\n \n In the debate, Kerry did not respond to criticism from DeConcini and Inouye. He did not address intelligence specifically, much less single out pork barrel projects in the intelligence budget that his campaign now says he was targeting. However, 10 days earlier on the Senate floor, Kerry declared: \"The madness must end.\"\n \n Kerry's amendment failed 75 to 20 -- opposed by his Massachusetts colleague, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy; a future Intelligence Committee chairman, Sen. Bob Graham of Florida; and the Appropriations Committee chairman, Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia.\n \n The senator is described by campaign aides as attempting to restore human intelligence to learn about terrorism, drug trafficking and international crime. But at an Intelligence Committee meeting in 1995, Kerry asked \"whether we should use paid clandestine human assets in situations where the ramifications of discovery are so great and the risk of U.S. security is so minimal.\"\n \n Such suspicion of human intelligence had been the liberal line since the early 1970s, grinding down CIA assets. Indeed, Kerry's assault on intelligence spending had been urged by liberals for the past quarter of a century. The presidential candidate now attempts to rationalize his past conduct rather than repudiate it.\n \n \n \n \u00a92004 Creators Syndicate, Inc.",

Kerry brought this upon himself. One of the main focuses of the DNC was his time spent in Vietnam. They made a whole movie about it. NOT ONCE did Kerry mention his 20+ years in the Senate. That tells me that he relies more on his past experiences in Vietnam than he does his time as a Senator (which, to me, is much more relevant to what his duties as Commander in Chief will be). It is the same as if he made the cornerstone of his speech lowering taxes. People would come out with ads (like they are now) that criticize his voting record. It is the same with Vietnam. He made it an issue. I am sure nothing would have came up if he didn't make that the focal point of the convention. If he has lied about something that is the basis of his platform, why should we believe what he says he will do if he becomes President? If he is in fact lying and ends up winning, he will have misled millions of Americans into voting for him. Apparently George W. Bush's qualifications were good enough, because he won. You don't have to have served in the military to be a good President. And Bush didn't come out with a video at the RNC in 2000 spouting out about his time in the Air National Guard. And your comment that Bush didn't leave the US makes absolutely no sense. Who cares? He doesn't rely on his military service to get votes. Clinton dodged the war. Why did people vote for him? I agree that Kerry should get respect for going to Vietnam. So you're going to vote for him because he went to Vietnam?

He talked about a combat situation on Christmas Eve 1968 which at one point he said occurred in Cambodia. He has since corrected the recorded to say it was some place on a river near Cambodia and he is certain that at some point subsequent to that he was in Cambodia. My understanding is that he is not certain about that date.\"\n \n http://www.washingtondispatch.com/page2/archives/000480.html\n \n \n \"He did not spend Christmas 1968 in Cambodia. Until very recently, he said he did; in fact, he described it as an incident that was \"seared\" in his memory and induced a psychological turning point that changed the way he viewed his country and the war.\"\n \n http://www.fortwayne.com/mld/newssentinel/news/editorial/9394046.htm\n \n That shows me he is lying about it. If it was seared in his memory, you would think he would know that he wasn't in Cambodia. But in the source above, he said he has a \"mistaken recollection\". Which one is it, it was seared in his mind or it wasn't?\n \n \n \n \"In an Oct. 14, 1979, letter to the editor of the Boston Herald, Kerry wrote: \"I remember spending Christmas Eve of 1968 five miles across the Cambodian border being shot at by our South Vietnamese allies who were drunk and celebrating Christmas. The absurdity of almost being killed by our own allies in a country in which President Nixon claimed there were no American troops was very real.\"\n \n Kerry, a senator from Massachusetts, also talked about his experience during a speech on the Senate floor on March 27, 1986.\n \n \"I remember Christmas of 1968 sitting on a gunboat in Cambodia. I remember what it was like to be shot at by Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge and Cambodians, and have the president of the United States telling the American people that I was not there; the troops were not in Cambodia,\" Kerry said.\n \n The Kerry campaign first asserted that the Massachusetts senator never said that he was in Cambodia, only that he was near the country. But when presented with a copy of the Congressional Record and asked about Kerry's letter in the Boston Herald, the campaign said it would come up with an explanation. After repeated phone calls, there was still no clarification.\"\n \n \n Looks like they needed time to make up a lie or send out more threatening letters to TV stations that were playing the ads. emoticon_xbouncer \n \n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,128561,00.html\n \n \n \n \n \nAnd since you hold such great stock in admiting when you're wrong, I don't suppose you have anything to say about Clinton dodging the draft, do you?

Schachte berated Kerry for almost putting someone's eye out. \n There was no hostile fire of any kind, nor did Kerry on the way back mention to OinC Mike Voss, who commanded the PCF that towed the skimmer, that he was wounded.  \n There was no report of hostile fire that day (as would be required), nor do the records at Cam Ranh Bay reveal such hostile fire. No other records reflect hostile fire. There is no casualty report, as would have been required had there actually been a casualty.  \n To the surprise of both Schachte and the treating doctor, Louis Letson, Kerry managed to keep the tiny hanging fragment barely embedded in his arm until he arrived at sick bay miles away. Kerry was examined by Letson, who never has forgotten the experience and related it to his Democratic county chairman early in the 2004 primary campaign. \n Letson, observing Kerry's unimpressive scratch, asked in surprise, \"Why are you here?\" \n Kerry answered, \"I've been wounded by hostile fire.\" \n Accompanying crewmen told Letson that Kerry had wounded himself.  Letson used tweezers to remove the tiny fragment, which he identified as shrapnel like that from an M-79 (not from a rifle bullet), and put a small bandage on Kerry's arm. \n The following morning, Kerry appeared at the office of Cmdr. Hibbard and applied for the Purple Heart. Hibbard turned down the award.\"",

He constantly reviewed tactics and lessons learned in river operations and applied his experience at every opportunity. On one occasion, while in tactical command of a three boat operation his units were taken under fire from ambush. LTJG Kerry rapidly assessed the situation and ordered his units to turn directly into the ambush. This decision resulted in routing the attackers with several KIA. LTJG Kerry emerges as the acknowledged leader in his peer group. His bearing and appearance are above reproach.
