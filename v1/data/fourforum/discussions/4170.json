If the material that everything is made of was always there, why couldn't God have always been there?\n\n \n I'll reverse your question. If God was always there, why is it so hard of you to believe that the material was always somewhere (which isn't true about the big bang). You use what other people believe and say it's no more far-fetched as what you believe, so why don't we believe you. What about the other way around? Anyway, I would just realize that there's no real proof for any of that since the concept of time not existing or something existing forever is beyond our comprehension. So I just live my life as I feel like and not according to a God that may or may not exist and I don't base my life on the fact that there was a big bang.",

If the material that everything is made of was always there, why couldn't God have always been there?\n\n \n 1. This is a good question, and it can be solved through occam's razor. We know the universe exists, and we don't know that God exists. God is a metaphysical, unfalsifiable entity. Since we know the Universe exists and that God (might or might not), he's an unnecessary entity in explaining the process of the natural universe, therefore we shave him away.\n \n 2. What remains is what's observable, testable, falsifiable--what's natural and non-metaphysical. Even if God does exist, there's no reason to say he does or that he \"created\" the universe or was \"eternal\" alongside the universe, because it's an unnecessary factor.",

They don't \"age\" because they are doing all there travelling in the 3 spatial dimensions. Matter does its travelling in all 4 dimensions of spacetime. We are all travelling at the \"speed limit\" of the universe (or is it just the speed at which everything 'travels'?) if you want to think of this as light speed, then that's fine. So you, me, and this computer are travelling at the same speed as light, except we are doing it mostly in the time dimension (relative to our surroundings). If we start speeding up in any of the other dimensions our 'time' slows down, something has to give. So when you say something is 'outside of time' you have to say that it's outside of spacetime, or outside our universe.\n \n This really belongs in the science and math forum.\n \n edit:\n So, I'm a dumbass for saying that outside of time meant outside the universe, since light is outside of time. anyway...",
