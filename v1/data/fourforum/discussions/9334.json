   "Another commonly cited reason for residential appreciation is the impact of baby boomers reaching their peak earning years, and subsequently' investing' in residential real estate. The holes in this theory are countless, so I'll point out just the most obvious few.\n \n Why would anybody invest in new, expensive, single-family homes? There is no rental market for these homes because rental income would be a fraction of the amortizing mortgage payments. Rental homes are by definition lower-quality properties in older neighborhoods.\n \n Why would anybody invest in rental properties when rental vacancies and homeownership have both reached record highs? Most of the renters are now homeowners, so investing in rental properties would not be wise at this time.\n \n I've seen the following 'fact' cited numerous times. \"Baby boomers are buying second (vacation) homes.\" Wow, I had no idea baby boomers wanted to spend their holidays in 4,000 square foot McMansions in the middle of ugly, urban sprawl. Whoever invented this theory should be embarrassed.\n \n Baby boomers should be collectively outraged because the bubble supporters are making the boomers look like fools.\n \n Or maybe there is something to this theory after all. Maybe boomers are speculating in residential real estate. What are the odds? Of course they are, just like all the other speculators, and they will get burned as badly.\n \n Jeff\n \n http://home-economics-us.blogspot.com",

Rental homes are by definition lower-quality properties in older neighborhoods.\n\n \n That is what puts the air in the bubble. They are investing in these homes because the value has been going up. Mc Mansions make poor rental properties. I did just unload the very last of my residential investment properties. The last crop consisted of 4 McMansions that I bought to lease to Sprint in kansas city. They put transplants in them until they could find places of thier own. That was a pretty good deal. When I bought them, I had a residential construction company that built them, so I gave myself one hell fo a deal :) . The lease was enough to provide significant positive cash flow, and Sprints maintenance department handled all maintenance. I actually had the lease in hand before I bought them, so it was a no loose. \n \n \nWhy would anybody invest in rental properties when rental vacancies and homeownership have both reached record highs? Most of the renters are now homeowners, so investing in rental properties would not be wise at this time.\n\n \n A lot of those renters turned homeowners are the ones who drove up the nontraditional loan and liars loans numbers. Conventional wisdom was \"buy now or you are loosing out and may not be able to buy later\". This led to a lot of people making extremely poor home purchase decisions. \n \n \nI've seen the following 'fact' cited numerous times. \"Baby boomers are buying second (vacation) homes.\" Wow, I had no idea baby boomers wanted to spend their holidays in 4,000 square foot McMansions in the middle of ugly, urban sprawl.

I ahve always quesitoned the whoel \"vacation property\" thing. If there was a boom in cabins in colorado, or beach houses in florida, that may be a good explanation. What has been pushing the market, though, is the cardboard and presswood garbage they put up in tract housing projects. These are NOT vacation proerties! A new subdiision in Kansas City looks pretty mcuh just like a new subdivision in Houston, or Denver, or Vegas. Nobody is going to buy a McMansion to vacation in!",
