   "(FYI, this post is a reply in a discussion that began over on the gay rights threads. Topically, it's more appropriate here. Anyone who's interested, feel free to join in. By forewarned: This is very long.)\n \n Okay, Archie, here we go. In response to my non-literalism, you said:\n \n \n: Then you are calling God and His word a liar.\n\n \n I replied:\n \n \nThat would follow only if I believed that the Bible was an infallible transcript of God's words. Which I don't. It's a fallible text written by human beings attempting to express their transcendent religious beliefs and feelings and experiences. So when I think something in the Bible is erroneous or egregious, I don't blame God but men.\n \n I just don't think of the Bible the same way that you do. I think your way is unjustifiable, and that it has pernicious practical consequences, as well.\n\n \n And now you reply:\n \n \nYou really don't see the error of your rationale do you? You seem to think that because you reject the absolute truth of the bible as Gods word, as do all of the atheists and secular humanists on this forum, I might add, that that somehow exonerates you from being held responsible for rejecting those truths.\n\n \n First, I don't reject the truths that the Bible expresses, e.g. concerning the relation of man to God. I reject the notion that the Biblical stories that express those truths are themselves true, that they are factually accurate descriptions of real events.\n \n I realize that you don't think one can gain the one sort of truth without the other. But as that is precisely the idea that I am challenging, you can't just appeal to it as if it were somehow a refutation of my challenge. Because that makes me wrong merely for having disagreed in the first place. I accept the possibility that I may be wrong and you right. Now explain to me why I am wrong, instead of just repeating precisely the point at issue.\n \n Second, I seek to evade no responsibility for holding the views that I hold. By my lights, I have no need to.\n \n Third, I have no problem with agreeing with atheists about some things. I disagree with them about others. But many atheists I've known display far better moral character and intellectual integrity than unfortunately many professed Christians I've also known. So if you think saying that I share something in common with them is going to give me pause, think again.\n \n \nIn other words, if I pointed to the Sun as the Earths source of heat and light and you said you didn't accept that as an explanation, would that mean that the Sun as I explained it ceased to exist and you were innocent of not believing in it? Of course not.\n\n \n Indeed it would not. But would that make me a liar?!? or just mistaken?\n \n Or do you really think that honest mistakes are impossible? Is all cognitive error sinful?\n \n \nYour denial does nothing to change the reality of the situation from Gods perspective so your rejection of the truth of Gods word as HIS word being absolute truth is calling Him and His word a liar.\n\n \n Okay, first of all, I am in full agreement that what I think is incapable of altering reality.\n \n But what I'm really curious about is this: On what grounds do you appeal to \"God's perspective?!?\" You see, I believe that, as a finite and fallible human being, I cannot reasonably claim to occupy or even well-understand the perspective of God. Indeed, your suggestion strikes me as monumentally hubristic.\n \n \nI also must ask you to tell me, in your opinion, what differentiates you from the atheists and secular humanists on this forum who have the same exact opinion of Gods word as you do? As a so called christian, what separates you from them at all?\n\n \n Oh, puh-leeze! I believe in God. Atheists don't. It's very simple.\n \n For good measure, let me add that I also accept Jesus Christ as my Savior. And I find enormous value in the Scriptures, spiritually and morally. And I find spiritual and personal fulfillment participating in the religious practices of my chosen community. Atheists tend not to do these things. So you see, it can hardly be said that atheists have \"the same exact opinion as I do\" of the value of God's word.\n \n Now then. I shall thank you to refrain from describing me as a \"so-called Christian\" ever again. Disagree with me all you like, criticize me all you like. But despite our differences, I have not impugned your motives or maligned the honesty of your convictions. Please kindly return the favor.\n \n \nThe answer from my perspective is nothing at all.\n\n \n Wrong-o. See above.\n \n \nMaybe you can correct me, though I seriously doubt it.\n\n \n I have my doubts, too, though for different reasons, of course.\n \n \nSo you can claim to be debating me from a christian perspective, but you are no different than the unbelievers whom you identify with.\n\n \n See above for my take on this baseless charge of dishonesty, and for my request that it not be repeated.\n \n \n \n [Me]: And let me add that I'm not even calling the Bible's human authors \"liars\" necessarily. I don't have any reason to doubt their sincerity. But in some cases, I have reason to doubt their accuracy or their rectitude.\n \n [You]: How very liberal of you.\n\n \n So let me get something straight. In order for me to think someone has made a mistake, must I regard them as dishonest? And have \"liberals\" cornered the market on thinking not?\n \n \n: So let me get this right. The bible calls itself Gods word through out it. It claims to be His authoritative message to guide Humanity in all of His ways. But just because the human writers who actually wrote those assurances, according to you were sincere in making these inaccurate, misleading and incorrect statements, you will generously say they're not lying, but just that you doubt their accuracy?\n\n \n That's right. There are only a handful of isolated passages where infallibility is claimed for words recorded in the Bible, and as those claims were made by fallible human beings, I don't see any need to ascribe them much weight.\n \n Why such errors must mean that the men who make them are lying escapes me. You, for example, seem to think there's no possibility you're wrong about what the Bible means. I think you're quite mistaken about that. But that doesn't make you dishonest, just wrong.\n \n \nAnd you can't see that if you're right about that statement, then the bible has no authority at all as it claims to have? Which means that you have completely dethroned God as the Lord of your life as a christian by denying that the bible He says is His word, is actually His word. In other words, you have still called Him a lair.\n\n \n Tiresome. You need to distinguish between denying authority to the Bible and denying it to God. The Bible is not God. I am willing to grant that it is God's word, but it is God's word as understood and expressed by fallible human beings, who don't magically become immune to error just because they believe they are.\n \n \n[Me:]First of all, I don't see the \"for the sake of procreation\" appearing anywhere in the three verses you've quoted. Apparently your \"literal\" reading of the text involves reading quite a bit more than is \"actually\" there. Which, I've noticed over the years, is quite typical of \"literalism.\"\n \n [You: Yeah, so what? What's your point? Are you saying that just because God didn't say that in those 3 verses, that He didn't say it at all?\n\n \n Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that since you quoted those verses and mentioned that point, the verses had something to do with the point. Moreover, I thought that since you hold the Bible to be literally true, there would be no need to read between the lines in order to get that ostensibly \"literal\" meaning. Apparently I was wrong on both counts.\n \n \nBy me repeating the command, am I really reading more into the bible than was actually said?\n\n \n You were saying more than those verses said, certainly.\n \n \nOr just expanding my explanation of what God said at that time?\n\n \n And that expansion is your words, not God's.\n \n \nHow tedious of you to hold me to such a limited right to expound when you know very well, hopefully, that God commanded them to fill the Earth with their seed.\n\n \n Yes, rigorous scrutiny often strikes Lazy Literalism as tedium. It calls the bluff.\n \n For example, none of the passages you here cite from Genesis mentions marriage being for the sake of procreation. They just tell men and women to procreate. Why do you insist on bringing up passages that can't make the point you're defending?\n \n \nAccording to God the Genesis account of Creation is historically true.\n\n \n -sigh- No, according to you, given your understanding of God's intentions. I tire of your penchant for speaking on His behalf, as if you weren't just as fallible as the rest of us, even about God.\n \n \nSo what you think changes nothing according to Gods perspective of events.\n\n \n And one more time.\n \n Come on! By what right or power do you claim to know diddly-squat about \"God's perspective?!? You're not really an archangel, Archie.\n \n \nAs for scientific truths, show where the bible is ever speaking as a scientific authority from mans shallow and very limited point of view?\n\n \n Well, I certainly don't think it speaks with scientific authority! But silly me, I just thought creationists thought so, which is why the try to get it taught in biology classes.\n \n \nOr from any point of view for that matter. It speaks and offers no confirming evidence for what it say's because according to God, His word is self evident and requires no evidence to support it. God only requires that we trust Him enough to believe He is not a liar. Obviously that isn't the case with you.\n\n \n Ach, whatever. You know what? I think I've said my piece for today. Or most of it, anyway. Just a couple more tidbits that I'd throw out there. Speaking of my comments on Leviticus and \"the Age of Grace\" issue, you wrote:\n \n \nYou need to do a deeper study if you really want to understand this, as it's an extensive study.\n\n \n Ha! It is to laugh.\n \n You continue:\n \n \nCan you understand that that when dealing with separations of time through the Ages that even though what was unlawful then remains unlawful now, that the lawful response to that moral failing, whether it be straight or gay, can be responded to with grace rather physical punishment due to the dissolution of the power of the Law over us through Jesus sacrifice on the Cross in which He died for our sins? Are you completely blind to His impact on how a loving God is attempting to deal with all sinners in this Age of Grace? Compared to how He dealt with sinners in the Age of the Law?\n\n \n I see. So physical punishment for sin is now unnecssary? Intriguing. Do tell. Seriously, I am curious where you go with this.\n \n And finally:\n \n \n... you attempt to imply that i wrongly take upon myself authority which is given to all believers in Christ. And furthermore, by denying we have that authority you claim a form of Godliness while denying the power which comes with it. How can you claim to know Christ while fitting EXACTLY what He warned us of regarding people like you?\n\n \n What is this \"authority?\" Authority to do what, exactly?\n \n I claim no \"form of Godliness\" other than having been made in His image: a free agent capable of recognizing, choosing, and doing what is good. The passage you cite is about not understanding oneself in this way, and therefore lacking the power to become good. It has zip, zilch, and nada to do with any form of \"authority\" over anyone, save perhaps oneself.\n \n \nSo, once again, just because you claim I don't have the authority as a believer in Christ to exhort, correct and rebuke your denials of Gods truths, God Himself gives all believers that authority which surely trumps your personal and very erroneous personal opinion.\n\n \n Oh, please! You may exhort and rebuke as much as you like! But in what sense is that \"authority?\" To quote a true giant of philosophy: \"I do not think that word means what you think it means.\"\n \n \nWhy do you think that the constant lies and shallow condemnations from alleged christians like you who haven't a clue about what a real relationship with the living God is, has no effect on our belief system? It's because we understand where you're coming from because we were once spiritually dead just as you are. But we now belong to a different hierarchy of authority under God which it's impossible for you to relate to as an unredeemed man.\n\n \n This will just about do it from my end. Once again, I simply must take offense at the notion that I have no clue about a relationship with God or that I'm spiritually dead. By what strange power do you see into my soul, Archie? By what right do you declare me unredeemed?\n \n If either of us is stepping on God's toes, my friend, it isn't me.",

As if you won't have supporters out there?\n \n There's no reason why we can't debate the issues and let everyone else join in, too. Frankly, I think there's a lot more diversity of opinion than believer and unbeliever.

[Note to everyone else: If any of my arguments is flawed, point it out to me, even if you agree with whatever general or particular conclusion is at issue.]\n \n Screw what I wrote earlier in specific terms if you like. Let's narrow it down to a few questions.\n \n 1. Is the Bible fallible, or not?\n \n 2. Is the Bible literally true, or not?\n \n 3. Does the value of the Bible depend on it being infallible and literally true, or not?\n \n 4. On what basis, if any, can a human being invoke \"God's perspective?\" (Or perhaps: To what extent can a human being understand God's nature or His will? (Or perhaps further: How can we know anything at all about God, if at all?))\n \n 5. What sort of \"authority,\" if any, should a Christian (or any other religious believer) claim?\n \n And of course, the further question that must be asked of any answer given to the above is: Why?\n \n Heck, feel free to start a new thread in response to these questions, just to leave that over-long monstrosity of mine in the dust. But as I said, I really don't have the inclination to get involved in what would essentially be an online correspondence. Let's have an open discussion of some big religious issues.",

I just don't understand your behavior here.\n \n \nAnd I'm not the one running away. All Matthew has to do is respect the wishes of the other debater in the debate, and it's on.\n\n \n Archie, all YOU have to do is respect the wishes of the other debater in the debate, and it's on. But this point is totally irrelevant, regardless of whose name we substitute.\n \n \nIt is he who is using my request as an excuse to run away because he needs the security of you atheists to attack me from all angles as you all did on the other thread.\n \n HE IS THE COWARD HERE WHO'S AFRAID TO FACE ME ALONE...\n\n \n Okay, let me ask you something. If I declared that you were \"running away,\" and attributed that to your \"need\" for the \"security\" of a narrower debate, and called you a \"coward\" -- would that make you more or less inclined to respond to my requests positively?\n \n Archie, I daresay that you have no more insight into my soul and mind and motives than I do into yours. Which is why I think it best not to bring them up. And I haven't. Instead, I've voiced my perplexity. Which is pretty huge where your current behavior is concerned.\n \n \n...OR ELSE HE WOULD ASK ADMIN TO MOVE ONLY THE FIRST POST TO THE CHALLENGERS CORNER SO WE COULD HAVE A FORMAL DEBATE WITHOUT INTERFERENCE.\n \n ...Talk to the coward who's afraid to face me one on one, set some ground rules and have a formal debate without interference from you very partial trolls.\n\n \n A \"formal debate?\" Oh, for pity's sake, I have enough of that in my day job. It's not why I come here.\n \n All you had to do was respond substantively some dozen posts ago or so. As you have done, and as you continue to do, on other open threads. I fail to see why this has suddenly become such a burden in this single instance.",

   "Guys and gals this thread reeks of high school bullying tactics, being more of a newbie i dont know what your grudges are with Archangel so I'm not defending him, but dont you think that all of you against one is a little unfair? Just a thought perhaps ... \n \n Hi Mathew, maybe you could kindly have your debate moved to the challenges corner please, if it is as you have titled, a debate intended against yourself and one persons opinion. I'd be most interested to actually read the crux of your debate without the Statler and Waldorf commentary. :)",

I titled it that way so that people from a gay-rights thread, where the discussion began but went totally off-topic, would be able to recognize it quickly. I probably could have done a better job.\n \n Over there, I explicitly invited them all to join in. I did not intend this to be ganging up on one guy. Nor did I intend it as a one-on-one debate. So I probably should have been more careful in titling the thread. My bad.\n \n Maybe I should just repost the same ideas, or a truncated version of them, on another thread or two. This thread can then be retired, and an open discussion can ensue without anyone feeling particularly called out.",

   "Hi Mathew,\n \n Ah i see, i didnt want to offend anyone just wanted you guys to see it from an outside perspective. I really dont think any of you intended on this becoming a 'ganging up thread' it just headed that way. \n Thanks for taking it to another area though, its much easier to read and undertand what your views are. :)\n \n \n Happy Happy New Year all of you! I hope you have a safe and wonderful time! emoticon_xhoho",
