So stop your lies and twisting of reality foundit.\n\n I spoke no lies.\n I can substantiate my position WITH POLLS that actually ask the people leaving WHY they are leaving.\n \n Rather than listen to that, Archie would have us listen to people who are ENTRENCHED in REPEATING the very reasons why people are leaving Christianity...\n Such glaring misrepresentation of reality is obviously an act of a dinosaur complaining as it sinks into the tar pit.\n \n A logical person can very well ask \"If the reason people leave Christianity is because the religion is not adhering to biblical principles, then WHY do we STILL HAVE MOST CHRISTIANS thinking homosexuality is a sin?\"\n Cause you see, changes like the above with the Lutherans DO NOT come about because most people WANT the church to be more strict...\n They come about because there are MORE people in the church who WANT the change.\n \n \n \nNo, but they represent the large majority of Lutherans.\n They are the largest Lutheran church in the US, with 4.70 million members. the next two largest are the Missouri Synod (2.41 million members), and the Wisconsin Synod (390,000 members). Or 2.8 million between the two.\n Taking that, they account for ~63%, quite a decent majority.\n\n Tying this in with Archie's claims (which can be documented by research as false), the obvious simple fix would be for people to flee the \"gay accepting\" sects and transition to the NON-gay accepting sects.\n i.e. People leaving the ELCA to go to the Missouri Synod...\n \n But of course, Archie can't point to that actually happening with any significant / documented evidence...\n \n Even as actions similar to Archie's behavior routinely drive people away from the church, he'll insist that embracing his approach what is necessary to save it...\n To which I still can't help but chuckle because he STILL can't name any single person who has EVER been enticed from outside his position to embrace his belief BECAUSE OF his action.\n \n If Archie's behavior has NEVER brought in members, then why should anybody believe that embracing his behavior on a wide-scale basis would bring in MORE members???",

   "A logical person can very well ask \"If the reason people leave Christianity is because the religion is not adhering to biblical principles, then WHY do we STILL HAVE MOST CHRISTIANS thinking homosexuality is a sin?\"\n Cause you see, changes like the above with the Lutherans DO NOT come about because most people WANT the church to be more strict...\n They come about because there are MORE people in the church who WANT the change.\n\n \n This is the same arguement the left is using to describe how a left-wing socialist like Obama got elected to office. Now all of a sudden the entire American population is for big government, trillion dollar deficits and cash for clunkers.\n \n Suddenly there's the sound of skidding tires........HEALTHCARE.... PUBLIC OPTION????\n \n Your arguement doesn't hold water foundit. Yes there are some who are leaving the church because the pastor is able to clearly read that homosexuality is an abomination to the Lord. But there are many leaving the church for a number of other reasons, not withstanding that selfish desires of man are prevailing.\n \n BTW.., where in the Bible does it say that the followers of Christ would ever be a majority? I believe it says quite the opposite.......",

Equal rights for all peoples. You see Easy not all Americans share in your crackpot theories and thus really don't give two shits about what you believe.\n \n What actual Americans are beginning to realize is the greater impact of ones rights relative to the consitution, not to a king james version of the bible.

Godless.\n\n \n \n Funny but I would not be surprised if your congregation had many conflicting relationship issues going on. Many have gone through divorce and will continue to do so. Relationships don't work sometimes for whatever reason, get over it.\n \n As for this whole omg that woman has dominion over me! XXXX. Well I for one welcome a woman authority figure. Better than your notion of having woman repressed. See I live with an ex wife beater Steam called my father and quite frankly I see that your mentality and his are strikingly similar. See he would always quote the bible and refer to my mother as woman. Like a second class sub human over him. \n \n He justified the Bible in his anger to harass and verbally abuse my mom. In fact he just did that yesterday. Oh the joys of a christian family right? You see you throw the word \"god\" in there and \"less\" when your control or your so called views are no longer holding sway on others. \n \n You have become so deluded and so engorged in self righteous fantasy crusades to make everyone conform to your beliefs that anything not deemed ok by your narrow minded views are hence godless.\n \n So forgive me if I just come out and call you a control freak ok?",
