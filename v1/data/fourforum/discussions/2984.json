   "Published on May 04, 2000 \n \n Sunday, April 30, 2000 \n By SHARON UNDERWOOD \n For the Valley News (White River Junction, VT) \n \n Many letters have been sent to the Valley News concerning the homosexual menace in Vermont. I am the mother of a gay son and I've taken enough from you good people. \n \n I'm tired of your foolish rhetoric about the \"homosexual agenda\" and your allegations that accepting homosexuality is the same thing as advocating sex with children. You are cruel and ignorant. You have been robbing me of the joys of motherhood ever since my children were tiny. \n \n My firstborn son started suffering at the hands of the moral little thugs from your moral, upright families from the time he was in the first grade. He was physically and verbally abused from first grade straight through high school because he was perceived to be gay. \n \n He never professed to be gay or had any association with anything gay, but he had the misfortune not to walk or have gestures like the other boys. He was called \"***\" incessantly, starting when he was 6. \n \n In high school, while your children were doing what kids that age should be doing, mine labored over a suicide note, drafting and redrafting it to be sure his family knew how much he loved them. My sobbing 17-year-old tore the heart out of me as he choked out that he just couldn't bear to continue living any longer, that he didn't want to be gay and that he couldn't face a life without dignity. \n \n You have the audacity to talk about protecting families and children from the homosexual menace, while you yourselves tear apart families and drive children to despair. I don't know why my son is gay, but I do know that God didn't put him, and millions like him, on this Earth to give you someone to abuse. God gave you brains so that you could think, and it's about time you started doing that. \n \n At the core of all your misguided beliefs is the belief that this could never happen to you, that there is some kind of subculture out there that people have chosen to join. The fact is that if it can happen to my family, it can happen to yours, and you won't get to choose. Whether it is genetic or whether something occurs during a critical time of fetal development, I don't know. I can only tell you with an absolute certainty that it is inborn. \n \n If you want to tout your own morality, you'd best come up with something more substantive than your heterosexuality. You did nothing to earn it; it was given to you. If you disagree, I would be interested in hearing your story, because my own heterosexuality was a blessing I received with no effort whatsoever on my part. It is so woven into the very soul of me that nothing could ever change it. For those of you who reduce sexual orientation to a simple choice, a character issue, a bad habit or something that can be changed by a 10-step program, I'm puzzled. Are you saying that your own sexual orientation is nothing more than something you have chosen, that you could change it at will? If that's not the case, then why would you suggest that someone else can? \n \n A popular theme in your letters is that Vermont has been infiltrated by outsiders. Both sides of my family have lived in Vermont for generations. I am heart and soul a Vermonter, so I'll thank you to stop saying that you are speaking for \"true Vermonters.\" \n \n You invoke the memory of the brave people who have fought on the battlefield for this great country, saying that they didn't give their lives so that the \"homosexual agenda\" could tear down the principles they died defending. My 83-year-old father fought in some of the most horrific battles of World War II, was wounded and awarded the Purple Heart. \n \n He shakes his head in sadness at the life his grandson has had to live. He says he fought alongside homosexuals in those battles, that they did their part and bothered no one. One of his best friends in the service was gay, and he never knew it until the end, and when he did find out, it mattered not at all. That wasn't the measure of the man. \n \n You religious folk just can't bear the thought that as my son emerges from the hell that was his childhood he might like to find a lifelong companion and have a measure of happiness. It offends your sensibilities that he should request the right to visit that companion in the hospital, to make medical decisions for him or to benefit from tax laws governing inheritance. \n \n How dare he? you say. These outrageous requests would threaten the very existence of your family, would undermine the sanctity of marriage. \n \n You use religion to abdicate your responsibility to be thinking human beings. There are vast numbers of religious people who find your attitudes repugnant. God is not for the privileged majority, and God knows my son has committed no sin. \n \n The deep-thinking author of a letter to the April 12 Valley News who lectures about homosexual sin and tells us about \"those of us who have been blessed with the benefits of a religious upbringing\" asks: \"What ever happened to the idea of striving . . . to be better human beings than we are?\" \n \n Indeed, sir, what ever happened to that?",

   "Homosexuality\n A Christian Perspective\n Helping Homosexuals To Overcome\n As suggested in the previous section, it is possible for a person to overcome their homosexuality even if they are not a Christian. But there is so much more help available if one is willing to come to Jesus Christ and the transforming power of the Holy Spirit! In this section, we shall briefly examine positive steps one can take in dealing with the pernicious sin of homosexuality.\n \n OBEY JESUS CHRIST AS SAVIOR AND LORD\n When one turns to the Lord in sincere faith and repentance, their baptism into Christ is the source of great blessings. As the apostle Peter proclaimed in the first gospel message on the Day of Pentecost:\n \n \"...Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.\" (Ac 2:38)\n Notice carefully that when one is baptized upon repentance that there is first the \"remission of sins.\" By the blood of Christ every sin is washed away in baptism. But there is also the \"gift of the Holy Spirit\" promised to those who repent and are baptized. This refers to the personal indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the life of the Christian, Who serves as the instrumental agent by which God and Christ indwell and strengthens the Christian. As Paul wrote to the Christians at Rome:\n \n \"But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.\"\n \"Therefore, brethren, we are debtors--not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.\"\n \"For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.\"\n (Ro 8:11-13)\n Yes, it is by the Spirit we are able to \"put to death the deeds of the body\", for as Paul wrote to the Ephesians, it is through the Spirit that God strengthens our inward man:\n \n \n \"...to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man,\" (Ep 3:16)\n With such \"divine help\" we are able to do whatever the will of God calls us to do. As Paul wrote in his epistle to the Philippians:\n \n \"...for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure.\" (Ph 2:13)\n \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\" (Ph 4:13)\n When we obey Christ and submit our lives to Him, we are not alone in our struggle against sin and the temptations we often face in the flesh; by the Spirit of God we can receive the strength Christ provides!\n But such ability does not come automatically. To receive the help God provides requires that we...\n \n \n WALK IN THE SPIRIT\n As written to the churches of Galatia:\n \n \"I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.\" (Ga 5:16)\n Whether the \"lust of the flesh\" we are fighting involves fornication, adultery, or homosexuality, we can only overcome it as we \"walk in the Spirit\". How does a Christian do this? The answer is found in Paul's epistle to the Romans:\n \n \"For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.\" (Ro 8:5)\n We \"live according to the Spirit\" (or \"walk in the Spirit\") as we \"set our minds on the things of the Spirit!\" Just as a person whose mind is \"in the gutter\" will soon live accordingly, those who \"set\" their mind on the things the Spirit has revealed will live in harmony with that revelation.\n In other words, the Word of God, revealed to us by the Holy Spirit working through the apostles and prophets of Jesus Christ, contains those \"things\" upon which we must \"set our minds\" if we are going to \"live according to the Spirit\". The Word of God is the instrument (or sword, Ep 6:17) the Holy Spirit uses to transform the minds and lives of those who will truly give themselves to it!\n \n As the Psalmist understood and declared so long ago...\n \n \n \"Your word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You.\" (Psa 119:11)\n Even Jesus, when tempted in the wilderness, appealed to the Word of God again and again in His fight against the lusts of the flesh (Ma 4:1-11)! So must one who is serious in overcoming homosexuality set his or her mind on the Word of God, that they might truly walk in the Spirit and receive the strength only the Spirit can provide!\n But there is more that can be said...\n \n \n RESTRICT WHAT GOES INTO YOUR MIND\n Jesus pointed out in His sermon on the mount that the problem of adultery actually begins in the heart (mind):\n \n \"...whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.\" (Ma 5:28)\n The same can be said for homosexuality. Therefore, a person who is serious in their efforts to overcome any sexual sin must be careful about what they allow their minds to dwell on. Again, Paul wrote:\n \n \"For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh...\" (Ro 8:5)\n If a person is going to be truly \"transformed\" it will occur only when the mind is being \"renewed\":\n \n \"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.\"\n \"And do not be conformed to this world, BUT BE TRANSFORMED BY THE RENEWING OF YOUR MIND, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.\"\n (Ro 12:1-2)\n But a person's mind cannot be \"renewed\" if they allow themselves to dwell on those things that will prompt lustful desires. Rather, they need to heed the following admonition:\n \n \n \"...whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy--meditate on these things.\" (Ph 4:8)\n Rather than dwelling on things that will weaken one's resolve, a person committed to overcoming temptations of the flesh will devote their thoughts, their reading, their television and movie viewing, to such things described above!\n \n AVOID HOMOSEXUAL FRIENDS AND HANGOUTS\n One should be aware of the dangers of the wrong kind of companionship:\n \n \"Do not be deceived: 'Evil company corrupts good habits.'\" (1 Co 15:33)\n Friends can be a wonderful blessing, but the wrong kind of friends can be a disaster! Avoid like the plague those who would entice you back into sin. And avoid those environments where the opportunities for temptations are great, where homosexuals are known to frequent. In other words...\n \n \"...put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and MAKE NO PROVISION FOR THE FLESH, to fulfill its lusts.\" (Ro 13:14)\n Do not provide opportunities for the flesh to be tempted to give into unlawful desires!\n \n BECOME ACTIVE IN THE LOCAL CHURCH\n Those who have been converted from homosexuality especially need the encouragement of that which comes from Christian fellowship. The very purpose of our assemblies is to provide such:\n \n \"And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another...\" (He 10:24-25)\n Of course, it is essential that those struggling with trying to overcome homosexuality be fully accepted despite their past by their fellow Christians, or they will be terribly discouraged! It is the Lord's desire that local congregations be a haven for ALL who seek to serve the Lord and overcome sin.\n \n BECOME ACTIVE IN A WEEKLY BIBLE STUDY\n The early Christians realized the value of home Bible studies with others...\n \n \"And daily in the temple, AND IN EVERY HOUSE, they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.\" (Ac 5:42)\n \"...I kept back nothing that was helpful, but proclaimed it to you, and taught you publicly and FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE.\" (Ac 20:20)\n The value of such special studies should be especially apparent for those Christians overcoming difficult problems (such as drugs, alcohol, homosexuality) where meeting with the church during its regular assemblies is not enough. Again, this calls for understanding and committed Christians who are willing to spend such time in study with their brethren who may be weak.\n \n BELIEVE IN GOD FOR AN \"UNLIMITED\" FUTURE!\n It is important to remember that with God nothing is impossible! The scriptures tell us that God is able to do things beyond what we are able to imagine:\n \n \"...who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,\" (Ep 3:20)\n Notice the superlatives used by Paul (\"exeedingly\" \"abundantly\" \"above all\"), you soon get the impression that this \"power\" that works in us is really beyond description! But it is available to those who commit themselves to serving the Lord!\n Not only that, but we have the promise that God will never allow us to be tempted beyond what we are able to handle:\n \n \n \"No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it.\" (1 Co 10:13)\n With the power of God working IN us to give us strength, and the providence of God working AROUND us to keep us out of temptations beyond our ability to overcome, we can change and be all that God wants us to be! (And remember, when we do fall because we do not take advantage of God's power and providence, there is still the grace of God to provide forgiveness when we truly repent and come back to God.)\n \n PRESENT YOUR BODY FORMALLY TO GOD\n When one becomes a Christian, their body then belongs to the Lord:\n \n \"Flee sexual immorality. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.\"\n \"Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?\"\n \"For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.\"\n (1 Co 6:18-20)\n Since we now belong to God, we should present our bodies to God as part of our reasonable service...\n \n \n \"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.\n \"And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.\"\n (Ro 12:1-2)\n Whereas before you may have allowed your body to be used as an instrument for sin, let it be used as an instrument of righteousness in the service of God:\n \n \n \"Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.\"\n \"And do not present your members as instruments of unrighteous- ness to sin, but present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.\"\n (Ro 6:12-13)\n The more we think of serving God with both body and spirit, the less we will succumb to allowing either to engage in sinful activities.\n \n \n FINALLY, PRAY!\n Yes, pray! And \"pray without ceasing\" (1 Th 5:17) whenever the temptation is greatest. Why pray? The author of Hebrews gives us two good reasons:\n \n \"Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.\" (He 4:16)\n Through prayer we can receive from God both mercy and grace to help us in time of need. Mercy for the times when we do not take advantage of the help God provides, and grace to help in those times when we DO seek to take advantage of it.\n Through prayer, the Word, the help of brethren, and the Holy Spirit Himself, anyone (including the homosexual and lesbian) should be able to say with the apostle Paul:\n \n \n \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\"\n May God give us all whatever portion of that strength we need!\n \n God bless you Joe Brummer!\n \n \n Source: \n http://www.ccel.org/contrib/exec_outlines/hom/hom_06.htm",

   "No really it is. You spread lies and hate about gays and lesbians. There is no foundation for half of the things you say. You ignore science and it's findings. You promote nothing but intolerance towards homosexuals by calling it perversion, immoral, and disgusting. I am not a christian, but I am a homosexual. I rarely go to clubs, I am monogamous with my partner, I have never had an STI of any sort, niether has my partner, I, and most of my friends defy everything you have ever said about homosexuality.\n \n You are brainwashed. Christianity is a cult, nothing more, nothing less. Addictions are very destructive and you are addicted to christianity. Sad really. BUT you need to keep your wierd beliefs away from others. They are destructive. The CDC recently released a report that teen suicide rates are down over he last decade. Th CDC also attributes this to the growing acceptance of homosexuality. Can you respond to that with out a bible, I doubt it. If you truely believe homosexuality is wqrong than you need to approach homosexuals in a different way. One that does not pass judgement. One that shows the true facts, not that facts you make up or get from your fellow brainwashed christians.\n \n \n I would urge you to re-think your actions and words as a christian.\n \n I would reccomend this site to you, and anyone else who thinks the bible condems homosexuals.\n \n www.godmademegay.com\n\n \n \n It seems to me that you are not able to tolerate others' beliefs. Why should we then tolerate yours? There is a thing in the US called freedom of speech. Someone, whether you like it or not, is allowed to call homosexuality a perversion, immoral, and disgusting. I'm sure that's hard for you to stomach, but it's legal.\n \n Whether you think Christianity is a cult or not is your belief, which you are entitled to be able to express under the first amendment. However, some may disagree with you, but you don't see anyone on the forum coming out and accusing you of being \"brainwashed\" and telling you to \"keep your weird beliefs away from others\" because you're gay.

It works both ways. If you feel it is right to accuse someone like that, be prepared for them to retaliate. \n \n I personally am a Christian, but I do not use the Bible to back up my beliefs on homosexuality. I use science, which states that there is no gay gene, to prove my point. I don't attack people's religions because they think different of me (unlike some people, such as yourself, do).

   "Joebrummer << For the anti gay christians \n \n \n The letter that started this thread appears to express the same contempt for God fearing Christians, as our Bible has for Homosexuals. We are talking about homos right? This letter from Mrs. Underwood is describing a young man in a terrible situation that has nothing to do with 'gay' at all. \n \n \nMs. Underwood << Many letters have been sent to the Valley News concerning the homosexual menace in Vermont. I am the mother of a gay son and I've taken enough from you good people. \n \n \n By 'you people,' this must mean Christian folks. This kind of stereotyping is what Ms. Underwood is supposed to be attacking. Being the mother of a homo must be the source of great guilt. \n \n \nMs. Underwood << I'm tired of your foolish rhetoric about the \"homosexual agenda\" and your allegations that accepting homosexuality is the same thing as advocating sex with children. You are cruel and ignorant. You have been robbing me of the joys of motherhood ever since my children were tiny.\n \n \n Homos are seeking to gain \"special rights\" (Jaaaman's phrase), and many of those 'good people' she is addressing are not willing to take this laying down. BTW, I must agree with most of what Jaaaman has to say on this thread. Since Ms. Underwood's child was harassed by first graders, are we to assume that all of them are aware of what the Bible has to say about homos? Or, is it possible that homosexual type behavior is also viewed as disgusting to secular non-religious Americans? \n \n Something inside me says that there is more to this story than meets the eye of the casual reader of this article. Now that my hair is gray, and I look back on events surrounding my friends who turned homo, there seems to be a common denominator. Even my next door neighbor in Junior High School (now dead from aids) had an aggressive overly-dominant mother who ran the show, and a submissive type (yes dear, yes dear) father. \n \n \nMs. Underwood << My firstborn son started suffering at the hands of the moral little thugs from your moral, upright families from the time he was in the first grade. He was physically and verbally abused from first grade straight through high school because he was perceived to be gay. He never professed to be gay or had any association with anything gay, but he had the misfortune not to walk or have gestures like the other boys. He was called \"***\" incessantly, starting when he was 6.\n\n \n Kids can be very cruel indeed, and for a variety of reasons. Boys that act like little girls are likely to receive shots from bullies period. Most of the six year old children I know do not possess the physical ability to be sexually active. They are still the human sponges with the capacity to be molded into just about whatever mommy and daddy desire. However, they mimic behavior that they see in their parents more than they listen to their commands. That is why parenting is more about being a good consistent example, than shouting verbal orders on how to be. They do as you do, and not as you say. Also, saying that school kids abused this child over their 'perception' of his homosexuality is a perception in itself. Did we actually interview the bullies that were led to act out in front of Ms. Underwood's boy? \n \n \nMs. Underwood << In high school, while your children were doing what kids that age should be doing, mine labored over a suicide note, drafting and redrafting it to be sure his family knew how much he loved them. My sobbing 17-year-old tore the heart out of me as he choked out that he just couldn't bear to continue living any longer, that he didn't want to be gay and that he couldn't face a life without dignity.\n \n \n Anger Management 101 says that we all must be responsible for our own feelings. By Ms. Underwood's own testimony, this behavior did not appear overnight. People usually do not decide to take their own lives on a whim. Many people have thoughts about taking their own lives, and for a variety of reasons. Those kinds of behavior patterns are usually a cry for help. \n \n What I do not see in this letter are examples of how the young man acted upon these homosexual urges. Was he playing with dolls at six? Or dressing up as a girl and having tea parties? Did he have this 'in your face' attitude that many homos display in public places today? What were the warning signs that the youngster was a prime candidate to take his own life? There is a large hole in the story between the ages of six and seventeen. Also, the tendency is for parents in this situation to blame themselves. This letter does not display that kind of emotion at all. And that leads me to believe, again, that there is more to this story than we are hearing.\n \n \nMs. Underwood << You have the audacity to talk about protecting families and children from the homosexual menace, while you yourselves tear apart families and drive children to despair. I don't know why my son is gay, but I do know that God didn't put him, and millions like him, on this Earth to give you someone to abuse. God gave you brains so that you could think, and it's about time you started doing that.\n \n \n My children are all adults, and none are homos. Why should Ms. Underwood believe that any parent should want to see their children exposed to ANY kind of sexual behavior? Much less those from a distorted homosexual perspective? Like Jaaaman says, \n \n \n\"Homosexuality is a behavior, not a race. Homosexuality is defined by the act of sodomy (sex with members of the same sex).\"\n \n \n We all make choices about how we behave in private and in public. Any display of sexual behavior in front of children is wrong. Any parent should react to that kind of situation, and meet it head on. Otherwise, our children are left exposed to negative fleshy influences that might plague them the rest of their lives. Look at the problems experienced by Ms. Underwood's child. She had some reason to 'perceive' that six your old school children believed her son to be a homosexual. We are left to guess at exactly why she believed that in the first place. \n \n \nMs. Underwood << At the core of all your misguided beliefs is the belief that this could never happen to you, that there is some kind of subculture out there that people have chosen to join. The fact is that if it can happen to my family, it can happen to yours, and you won't get to choose. Whether it is genetic or whether something occurs during a critical time of fetal development, I don't know. I can only tell you with an absolute certainty that it is inborn.\n \n \n No way. Ms. Underwood is part of the equation, and is in no position to credibly make those determinations beyond the shadow of doubt. I am more inclined to believe that every living thing on this planet has the inherited physical and chemical predisposition to reproduce itself. That is the underlying principle of nature and the 'birds and the bees.' It is normal for a person in the position of Ms. Underwood to be in denial, and to push responsibility elsewhere. It is far more likely that her son had an early childhood sexual experience that she simply knows nothing about (or one she is not willing to share); one that caused her son so much grief and guilt later on, that he could not tell one living soul. Therefore, her words in this paragraph above, that I believe the most are, \"I don't know.\" \n \n \nMs. Underwood << If you want to tout your own morality, you'd best come up with something more substantive than your heterosexuality. You did nothing to earn it; it was given to you. If you disagree, I would be interested in hearing your story, because my own heterosexuality was a blessing I received with no effort whatsoever on my part. It is so woven into the very soul of me that nothing could ever change it. For those of you who reduce sexual orientation to a simple choice, a character issue, a bad habit or something that can be changed by a 10-step program, I'm puzzled. Are you saying that your own sexual orientation is nothing more than something you have chosen, that you could change it at will? If that's not the case, then why would you suggest that someone else can? \n \n \n Okay. I can give you Bible reasons for why our Creator believes that homos are \"worthy of death\" (Romans 1:20-32 (32)), but not here. Many of my school yard friends are now dead from Aids contracted through homosexual episodes in their lives. Two of my cousins and one uncle are dead for the same reason. One of those cousins and my uncle were exposed to an infected homosexual just once. Yes, it was their own stupid fault, as they made their own choice, but my cousins and second cousins are still fatherless just the same. And she is \"puzzled?\" \n \n The normal heterosexual orientation is not a choice at all. All of God's creatures are born that way. Even the most vile of beasts in the forest have that much common sense. Deviation from that genetically sound normal behavior is a choice that some people have made to their own destruction. BTW, no normal heterosexual person has ever defiled the behavior of the natural child of any homosexual couple in the history of this planet. Can homos make the same claim? \n \n How many of our young children have fallen victim to homosexual predators in the USA alone? I can tell you this: The last time I took my fishing pole out to one of our beaches, there were at least a dozen 'homo preds' out there looking for some action. They approached me with that disgusting look in their eyes. They prey on the homeless and disadvantages souls of our society. So I am not sharing in this pity party for 'homo rights' nor any related nonsense. The homos are not the victims here. \n \n \nMs. Underwood << You religious folk just can't bear the thought that as my son emerges from the hell that was his childhood he might like to find a lifelong companion and have a measure of happiness. It offends your sensibilities that he should request the right to visit that companion in the hospital, to make medical decisions for him or to benefit from tax laws governing inheritance.\n \n \n The fact that her boy practices sodomy with another man is no reason for society to reward him with special rights. I did not cause her son to emerge from the hell of a terrible childhood. That responsibility must be shouldered by someone who was there every day in a position of authority in his life. If one of my sons or daughters turns out to be a murderer, then is that societies fault? And yet, this homo who infected two members of my family knew full well that he had Aids. While I am not for ridding our society of all homos, the idea of handing them special rights has to be one of the most ridiculous notions ever conceived. I am not buying it. \n \n \nMs. Underwood << How dare he? you say. These outrageous requests would threaten the very existence of your family, would undermine the sanctity of marriage.\n \n \n So, she wants to express anger towards Christians over her perceived notions about other people's behavior towards her son's homosexuality, then ask these same 'good people' for special rights in the same breath. This is a grandstanding attempt at sensationalism in the attempt at placing blame on others, while at the same time seeking to justify bad behavior by rewarding it with special rights. The underlying message appears to be that this homo behavior should be accepted as normal, and that same sex couples should be treated by the law as normal married folks. \n \n That kind of attitude breeds the same kind of problems that led her son to commit suicide in the first place. Did he seek a way out of the situation, because school yard boys harassed him, or because mommy led him to believe all those years that this behavior would some day have rewards? I am certainly not getting the impression that mom discouraged this homo styled behavior in her child. And, since she still feels that he was born that way, then her own behavior must have mirrored that conviction early on. \n \n \nMs. Underwood << You use religion to abdicate your responsibility to be thinking human beings. There are vast numbers of religious people who find your attitudes repugnant. God is not for the privileged majority, and God knows my son has committed no sin.\n \n \n No. The Bible only validates my thoughts and feelings on the matter. And if Ms. Underwood and her boy gave a hoot about what vast numbers of religious people thought, then perhaps they could have avoided this disaster. And, I am not in anyone's line for special rights over willingness to participate in deviant sexual behavior. \n \n \nMs. Underwood << The deep-thinking author of a letter to the April 12 Valley News who lectures about homosexual sin and tells us about \"those of us who have been blessed with the benefits of a religious upbringing\" asks: \"What ever happened to the idea of striving . . . to be better human beings than we are?\" Indeed, sir, what ever happened to that?\n\n \n Being a better human being for some might be standing up and saying something against rewarding those practicing such depraved acts with special rights. Maybe some among our youth will get the idea that these things are indeed wrong and to be avoided. Maybe some young folks like the son of Ms. Underwood will be spared from the suicidal tendencies that affect many from that particular group of our society. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "It seems to me that you are not able to tolerate others' beliefs. Why should we then tolerate yours? There is a thing in the US called freedom of speech. Someone, whether you like it or not, is allowed to call homosexuality a perversion, immoral, and disgusting. I'm sure that's hard for you to stomach, but it's legal.\n \n Whether you think Christianity is a cult or not is your belief, which you are entitled to be able to express under the first amendment. However, some may disagree with you, but you don't see anyone on the forum coming out and accusing you of being \"brainwashed\" and telling you to \"keep your weird beliefs away from others\" because you're gay. I think you are very close-minded. You want only people like you to be able to express their beliefs, and when someone else expresses ideas not like yours, you harass them and tell them that they are part of a cult (to me, it seems as if you're looking for acceptance and only want to hear opinions from people who will make you feel better about yourself). It works both ways. If you feel it is right to accuse someone like that, be prepared for them to retaliate. \n \n I personally am a Christian, but I do not use the Bible to back up my beliefs on homosexuality. I use science, which states that there is no gay gene, to prove my point. I don't attack people's religions because they think different of me (unlike some people, such as yourself, do). I suggest going down a different path when attacking people like you are doing.\n\n \n \n \n I believe this may be the post that started the debate about the debate. I re-read my own posts and don not think I was wrong in anything I said. Nor do I think I attacked anyone. I do think that Jaaman is brainwashed by his church. That is my opinion and I have no problem expressing that to someone who continues to promotes lies and untruth (given to him by his church) that cannot be back up'ed by facts and unbiased data. I am sorry if you think that I am close minded, I read about all types of religions and I am facinated by them. I have friends of all different cultures and beliefs. I am open to those when people don't inflict them upon my life denying my rights or make others like me feel bad about being who they are. \n \n As I told Jaaman in my post, take your wierd beliefs elsewhere. I still agree with that. but please, It seems you left off the rest of the post that tells him if he truely belives homosexuality is wrong he needs to approach it in a different way. I never told him he is not welcome on this forum. I told him he needs to approach it in a different way he is going to show \"god's love\"",

   "This letter from Mrs. Underwood is describing a young man in a terrible situation that has nothing to do with 'gay' at all.\n \n \n How do you mean? \n \n \nBy 'you people,' this must mean Christian folks. This kind of stereotyping is what Ms. Underwood is supposed to be attacking. Being the mother of a homo must be the source of great guilt.\n\n \n I don't see how it is a source of guilt. \n \n \nHomos are seeking to gain \"special rights\" (Jaaaman's phrase),\n\n \n Actually, it's equal rights, not special rights.\n \n \nand many of those 'good people' she is addressing are not willing to take this laying down.\n\n \n Take what exactly? The bigots and those who discriminate will have that bigoted and discrminatory behaviour impacted on?\n \n \nBTW, I must agree with most of what Jaaaman has to say on this thread.\n\n \n I'm not surprised.\n \n \nSince Ms. Underwood's child was harassed by first graders, are we to assume that all of them are aware of what the Bible has to say about homos? Or, is it possible that homosexual type behavior is also viewed as disgusting to secular non-religious Americans?\n\n \n Quite possibly they heard it from their parents who could be anti-gay Christians. \n \n \nSomething inside me says that there is more to this story than meets the eye of the casual reader of this article. Now that my hair is gray, and I look back on events surrounding my friends who turned homo, there seems to be a common denominator. Even my next door neighbor in Junior High School (now dead from aids) had an aggressive overly-dominant mother who ran the show, and a submissive type (yes dear, yes dear) father.\n\n \n Many heterosexuals have had those kinds of parents, and many gays have not had those kinds of parents.\n \n \nAlso, saying that school kids abused this child over their 'perception' of his homosexuality is a perception in itself. Did we actually interview the bullies that were led to act out in front of Ms. Underwood's boy?\n\n \n Calling him certain names may indicate this. \n \n \nWhat I do not see in this letter are examples of how the young man acted upon these homosexual urges. Was he playing with dolls at six? Or dressing up as a girl and having tea parties? Did he have this 'in your face' attitude that many homos display in public places today? What were the warning signs that the youngster was a prime candidate to take his own life? There is a large hole in the story between the ages of six and seventeen. Also, the tendency is for parents in this situation to blame themselves. This letter does not display that kind of emotion at all. And that leads me to believe, again, that there is more to this story than we are hearing.\n\n \n Why would it be relevent to talk about this person's sex life, if he had one at all. Being gay is about more than the act of sex, it's in your head. \n \n \nMy children are all adults, and none are homos.\n\n \n Well, don't blame yourself for that. No parent is perfect.\n \n \nWhy should Ms. Underwood believe that any parent should want to see their children exposed to ANY kind of sexual behavior? Much less those from a distorted homosexual perspective?\n\n \n \nWe all make choices about how we behave in private and in public. Any display of sexual behavior in front of children is wrong. Any parent should react to that kind of situation, and meet it head on. Otherwise, our children are left exposed to negative fleshy influences that might plague them the rest of their lives.\n\n \n I'm not sure what you mean. There are obviously issues of what behaviour display is age appropriate whether it is gay or straight behaviour.\n \n \nNo way. Ms. Underwood is part of the equation, and is in no position to credibly make those determinations beyond the shadow of doubt. I am more inclined to believe that every living thing on this planet has the inherited physical and chemical predisposition to reproduce itself. That is the underlying principle of nature and the 'birds and the bees.' It is normal for a person in the position of Ms. Underwood to be in denial, and to push responsibility elsewhere. It is far more likely that her son had an early childhood sexual experience that she simply knows nothing about (or one she is not willing to share); one that caused her son so much grief and guilt later on, that he could not tell one living soul.\n\n \n Why would you assume her son had an early childhood sexual experience?\n \n \nOkay. I can give you Bible reasons for why our Creator believes that homos are \"worthy of death\" (Romans 1:20-32 (32)), but not here\n\n \n You always bring up that all gay people are worthy of is death. So if you taught a gay person this all his or her life, and that gay person internalized your lies, and didn't get support from elsewhere, perhaps he or she would commit suicide.\n \n \nMany of my school yard friends are now dead from Aids contracted through homosexual episodes in their lives. Two of my cousins and one uncle are dead for the same reason. One of those cousins and my uncle were exposed to an infected homosexual just once. Yes, it was their own stupid fault, as they made their own choice, but my cousins and second cousins are still fatherless just the same. And she is \"puzzled?\"\n\n \n Well, we could talk to all the many babies in Africa orphaned when their heterosexual parents died of AIDS. It's hard for me to belive that you would personally know so many gay people with AIDS. Given your highly negative attitudes toward homosexuality generally, it's hard to believe so many gay people would open up to you like that.\n \n \nThe normal heterosexual orientation is not a choice at all. All of God's creatures are born that way. Even the most vile of beasts in the forest have that much common sense.\n\n \n But then, these are just vile beasts, so we shouldn't go by what they do.\n \n \nDeviation from that genetically sound normal behavior is a choice that some people have made to their own destruction.\n\n \n Being left-handed and liking blue cheese, may also fit into that category of not being normal and not having a genetic predisposition proven for it. You haven't shown how homosexuality is destructive.\n \n \nBTW, no normal heterosexual person has ever defiled the behavior of the natural child of any homosexual couple in the history of this planet. Can homos make the same claim?\n\n \n I have no idea what you are on about. You are sounding really silly. \n \n \nHow many of our young children have fallen victim to homosexual predators in the USA alone?\n\n \n Pedophilia is not homosexuality nor heterosexuality.\n \n \nI can tell you this: The last time I took my fishing pole out to one of our beaches, there were at least a dozen 'homo preds' out there looking for some action. They approached me with that disgusting look in their eyes.\n\n \n That look in their eyes, what is that exactly? The look was directed toward yourself, an old man with graying hair(as you've described yourself)? \n \n \nThey prey on the homeless and disadvantages souls of our society.\n\n \n And they try to tempt gray haired old men!\n \n \nSo I am not sharing in this pity party for 'homo rights' nor any related nonsense.

Isn't it the bullies who had the problem? The mother would be as bad as the bullies if she did what you want her to do. \n \n \nNo. The Bible only validates my thoughts and feelings on the matter. And if Ms. Underwood and her boy gave a hoot about what vast numbers of religious people thought, then perhaps they could have avoided this disaster.\n\n \n Your thoughts and feelings is that God thinks gays are only worthy of death.

You tend to focus on acts, but being gay is in one's head, and more than acts, as I pointed to earlier. You are going to have to convince thinking people why the acts are wrong and \"depraved\", and/or why being gay is wrong and how it can be avioded. You haven't done this.",

   "The letter that started this thread appears to express the same contempt for God fearing Christians, as our Bible has for Homosexuals. We are talking about homos right?

Boys that act like little girls are likely to receive shots from bullies period. Most of the six year old children I know do not possess the physical ability to be sexually active. They are still the human sponges with the capacity to be molded into just about whatever mommy and daddy desire. However, they mimic behavior that they see in their parents more than they listen to their commands. That is why parenting is more about being a good consistent example, than shouting verbal orders on how to be. They do as you do, and not as you say. Also, saying that school kids abused this child over their 'perception' of his homosexuality is a perception in itself. Did we actually interview the bullies that were led to act out in front of Ms. Underwood's boy? \n \n Anger Management 101 says that we all must be responsible for our own feelings. By Ms. Underwood's own testimony, this behavior did not appear overnight. People usually do not decide to take their own lives on a whim. Many people have thoughts about taking their own lives, and for a variety of reasons. Those kinds of behavior patterns are usually a cry for help. \n \n What I do not see in this letter are examples of how the young man acted upon these homosexual urges.

The homos are not the victims here. \n \n The fact that her boy practices sodomy with another man is no reason for society to reward him with special rights. I did not cause her son to emerge from the hell of a terrible childhood. That responsibility must be shouldered by someone who was there every day in a position of authority in his life. If one of my sons or daughters turns out to be a murderer, then is that societies fault? And yet, this homo who infected two members of my family knew full well that he had Aids. While I am not for ridding our society of all homos, the idea of handing them special rights has to be one of the most ridiculous notions ever conceived. I am not buying it. \n \n So, she wants to express anger towards Christians over her perceived notions about other people's behavior towards her son's homosexuality, then ask these same 'good people' for special rights in the same breath. This is a grandstanding attempt at sensationalism in the attempt at placing blame on others, while at the same time seeking to justify bad behavior by rewarding it with special rights. The underlying message appears to be that this homo behavior should be accepted as normal, and that same sex couples should be treated by the law as normal married folks. \n \n That kind of attitude breeds the same kind of problems that led her son to commit suicide in the first place. Did he seek a way out of the situation, because school yard boys harassed him, or because mommy led him to believe all those years that this behavior would some day have rewards? I am certainly not getting the impression that mom discouraged this homo styled behavior in her child. And, since she still feels that he was born that way, then her own behavior must have mirrored that conviction early on. \n \n No. The Bible only validates my thoughts and feelings on the matter. And if Ms. Underwood and her boy gave a hoot about what vast numbers of religious people thought, then perhaps they could have avoided this disaster. And, I am not in anyone's line for special rights over willingness to participate in deviant sexual behavior. \n \n Being a better human being for some might be standing up and saying something against rewarding those practicing such depraved acts with special rights. Maybe some among our youth will get the idea that these things are indeed wrong and to be avoided. Maybe some young folks like the son of Ms. Underwood will be spared from the suicidal tendencies that affect many from that particular group of our society. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral\n\n \n What a post. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n You revile homosexuals and wish them all death according to the words of the Bible, and yet, you have extensive experience with homosexuals in your life, even within your own family!\n \n You're an old grey haired Bible teacher, and yet, apparently, you're irresistable to gay men. Interesting. You must put out quite the vibe if they get that look in their eyes every time they see you.\n \n Then you close with \"God bless\", that's hilarious Terral. Monty's comments on irony apparently know no bounds with you.\n \n IMHO, you represent everything that's wrong with Christianity. I am so thankful that I don't know, and haven't as yet encountered, anyone like you during my lifetime. \n \n I hope I never do.\n \n Waxy",

If I made the general statement that Christianity is perverted, wouldn't it offend people who identify and practice in terms of Christianity, also known as Christians? Would it personally offend anyone who does not?\n \n \nI aksed you to prove to me that gays can't change. Why can't they? It is not genetic and is not forced upon them, so why can't they change? It is their CHOICE, nobody forced them to do it and it has been proven that there is no gene that is linked to \"gayness\".\n\n \n You seem to believe it is only an action. It's not, it's an identity, and it is in one's head. What is so difficult for some people to understand? No there is no concrete proof of a gay gene. There is no proof of a gene that makes someone like the colour yellow either. There is no proof of a gene for making someone left-handed. This doesn't making being gay or liking the colour yellow, or being left-handed is a bad thing. These things may not be conscious or deliberate choices, either. If someone could possibly change, it doesn't mean that person should change.",

   "As Americans, homosexuals are entitled to equal rights, not special rights. Their behavior based lifestyle does not qualify for privileged minority status under the U.S. law.\n\n \n Equal ACCESS To rights is what is being discussed. We build ramps to public buildings so that those without the ability to walk up stairs, may access those buildings. What the GLBT community is fighting for is a VIRTUAL ramp into PUBLIC liberties.\n \n \n All individuals; good, bad, homosexual, or whatever, are protected under the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. As a class, the courts have repeatedly denied homosexuals their claim to \"insular and discreet\" minority status, quotas and affirmative action.\n\n \n Minority Status isn't really something that we actually need courts to deny or accept. We don't ask the courts to label left-handed persons from right-handed persons, we simply accept that because they ARE.\n \n \n Homosexuality is a behavior, not a race. Homosexuality is defined by the act of sodomy (sex with members of the same sex).\n\n \n First off, homosexuality is NOT solely a \"behavior.\" If this were the case then no Heterosexual could claim to be that until having had sexual intercourse with someone of the opposite gender.\n Secondly, Sodomy is NOT sexual contact with someone of the same gender. It IS anal sex. That is why Sodomy laws were actually placed to protect female rape victims from males who had raped them anally. That is also why the ironious sodomy laws of Texas were REMOVED! Because said sodomy laws were restrictive and an invasion of privacy between two concenting adult males.\n Thirdly, Since Sodomy is ANAL sex, therefore accourding to your definition no Females could ever be homosexual unless they partook in anal sex. \n Which then means any heterosexual female would be classified as homosexual even if her anal sex partner were a male!\n Hmmm...confusing, ain't it? \n \n \n Homosexuals fight for protection by drawing an analogy between themselves and African Americans before the civil rights movement, and by presenting themselves as severely persecuted. Is the analogy reasonable? People of color cannot abandon their color the way many homosexuals have abandoned their perverse lifestyle. \n\n \n The analogy was not actually started as a comparission of Gays to African-Americans due to race. But rather in that homosexuals are indeed persecuted and are indeed denied EQUAL ACCESS to protections, rights and priveledges. Homosexuals are INDEED denied employment protections as well as shelter, ie hotels/motels, and rental properties. \n They are denied the right to raise children in many states, in that some state will actually removed biological children from their homes because they are gay. As well as being denied the ability to adopt in even more states. \n \n To say that African-Americans do not abandon their race is yet another popular falicy. Indeed African-Americans do abandon their race in that they abandon it's culture. Of course, my best friend who is African-American, will also point out the case of Michael Jackson who has abandoned his race in the physical sence by way of bleaching his skin color.\n This also opens the door to the arguments which are quite popular among African-Americans as to which of them are \"More\" black than another.\n Of course if you really want to get picky about the whole race issue, there is the fact that there are so few \"pure\" races left on the entire planet that it makes your argument MOOT.\n \n \nProtection of homosexuals is based on behavior held as immoral by the majority of people. An African American or a Caucasian can be either morally upright or morally corrupt; a practicing homosexual seeks social sanction of inherently illicit activities, not of an immutable or constitutionally recognized trait.\n\n \n And in that lies the problem. Persons who AQUIRE age and physically different abililties are given EQUAL ACCESS to said rights and protections, yet those whom you claim AQUIRE a sexual preferance are not. That in and of itself is descriminatory on the basis of percieved choice. \n \n \n \nIN ORDER FOR A GROUP TO MEET MINORITY STATUES ACCORDING \n TO UNITED STATES LAW THEY MUST MEET THREE QUALIFICATIONS. \n HOMOSEXUALS DO NOT FULFILL ANY OF THEM!\n Ready to have some fun?~~~\n \n 1. The class must have suffered a history of discrimination which is evidenced by the lack of ability to obtain economic mean income, adequate education and be deprived of cultural opportunities.\n \n So, the fact that homosexuals actually do have such a history is obviously disregarded here. As I stated before, gays can be, and regually are, denied employment simply for the mere perception of being gay.\n \n 2. The class must exhibit obvious, immutable or distinguishable characteristics that define them as an insular and discrete group.\n \n Again, the fact that homosexuals are not heterosexuals in subject to PERSEPTION of choice.\n \n 3. The class must show they are politically powerless.\n \n Gee, I don't know what you call the FMA or the more current HB3313 (Protection of marriage act) but that pretty much forces gays to become politically powerless. \n \n Source:\n http://www.geocities.com/peterpaulmin/HomosexualMyths.html\n\n \n So, you have once again AIDED my arguments in that you really haven't a clue as to your own.",

   "Hi Waxy:\n \n \nWaxy << You revile homosexuals and wish them all death according to the words of the Bible, and yet, you have extensive experience with homosexuals in your life, even within your own family!\n\n \n Scripture says what Scripture says. Nobody writing on this forum can change that. The homos you are referring to are on the prowl out there as we speak. What is this \"in your life\" lingo? Everyone walking by must put up with their 'in your face' displays. And, yes, some members of my family have been touched by this madness, but I have a very large family, and this is a widespread problem. The fact that you see this as a negative does not speak well of homos in general. Is this the attitude you are trying to convey? Or is this just another opportunity for you to poke at a Christian? \n \n Here is some Bible for you on this topic:\n \n \n\"For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse. For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened.\n Professing to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures. Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them. For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper, being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; {they are} gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful; and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are WORTHY OF DEATH, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.\" Romans 1:20-32.\n\n \n \nWaxy << You're an old grey haired Bible teacher, and yet, apparently, you're irresistable to gay men. Interesting. You must put out quite the vibe if they get that look in their eyes every time they see you.\n\n \n That is a far stretch indeed. Who said anything about irresistible? And vibes? Those are your concoctions. My words simply show that these guys will go for anybody. When these people speak about equal rights for homos, they are representing these 'homo preds' also. No thanks, I will stand with the God fearing Christians on this one. Choose your bed fellows carefully, just in case you are forced one day to sleep with them. \n \n \nWaxy << Then you close with \"God bless\", that's hilarious Terral. Monty's comments on irony apparently know no bounds with you.\n\n \n Well, if blessing someone is a sin, then I am your biggest sinner. And I am tickled that you have the opportunity to chuckle now and then. And, anyone willing to stand up and speak for what is right should also be willing to take shots from the peanut gallery. So blast away. \n \n \nWaxy << IMHO, you represent everything that's wrong with Christianity. I am so thankful that I don't know, and haven't as yet encountered, anyone like you during my lifetime.

   "Hi Jake:\n \n \nOriginally Posted by terral03 This letter from Mrs. Underwood is describing a young man in a terrible situation that has nothing to do with 'gay' at all. \n \n \n \nJake << How do you mean? \n \n \n The suicidal homo lad's hellish life had to be anything but 'gay.' \n \n \nJake << I don't see how it is a source of guilt. \n \n \n Mom raised a child that grew up wanting to sodomize other men rather than get married and raise a family of his own. And you do not see how this can be a source of guilt for the mother. Perhaps we are getting closer to identifying specific mental traits and attributes of folks with the tendency towards homosexuality. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by terral03 << Homos are seeking to gain \"special rights\" (Jaaaman's phrase), \n \n \n \nJake << Actually, it's equal rights, not special rights.\n\n \n No. That is where the homos have things screwed incorrectly into their twisted heads. Have you ever heard the phrase, \"We The People?\" They are sort of famous words you know. That includes people of every race, creed and sexual orientation. You have every right that I have under the laws of the land. You can marry, raise a family, have grandchildren, and the whole nine yards. How much more equal can it be? The homos want what is beyond the law, things that nobody here has rights over. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by terral03 << and many of those 'good people' she is addressing are not willing to take this laying down.\n \n \n \nJake << Take what exactly? The bigots and those who discriminate will have that bigoted and discrminatory behaviour impacted on?\n\n \n Bigot? You have some nerve pal. Bigot, extremist, racist, hypocrite . . .? So you believe that men should be allowed to legally marry men and I am the extremist? When was the last time two men got together and swapped dna, and brought a new citizen into this great land? My Bible shows a man and woman becoming one flesh in the second chapter. There is no male/male marriage anywhere to be found. Who is the extremist here? \n \n \nOriginally Posted by terral03 << BTW, I must agree with most of what Jaaaman has to say on this thread. \n \n \n \nJake << I'm not surprised.\n\n \n Everything I have to say here is very predicable and very Biblical. What you have to say is also very predictable and most un-Biblical, and very much against everything our Creator stands for. No surprises here. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by terral03 << What I do not see in this letter are examples of how the young man acted upon these homosexual urges. Was he playing with dolls at six? Or dressing up as a girl and having tea parties? Did he have this 'in your face' attitude that many homos display in public places today? What were the warning signs that the youngster was a prime candidate to take his own life? There is a large hole in the story between the ages of six and seventeen. Also, the tendency is for parents in this situation to blame themselves. This letter does not display that kind of emotion at all. And that leads me to believe, again, that there is more to this story than we are hearing. \n \n Jake << Why would it be relevent to talk about this person's sex life, if he had one at all. Being gay is about more than the act of sex, it's in your head.\n\n \n Being a murderer might be in your had also, or a rapist who seeks power of weaker people, or thieves who hide in the dark and take from others. Saying something is in your head is no reason or excuse. Why should we allow the facts in this case to get in the way of this lady's drawn conclusions? Scripture says that they receive, \"in their own persons the due penalty of their error.\" Romans 1:27. It is that I can hardly believe this happened to a boy at the age of six without added information as proof. \n \n \nJake << Why would you assume her son had an early childhood sexual experience?\n\n \n Ahhh, the fact that he turned into a suicidal homo maniac? Are we reading the same article? To me, this boy did not respond to this homo business with the same zeal you seem to have for it. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by terral03 << Okay. I can give you Bible reasons for why our Creator believes that homos are \"worthy of death\" (Romans 1:20-32 (32)), but not here \n \n Jake << You always bring up that all gay people are worthy of is death. So if you taught a gay person this all his or her life, and that gay person internalized your lies, and didn't get support from elsewhere, perhaps he or she would commit suicide.\n\n \n Lies? Exactly what part of that is a lie? Paul says about homos, \"And although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.\" Romans 1:32. For anyone to teach otherwise is a lie. So, what do you expect to hear from someone like me? Again, no surprises here, I am sure. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by terral03 << Many of my school yard friends are now dead from Aids contracted through homosexual episodes in their lives. Two of my cousins and one uncle are dead for the same reason. One of those cousins and my uncle were exposed to an infected homosexual just once. Yes, it was their own stupid fault, as they made their own choice, but my cousins and second cousins are still fatherless just the same. And she is \"puzzled?\" \n \n \n \nJake << Well, we could talk to all the many babies in Africa orphaned when their heterosexual parents died of AIDS. It's hard for me to belive that you would personally know so many gay people with AIDS. Given your highly negative attitudes toward homosexuality generally, it's hard to believe so many gay people would open up to you like that.\n\n \n I live in proximity to Florida's beaches where many gay folks live and thrive, and many have died. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by terral03 << The normal heterosexual orientation is not a choice at all. All of God's creatures are born that way. Even the most vile of beasts in the forest have that much common sense. \n \n \n \nJake << But then, these are just vile beasts, so we shouldn't go by what they do.\n\n \n I understand. That is my point, that homos have less common sense than the beasts of the field. They should receive special rights long before you. Here comes a homo up to the counter at the government building. He says, \"Hey, I sodomized a man last night, and I am here to collect my rights.\" Somehow your arguments fail to convince me. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by terral03 << Deviation from that genetically sound normal behavior is a choice that some people have made to their own destruction. \n \n \n \nJake << Being left-handed and liking blue cheese, may also fit into that category of not being normal and not having a genetic predisposition proven for it. You haven't shown how homosexuality is destructive.\n\n \n But, who wants special rights for liking blue cheese? I am confident that my dead friends would love to have the ability to show you just how destructive homosexuality can be. But they are dead!\n \n \nOriginally Posted by terral03 << BTW, no normal heterosexual person has ever defiled the behavior of the natural child of any homosexual couple in the history of this planet. Can homos make the same claim? \n \n \n \nJake << I have no idea what you are on about. You are sounding really silly.\n \n \n Many God fearing Christians out there caught the message. Lifelong homo couples have no natural posterity of their own without taking dna from another party. That should tell you that something is wrong. Homosexual acts are not about propagation of the species. They are abnormal acts specifically spoken against in Holy Scripture. You are sitting at your desk typing out homosexual propaganda in a country dominated by a majority of professing Christians. Therefore, by definition, your views are in the extreme; far, far . . . Discrimination and bigotry indeed. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by terral03 << How many of our young children have fallen victim to homosexual predators in the USA alone? \n \n \n \nJake << Pedophilia is not homosexuality nor heterosexuality.\n\n \n Heterosexual acts are sometimes sex outside of marriage, and Biblically immoral. Homosexuality acts are ALWAYS sex outside of marriage and, Biblically immoral. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by terral03 << I can tell you this: The last time I took my fishing pole out to one of our beaches, there were at least a dozen 'homo preds' out there looking for some action. They approached me with that disgusting look in their eyes.\n \n \n \nJake's interest is tweaked << That look in their eyes, what is that exactly? The look was directed toward yourself, an old man with graying hair(as you've described yourself)? \n \n \n Do you know a disgusting look, when you see one? What is going on inside the mind of some even older dude wearing a speedo talking about how good you look? Hey, I am the first in line to agree that this homo stuff is sick. They are out there right now preying on people. You people want to point fingers at me and poke fun . . . go right ahead. \n \n \nJake << Who is the victim? \n \n \n The ex-husbands and wives left at home to take care of the abandoned children, because these sex acts are more important than anything else. People who have to put up with these 'homo preds,' like the ones out there on Gandy Blvd, along the waterway. And you know what? That is their right to be out there. I can fish someplace else. But, extra rights? That is nonsense. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by terral03 << The fact that her boy practices sodomy with another man is no reason for society to reward him with special rights. I did not cause her son to emerge from the hell of a terrible childhood. That responsibility must be shouldered by someone who was there every day in a position of authority in his life. If one of my sons or daughters turns out to be a murderer, then is that societies fault? And yet, this homo who infected two members of my family knew full well that he had Aids.\n \n \n \nJake << Your family members are responsible for not having protected sex.\n\n \n Another miracle. I said that it was their own stupid fault. But, you know what? It is the fault of every God-fearing Christian to allow this homo equal rights nonsense to pass as legislation. I believe that God defends this great nation from destruction from our enemies, because we stand together for what is right in His eyes, and according to His word. Allowing same sex marriages in this country is wrong. Should that ever happen, we should expect God to remove His hand from keeping us secure. When He says that homos are worthy of death (Rom. 1:27), and we reward that deviant behavior with special rights, as a nation, then we should expect Him to shake this country from one side to the other. And if we, as a Christian nation, allow this to happen, then we deserve the fate of my stupid family members.\n \n \n \nOriginally Posted by terral03 << So, she wants to express anger towards Christians over her perceived notions about other people's behavior towards her son's homosexuality, then ask these same 'good people' for special rights in the same breath. This is a grandstanding attempt at sensationalism in the attempt at placing blame on others, while at the same time seeking to justify bad behavior by rewarding it with special rights. The underlying message appears to be that this homo behavior should be accepted as normal, and that same sex couples should be treated by the law as normal married folks. \n \n \n \nJake << I don't see anything wrong with the message. \n \n \n Of course not, it was written for homos. Homosexual behavior is not the same as between a married man and woman. Those sets of behaviors have nothing at all in common. One is ordained and instituted by the Creator, and the other is held in the highest contempt. One brings forth children to God, and the other brings condemnation. The only place where these things appear the same is in the twisted mind of the homo. The typical God-fearing Christian does not buy it. Find yourself a country where homos are in the majority. But, where will the new citizens come from? Are hetero and homo marriages really equal? If so, then you guys will have no problem keeping up with the Jones.\n \n GL,\n \n Terral",

   "Mom raised a child that grew up wanting to sodomize other men rather than get married and raise a family of his own.\n\n \n Perhaps he wanted to both have sex with men, get married, and raise a family.\n \n \nAnd you do not see how this can be a source of guilt for the mother.\n\n \n No, her son is her son, gay or straight.\n \n \nNo. That is where the homos have things screwed incorrectly into their twisted heads. Have you ever heard the phrase, \"We The People?\" They are sort of famous words you know. That includes people of every race, creed and sexual orientation. You have every right that I have under the laws of the land. You can marry, raise a family, have grandchildren, and the whole nine yards. How much more equal can it be? The homos want what is beyond the law, things that nobody here has rights over.\n\n \n Actually, I live in Canada. Like Canada, the U.S. uses the common law definition of marriage. This is a court created law, and the court is given a lot of latitude to interpret the law, according to an evolving society.\n \n \nBigot? You have some nerve pal. Bigot, extremist, racist, hypocrite . . .?\n\n \n If the shoe fits, wear it.\n \n \nSo you believe that men should be allowed to legally marry men and I am the extremist?\n\n \n The reasons you give are bigoted.\n \n \nWhen was the last time two men got together and swapped dna, and brought a new citizen into this great land?\n\n \n There is no requirement for reproduction in marriage. Mary was a surogate for God. \n \n \nMy Bible shows a man and woman becoming one flesh in the second chapter.\n\n \n It also shows talking snakes, and a man who lived in a great fish.\n \n \nThere is no male/male marriage anywhere to be found. Who is the extremist here?\n\n \n Ruth 1:14, referring to the relationship between Ruth and Naomi, mentions that \"Ruth clave onto her.\" (KJV) The Hebrew word translated here as \"clave\" is identical to that used in the description of a heterosexual marriage in Genesis 2:24: \" Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.\" (KJV)\n \n 1 Samuel 18:20-21\n \"Now Saul's daughter Michal was in love with David, and when they told Saul about it, he was pleased. 'I will give her to him', he thought, 'so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him'. Now you have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law\" (NIV)\n \n In the King James Version, the end of Verse 21 reads: \n \n \"Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law, in the one of the twain.\" (KJV)\n \n Saul's belief was that David would be so distracted by a wife that he would not be an effective fighter and would be killed by the Philistines. He offered first his daughter Merab, but that was rejected, presumably by her. Then he offered Michal. There is an interesting phrase used at the end of verse 21. In both the NIV and KJV, it would seem that David's first opportunity to be a son-in-law was with the older daughter Merab, and his second was with the younger daughter Michal. The KJV preserves the original text in its clearest form; it implies that David would become Saul's son-in-law through \"one of the twain.\" \"Twain\" means \"two\", so the verse seems to refer to one of Saul's two daughters. Unfortunately, this is a mistranslation. The underlined phrase \"the one of\" does not exist in the Hebrew original. The words are shown in italics in the King James Version; this is an admission by the translators that they made the words up. Thus, if the KJV translators had been truly honest, they would have written:\n \n \"Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law, in the twain.\"\n \n In modern English, this might be written: \"Today, you are son-in-law with two of my children\" That would refer to both his son Jonathan and his daughter Michal. The Hebrew original would appear to recognize David and Jonathan's homosexual relationship as equivalent to David and Michal's heterosexual marriage. Saul may have approved or disapproved of the same-sex relationship; but at least he appears to have recognized it. The KJV highlight their re-writing of the Hebrew original by placing the three words in italics; the NIV translation is clearly deceptive. \n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bmar.htm\n \n You should note that not everyone who gets married is a Christian zealot.\n \n \nEverything I have to say here is very predicable and very Biblical.\n\n \n No kidding that it's predictable. It is selectively Biblical, and your interpretation.\n \n \nWhat you have to say is also very predictable and most un-Biblical, and very much against everything our Creator stands for. No surprises here.\n\n \n Well then, you're going to heaven, and God will get me, so what are you worried about? \n \n \nBeing a murderer might be in your had also, or a rapist who seeks power of weaker people, or thieves who hide in the dark and take from others. Saying something is in your head is no reason or excuse.\n\n \n Not when it harms others is non-consentual, and interferes with other people's freedoms. With homosexuality, we are talking about an attraction to men or to women, we are not talking about an attraction to power or theivery.\n \n \nScripture says that they receive, \"in their own persons the due penalty of their error.\" Romans 1:27.\n\n \n What was the error though, was it the idolatry, or the homosexuality? How did God give them over to it, if they can be blamed for using their own free will.\n \n \nIt is that I can hardly believe this happened to a boy at the age of six without added information as proof.\n\n \n Doesn't make it so.\n \n \nAhhh, the fact that he turned into a suicidal homo maniac? Are we reading the same article? To me, this boy did not respond to this homo business with the same zeal you seem to have for it.\n\n \n Unfortunately, he didn't understand how to stand up to bullies.\n \n \nI live in proximity to Florida's beaches where many gay folks live and thrive, and many have died.\n\n \n And I doubt any self-respecting gay person would give you the time of day, and would not share his or her life with you.\n \n \nI understand. That is my point, that homos have less common sense than the beasts of the field.\n\n \n How do you know that gays don't have a different sence, or more intelligence?\n \n \nThey should receive special rights long before you.\n\n \n So you respect animals and the heterosexuals you compare them to, more than you respect gays.\n \n \nHere comes a homo up to the counter at the government building. He says, \"Hey, I sodomized a man last night, and I am here to collect my rights.\" Somehow your arguments fail to convince me.\n\n \n Marriage is about more than that, gay or straight.\n \n \nBut, who wants special rights for liking blue cheese?\n\n \n They want the same rights as those who enjoy green beans or steak.\n \n \nI am confident that my dead friends would love to have the ability to show you just how destructive homosexuality can be. But they are dead!\n\n \n It is not destructive. Unprotected sex is destructive. Many people could say how destructive aging is, before they die. People end up with diseases no matter how they live their lives, or by whom they are judged. Death is a fact of life. \n \n \nMany God fearing Christians out there caught the message.\n\n \n The message of fear?\n \n \nLifelong homo couples have no natural posterity of their own without taking dna from another party. That should tell you that something is wrong.\n\n \n God used a surrogate in Mary.\n \n \nHomosexual acts are not about propagation of the species.\n\n \n So?\n \n \nThey are abnormal acts specifically spoken against in Holy Scripture.\n\n \n Well, the majority aren't gay, that does not make it morally wrong however. It seems specific acts are condemned, just as specific heterosexual acts are condemned, not being gay itself is condemned.\n \n \nYou are sitting at your desk typing out homosexual propaganda in a country dominated by a majority of professing Christians.\n\n \n Not all those Christians are extremist zealots as you are. I don't live in the USA, by the way, I live in Canada. However, I thought the U.S. had the right to free speech.\n \n \nTherefore, by definition, your views are in the extreme; far, far . . . Discrimination and bigotry indeed.\n\n \n I don't think so, see above.\n \n \nHeterosexual acts are sometimes sex outside of marriage, and Biblically immoral. Homosexuality acts are ALWAYS sex outside of marriage and, Biblically immoral.\n\n \n It depends where you live, if gay acts are always outside of marriage. I don't see anyone denying heterosexuals rights because they may have had sex outside of marriage. Not everyone believes in your Bible, or else has a different interpretation, or is not selective the same way you are selective. \n \n \nDo you know a disgusting look, when you see one? What is going on inside the mind of some even older dude wearing a speedo talking about how good you look?\n\n \n Even older, and still wearing a speedo? Good for him, whether he is gay or straight. A straight guy would be applauded.\n \n \nHey, I am the first in line to agree that this homo stuff is sick.\n\n \n I find your stuff sick, does that mean you should have fewer rights?\n \n \nThey are out there right now preying on people. You people want to point fingers at me and poke fun . . . go right ahead.\n\n \n Preying on people? You are very entertaining. \n \n \nThe ex-husbands and wives left at home to take care of the abandoned children, because these sex acts are more important than anything else.\n\n \n You are just ranting and raving on now, or perhaps you doth protest too much. How do you know about their personal lives? How familiar are you with these people you claim disgust you so much?\n \n \nAnd you know what? That is their right to be out there. I can fish someplace else.\n\n \n Do you want to?\n \n \nBut, extra rights? That is nonsense.\n\n \n It's equal right to marry someone you love, not extra.\n \n \nAnother miracle. I said that it was their own stupid fault. But, you know what? It is the fault of every God-fearing Christian to allow this homo equal rights nonsense to pass as legislation. I believe that God defends this great nation from destruction from our enemies, because we stand together for what is right in His eyes, and according to His word.

And if we, as a Christian nation, allow this to happen, then we deserve the fate of my stupid family members.\n\n \n Right. You have to use fear and ignorance instead of reason, I can see that. I wouldn't elect a leader who uses tactics of fear and threats to try to control a society of frightened, unthinking, unquestioning, slaves. Such a society does not deserve to survive. \n \n \nOf course not, it was written for homos. Homosexual behavior is not the same as between a married man and woman. Those sets of behaviors have nothing at all in common. One is ordained and instituted by the Creator, and the other is held in the highest contempt. One brings forth children to God, and the other brings condemnation. The only place where these things appear the same is in the twisted mind of the homo. The typical God-fearing Christian does not buy it. Find yourself a country where homos are in the majority. But, where will the new citizens come from? Are hetero and homo marriages really equal? If so, then you guys will have no problem keeping up with the Jones.\n\n \n These are attractions to men and to women. Not everyone believes in your ideology, that does not make them twisted. It's not about making gays the majority. Are people with your ideology of extreme anti-gay right-wing Christian zealotry the majority? Who mentioned anything about keeping up with the Jones'? What does that have to do with anything?",

   "Hi Jake:\n \n \n \n \n \n The suicidal homo lad's hellish life had to be anything but 'gay.' \n \n \n \n Mom raised a child that grew up wanting to sodomize other men rather than get married and raise a family of his own. And you do not see how this can be a source of guilt for the mother. Perhaps we are getting closer to identifying specific mental traits and attributes of folks with the tendency towards homosexuality. \n \n\n \n And how exactly do you \"know\" what was in the heart of that teenager? Hmmm...\n Did you know him, did you ask him? \n How is it you have such a special insight into that teen's thoughts, desires, interests? \n How do you know anything about him?\n How is it you are so sure he wanted to sodomize anyone? \n How is it you know he never wanted a family? \n How is it you throw guilt on the mother as if she \"made\" him gay.\n How is it you are so sure she didn't try to find help for him? How is it you are so sure she didn't attempt to \"redeam\" him? \n No, you can't know. You wouldn't have the first frelling clue.\n You sit there in front of your computer, you read the exact same article as everyone else did, but suddenly you have the wisdom of the ages and miraculously know more about this teen than anyone else! \n BULL PUCKY! \n \n You're scared, you timmid, frightened and scared! \n You don't know this teen, you never met him. You don't know his mother or any member of his family. You don't even know Joe or LadyWolf or myself. \n You just sit there as pompous as you please and make ironious accusations about people you not only know nothing about, but are much more self-gratified in making wild assumptions about. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNo. That is where the homos have things screwed incorrectly into their twisted heads. Have you ever heard the phrase, \"We The People?\" They are sort of famous words you know. That includes people of every race, creed and sexual orientation. You have every right that I have under the laws of the land. You can marry, raise a family, have grandchildren, and the whole nine yards. How much more equal can it be? The homos want what is beyond the law, things that nobody here has rights over.\n\n \n Firstly, you need to stop with the epitaphs. They only make you look/read as if you are uneducated and ignorant.\n Secondly, homosexuals (ie gays/lesbians/bisexuals and transgendereds) do not have \"twisted\" heads. According to the APA and other reputable mental health groups, they are perfectly NORMAL. So just suck on that one for a while before you stick your foot in your wide open mouth again.\n Thirdly, I have serious reservations that the founding fathers ever once took homosexuals into concideration when the Constitution was drafted. I believe Good Ol' Mister Jefferson would be rolling in his grave right now to hear how you have TWISTED his insightful, but societally limited words. \n \n \n Bigot? You have some nerve pal. Bigot, extremist, racist, hypocrite . . .? So you believe that men should be allowed to legally marry men and I am the extremist? When was the last time two men got together and swapped dna, and brought a new citizen into this great land? My Bible shows a man and woman becoming one flesh in the second chapter. There is no male/male marriage anywhere to be found. Who is the extremist here?\n\n \n Your Bible (book of fables and fairie tales) also says the World is flat, The earth is the center of the Universe and that ALL SINS ARE EQUAL! \n Your Bible makes no distinction between murder, child molestation (which by the way, for your arrogantly ignorant information are MOSTLY HETEROSEXUALS), Theives or Slave owners. \n Your bible in one chapter/book says slavery is GOOD, and in another it says it's BAD.\n Hmmm...talk about contradictions? WOW!\n Your Bible also says that wearing clothes made of different fabrics is BAD.\n Your Bible says that men should not cut their hair or trim their beards.\n Your Bible says that sewing crops with different seed is BAD.\n Shall I go on? \n No, I'll let you stew on that for a while before I go on to inform you that the word; \"Homosexual\" wasn't even invented until around 1800. So it is completely IMPOSSIBLE for it to ever have been used in any of the original texts of the Bible. \n Not to mention that ancient Greek, Arabic and Latin don't even have words for HOMOSEXUALS! \n \n Now that I've settled that bit of MISINFORMATION, let me move foreward a bit.\n \n As I have stated many times before, GAYS DO AND ARE PHYSIOLOGICALLY able to have children. They are NOT sterile, although I'm beginning to believe your brain may be. \n No, of course two men together cannot biologically have a child that is only of their bodies. DUH!\n But gays do reproduce. \n How do I know this?\n I am gay, I have a BIOLOGICAL teenage son! And let me tell you, there is no way in HELL you can ever tell a teenager that he doesn't exist! That's just plain pointless.\n \n Gays also make GREAT parents! Many studies PROOVE this over and over. \n The American Pediatric Society as well as the American Psychological Association both concure. \n \n You want to talk about Extremists? \n Fine, any American Citzen descriminated against by way of not allowing access to ALL RIGHTS, LIBERTIES and PROTECTIONS is an EXTREME idea, for this country.\n Again, we build ramps for the physically disabled to ACCESS public buildings. \n What homosexuals are asking for, as is their CITIZEN right, is ACCCESS to Public Institutions, namely MARRIAGE! \n \n You are very fond of confusing religious tradition with legal terminology. The thing you have forgotten, and conveniently for your own AGENDA, is that we have something called the \"Seperation of Church and State.\"\n It says that:\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...\"\n Meaning NO ONE RELIGION CAN BE PROMOTED IN ANY WAY OVER ANY OTHER RELIGION.\n This means any LEGAL actions taken to ban gays and lesbians from equal access to the legally defined marriage institution can be taken as promotion of a specific \"Christian\" belief that gay marriages are bad. \n \n Since not all denominations of Christianity agree that gay marriage is bad, let alone any other religion, to make such laws is indeed promoting one specific religious belief over any other.\n \n emoticon_angry \n \n \nEverything I have to say here is very predicable and very Biblical. What you have to say is also very predictable and most un-Biblical, and very much against everything our Creator stands for. No surprises here. \n\n \n Yuppers you better believe that it is! \n It's also high time you pulled your head out of your arse as well. Time to understand the differences between LEGAL and RELIGIOUS!\n Our laws are indeed based in Moral Standards, but they are NOT subject to ONE SPECIFIC religion. \n \n \n \nBeing a murderer might be in your had also, or a rapist who seeks power of weaker people, or thieves who hide in the dark and take from others. Saying something is in your head is no reason or excuse. Why should we allow the facts in this case to get in the way of this lady's drawn conclusions? Scripture says that they receive, \"in their own persons the due penalty of their error.\" Romans 1:27. It is that I can hardly believe this happened to a boy at the age of six without added information as proof.\n\n \n You want to talk about facts? \n You wouldn't be able to tell a fairie tale from a fable! \n (And yes, for those who don't already know, there are disticint differences)\n You consistently interchange the term \"Fact\" with \"belief.\" The two are NOT the same.\n What you believe and what are facts may sometimes concure, but they are NOT the same things.\n FACT: Moses COULD NOT have lived to be 700yrs old as your BIBLE says.\n FACT: the WORLD IS ROUND! \n Not, flat as your Bible says it is.\n FACT: The earth is NOT the center of the universe as your Bible says it is.\n FACT: Farmers regularly rotate their crops because it is actually GOOD for the soil. They have rarely been visited by plague or famine due to their concervation techniques. \n FACT: People wear t-shirts of 50% polyester/50% cotton, and NOT ONCE have been struck down for it! \n \n Your facts are PURE FANTASY! \n \n \n \n \nAhhh, the fact that he turned into a suicidal homo maniac? Are we reading the same article? To me, this boy did not respond to this homo business with the same zeal you seem to have for it.\n\n \n I'm starting to get the feeling that maybe you did know this kid. Maybe YOU were the one who teased him in elementary school? Or where you the one who beat the shiet out of him in the boys bathroom? \n \n \n \nLies? Exactly what part of that is a lie? Paul says about homos, \"And although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.\" Romans 1:32. For anyone to teach otherwise is a lie. So, what do you expect to hear from someone like me? Again, no surprises here, I am sure.\n\n \n ROMANS 1:24-27 \n \n This passage has been used by some Christians to make an issue over how \"unrighteous\" and sinful homosexuals are. In fact, it has been used to support the view that AIDS is the \"penalty of their error which was due.\" What is fascinating about this kind of application is that it is totally at odds with what, I believe, Paul was really saying. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF ROMANS CHAPTER ONE YOU MUST READ ROMANS CHAPTERS ONE THROUGH THREE. The outline is as follows: \n \n I. The Gospel is for EVERYONE, Jews and Gentiles. (1:16) \n \n II. Why? Because God's wrath is against ALL unrighteousness. (verse 18). \n \n II. The Gentiles need the Gospel. (1:28-32) The examples of their \"uncleanness\" include idolatry and homosexual acts which are either connected to or resulting from idolatry. \n \n III. But the Jews are just as unrighteous as the Gentiles. (2:3) \n \n IV. \"All have sinned\" and are \"justified (made right with God) FREELY by God's grace (unearned love) through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ.\" (3:23-24) \n \n While Paul is certainly not favorable toward the homosexual acts that he is writing about it is interesting to note that Paul classifies them \"unclean\" which is not necessarily a \"moral\" precept. (According to the Holiness Code lobsters and shrimp are \"unclean\" also.) He may be pointing out that though the Jews are different than the Gentiles in that they are ritually \"clean\" (according to the Old Covenant) they are still just as much in need of the grace of the New Covenant. \n \n Let's look at some of the verses in this section: \n \n Verse 27b \"And receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due\". Is Paul here saying that those who committed homosexual acts were punished in some physical way...as in venereal disease? Or could \"uncleanness,\" being cut off from the Old Hebrew Covenant, be the penalty of the Gentile's error? \n \n 28 \"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to adebased mind, to do those things which are not fitting...\" People often take this to mean one of the following things: \n \n Since homosexuals didn't retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind. \n Since the Gentiles were idolatrous God gave them over to a debased mind of homosexuality. However, I believe that Paul was saying the following: \n \"Since the Gentiles did not retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a debased mind. The debased mind is NOT homosexuality but a mind that is centered on unrighteousness, hence the listing of what the Gentile mind is full of in verse 29. \n 29-32 This list of \"unrighteousness\" is being applied to all Gentiles, not Gentiles that commit homosexual sex acts. It is the Gentiles \"who are worthy of death.\" These verses are really just an exposition of verse 18. \n 26-27 Another interesting point to consider is that people often use verses 26-27 to prove that Paul used an argument from \"nature\" to prove that homosexual activity was wrong. However that kind of usage of the word \"nature\" is highly unlikely as Paul usually uses the word \"nature\" or \"natural\" to mean not what \"Mother Nature\" does but instead he means \"the previously accepted common usage\". Nature is not a great teacher about ethics and humans are nowhere called in scripture to emulate it. What is more, homosexual activity DOES go on in the animal world. \n It must be remembered also that Paul was referring to homosexual ACTS, not homosexuals. AND NO ONE KNOWS WHAT HOMOSEXUAL ACTS PAUL WAS TALKING ABOUT... NO ONE KNOWS THE BACKGROUND... We must ask ourselves \"what type of homosexual acts was Paul talking about?\" Was he talking exclusively about homosexual acts connected with idolatry? (Perhaps that was the only kind of homosexual activity he was familiar with.) Was he talking about pederasty? Was he talking about homosexual acts committed with slaves? Was he talking about people of heterosexual orientation committing homosexual acts? Just exactly what type of homosexual acts was he concerned with? Do people have the Right to just ASSUME that these verses were a blanket condemnation of homosexual sex in every context? \n In my personal opinion Paul was referring to same sex sexual acts committed in idolatrous worship by people he regarded as heterosexual. Even the most conservative theologian can only give their opinion as to what type of same sex acts Paul was referring to. No one can state that God clearly condemns all homosexuality activity based upon these verses. It is just too vague. \n \n As for me, based on the context of Paul's writing in Romans chapters 1-3 I choose to believe that God's New Covenant of grace embraces those who believe in Jesus; being a Jew doesn't make you better than a Gentile; being a heterosexual doesn't make you any better than a homosexual. Romans chapters one through three strike at the very heart of self-righteous pride. It is amazing that some Christians continue to lord their own sense of righteousness over gays and lesbians as if their heterosexual sex acts make them somehow better, or less in need of grace. We are all in need of grace and we ALL have that grace in Jesus Christ. \n \n \n \nI live in proximity to Florida's beaches where many gay folks live and thrive, and many have died. \n \n I understand. That is my point, that homos have less common sense than the beasts of the field. They should receive special rights long before you. Here comes a homo up to the counter at the government building. He says, \"Hey, I sodomized a man last night, and I am here to collect my rights.\" Somehow your arguments fail to convince me. But, who wants special rights for liking blue cheese? I am confident that my dead friends would love to have the ability to show you just how destructive homosexuality can be. But they are dead!\n\n \n I just love how you confuse Homosexuality with Promiscuous sexual activities, in general. Until you realize that even you are not 100% safe from HIV/AIDS, you will continue to put yourself at risk. STDs of any kind are from PROMISCIOUS SEXUAL ACTIVITY. That's why they are called SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES! OYE! \n \n \n \nMany God fearing Christians out there caught the message. Lifelong homo couples have no natural posterity of their own without taking dna from another party. That should tell you that something is wrong. Homosexual acts are not about propagation of the species. They are abnormal acts specifically spoken against in Holy Scripture. You are sitting at your desk typing out homosexual propaganda in a country dominated by a majority of professing Christians. Therefore, by definition, your views are in the extreme; far, far . . . Discrimination and bigotry indeed.\n\n \n Again, just because Christianity is the largest religion in the U.S. doesn't mean it's the best. That is like saying that because Islam is the fastest growing religion, world wide, that it is the best. \n We don't know that, we can't know that. We are only human, same as you.\n I know you really hate the idea that indeed homosexuals are just as human as you are, but this is the FACT!\n \n Now, lets tear apart you dilike for such words as:Bigotry, Discrimination and FACT.\n \n Bigotry: Pronunciation Key (bg-tr)\n n. \n The attitude, state of mind, or behavior characteristic of a bigot; intolerance. \n \n Source: The American Heritage\u00ae Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition\n Copyright \u00a9 2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company.\n Published by Houghton Mifflin Company.

The aspect of a case at law comprising events determined by evidence: The jury made a finding of fact. \n \n So, indeed, your advisary was correct in his assertation that you posess an atitude of bigotry and discrimination. \n I am correct in that you confuse \"belief\" with \"Fact.\"\n \n \n \nHeterosexual acts are sometimes sex outside of marriage, and Biblically immoral. Homosexuality acts are ALWAYS sex outside of marriage and, Biblically immoral.\n\n \n In that case it would only serve to make LEGAL homosexual marriage so that the sexual acts involved are no longer outside of marriage. Fairly simple actually. \n \n \nDo you know a disgusting look, when you see one? What is going on inside the mind of some even older dude wearing a speedo talking about how good you look? Hey, I am the first in line to agree that this homo stuff is sick. They are out there right now preying on people. You people want to point fingers at me and poke fun . . . go right ahead.\n\n \n Again, you are not only mistaking your beliefs for facts, but are confussiong Sexual Predators with Homosexuals. \n The two are NOT synonomous. \n Most child molesters are actually HETEROSEXUAL males. They prey on boys because of their access to them. Priests have access to alter boys, John Wayne Gacy had access to boys because he ran a lawncare business and at the time, boys were expected to take on those jobs.\n \n I'm not poking fun at all, I am pointing a finger, a finger of accusation for your lies and misconceptions. \n \n \nThe ex-husbands and wives left at home to take care of the abandoned children, because these sex acts are more important than anything else. People who have to put up with these 'homo preds,' like the ones out there on Gandy Blvd, along the waterway. And you know what? That is their right to be out there. I can fish someplace else. But, extra rights? That is nonsense. \n\n \n What of the ExPartners of those who die and are legally unable to leave anything to because of the discriminatory laws against such unions which would have not only prevented such travesties but could have protected the real victims, the children being raised in those families who are now left without one of their parents.\n To say that gays don't have children is not only blind and bigoted, but a lie. \n No more children raised in families consisted of two same gender parents are at any more risk of molestation than are children raised in families with two opposet gender parents. This is true, and factual due to the previous information I gave earlier in this post. \n \n [QUOTE-terral03]Another miracle. I said that it was their own stupid fault. But, you know what? It is the fault of every God-fearing Christian to allow this homo equal rights nonsense to pass as legislation. I believe that God defends this great nation from destruction from our enemies, because we stand together for what is right in His eyes, and according to His word.[/QUOTE]\n \n Really? So, why did God allow 9/11 to happen? Where was your GOD then?\n What sins so terrible was God punishing 3,000 INNOCENTS for? And don't even try that Jerry Fallwell pack of LIES about 9/11 being because of gays! \n That's a bold face lie which Dear'ol Jerry was forced to APOLOGIZE for!\n So, think again.\n \n \n \n Allowing same sex marriages in this country is wrong. Should that ever happen, we should expect God to remove His hand from keeping us secure. When He says that homos are worthy of death (Rom. 1:27), and we reward that deviant behavior with special rights, as a nation, then we should expect Him to shake this country from one side to the other. And if we, as a Christian nation, allow this to happen, then we deserve the fate of my stupid family members.\n\n \n Firstly, I really pity you. You hate your own family members? Wow, how arrogant can you actually get here?\n Secondly, I have already addressed the whole :\"Romans..blah, blah, blah...\" issue previously in my post here.\n \n \nOf course not, it was written for homos. Homosexual behavior is not the same as between a married man and woman. Those sets of behaviors have nothing at all in common. One is ordained and instituted by the Creator, and the other is held in the highest contempt. One brings forth children to God, and the other brings condemnation. The only place where these things appear the same is in the twisted mind of the homo. The typical God-fearing Christian does not buy it. Find yourself a country where homos are in the majority. But, where will the new citizens come from? Are hetero and homo marriages really equal? If so, then you guys will have no problem keeping up with the Jones.\n\n \n Obviously the \"Jones'\" of which you speak must be Catholics who don't use BIRTH CONTROL and have infinite stores of wealth to be able to feed all those UNPLANNED kids.\n \n GOD SAVE ME FROM HAVING MORE KIDS THAN I CAN FEED! \n \n Thank you God! \n \n Secondly, I see that you have forgotten that Jesus destroyed the Temple NOT because of gays, but because of MONEY LEANDING and IDOLITRY! Damn, you really are thick! :xbanghead \n \n GL,\n \n Terral[/QUOTE]",

   "I was just going to make you the first and only person on my ignore list, but I just can't ignore this post.\n \n \nScripture says what Scripture says. Nobody writing on this forum can change that. \n \n \n It sure does, but the problem isn't with scripture, the problem is the people interpreting it. You take an obscure, indefinate passage and you value it above Jesus's one golden commandment - Love thy neighbor as thy self.\n \n You are so full of your own righteousness that you've completely lost touch with what IMHO are the very basic tenets of Christianity. You've convinced yourself that you have the ultimate knowledge of the Bible. It seems to me there's a passage or two in their directed at that kind of arrogance as well.\n \n \nThe homos you are referring to are on the prowl out there as we speak. What is this \"in your life\" lingo? Everyone walking by must put up with their 'in your face' displays. And, yes, some members of my family have been touched by this madness, but I have a very large family, and this is a widespread problem. The fact that you see this as a negative does not speak well of homos in general. Is this the attitude you are trying to convey? Or is this just another opportunity for you to poke at a Christian? \n \n \n I don't see your family members as being gay as a negative in any way, that's only your opinion. I'm not surprised you'd interpret my statements that way, it's obviously the only opinion you're capable of forming since you are incapable of thought beyond what you interpret your Bible as telling you.\n \n Most people have very limited contact with homosexuals, so I find it very hard to believe that someone with such hatred for homosexuals would have so much contact with them \"in their life\". It's not lingo, it's a common term, just maybe not in the Bible.\n \n It's an opportunity to poke at anyone that can have such a blatant disregard for others. The hatred you have is almost unfathomable to me.\n \n \nThat is a far stretch indeed. Who said anything about irresistible? And vibes? Those are your concoctions. My words simply show that these guys will go for anybody. When these people speak about equal rights for homos, they are representing these 'homo preds' also. No thanks, I will stand with the God fearing Christians on this one. Choose your bed fellows carefully, just in case you are forced one day to sleep with them.\n\n \n The idea of homosexuals finding a grey haired Bible teacher attractive is pretty far fetched alright, I just thought I'd point that out. Of course they are my concoctions. You really are out there, I was making fun of you but you can't even understand the joke in your being so attractive to homosexuals despite your open hate for them.\n \n \"Homo preds\". What a ridiculous statement. They're \"preds\" because they find you attractive ( emoticon_confused ) and ask you out? Good thing you aren't a woman, can you imagine how many \"hetero preds\" would approach you every time you went out? \n \n Thankfully, there are some \"God fearing Christians\" here that I truly admire, Big Orn and Fisher_of _Man to name a couple, to balance out your \"Christian\" views. \n \n \nWell, if blessing someone is a sin, then I am your biggest sinner. And I am tickled that you have the opportunity to chuckle now and then. And, anyone willing to stand up and speak for what is right should also be willing to take shots from the peanut gallery. So blast away.\n \n \n You're a sinner alright. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Being blessed by you is about as meaningless a gesture as I can possibly imagine. \n \n Save it.\n \n Waxy",

   "Terrel03: \n \n I certainly hope that one day you will learn to look beyond the literal translations of the Bible, that you have so steadfastedly preached. \n It's truly sad that you have been completely unaware of the myriad of posibilities of mistranslations.\n \n Here are a few chapters and verses for you mull over:\n \n Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 \n \n Leviticus 18:22 states: \"Thou shall not lie with mankind as with womankind: it is abomination.\" The term abomination (to'ebah) is a religious term, usually reserved for use against idolatry; it does not mean a moral evil. The verse seems to refer to temple prostitution, which was a common practice in the rest of the Middle East at that time. Qadesh referred to male religious prostitutes. \n \n Leviticus 20:13 states: \"If a man also lie with mankind as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they should surely be put to death....\". The passage is surrounded by prohibitions against incest, bestiality, adultery and intercourse during a woman's period. But this verse is the only one in the series which uses the religious term abomination; it seems also to be directed against temple prostitution. \n \n These passages are part of the Jewish Holiness Code which also: \n \u0095 permits polygamy \n \u0095 prohibits sexual intercourse when a woman has her period, \n \u0095 bans tattoos \n \u0095 prohibits eating rare meat \n \u0095 bans wearing clothes that are made from a blend of textiles \n \u0095 prohibits cross-breeding livestock \n \u0095 bans sowing a field with mixed seed \n \u0095 prohibits eating pigs, rabbits, or some forms of seafood \n \u0095 requires Saturday to be reserved as the Sabbath\n \n \n Churches have abandoned the Holiness Code; it is no longer binding on modern-day Christians. They can wear tattoos, eat shrimp, wear polyester-cotton blends and engage in temple prostitution without violating this particular section of the Bible. Although this code is obsolete for Christians, many clergy still focus on those passages which deal with homosexuality.\n \n \n \n Romans 1: 26-27 \n \n Romans 1:26 and 27, at first glance, appears to condemn gay and lesbian activity. Paul criticizes sexual activity which is against a person's nature or disposition. But in Greek society of the time, homosexuality and bisexuality was regarded as a natural activity for some people. Thus Paul might have been criticizing heterosexuals who were engaged in homosexual activities against their nature. He might not be referring to homosexuals or bisexuals at all. \n The verses preceding 26 might indicate that he was referring to sexual acts associated with idol worship. The verse is too vague to be interpreted as a blanket prohibition of all same-sex activities.\n \n ROMANS 1:24-27 \n This passage has been used by some Christians to make an issue over how \"unrighteous\" and sinful homosexuals are. In fact, it has been used to support the view that AIDS is the \"penalty of their error which was due.\" What is fascinating about this kind of application is that it is totally at odds with what, I believe, Paul was really saying. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF ROMANS CHAPTER ONE YOU MUST READ ROMANS CHAPTERS ONE THROUGH THREE. \n \n The outline is as follows: \n \n I. The Gospel is for EVERYONE, Jews and Gentiles. (1:16) \n II. Why? Because God's wrath is against ALL unrighteousness. (verse 18). \n II. The Gentiles need the Gospel. (1:28-32) The examples of their \"uncleanness\" include idolatry and homosexual acts which are either connected to or resulting from idolatry. \n III. But the Jews are just as unrighteous as the Gentiles. (2:3) \n IV. \"All have sinned\" and are \"justified (made right with God) FREELY by God's grace (unearned love) through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ.\" (3:23-24) \n \n While Paul is certainly not favorable toward the homosexual acts that he is writing about it is interesting to note that Paul classifies them \"unclean\" which is not necessarily a \"moral\" precept. (According to the Holiness Code lobsters and shrimp are \"unclean\" also.) He may be pointing out that though the Jews are different than the Gentiles in that they are ritually \"clean\" (according to the Old Covenant) they are still just as much in need of the grace of the New Covenant. \n \n Let's look at some of the verses in this section: \n \n Verse 27b \"And receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due\". Is Paul here saying that those who committed homosexual acts were punished in some physical way...as in venereal disease? Or could \"uncleanness,\" being cut off from the Old Hebrew Covenant, be the penalty of the Gentile's error? \n 28 \"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to adebased mind, to do those things which are not fitting...\" People often take this to mean one of the following things: \n \u0095 Since homosexuals didn't retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind. \n \u0095 Since the Gentiles were idolatrous God gave them over to a debased mind of homosexuality. However, I believe that Paul was saying the following: \n \u0095 \"Since the Gentiles did not retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a debased mind. The debased mind is NOT homosexuality but a mind that is centered on unrighteousness, hence the listing of what the Gentile mind is full of in verse 29. \n \u0095 29-32 This list of \"unrighteousness\" is being applied to all Gentiles, not Gentiles that commit homosexual sex acts. It is the Gentiles \"who are worthy of death.\" These verses are really just an exposition of verse 18. \n \u0095 26-27 Another interesting point to consider is that people often use verses 26-27 to prove that Paul used an argument from \"nature\" to prove that homosexual activity was wrong. However that kind of usage of the word \"nature\" is highly unlikely as Paul usually uses the word \"nature\" or \"natural\" to mean not what \"Mother Nature\" does but instead he means \"the previously accepted common usage\". Nature is not a great teacher about ethics and humans are nowhere called in scripture to emulate it. What is more, homosexual activity DOES go on in the animal world. \n It must be remembered also that Paul was referring to homosexual ACTS, not homosexuals. AND NO ONE KNOWS WHAT HOMOSEXUAL ACTS PAUL WAS TALKING ABOUT... NO ONE KNOWS THE BACKGROUND... We must ask ourselves \"what type of homosexual acts was Paul talking about?\" Was he talking exclusively about homosexual acts connected with idolatry? (Perhaps that was the only kind of homosexual activity he was familiar with.) Was he talking about pederasty? Was he talking about homosexual acts committed with slaves? Was he talking about people of heterosexual orientation committing homosexual acts? Just exactly what type of homosexual acts was he concerned with? Do people have the Right to just ASSUME that these verses were a blanket condemnation of homosexual sex in every context? \n In my personal opinion Paul was referring to same sex sexual acts committed in idolatrous worship by people he regarded as heterosexual. Even the most conservative theologian can only give their opinion as to what type of same sex acts Paul was referring to. No one can state that God clearly condemns all homosexuality activity based upon these verses. It is just too vague. \n As for me, based on the context of Paul's writing in Romans chapters 1-3 I choose to believe that God's New Covenant of grace embraces those who believe in Jesus; being a Jew doesn't make you better than a Gentile; being a heterosexual doesn't make you any better than a homosexual. Romans chapters one through three strike at the very heart of self-righteous pride. It is amazing that some Christians continue to lord their own sense of righteousness over gays and lesbians as if their heterosexual sex acts make them somehow better, or less in need of grace. We are all in need of grace and we ALL have that grace in Jesus Christ.\n \n I Corinthians 6:9 \n \n I Cor 6:9 Paul lists a many activities that will prevent people from inheriting the Kingdom of God. One has been variously translated as effeminate, homosexuals, or sexual perverts. The original Greek text reads malakoi arsenokoitai. The first word means soft; the meaning of the second word has been lost. It was once used to refer to a male temple prostitute (as in the verses from the Hebrew Scriptures/Old Testament described above). The early Church interpreted the phrase as referring to people of soft morals; i.e. unethical. From the time of Martin Luther, it was interpreted as referring to masturbation . More recently, it has been translated as referring to homosexuals . Each Translator seem to take whatever activity that their society particularly disapproves of and use it in this verse.\n (Yes, I know I've posted this portion before.  )\n \n I CORINTHIANS 6:9-10 \n It is amazing the number of times that you will see the word \"sodomite\" or \"homosexual\" or \"pervert\" in different translations concerning this text. It is amazing because no one knows exactly what the words of the original text mean! The layperson, unfortunately, has no way of knowing that interpreters are guessing as to the exact meaning of these words. Pastors and laypersons often have to rely upon the authority of those who have written lexicons (dictionaries explaining the meaning of words) of Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic words. The authors of scriptural lexicons search for the meaning of the word within the scriptures themselves and also go outside of scripture and research literature written around the same time the scriptures were written. If the interpreter is already prejudiced against homosexuality they can translate these words as condemning homosexual sex even based upon little usage of that word in the Scriptures and little if any contemporaneous usage of that word. \n The truth is that the word some translators \"transform\" into \"sodomite/homosexual/pervert\" in I Corinthians 6:9-10 is actually TWO words. Some translators combine them because they \"think\" they go together but they DO NOT KNOW. This uncertainty is reflected in the fact that other translators keep the words separate and translate them \"effeminate\" and \"abusers of themselves with mankind\". \n \n The two words in the original Greek are \"malakoi\" and \"arsenokoitai\". Malakoi is a very common Greek word. It literally means \"soft\". It is used in Matthew 11:7-18 and Luke 7:24-25 in reference to soft clothing. Scholars have to look at material outside of the Bible in order to try and figure out just what this means. The early church Fathers used the word to mean someone who was \"weak\" or \"soft\" in their morals and from the time of the reformation to the 20th century it was usually interpreted as masturbation. In Greek this word never is applied to gay people or homosexual acts in general. \"No new textual data effected the twentieth-century change in translation of this word: only a shift in popular morality. Since few people any longer regard masturbation as the sort of activity which would preclude entrance to heaven, the condemnation has simply been transferred to a group still so widely despised that their exclusion does not trouble translators or theologians.\" (See Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality, John Boswell, University of Chicago Press, 1980, page 105-107) \"Arsenokoitai\" is discussed in the next section as it is found here and in I Timothy 1:8-11. \n Note: Greek contained no word which compares to the English noun \"homosexual\" meaning someone of homosexual orientation. In fact the word \"homosexual\" (meaning someone of homosexual orientation) was not even coined until the late 1800'S by German psychologists, and introduced into English only at the beginning of the 1900's. \n However, during scriptural times there were a number of Greek words to describe homosexual sex acts and the two words \"malakois\" and \"arsenokoitai\" do not appear among them.\n \n Genesis 18 - 19 \n \n Genesis 19 describes how two angels visited Sodom and were welcomed into Lot's house. The men of the city gathered around the house and demanded that Lot send the visitors to the mob so that they might know the angels. [The Hebrew verb yada (to know) is ambiguous. It appears 943 times in the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament). In only about a dozen of these cases does it refers to sexual activity; it is not clear whether the mob wanted to rape the angels or to meet with them, and perhaps attack them physically. From the context, it is obvious that their mood was not friendly ]. \n Lot refused, but offered his two virgin daughters to be heterosexually raped if that would appease the mob. The offer was declined. God decided to destroy the city because of the wickedness of its inhabitants. The angels urged Lot and his family to flee and to not look back. Unfortunately, Lot's wife looked the wrong way, so God killed her because of her curiosity. \n God was apparently not critical of Lot for offering his two daughters to be raped. However, God was angry at the other inhabitants of the town. He destroyed Sodom with fire and brimstone (sulfur). He presumably killed all of the men in the mob, their wives and other adults, as well as children, infants, newborns, etc. It is unclear from these few verses whether God demolished the city because the citizens: \n 1. were uncharitable and abusive to strangers \n 2. wanted to rape people \n 3. engaged in homosexual acts. \n The Church has traditionally accepted the third explanation. In fact, the term sodomy which means anal intercourse is derived from the name of the city, Sodom. But the first explanation is clearly the correct one. As recorded in Matthew 10:14-15 and Luke 10:7-16, Jesus implied that the sin of the people of Sodom was to be inhospitable to strangers. In Ezekeiel 16:48-50, God states clearly that he destroyed Sodom's sins because of their pride, their excess of food while the poor and needy suffered, and worshiped many idols; sexual activity is not even mentioned. Jude disagreed with God; he wrote that Sodom's sins were sexual in nature. Various biblical translations describe the sin as fornication, going after strange flesh, sexual immorality, perverted sensuality, homosexuality, lust of every kind, immoral acts and unnatural lust; you can take your pick. \n We are faced with the inescapable and rather amusing conclusion that the condemned activities in Sodom had nothing to do with sodomy.\n The story of Sodom and Gomorrah actually condemns inhospitality and idolatry, not homosexuality. Read the Scriptural cross-references: Deuteronomy 29:23, Isaiah 1:9, Jeremiah 23:14, Lamentations 4:6, Ezekiel 16:49-50, Amos 4:11, Zephaniah 2:9, Matthew 10:15 / Luke 10:12, Luke 17:29, Romans 9:29, Jude v.7, Revelation 11:8 \n NOWHERE in the Scriptures does it say that the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was homosexual sex. Even if the specific point of the story was concerning a sexual matter, rather than hospitality, the issue is rape not homosexuality. Jesus claimed the issue was simply one of showing hospitality to strangers (Luke 10:12). How ironic that those who discriminate against homosexuals seem to be the true practitioners of the sin of Sodom.\n \n Deuteronomy 23:17 \n \n Deuteronomy 23:17 states (in the King James Version) \"There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel . This is an \"error\" by the authors of the KJV. The word qadesh in the original text was mistranslated as sodomite. Quadesh means \"holy one\" and is here used to refer to a man who engages in ritual prostitution in the temple. There is little evidence that the prostitutes engaged in sexual activities with men. Other Bible translations use accurate terms such as shrine prostitute, temple prostitute, prostitute and cult prostitute.\n \n In this passage, the actual word that is being translated is \"qadesh\" which means \"holy one\" or \"someone set apart for a holy purpose.\" In this case the word is referring to people who commit ritual acts of prostitution in order to honor their deity. The clearest translation of this concept would simply be \"temple or ritual prostitute\". For example, Deuteronomy 23:17 should be translated thusly: \"There shall be no ritual prostitute of the daughters of Israel, or a ritual prostitute of the sons of Israel\". Any translation which translates qadesh as pervert or sodomite is blatantly mistranslating. An example which shows this clearly is found in the New King James version which translates qadesh in its male form as 'perverted one' but translates qadesh in its female form as 'ritual harlot', both should be 'ritual harlot or prostitute!'\n \n It's really pathetic that so many supposed \"Christians\" choose to read one passage, claim it means to be against homosexuality, but completely ignor other passages which contradict their belief.\n \n Maybe it's time to stop the usage of the Bible as an excuse for the very human emotion of hatred.",
