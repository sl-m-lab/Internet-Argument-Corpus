There is still time! The Energy Element can still save you. He is the Truth. He is the ultimate supreme. He is a he...i'm sure of it.\n \n I have time-honored scripture to back my relgion. I abide by the most ancient book - \"The Energy Man's Superlicious Plan.\" It is over 30,000 years old. The original still exists - you can see it engraved on the bottom of the pacific ocean sea floor. Some claim the engravings are just random lines. But they are wrong. Why? Look at the amazing commandments the Energy Element has given us:\n \n 1) Thou shalt do the right thing.\n 2) Thou shalt not do the wrong thing.\n 3) Homosexual behavior start with an \"H\" when written in modern english.\n 4) Drinking is a gerund.\n 5) Thou shalt do this and do that.\n 6) Thou shalt not do this and do that.\n 7) Thou shalt avoid any obvious contradictions made.\n 8) Thou art an XXX...et of God.\n 9) There shalt be no other God other that Me.\n 10) Commandment nine shalt not be considered an affirmation of religion when applied in a political context.\n \n How dare you deny our savior, the Lord and Energy's Element's son, the Water?\n \n Worship the holy trinity of Energy, Water, and Boogieman.\n \n There is still time! May water save you! \n \n -He who drinks water worships me. (Balthasour, 10.148.12875)",
