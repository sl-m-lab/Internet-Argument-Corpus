Now what we dont have at a movie theater is a killer detector, no one has any kind of pre-warning devices that let you know someone is coming to the theater to start killing people, and in case you havent noticed, the theater already places fire extenguishers throughout the building just in case of a fire. Your comparison of guns to fire-extinguishers showed a complete lack of commonsense thinking. A famous quote\" God created man, but Sam Colt made him equall\". Also Sinjin, you asked why was the bear angry, another lack of commonsense in that question, the bear is angry just because he is there, just as killer bees get angry and attack just because one is near their hive.

Everything is illegal in California, the laws out there only work in favor of homo-sexuals and gun haters, and dont try to tell me this aint so because I tried living in California for a while. As far as deleating the 2nd amendment, you will never accomplish it.
