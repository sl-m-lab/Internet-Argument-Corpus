   "  Tiahrt to Holder: Read the Tiahrt Amendment before Drawing False Conclusions \n \"Attorney General Holder should read the Tiahrt amendment before giving any further misleading comments about it,\" said Tiahrt. \"Given what the attorney general stated before Congress this week, I am concerned this administration is relying more on talking points from liberal special interest groups rather than on the facts. Instead of drawing false conclusions about the Tiahrt amendment, the attorney general should lend his full support for my trace data language that protects law enforcement officers and honors the privacy rights of law-abiding American citizens.\n \n \"The intent of my trace data amendment has always been to protect those who protect us. The language approved by Congress explicitly states that law enforcement officials are to be given full access to firearm trace data.\n \"My amendment also protects the privacy rights of firearm owners all across America. Just as we protect the privacy of medical and financial records, we should also protect the privacy of law-abiding citizens who exercise their 2nd Amendment right to own a firearm. Publicly disclosing who owns a firearm would only benefit thieves and criminals intent on doing harm to our families and property. \n ...\n The ATF and law enforcement groups, including the Fraternal Order of Police, the world's largest law enforcement organization of sworn law enforcement officers, oppose public disclosure of sensitive firearm trace data because it could jeopardize ongoing investigations and endanger officers' lives. They asked Tiahrt to protect the integrity of trace data in 2003 and have supported retention of the trace data language each year since. \n",

   "\n \"The language approved by Congress explicitly states that law enforcement officials are to be given full access to firearm trace data.\"\n \n\n So it is claimed.\n \n \nThe Tiahrt Amendments, named for their original sponsor, U.S. Representative Todd Tiahrt (R-KS), are provisions attached to federal spending bills that make it harder for law enforcement officers to aggressively pursue criminals who buy and sell illegal guns.\n \n * The amendments restrict cities, states and even the police from fully accessing and using Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) gun \n trace data, which can show where illegal guns are coming from, who buys them and how they get trafficked across state lines and into our communities. \n Learn More\n * The Tiahrt provisions require the Federal Bureau of Investigation to destroy certain background check records within 24 hours, making it nearly impossible \n to use those records to help solve crimes or to identify gun buyers with criminal histories who were mistakenly approved. Learn More\n * The Tiahrt Amendments also block ATF from requiring gun dealers to conduct inventory checks to detect loss and theft, which law enforcement says is a \n dangerous back channel source for criminals who are in the market for illegal guns. Learn More\n \n For years, the Tiahrt Amendments have been standing in the way of law enforcement efforts to stop the flow of illegal guns to criminals. But now, a coalition of 350 mayors and 200 police chiefs have called for repealing these damaging restrictions. \n\n Tiahrt Amendment Facts | ProtectPolice.org\n \n I've noticed a pattern. Pro-gun activists give lip service to the idea of enforcing the law and catching the bad guys while supporting legislation that actually makes it harder for law enforcement to do so. They send a mixed message. It's happened before such as when the NRA has lobbied Congress to reduce the budget of the ATF. How can reducing the budget of law enforcement help them do their job better? It gives us a clue to what the gun lobby's true motives are. Truly disturbing.",

   "Well first of all, ProtectPolice.org is part of the anti-gun org of anti gun mayors! \n So what would you expect from people who want to sue the 2nd Amendment out of our Constitution. \n   About ProtectPolice.org & Mayors Against Illegal Guns \n ProtectPolice.org is a project of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a bi-partisan coalition of more than 350 mayors in more than 40 states.\n\n What you want is a special privilege to use OUR courts to make it just as expensive as humanly possible to participate in our Inalienable Right to Keep and Bear Arms! Sue the Gun Makers for making a legal Produce, sue the Gun Shops who must get the FBI's permission in order to sell a gun to an American Citizen. \n \n There is a whole Federal Police force that is part of the FBI, policing the commercial activities of the 2nd Amendment, but you guys are not satisfied. Your side HATES the way they do their jobs and you and the Illegal Mayors want to do their jobs for them!\n \n   Amateur Hour \n While announcing his lawsuit against 15 gun dealers, the mayor said ATF was \"asleep at the switch.\" He implied the same in his recent congressional testimony. Those comments are insulting to the hard-working men and women of ATF.\n \n Far worse than verbal insults, reports indicate his sting operation has jeopardized over a dozen ongoing criminal investigations, putting law enforcement officers at risk. A suspect who suddenly finds out that a gun store he frequents is under surveillance will likely stop his activities. He also could violently turn on anyone he believes is an investigator; shop owners and employees are potential targets, too. The few gun storeowners who are corrupt will be on their best behavior. Suspects and evidence may disappear, with weeks or months of investigative work being lost.\n \n The number of defendants referred by ATF for prosecutions is up 170% since 2000, with a 14% increase in the number of convictions for illegal firearms trafficking in just the past year. ATF is not \"asleep at the switch,\" and the people of New York need to know it.\n\n Which the ATF, after viewing Bloomberg's evidence said, nothing that Bloomberg had had on tape, had risen to a level of a crime!",

   "So it is claimed.\n\n \n And rightfully so. I'll prove it with the exact legislation.\n \n \nThat no funds appropriated under this or any other Act with respect to any fiscal year may be used to disclose part or all of the contents of the Firearms Trace System database maintained by the National Trace Center of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives or any information required to be kept by licensees pursuant to section 923(g) of title 18, United States Code, or required to be reported pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (7) of such section 923(g), to anyone other than a Federal, State or local law enforcement agency or a prosecutor solely in connection with and for use in a bona fide criminal investigation or prosecution and then only such information as pertains to the geographic jurisdiction of the law enforcement agency requesting the disclosure and not for use in any civil action or proceeding other than an action or proceeding commenced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, or a review of such an action or proceeding, to enforce the provisions of chapter 44 of such title, and all such data shall be immune from legal process and shall not be subject to subpoena or other discovery in any civil action in a State or Federal court or in any administrative proceeding other than a proceeding commenced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to enforce the provisions of that chapter, or a review of such an action or proceeding; except that this proviso shall not be construed to prevent the disclosure of statistical information concerning total production, importation, and exportation by each licensed importer (as defined in section 921(a)(9) of such title) and licensed manufacturer (as defined in section 921(a)(10) of such title):''.\n\n \n \nTiahrt Amendment Facts | ProtectPolice.org\n\n \n That group is owned by Bloomberg's mob squad. You remember Bloomberg, right? The mayor that got in hot water with the ATF and told that his actions amounted to criminal actions?\n \n \nI've noticed a pattern. Pro-gun activists give lip service to the idea of enforcing the law and catching the bad guys while supporting legislation that actually makes it harder for law enforcement to do so.\n \n \n I've noticed a pattern too. You come on about once a month, spread a bunch of bull, and then run like to hide where it's safe and contradicting opinions can't reach you.\n \n \nHow can reducing the budget of law enforcement help them do their job better?\n\n \n It'll force them to focus more on actual crimes rather than harassment tactics.",

You come on about once a month, spread a bunch of bull, and then run like to hide where it's safe and contradicting opinions can't reach you.\n \n It'll force them to focus more on actual crimes rather than harassment tactics.\n\n \n The major problem for the anti freedom lobby is the total failure to explain the selective enforcement of existing laws. For instance the Bloomberg thugs who made straw puchases were not prosecuted. Nor was Bloomberg charged with conspiracy as he should have. In the VPC drivel they note one straw purchaser who when questioned by the ATF gave up the person who paid her to become a straw purchaser. Yet she was not prosecuted for being a straw purchaser. It begs the question of why not? At the very least a successful prosecution would remove one straw purchaser from the potential poll. \n \n You are entirely correct in that the star struck one posts and then scampers for the bunkers. \n \n If any thing this load of barn jelly proves that our pourous border is a danger to both countries. Although why neither party will close it is beyond comprehension. What does it take to close the border? A nuclear detonation in one of our cities?",

England has the kind of gun control you want. \n \n   Weapons sell for just \u00a350 as suspects and victims grow ever younger \n Senior police officers have been warning for several months that a growing number of teenagers in big cities are becoming involved in gun crime. \n \n The age of victims and suspects has fallen over the past three years as the availability of firearms in some cities has risen. \n \n \"Illegal firearms have become increasingly accessible to younger offenders who appear more likely to use these firearms recklessly,\" a report on gun crime commissioned by the Home Office cautioned last year.\n\n England & Aust gun studies \n   Shotguns for \u00a350: study reveals weapons culture  \n Sawn-off shotguns are still the weapon of choice for the more serious armed criminal and can now be bought illegally for between \u00a350 and \u00a3200, according to Home Office research. A purpose-built 9mm handgun, which is easier to conceal than a shotgun, is available for \u00a31,000-\u00a31,400 on the back streets of Britain while those wanting \"a gangster image\" can buy a  machine gun  for \u00a3800.\n \n Even though those interviewed were in prison, many still viewed gun crime as a \"viable career option\" enabling them to overcome their deprived backgrounds to secure wealth and status. One man from Greater Manchester claimed he had earned \u00a352,000 in a week from gun crime. The study shows that though Nottingham is dubbed Britain's gun crime capital, guns are far more available in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and London.\n\n \n Here is another report produced by Australian Institute of Criminology here called   Weapons, drugs and crime Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) \n \n And a article about is in the report here.\n Link  Australian Institute of Criminology study -- Tough new weapons laws 'miss hard core of criminal underworld' \nCANBERRA - The introduction of tough laws to control guns and knives appears to be failing to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of Australian criminals. .... reported that while new laws may have helped reduce the number of knives and guns in illicit circulation,  they have failed to deter hard-core criminals. It also pointed to a large firearms black market.  \n\n \n Gun Control is NOT Crime Control!",
