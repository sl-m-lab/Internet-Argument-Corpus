   "The context of the topic is the legality of abortion. Some individuals believe it should be legal... others believe it should be illegal. Some individuals believe every woman has the 'right to choose.' And other individuals believe that every child has the 'right to live.' These are both valid perspectives. \n \n While no one can force anyone else to do anything, I respectfully ask all debaters on this forum to refer to each 'camp' of thought by their preferred labels, which are 'Pro-Choice' and 'Pro-Life.' Using terms such as 'Anti-choice' or 'Anti-life' are not constructive in an intelligent debate, in my opinion.\n \n If the preferred terms are not used, then perhaps you may wish to consider this: In a debate about making or keeping X legal, some people may believe that X should be legal... other people may believe that X should not be legal. In this simple example, the most neutral terms to label each camp would be 'Pro-X' and 'Anti-X.' Both camps would argue that 'Pro-abortion' and 'Anti-abortion' do not accurately communicate their beliefs, and so, it follows reasonably that each camp be labeled with their preferred terms.\n \n If you have a reasonable argument for labeling one camp or the other with terms other than their preferred terms, feel free to discuss them in this thread.",
