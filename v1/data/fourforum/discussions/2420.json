   "The president of the Iraqi Governing Council was killed just a few hours ago in Baghdad when a car bomb exploded killing 7 other people as well. This latest attack in Iraq exemplifies the uncertainty and chaos that indefinitely exists. With increasing tensions from photos of Abu Ghraib prison, questions of wider abuse, infrastructural damage, resources and manpower depleting, and mounting coalition and civilian casualties, the grim picture of Iraq just seems to worsen. We should see this latest attack unfold with more clarification today, as we witness just another part of the struggle in this quagmire we refer to as Iraq.\n \n Remi",

   "He was not the first, and certainly will not be the last. Makes me wonder when the Iraqi people will stand up and with one loud voice condemn the XXXXXX among them who continue to make Iraq a war zone. It seems to me that perhaps they would be smart enough, even if they are of an anti-coalition mindset to understand that if they just behave like good little citizens for about 5 or 6 months we will leave and then they can rip the country apart in a bloody civil war if that's what they want. I support the war, and I have been in agreement for a long time that we need to stay the course, but my opinion is starting to change. It seems to me that if these people really want democracy and peace, they should be standing up and fighting for it. Democracy that is forced upon them has no realistic chance of lasting. Democracy fought for by the people is the only way it will endure. If they don't want to chip in and make a contribution, perhaps we just need to let them fall on their face. It would force them to make a choice, cower under again to another regime like Saddam's, or fight for a democratic and free society. But then again, one has to wonder if democracy can ever work in a country where the religious leaders (clerics) have the influence to tell the people what to believe and do.",

Our government has, through official press releases fueled by media publishing geared towards patriotic emotion (the very same press many patriotic Americans label liberal if the reporting is slanted against the current administration) managed to leave a majority of Americans still believing there was a direct connection between Iraq and 9/11 while turning Saddam and all Muslim related foreign culture into monsters threatening the American Christian way of life. The fruitless search for WMD turned into liberating Iraq from a despotic dictator and instilling democracy has backfired and our arrogance, on national and personal levels, has kicked liberation in the ditch in favor of 'those ungrateful blankety blanks'. We're now comparing the beheading of one US contractor to what looks like widespread abuse and torture of Iraqis by our military in an effort to show we're still wearing the White Hat, albeit somewhat discolored at this point, while systematically destroying what's left of civilian property in a witch hunt for foreign fighters, said by our government to be the primary cause of Iraqi Nationalism and resistance to our occupation. When expressing disbelief, consider this as the same public, different generation that initially supported our attempt to instill democracy in Vietnam to stem the Domino Effect of communism in SE Asia. That expedition cost us 50,000 American lifes and who knows how many Vietnamese, only to leave clinging to the skids of helicopters.",
