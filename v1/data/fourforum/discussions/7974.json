   "http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=49813\n \n Society is never going to change its discriminatory ways towards gays and lesbians unless parents stop reacting to things like this in such a negative manner. They would have nothing to say if this were a book about a prince and princess getting married. \n Some will say that this is inappropriate for this age of children but I totally disagree. It was not about sex, it was about a prince that didn't like girls, fell in love with another prince and got married to him. So what? \n I have known many children that have known about boys likeing boys and girls likeing girls since they were very young. They are older now and are the most well adjusted, non-judgemental, kind young adults you would ever want to meet. \n And straight, in case your wondering. The parents say that they would like the opportunity to explain there views about this subject to the child. This is the problem, the parents want to instll bigotry and discimination into there children. Children should learn from the beginning that some girls and boys like each other, sometimes girls and girls and boys and boys like each other just like the boys and girls do. I commend those parents that do actually teach tolerance and acceptance.",

I see no point in it.\n There are a lot of things people can see as \"controversial\". Some should probably not be presented to 2nd graders. Some are \"controversial\" because some XXXXXX make them so, and the children of those XXXXXX can be catered to, but in no way should that require that no 2nd grader hear about it.\n \n Satisfied?\n \n \n \nAre you familiar with logical fallacies? Do you not realize that by expecting me to prove they weren't bigoted when you've claimed they are (without proof), you are asking me to prove a negative?\n\n Do you know what \"proving a negative\" actually means with regards to logical fallacies?\n Your response demonstrates that you don't.\n If I asked you to prove that God doesn't exist, that would be requiring a negative proof.\n If I asked you to prove that John wasn't at the bar on Saturday night, and he spent the entire week-end in jail, some would claim that would also be asking for proof of a \"negative\", but obviously it COULD BE PROVED.\n \n Likewise, if you can show a NON-BIGOTTED motivation for this couple, and PROVE that non-bigotted motivation, THAT would be proof.\n \n So don't try to malign \"logical fallacies\" in your efforts to avoid proving this.\n \n And ironically, do you realize your argument would have defended my position in the whole \"egg roll\" thing???? Ever think about that???\n \n \n \nNo, you don't have to prove your assertion that it was bigotry that motivated these parents, but without it, it's hard to take your accusations seriously.\n\n <snort<\n YOU are never going to take any assertion that disagrees with you seriously.\n That was proven in the egg roll thing.\n I had a very simple assertion. Like a \"red car\" needs to be both \"red\" and a \"car\", a \"political message\" needs to be both \"political\" and a \"message\".\n Yet in all of that, I don't think you saw my position \"seriously\" at all....\n \n \n \nYou're basically saying here \"they're bigoted, now prove they're not.\" I'm saying, you gotta first prove their bigoted. Otherwise, why should I believe you? (shrug)\n\n MAN you lie like a rug!\n I'm saying \"I THINK they're bigotted, and this is why...\n If you CLAIM they aren't bigotted, and you want others to take you seriously, you need to provide the SAME PROOF that you demand from others.\"\n \n \n \nSome homeschooled familes are one such example. Another is this case. Sometimes parents just don't want their kids around a lot of controversy. And it stands to reason that they know their kids best. (and by the way, this was in the news on general sites too, before you start in on it being WorldnetDaily.)\n\n I was VERY EXPLICIT in my request.\n And you continue to be disingenuous in obfuscating your response...\n \n \nHave you ever heard of a situation where parents insisted their kids not be taught about homosexuality, because the parents wanted to insist that it be they who teach their kid about homosexuality in a manner devoid of prejudice, while teaching all sides of the issue?\n\n Your responses do not even say ANYTHING about homosexuality, and thus are completely non-topical and irrelevant to my question.\n \n Why don't you scrounge up some honesty, and actually just say \"No. I don't have any specific and verifiable examples of what you ask...\"\n \n \n \nI don't think I've dodged your question. I really do believe the parents in the article here are an example of what you're asking for.\n I am not lying, and it amazes me that you accuse me of such when I can prove my claim so readily...\n\n Of course you don't \"think\"...\n ... that you dodged my question.\n You keep answering with things that aren't what I asked for.\n It's like asking: \"What's 2+2?\", and you answer \"Green\".\n I asked for the following: \"Have you ever heard of a situation where parents insisted their kids not be taught about homosexuality, because the parents wanted to insist that it be they who teach their kid about homosexuality in a manner devoid of prejudice, while teaching all sides of the issue?\"\n \n You have shown NO EVIDENCE that they want their kid out of this class \"because the parents wanted to insist that it be they who teach their kid about homosexuality in a manner devoid of prejudice, while teaching all sides of the issue\".\n \n Until you do, it's like asking for proof of Santa Clause, and you reply that you think he's in a Dairy Queen in Kentucky...\n (But supply no proof of your claim...)\n \n \n \nThe point is that I'm not the one making that statement or using that term (\"crashed\"). No, I think the title went over the top in this case, but the article itself was good, I thought.\n\n So you claimed that the article summed it up quite nicely, but said ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the title...\n ... which you now claim \"went over the top\"...\n \n Well, I guess your backpedalling on that is about as good as we can expect...\n \n Now if we can just get you to admit that the anti-gay families involved were egregious in their protest, THAT would be something...",

YOU used something worldnet said to \"prove\" the parents were bigoted, and of course that doesn't work. You are SO trying to obfuscate here, it's hilarious. \n \n \nSo you're advocating that we hide all reality for \"controversial issues\" from 2nd graders?\n Is that what you're advocating?\n\n \n Tell you what, see if you can go back through my posts and find where I claimed that we should hide \"ALL reality\" for controversial issues from 2nd graders. That way at least you will have done your homework and it will help you aviod asking embarassing questions that are all-to-easy to verify, as in this case.\n \n That said, I see no good reason to drag 2nd graders into the issue of abortion, the death penalty (\"gee dad, how DO they execute criminals?\"), homosexuality, or any other controversial social issue.

Stick your head in the sand?\n\n \n Dude, that can be done in a way they can understand, on their level! You don't have to go into the ins-and-outs of homosexuality or give them a lesson on the differences between heterosexuals and homosexuals. Suffice it to say that 2nd Graders are going to be fine with simply the explanation that \"Joey has two dads\" or \"Billy has 2 moms.\" Those aren't statements about sexuality. There's not even any indication that \"Joey's dads\" are in a homosexual relationship. Of course, I get the impression you'd want to make sure they know it.

Yes, that's expecting me to prove a negative. Would you like a link to a site explaining logical fallacies so you can read up on them?\n \n I don't need to prove something based on what YOU'VE asserted. Again, it's like you making an argument that the earth is flat and expecting everyone else to prove it's round. Why should you not be expected to prove your premise to even be taken seriously? \n \n \nI had a very simple assertion.

Yet in all of that, I don't think you saw my position \"seriously\" at all....\n\n \n When you offer some proof, maybe I'll take it seriously. You've made a very serious accusation here by saying these parents are bigoted. Such an accusation needs to backed up substantively. I don't think that's too much to ask . . . if someone accused YOU of bigotry you'd want them to prove it, right? This isn't rocket science.\n \n [QUOTE=foundit66]I asked for the following: \"Have you ever heard of a situation where parents insisted their kids not be taught about homosexuality, because the parents wanted to insist that it be they who teach their kid about homosexuality in a manner devoid of prejudice, while teaching all sides of the issue?\"\n \n And I said yes, I have. The article was one such example. If that's not good enough for you, it's your problem. I also gave you homeschooling as an example of parents who prefer to be the ones to teach their kids about controversial issues, AND I gave you a link to another such case.

   "Two very good reasons, at least for mentioning same-sex relationships. One, some of the kids probably know someone with gay parents.\n\n \n Even if that's true, why is it a reason for them to be taught about it? So what if they have a friend somewhere with a gay dad? They probably know kids with a left-handed parent as well; they might even know a kid who had a dad in prison. Would you raise a stink about THOSE cases possibly not getting read to the kids as you're doing here? Why does this even need to be an issue? Furthermore, since gays make up less than 10% of the population (probably closer to 5% if stats out there are true), and an even smaller percentage are gay AND parents, then chances are that few of them know someone with a gay parent. In other words, it's really not that common. \n \n I wonder how many books out there focus on single-parent families, or kids being raised by grandparents. Or maybe kids that are on the street with no parents. Probably not many. I just find it odd that only with books about gay parents do some people seem to think it's crucial for some unknown reason to make sure everyone knows about it. As if somehow kids are going to be damaged if they don't know that kids exist being raised by a gay mom or dad. Or more importantly, that they might be damaged if we actually dare leave it up to the parents to explain such issues. Wow--actually trusting parents to prepare their kids for life . . . . imagine that. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nTwo, and frankly much more important, in a class of 30 kids, several ARE gay\n\n \n Maybe, maybe not. We don't really know how developed \"sexual orientation\" is at 2nd grade. Assuming sexual orientation is even really any more than an vague concept that's gotten blown WAY out of proportion because the gay rights movement jumped all over it.\n \n \nBut that's PRECISELY what the teacher was doing. Quite appropriately, she was having a class day focused on marriage. Until this year, it was only about heterosexual marriage. It's called learning.\n\n \n So you'd really be fine with limiting the 2nd graders to what I said, and not going into what it means to be gay or even bringing up being gay? (riiiight.) There's a difference between saying a kid has 2 dads, and saying the kid has a gay parent. I don't think the class limited the discussion to 2 parents of the same gender, or there wouldn't have been such a fallout over it.\n \n You know, at the end of the day, this all comes down to whether or not we think it's ok for parents (instead of schools) to determine what they think is right for their kids to be exposed to, and when, regarding controversial social issues. I think it's absolutely fascinating that some of you can't seem to agree that they should just because of your pet issues being at stake. The same people who are acting like it's some gawd-awful tragedy that some parents objected to this would probably be the first to raise a stink if the teacher read a book about something disagreeable from THEIR point of view.

   "Even if that's true, why is it a reason for them to be taught about it? So what if they have a friend somewhere with a gay dad? They probably know kids with a left-handed parent as well; they might even know a kid who had a dad in prison. Would you raise a stink about THOSE cases possibly not getting read to the kids as you're doing here? Why does this even need to be an issue? Furthermore, since gays make up less than 10% of the population (probably closer to 5% if stats out there are true), and an even smaller percentage are gay AND parents, then chances are that few of them know someone with a gay parent. In other words, it's really not that common.\n \n I wonder how many books out there focus on single-parent families, or kids being raised by grandparents. Or maybe kids that are on the street with no parents. Probably not many. I just find it odd that only with books about gay parents do some people seem to think it's crucial for some unknown reason to make sure everyone knows about it. As if somehow kids are going to be damaged if they don't know that kids exist being raised by a gay mom or dad. Or more importantly, that they might be damaged if we actually dare leave it up to the parents to explain such issues. Wow--actually trusting parents to prepare their kids for life . . . . imagine that. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n History shows us that a child of a left-handed parent or a child of a parent in prison does not so routinely get teased and ridiculed like a gay child or a child of a gay parent or parents. There is a very good reason to introduce this to the children on their level so that the gay child they WILL eventually meet or the child or a gay parent or parents that they will possibly meet, will not be teased and ridiculed and emotionally scarred.

I did some searching on this and can't really find much on it either way (whether or not teachers are allowed to deviate from or add to approved curriculum in schools).

If they could then there would be nothing to stop a teacher from, upon finishing the approved science textbook, bringing out a religious text to go into intelligent design, for instance. This isn't so much censorship, because there is still nothing to stop the teacher from giving his or opinion. But utilizing a different text that the school's approved curriculum would be going too far, I would think. I can't prove it in this case (yet) because I so far haven't been able to find much on this issue. So, I could be wrong.

I suspect the issue is also complicated by the fact that it could largely be determined by the indivdual schools instead of any \"law of the land.\"\n \n But even with all that said, I still find it noteworthy that this was a case where the teacher acted outside of approved curriculum--a fact that shouldn't go unnoticed.",

I never had the slightest interest to do these things with any girl.\n \n \n \nBased on your performance here and your naive ideas of what children know and when they know it, there's a good chance that any gay kids you had would grow up pained about your silence (or worse) about them.\n\n \n Jyoshu, I don't know you and make no judgement on your parenting. However, I can say that I am gay and know many gay individuals. The silence of parents on this subject or the actions like those in this article equals rejection. Parents often don't talk about this with their children because they assume their children are not gay or are not going to be gay. So they stay quiet. Once the child realizes the parents position it causes a rift among them and the relationship becomes more and more distant as the child ages. The gay child feels rejected, guilty and unworthy of living. This is from my experiences and the experiences of just about every gay person I know.

   "Why do assume their motivations could only be bad? Do you not think there is any possibility of parents who simply want to be sure they're the ones who teach their kids about it, with no prejudice? Do you not think parents themselves are capable of teaching all sides of the issue?\n\n \n From another link to the story: http://cbs4boston.com/topstories/local_story_109235525.html\n \n Here are some excerpts from the article. \n \n One couple says they only learned about the book called \"King and King\" after their 7-year-old son came home from Estabrook Elementary on March 24 talking about what he said was a silly book he read in school.\n \n Maybe if the child was educated on this subject and had been presented with all sides of the subject by his parents, he wouldn't have referred to the book as \"silly\". Why do you think he has this view? \n \n \"I think there are people who have a real agenda that they're trying to promote and teach the children\", Wirthlin said.\n \n Could this possibly be contrued as her wanting to teach her child about homosexuality in a manner devoid of all prejudice, while teaching all sides of the issue like foundit66 said? \n \n The quote from the school: \n \n School Superintendent Paul Ash defended the system's approach to teaching diversity. He says Lexington is committed to \"teaching children about the world they live in.\" \n \n I think the importance of diversity education overrides whatever objections or predudices these parents might have.",

   "Ok, so we don't go out of our way to teach children about homosexuality. But when it does come up, what do you think the parents are saying with such protest? Aren't they sending their kids a message that will definitely help form their views and would most likely lead to a gay child or a child of gay parents being harmed emotionally by their intolerance? \n\n \n I think it depends on the motivations of the parents. If they are doing it because they don't like gay people, then yes. If they are doing it because they would prefer themselves being the ones to guide their children on such issues, then not necessarily. \n \n It seems that you feel there are only 2 possible outcomes here: kids being gay and their parents fully accepting it, or kids being gay and thinking their parents hate them or them hating themselves. But I know of people who struggled with being gay as well, and their parents made it clear to them they loved them dearly but couldn't condone gay behavior. These kids didn't hate themselves, they knew their parents loved them but also had to stick to their moral beliefs. It's the same idea as when a parent finds out their kid is into any sort of behavior that a parent doesn't approve of. They can still show enormous love to the kids without condoning that behavior. Sure, these kids struggled with their desires (as anyone would who struggles with an issue), but they came through it and live pretty normal lives, and learned that libido isn't everything. I'm just saying that the two outcomes you are proposing may not be the only possibilities.\n \n I myself struggled with temptations (not related to this) in other areas as a kid. My parents loved me, and I know they loved me, but they didn't approve of everything I did. Before I come to definite conclusions here, I'd prefer to hear about or from people who struggled with gay tempation in their youth, but realized later that their parents didn't hate them and actually loved them, and learned to live fullfilling lives. There are people like that out there--some of them are in what you'd probably call the ex-gay movement. \n \n \nJyoshu, I just want to give you a little more input on this matter. I myself tried to kiss a boy in the coatroom in 1st grade. Another time when I was about 8 I talked my neighbor into playing \"doctor\". There has to be something to it!

That's not to say he doesn't deal with temptation from time to time--just like any person who is tempted to do things he feels is wrong. But he's an excellent case of someone who has successfully learned to live a fulfilled life when he was gay. And frankly, his experience and comments is a lot of the reason I don't put much stock in the gay pride movements' insistence that gay's can't change, and that they can only be miserable if they try. It's hard to take that seriously when you've seen the very opposite played out in the life of someone you know very well.\n\n \n This sounds so much like my cousin. He was raised in a very strict pentecostal family. He was gay. When he admited this to his family they had absolutely no tolerance for this whatsoever. So he really felt as if he had no choice but to become \"ex-gay\". He felt so pressured that he found a girl, had 3 children, would profess how happy he was with his life. He even tried to talk me into the same path he took. We lost touch for about 8 years. I started dating a guy and when he realized my last name he said \"hey, are you related to Terry?\" I said yes I am his cousin. He said wow, for several years now he calls me up about every 2-4 months and we get together. He proceded to show me all kinds of photos of the two of them and tell me how the two of them would get together and have sex before he would go back to his pentecostal life. His two lives could never collide or he would lose everything. I never confronted him about this and never said a word to the family. \n I'm not trying to say this is at all the same as your friend but ya know it could be. You'd never know. The last person they would confess something like I described to would be a religious friend. I have NEVER met anyone that has become straight after being gay.

Every Christian I know realizes that the law in the OT that says to stone gay people was changed in Christ's coming.\n\n Actually, I HAVE heard that phrase from a variety of different people on different boards. But I think they are typically trolls.\n When the people who aren't trolls bring it up, they are usually trying to justify their degree of anger that they demonstrate towards gays. And THAT is the point...\n \n \n \nTell you what, if you really want to know (and if it's really important enough for you) do a search.\n\n Actually, I found one gay adoption thread in the past, and true to form you were criticizing the gays. I didn't review the whole thread, but I didn't even see you mention a support for gay adoption in that thread.\n \n And the thing here is that my question was incredibly simple. And yet you avoided it.\n Sometimes, that's an answer unto itself...\n \n \n \nNo, this is where your misunderstanding is becoming clear. I'll explain the difference as best I can. When reloigious people disapprove of gays, it's not the \"being gay\" they are disapproving of. Its the behaviors they believe are associated with it--having gay relationships.\n\n I've heard this claim before and it's b.s.\n When they prevent gay adoption, do they require that the gay people involved be only the gays who have \"gay behavior\"? How about gays in the military?\n \n Our gay behavior IS what they are preoccupied, but make no mistake. The prejudice isn't just aimed at \"behavior\", but the entire group.\n \n \n \nThey really do believe the Bible frowns upon gay relationships.\n\n And the KKK and the Nazis really do believe the Bible frowns upon blacks, Jews, etc...\n Just because they \"believe\" a rule exists doesn't mean it justifies prejudice.\n \n \n \nTheir opposition is not about you being gay, it's about gay behavior. Have you ever heard a preacher rail against someone for having a gay sexual orientation? Probably not.\n\n Do you even know what the \"ex-gay\" community really is?\n A bunch of people insisting that you not only not be \"gay\"...\n ... but they want to make you \"straight\" instead.\n Why isn't it just about making people who are \"gay\" to be celibate?\n \n There's a lot that isn't covered in your claims.\n \n \n \nSo the bottom line is that for religious people with this issue, it's not about your state of being, it's about behavior. When the KKK goes out and burns a cross in a black person's yard, they do it because they're black. That's the reason. When religious people take a stand you don't like on homosexuality, they almost always don't hate you (although the gay pride movement talking points will tell you they do).\n\n It's amazing how you unilaterally make claims about \"they\".\n When I see somebody who \"doesn't hate\" me enough to actually LIE about how I am a pedophile and a child molestor and how kids aren't safe around me and ....\n THAT demonstrates HATE.\n And it's in abundance in the religious right. With examples. Not just \"claims\" of how \"they\" feel.\n \n Actions speak louder than words Jyoshu. It's a lesson you should learn.\n \n \n \nThey just believe your actions are wrong. That's not bigotry, it's actually a form of concern.\n\n And what I have found is that when I JUST SAY that I am gay, without actually saying what type of \"behavior\" I engage in, I get condemned.\n I have NEVER had ANYBODY stop and ask me, \"But do you engage in gay behavior? Or not.\" first.\n \n So you see, your distinction is arbitrary and virtually non-existent. In ACTUAL PRACTICE, I just don't see it.\n \n \n \nI don't hold out much hope that you'll actually stop and think about this some, and learn from what I've written, based on the posts you've made so far. But I lay it out for others who are willing to read it and think about it.\n\n Oh Jyoshu. You think you're some sort of Messiah giving me a brand-new message, but you just don't realize that it's all stuff I'VE HEARD BEFORE.\n \n And I understand what you're saying. I KNOW how some people want it to come across like that.\n But I also KNOW the reasons it is not seen like that.\n \n If it was just about \"gay behavior\", then why the unilateral ban on gay adoption preventing every gay from adopting? Why the unilateral ban on gays in the military, regardless of whether or not they engage in that \"behavior\"?\n Why am I habitually condemned just for SAYING I am gay, without anybody pausing to ask first whether or not I actually engage in \"gay behavior\"?\n \n It's an empty distinction that you make. You think that I won't think about your words, but I already had.\n Are you willing to think about my reply, and treat it with some honest reflection?",

   "Unkerpaulie is correct--the irony here is that even if a person is straight, religious people will still disapprove of that person engaging in homosexual relations. That fact alone is plenty of indication that for religion it's not an issue of innateness or state of being at all, but of behavior.\n \n The thing is, this (like most public policy discrimination issues) is much more complex than simply religious people wanting to discriminate and put it into law. It's just not that simple. People who oppose religious people on this issue should be clear here--is their intention to only stop what they perceive as discrimination, or to stop the religious view about homosexual relations, or is it both? And what of people who oppose homosexual relations or legalized gay marriage, or both, but who aren't religious and therefore don't even use religion as an argument?\n \n If the point is to simply oppose religious people because they have the religious view that gay relations are immoral, then it's a hopeless cause for gay rights. That much is certain. The Bible and it's predominant interpretation that gay relations are wrong has been around far longer than the gay rights movement and has survived far worse attacks in the past.\n \n If the point is to simply oppose discrimination but NOT the religious view, then one has to wonder why they are attacking the religious view at all instead of simply dealing with the legal matter purely on legal grounds. Wasting time and resources trying to convince millions of people to turn their backs on their time-honored and sacred religious beliefs, or trying to convince them that their doctrine is some sort of bigotry only takes emphasis off the legal and constitutional arguments. And if the gay rights issue is such a given and a slam-dunk as the gay rights movement would have us believe, then one would think they would have no need to bother attacking the religious view.",

   "We are not talking asking murderers to stop murdering.

The thing is, you are asking them to turn their back, overnight basically, on their religious beliefs only because some recent (relatively speaking) medical associations suddenly say that it's just a normal part of human behavior. Put yourself in their shoes for a moment and take another vice (since they view gay sex as a vice) as an example: if suddenly several medical associations said that it's a normal part of human behavior to act out violence, would you so readily accept that violence is ok? Or maybe sexual activity with children? (And understand I'm not using that analogy to say gay relationships are similar, I'm only using it to help you see this from their point of view. The only way to do that is to find something that you would consider an immoral behavior, because that's the way many religious people view gay relations. I'm NOT saying gays are like people who do these things or even equating them.) You're basically asking them to change their view just like you would have to change your view on THOSE matters. \n \n Now even if religious people are wrong on this, do you think hundreds of years of belief can be dropped overnight? Don't you think a better tactic would be to be at least somewhat understanding toward their position and not be hostile to them, realizing that it's going to take some time (and that it may never even happen)?

Gay behavior ENCOMPASSES \"being gay\".\n 3) Can you point to ANY LAW which prohibits \"straight people who have gay relations\" in their exclusion, while they exclude gays?\n The MAJORITY of the laws on the issue target GAY people.\n \n \n \nThat fact alone is plenty of indication that for religion it's not an issue of innateness or state of being at all, but of behavior.\n\n It's both.\n The homosexuality is an innate aspect. To restrict oneself from \"homosexual behavior\" would be to go against that innate attribute of their being.\n Kind of like insisting that a heterosexual not engage in heterosexual conduct, and then not talking about how that demand affects an innate quality.\n \n \n \nThe thing is, this (like most public policy discrimination issues) is much more complex than simply religious people wanting to discriminate and put it into law. It's just not that simple. People who oppose religious people on this issue should be clear here--is their intention to only stop what they perceive as discrimination, or to stop the religious view about homosexual relations, or is it both?\n\n Only stop the discrimination, speaking for myself.\n As to stopping that discrimination, I identify the root causes of that discrimination. And religion is one of those root causes.\n \n And thus, it's not the religion itself that I seek to stop, but rather the religious involvement in legislation.\n \n \n \nAnd what of people who oppose homosexual relations or legalized gay marriage, or both, but who aren't religious and therefore don't even use religion as an argument?\n\n I argue against them with regards to whatever argument they muster.\n Do we have any of those on this message board?\n Because from what I can see, it's primarily the \"religious\" argument counter...\n \n \n \nIf the point is to simply oppose religious people because they have the religious view that gay relations are immoral, then it's a hopeless cause for gay rights. That much is certain.\n\n I could care less about their views, as long as they don't try to make religious morality into law.\n That is expressly forbidden on multiple levels.\n \n \n \nThe Bible and it's predominant interpretation that gay relations are wrong has been around far longer than the gay rights movement and has survived far worse attacks in the past.\n\n As did the biblical stance allying with misogyny.\n As did the biblical stance on slavery.\n As did the biblical stance on the earth being the center of the universe.\n Funny thing is, the Bible keeps \"changing\" it's interpretation...\n \n \n \n \nIf the point is to simply oppose discrimination but NOT the religious view, then one has to wonder why they are attacking the religious view at all instead of simply dealing with the legal matter purely on legal grounds.\n\n 1) Can't we do both?\n 2) Actually, I HAVE TRIED to debate this on the legal grounds. Nobody seems interested.\n Is that fact relevant?\n Isn't the fact that the religious people are the ones moving away from the legal grounds rather poignant to your attempted point?\n \n \n \nAnd if the gay rights issue is such a given and a slam-dunk as the gay rights movement would have us believe, then one would think they would have no need to bother attacking the religious view.\n\n <snort<\n You're analysis is bass-ackwards.\n Would you care to stop this attempt of yours of deriding the gay people, who you label as \"gay rights movement\", and actually debate the legal issue?\n \n Or will you avoid such a discussion, proving my point?",

   "It doesn't matter--that is beside the point. The point is not how often either takes place, but rather the motives at work here. And I'm telling you, for religious people it's not about sexual orientation or the issue of innateness.\n\n I see that statement and I just want to shout B.S!\n If it weren't, in part, about innateness, they wouldn't be so insistent in trying to present it as a \"choice\"...\n \n \n \nDo you not realize that most religious people in these churches don't even know much about sexual orientation nor subscribe to that theory? How can you claim they attack you on the basis of your innateness or sexual orientation when they don't even know what that is, in many cases? \n\n 1) Who is saying that? \n 2) They attack what they don't understand.\n No argument here. In fact, I think I have been trying to make that point...\n \n \n \nAnother way to look at it is this: there are a number of people out there who claim to have \"left the homosexual lifestyle.\" (and please let's not get into the term \"lifestyle\" right now, I'm simply saying what THEY say.)\n\n You ADMIT that is what \"they\" say, but you don't want to get into the significance of their choice of that term?\n A significance which detracts from your attempted point?\n Why don't you finish the phrase Jyoshu?\n Isn't it typically phrased as \"gay lifestyle CHOICE\"???\n \n But oh yeah. You claim they're not interested in \"innateness\"...\n \n \n \nSome of them have ministries. If, for the church, it was about BEING gay that's wrong, the church would still reject these people. But they don't because these people claim to have left the \"gay lifestyle\" which is indicative of ceasing a pattern of behavior.\n\n Wake the heck up Jyoshu.\n They call themselves EX-GAYS!!!\n \n When they no longer label themselves as gay, THEN and ONLY THEN are they accepted.\n \n \n \nIn fact, the very fact that religious people use the term \"gay lifestyle\" instead of \"being gay\" should tell you that for religious people it's a behavioral issue. I'm not arguing whether or not the church is right on this or not, I'm saying that's the way they view this issue. It's all about the behavior to them.\n\n It's about BOTH the behavior AND the being gay.\n You keep denying that while ignoring the arguments refuting your claims...",

   "yes, THESE parents did indicate such. my contention was about parents explaining from their point of view, not preventing their children from hearing the school's view. a parent has every right to explain, or even refutr, what is taught in schools if the school's teaching goes against what the parents knows to be fect, or gainst the parent's opinion.\n\n Even if the parent refutes the SCIENTIFIC FACTS of the issue?\n \n But regardless, I fully support the parents from pulling THEIR child from the event. I've stated as such...\n \n \n \nyou cant assume this means discrimination or something negative just because the parent feels he or she should explain to her child what was discussed in school\n\n Invariably, without contrary exception being shown, a parent who wants to restrict their child from receiving a talk on homosexuality is prejudiced against and supports discrimination against gays.\n \n While it may not be \"always\" the case, the pink winged unicorn parent who acts in that way without supporting prejudice has not been found.\n If you wish to show that parent, then do so.\n \n \n \n1) What good does it do to \"disregard the bible\" when there are Christians wanting to enforce the laws of the Bible on gays regardless of whether or not we \"regard\" it??? \n\n \nbecause the question of whether or not a gay act is a sin is purely religious, and has nothing to do with law. read carefully what i posted\n\n Do you realize that you just ignored the point of my question?\n Personally, my responses to these issues have often IGNORED any attempt to refute what they claim the bible says, but rather to EXPLICITLY STATE that the bible has NO PLACE for being the sole justification for our governmental laws.\n \n \n \nand thats different and contrary to what jyoshu posted. can a straight man commit a gay sex act? or is it only gays that can do this? how do you draw the line?\n\n I contradicted Jyoshu? The sky must be falling...\n Yes. A straight man can commit a gay sex act.\n But do the laws which prevent gay adoption, or gay service in the military, really care about a \"straight\" man who commits a gay sex act?\n The laws typically discriminate against GAYS. Not just gays who engage in gay behavior. Not really straights who have had a gay sex act.\n But GAYS.\n \n \n \nor prejudice against childish behavior, or terrorist behavior. neither is a form of discrimination against children nor humans, because we are lead to believe that behaviors are within the control of the individual to change. unless you also believe that all behaviors are permanent, innate and unchangeable\n\n Tell me.\n How many laws against gays discriminate EXPLICITLY against gay behavior and not gays in general?\n \n \n \nis it possible for somebody to work at gm and not help make gm cars? i suppose it is, but chances are that person wont have his job for long.\n\n And likewise, what category would you have for gays who do not exhibit \"gay behavior\"?\n Celibate?",

   "Well, now that's the bottom line disagreement between you and many religious people, now isn't it: whether or not gay behavior is benignly part of just \"being human\" or whether or not it's an immoral behavior. The thing is, you are asking them to turn their back, overnight basically, on their religious beliefs only because some recent (relatively speaking) medical associations suddenly say that it's just a normal part of human behavior.\n\n Speaking for myself...\n No. I'm not.\n I don't care if they don't believe being a homosexual is acceptable. If they are gay and they feel that way, they can put themselves through whatever hoops they like...\n What I am asking is that they not take their religious beliefs, and demand that others stick to them. I do not share their religious beliefs on homosexuality, nor should I be forced to accept their laws based on their religious beliefs against homosexuality.\n \n \n \nPut yourself in their shoes for a moment and take another vice (since they view gay sex as a vice) as an example: if suddenly several medical associations said that it's a normal part of human behavior to act out violence, would you so readily accept that violence is ok? Or maybe sexual activity with children? (And understand I'm not using that analogy to say gay relationships are similar, I'm only using it to help you see this from their point of view. The only way to do that is to find something that you would consider an immoral behavior, because that's the way many religious people view gay relations. I'm NOT saying gays are like people who do these things or even equating them.)\n\n It's funny you should pick those two examples.\n Think about it.\n \"Violence\" is wrong, regardless of the fact that the majority of times it occurs REGARDLESS of mental illness. Being a mental illness has no intrinsic part of that morality.\n \n \"Pedophilia\" is a mental illness, and still obviously wrong. It involves child degradation and often rape. It leaves a child mentally and/or physically scarred. Regardless of whether or not it was a mental illness, it would STILL BE WRONG because there is a victim involved. An innocent child.\n \n I don't understand why some people have such a difficult time in feeling that the view \"homosexuality is a mental illness\" has to be an inalienable part of their morality regarding homosexuality. Even with it not being a mental illness, it could still be wrong just like thousands of other things in our United States penal system are wrong without requiring a stamp of \"mental illness\"...\n \n \n \nNow even if religious people are wrong on this, do you think hundreds of years of belief can be dropped overnight? Don't you think a better tactic would be to be at least somewhat understanding toward their position and not be hostile to them, realizing that it's going to take some time (and that it may never even happen)? And for that matter, what if these medical and psychological associations are wrong? They've been wrong on things before. Why should their views on this be taken as dogma?\n\n Think about it.\n ** Science is based on scientific standards. Research. Evidence. Conclusions are typically never completely concrete, and are open to be revisited WITH evidence...\n ** Religion is based on the statements recorded about men who lived thousands of years ago, who claimed they could talk to God.\n If somebody today said that they talked to God, they would probably be locked up as mentally ill...\n \n ** Science invites questions to further knowledge. It is refutable if it is wrong, substantiated with evidence.\n ** Religion consists of words once spoken, and then the people who follow those words often refuse to even entertain the idea that the person who said it might be wrong. It doesn't invite questions, but rather often demands blind belief.\n \n Do you really want to compare the two and figure out which has a stronger basis??? Because I would love to do that in a realistic and objective discussion.\n I am happy to debate a variety of different secular positions as to why \"homosexuality\" is supposed to be immoral and wrong. I often find that the Christian response is rigid and refusing debate, utilizing phrases found in the Bible which are not open for debate...\n And when people sometimes try to debate the Biblical standards, other people start accusing them of \"attacking\" their \"religion\"...\n \n Do you really want to compare the two and figure out which has a stronger basis??? \n I'm guessing you really don't...\n \n \n \nAgreed, and I too have a problem with Christians trying to legislate their doctrines. I don't think state ballot initiatives are a good idea for Christians to start up. That's not to say I think they are illegal or unconstitutional--they are part of the democratic process. But as a Christian myself, I tend to think that Christians should have better things to do that to lobby for things like this. There are certainly more important things mandated in Christian scripture, such as worship, helping orphans, helping the poor and homeless, simply showing the love of Christ, etc.\n\n There was a poll done a little while ago which asked people not associated with the Christian religion to rank their opinions of certain groups of people...\n Lawyers, Gays, Lesbians, Prostitutes, born-again Christians, ...\n \n The average ranking found that these people ranked born-again Christians SECOND TO LAST, beating out only prostitutes.\n \n You criticize the \"gay rights movement\" for not being more understanding, and question whether or not they are hurting themselves more than they are helping.\n You ever stop to ask the same question about the actions of Christians???\n \n Feh.

It's very common, but because it's not un-politically correct, no one notices half the time.\n\n I have to say that I disagree.\n I see the frustration with the religious types as a result of the actions of the religious types.\n \n There just isn't that big of a group running around trying to pick fights with religious people. It exists. I'll admit that. But I think that they pretty much stick to people of their own mind-set, instead of creating more people of that mind-set.\n \n What groups do you see running around trying to vilify Christians?\n Let me guess...\n Gay Rights Movement is on that list?",

   "I put this post here because it was statements made in this thread which gave me the idea for this test...\n \n \n Yesterday, about 24 hours ago, I opened up two new threads. A thread on gay adoption, and a thread on gays in the military.\n Those two issues, along with gay marriage, are what I see as the primary legal thrust for equality in this country.\n \n I opened them to try and check something out. If gay people were the ones who were dragging these arguments into the \"religious\" arena while avoiding other areas, or if it was the opposition that was dragging these arguments into the \"religious\" arena while avoiding other areas.\n \n My opinion was, and still is, that it is the opposition that is doing the dragging, and that the gay point of view discussion is just a reaction to the focus of the religious focus of the anti-gay crowd. I believe my experiment helped affirm this point. And granted, only 24 hours has passed, but I think we can continue to see whether or not these issues will even be broached by the anti-gay side, or if they will be broached in a way that doesn't focus on religion.\n \n Because, from my perspective, when a gay proponent attempts a non-religious argument, it is typically either dropped or ignored like my two threads yesterday were ignored.\n \n My two examples did not include the \"big\" issue of gay marriage, but I can point to two separate threads with discussions with two separate posters where I brought up the gay marriage legal argument, and the issue was dropped by them. Not me.\n And moreover, nobody else from the anti-gay marriage side picked up the gauntlet to argue the legal points I was putting forward...\n \n And on the flip side, you have at least a couple of posters against gays who I have seen on here who are approaching this issue on an almost exclusively religious manner. So any discussion with them will typically be of that sort. If anybody can point me to posters who bring the gay issue up mostly on religious issues from a pro-gay perspective, I am all ears. It would be the start of a good rebuttal attempt.\n Another couple of examples I have seen is when people have focused on \"why do gays bring up religion\" issues, which ironically IS A MEANS of bringing up the religious issue, courtesy of the gay critics without prompting from the gays.\n \n And thus, these are a few of the reasons that I believe that it is the anti-gay side which has provided the focus on religion for the \"gay issue\".\n \n Any comments, hopefully with reasoning for their position, from people who believe I am wrong in this?",
