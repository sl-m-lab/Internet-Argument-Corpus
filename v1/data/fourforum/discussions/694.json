   "should we use hemp as a main stable in the U.S.? \n hemp is not a harmful drug it's bad nickname of being called weed is not true you could smoke a whole feild of hemp and get away with less than a head ache. hemp can be used for so many things such as paper and clothing and rope and even to the most radicalk state it can be made into a house if you dont believe me read the book \"the house made by hemp\" in this book it explains that hemp is so useful that it can be made in to almost anything. the hemp industry was shut down because off the manufacturing of nylon rope, the hemp industry was then illegalized and has stayed that way ever since.\n \n so if you havnt already gotten my side of the matter i do beleive that hemp should me leagle\n \n sorry about my spelling \n \n i hope that you can look at both sides of this and decide whick is better stay open minded",

   "Any drug has its side affects. In this case, in serious use such as \"a whole feild\" it could be deadly, and any form of smoking also creates complications.\n Like all drugs people should be free to do what they want.\n Hemp should not stand out alone as being able to become legal, while others stay illegal. Thats ridiculous.... \n In this case legalizing drugs becomes a problem for communities, and people. \n People - Well you've seen the commericals, it slows down your reaction speed and can kill people. \n Community - In the family - second hand smoke. If you have a neighborhood where 60% all smoke it lowers the value of the neighborhood for some adults because they don't want to bring their kids up in that kind of enviorment.\n (Home value is something which I plan making a thread on later) \n \n Hemp has harmful effects that I don't think you've taken into consideration....\n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

   "silent poet i have recently discovered that hemp is only one plant in a large family of plants called cannibus. the plant used to make marijuana(sp) is an entierly diffrent plant than the plant that is called hemp so there should be no other reason to continue to keep hemp illeagle. hemp was made illeagle so that the nylon rope company woulkd start to increase in use. \n \n i hope that this new found information has made it more clear to you\n \n have a nice day \n \n see ya",
