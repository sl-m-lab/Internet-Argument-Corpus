I had mentioned the fact that god did nothing during the holocaust and EZ said god sent the USA to solve the problem (unlike god handling everything himself in the magic days or yore). But EZ forgot the fact that the atheist country of the USSR had just as much if not more of a contribution to stopping Nazi Germany, so that answer doesn't work. But a born again friend of mine told me the reason is that Jesus is protecting us from a vengeful god now that Jesus is in heaven. That was her answer.

   "This is a great topic where we can explore the possible relationship to natural disasters and link to a judgment from a God.\n \n San Francisco is known as the most liberal city in the United States with a very high Gay population. Clearly requiring equal treatment under God.\n \n The problem is it has natural events that we can monitor that are overdue. Meaning that if anything, God is over protecting the city and not judging it.\n \n Even it we look at Israel and associate its protection with Rome, we'd find the nation with the highest gay population lasted longer. Not shorter. Rome crushed Israel at a time when their religious observance to the God of Moses was at an all time high. \n \n The black plague hit Europe and took massive numbers of lives while under strict observance of Christian ethics. The Christian church had great power at the time. Clearly the outcome of this association either had a negative impact or no impact at all. The simplest thing would be to find flaw and blame the flaws yet, the logic isn't sound when relating it to other cultures and governments. A nice thing from God would have been a rule about washing your hands. Seems the practice is really good for man.\n \n now, Chance and God can not be brothers in arms. Clearly you can only have one. You either have a God or you have random chance. Religion associates outcomes to be from a God; In fact they would have to. Albert Einstien once said \"God does not play dice with the Universe!\" And Albert is correct if there is a God. Chance is why we are here or its God. If chance is in play then God would have to forgo some credit.\n \n If you get enough chances order is bound to come of it, more than likely because only order is detected. Also; once something happens it's clearly in an order. And one can derive many things from an outcome even if there is no relation. You can roll dice and finding a man's social security number; things of this nature. If all the details in the movements that became an order are strictly followed then the outcome can be predicted. Though all the events even in the slightest detail must be adhered to.\n \n Men is has risen above the petty nonsense of Religion and used his mind to determine why things happen. We know why and how weather patterns occur and we can predict them. We know why we have earth quakes and volcanic activity. We learned the why and how. No religion has ever been able to predict anything. This has nothing to do with there being a God or not. It has everything to do with crushing a religion though.\n \n The outcome of Sodom and Gomorrah had nothing to do with a judgment from God. If it did, the evidence would be overwhelming. There are churches that get knocked down by storms while Cat Houses stay standing. Clearly the observation and consensus the bible places on the event is skewed. To think otherwise would lead one to the dark ages all over again.\n \n And I believe there is a God.",

The energy that gets built up has a limit. The limit is set by the geology of the plates. And to build up energy, guess what? You have to store it.

   " I heard today that 70% of the US debt was created between Reagan, Bush I and Bush II.\n\n \n Revisiting Liberal Myths - Reagan and the Deficit\n \n President Reagan entered the White House with an attitude of working honest deals with the Congress on spending. He wanted more defense spending, lower entitlement spending, lower tax rates which would boost the economy (and thus revenues) and seemed to achieve that agreement with Congress in both 1981 and 1982. However, despite getting concessions on taxes, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives never once cut spending, and the actual budgets were higher than what Reagan asked for 7 out of 8 years. This attitude of \"cut spending later\" helped continue the debt trends that began under Ford and Carter. By the end of Reagans terms, debt had increased by $2 trillion.\n \n Actual budget figures in the link below:\n \n http://www.presidentreagan.info/reagan_budgets.cfm\n \n President Reagan was able to sign into law the tax cuts in late 1981 after an attempt by congressional Democrats to block the cuts (i.e. \"gridlock\") failed...but at the reduced rate of 25%, and an effective rate of 23% since the cuts would be over three years (5% in 1981, retroactive; 10% for 1982; 10% for 1983). \n \n All taxpayers received these cuts, not just the rich as anti-Reagan revisionists would have you believe, as shown in the table of effective tax rates. And, also contrary to liberal recounting, the tax cuts helped spur the economy (see the expansion). In addition, income tax revenues increased during this period and the share of taxes paid by the rich increased also! In other words, the liberals have been lying to you. \n \n http://www.presidentreagan.info/tax_cuts.cfm\n \n The smallest amount by which a Reagan budget was increased by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives was $50 billion. The government shut down on numerous occasions because of budget battles between Reagan and Congress. Interestingly, back then no one blamed the Speaker of the House for shutting down the government. They blamed the President. \n \n When Reagan's tax plan was passed in 1982, there were supposed to be two dollars in spending cuts for every dollar of tax cuts. But spending never got cut. In the end, for every new dollar of tax revenue, the Democrats spent $1.80. Rather than cut spending, they let the government shut down and blamed Reagan. \n \n http://www.cdharris.net/text/taxcuts.html\n \n Clinton\n \n In 1995, GOP congressional leaders had to push Clinton to submit five budgets before he would agree to a balanced-budget plan and he actually vetoed two balanced budgets. \n \n It remains a matter of record that the Republican Congress turned what was going to be a $3.9 trillion increase in the national debt into some $2 trillion in surpluses over the same period, a dramatic turnaround that Clinton and Gore were not hoping to engineer though they now wish to take full credit for it. \n Furthermore, Clinton took an economy that was growing at a 4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1992 and with his record 1993 tax increase managed to depress that growth rate to 2.4 percent annually throughout his first term. The Clinton tax increase is not what ultimately led to the balanced budget (again, there was no plan for a balanced budget until the Republicans took over Congress) and it in fact cost Americans $300 billion in output, $264 billion in disposable income, $138 billion in savings and 1.2 million jobs. The economy did not again resume 4 percent annual growth until after the Republican Congress finally got Clinton to sign a capital-gains tax cut. \n \n Watch out for the Liberal's Revisionism!\n \n \n\n Their programs and whoring with the religious right has brought America to the brink and if another politician of this type is elected in '08, he could very well take us right over the cliff.\n\n \n If you think Republican spending was high, just wait until the drunken-sailor Democrats get total power (Hillary will lose). There was never a spending program they didn't like (except for national defense), and never a tax they didn't like either.\n \n A liberal is someone who feels a great debt to his fellow man, which debt he proposes to pay off with your money. \n -G Gordon Liddy",

The best of intentions that raise a massive government will in the end, condemn liberty by trying to limit what is seen as negative vices of the population. Be it gay issues or worship; basically anything that is deemed resistance to the social order. To much of anything, Good or Bad ends up as bad.\n \n I would argue that a church state has the greatest of limits to liberty due to the fact that Religion even has laws against thought. We can't control thought openly, but we wouldn't be the first state to try.\n \n Reagan started out as a democrat. He ran a union for a long time. I believe Reagan though progressive, saw greater freedom in limiting government and lessoning individual burdens on the public as a liberal issue and clearly that argument has great merit. \n \n No one can say Reagan separated the country. That would be a hard stand to take. Reagan did not press law that would constrict options for the public, he actually did the opposite. \n \n There is clear danger in a national health insurance program if the state develops to much medical controls and limits private selective processes. I believe we can keep our freedom and have national health insurance if we stand guard and insure the state only provides access, not the heavy burden of law. A company can provide such things and logically so can a state. The cost must be a burden to the consumer or the system will be a welfare industry to the likes we've never seen in the country before. We could have people living in hospitals because they where kicked out of their apartment. Hospitals can not be used as a habitat and the country maintain any good medical system.\n \n As far as Reagan, My only problems with his administration was the support we gave to groups such as the Taliban and others. I think we should have seen what that would do to the country in the future and what we are facing today is clearly because of the poor choices we made in the past.",

We couldn't convert the Jews through terror and this bunch isn't going to respond to it as well.

Guys, wrong posting area emoticon_smile \n \n PS: I agree that compared to some of our \"allies\", Sadam was a kitten and posed no real threat whatsoever. Look at the mess we have today in Iraq and I think it will get worse.... All because of different religious factions!! At least Sadam controlled them.. \n \n Speaking of which... Religion: Another time in history when more people are killed in HIS name! The same old story! How sad to know that they are of the same ethnic origin and kill each other because each side believes in a non-existent god.\n \n I wonder if the Iraqi people would have a brighter future without religion?
