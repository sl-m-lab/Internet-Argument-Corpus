Our government has been playing the role of God in saying that people are free to act as they want,\" he told the paper, adding that the introduction of recent pro-gay laws undermines marriage.\n \n \"The sexual orientation regulations [which give greater rights to gays] are part of a general scene of permissiveness. We are in a situation where we are liable for God's judgment, which is intended to call us to repentance.\"\n \n Dow is a leading church conservative. The worldwide Anglican denomination has been engaged in a feud between conservatives and liberals over the role of gays in the faith since the American branch, the Episcopal Church, elected Gene Robinson, an openly gay man, as bishop of New Hampshire in 2003.\n \n Some church conservatives want the Episcopal Church expelled from the Anglican communion.\n \n In May Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, the titular leader of the worldwide church, told Robinson he was not invited to a conclave of bishops to be held in London. Last week Williams backtracked slightly saying Williams could attend the session but only as a non voting observer.\n \n Bishop Dow's remarks Sunday are likely to add fuel to the already enflamed divisions within the denomination.\n \n Gay members of the Church of England on Sunday expressed their outrage.\n \n The Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association called Dow a \"bronze age primitive\".",

   "On the other hand I try to blaspheme at least daily. Being an atheist I have to keep my hand in. If you don't use it you lose it. But its not very satisfying if one is a non-believer. For any Christians out there I can best describe it as speaking unkindly of Zeus or Thor. Try it Christians say Thor is a silly myth. See it does not hurt at all, and nobody dropped the hammer on you did they? Works exactly the same with GOD trust me.\n \n Les et al. Christ like gays in the US was crucified simply because those holding power in society at the time viewed him and his teachings as being a direct or indirect threat to their holding power. Its very much like the violence hurled at King during the non-violent civil rights movement. Spewing hate is often a sign of underlying fear and is often done defensively - but sometimes (too often) its a sign of real underlying evil. Its not something modern societies can afford, we need every bit of talent and skill we have just to stay even let alone progress. Why throw perfectly good people on the ash heap because of their sexual preference? Why treat people unequally for the same reason? We are no longer a society of pioneers out on the plains isolated and with a need to\"fill the earth\" and its no longer necessary to see that every egg is fertilized and no sperm is wasted on non reproductive activity.",

But one that may not prove true, even as gloomy predictions were rampant after the U.S. Episcopal Church wrapped up a gathering Wednesday without coming close to meeting demands of conservatives across the 77 million-member communion. \n \n Powerful considerations -- both practical and theological -- still stand in the way of one of the biggest meltdowns in Christian unity since the 16th century Reformation, clerics and scholars say. \n \n \"The problems are very, very deep,\" said Canon Martyn Minns, rector of Truro Church in Fairfax, Va., and a leader of the conservative bloc at the Episcopal meeting in Columbus, Ohio. \"But I don't share the view that it's moving toward a decisive break. That's not how we do things.\" \n \n What's more likely, many experts say, is a continued erosion from within -- an implosion rather than explosion. \n \n This could fold Anglicanism's big tent, the denominations rooted in the Church of England and roughly stretching across former British colonies and the old Empire. In its place, the 38 Anglican provinces might stay linked, but in name only -- each going their own way on key issues including same-sex blessings, women clergy and the ordination of openly gay priests and bishops.\n\n \n \n It is happening to the ELCA, also, the conservative vs the liberal view.
