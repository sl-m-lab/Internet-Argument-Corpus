Democratic concepts of rights such as \"needs of the many out weight the few\" type concepts are great, democratic, but they are NOT ours. It is very suprising that concepts such as \"you don't need a gun\" \"drivers have licenses\" \"you don't know who is a criminal\" seem so logical and reasonable to some people, the reality is such concepts are NOT part of our democracy. The Constitutionally illiterate think they know how democracy works. How? Because they herd about it? Ridiculus. Our democracy works in a very specific way and a body of documents very clearly spells out how it works. The Constitution, the Declearation of Independance, the Federalist Papers, and Supreme Court holdings spell out how it works. \"Hearing\" about how democracy works from TV, movies, and other countries examples is just as smart as learing about sex from the street and buddies, and about just as accurate.",

What I see happening is the errosion of rights. The re-interpretation of legal text that is very clear into a different meaing to suit modern political purpose. Again please reference up to to 'bastardization\".\n \n I'm not guessing what the 2nd Amendment means. I know what it means and what is means is not debateable.\n \n Please note this persons interpreation this text as a classic example of bastardization:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nWhat about this 1915 law article? I don't think it's very supportive of an individual right.\n \n \"The guaranty does not appear to have been of a common-law right, like that of trial by jury....it shows that a right to keep and bear arms was not regarded as a fundamental right of every Englishman.\"\n \n \"The phrase itself, 'to bear arms,' indicates as much. The single individual or the unorganized crowd, in carrying weapons, is not spoken of or thought of as 'bearing arms.' The use of the phrase suggests ideas of a military nature.\"\n \n \"Lastly, I submit that the right guaranteed is not so much to the individual for his private quarrels or feuds as to the people collectively for the common defense against the common enemy, foreign or domestic. The guaranty is to insure the safety of the people, their 'laws and liberties,' against assaults from any source or quarter, but not to give individuals singly or in groups uncontrollable means of aggression upon the rights of others. Granting that the individual may carry weapons when necessary for his personal defense or that of his family or property, it is submitted that he may be forbidden to carry dangerous weapons except in cases where he has reason to believe and does believe that it is necessary for such defense. In fine, I venture the opinion that, without violence to the constitutional guaranty of the right of the people to bear arms, the carrying of weapons by individuals may be regulated, restricted, and even prohibited according as conditions and circumstances may make it necessary for the protection of the people.\"\n http://www.guncite.com/journals/har1915.html\n \n It seems to me like he's saying that the right is primarily collective, and thus private ownership of guns can be regulated. Bearing arms also was not a right under common law.\n\n \n A law article? PLEEEASE!\n \n Jouralist and newspapers don't make Constitutional law.\n \n You don't seem to understand our justice system too well.\n \n First off judicial opinions are NOT law. Only the holdings are law. There are NO judicial holding that decide that the right to bear arms is collective. Even your source of 1934 and Love is OPINION not holding.\n \n The 2nd Amendment is law and the right is individual. I'm not guessing the intent of the men who wrote the 2nd Amendment. The same men who wrote the 2nd Amendment wrote the Militia Act, and the Militia Act very clearly intends people to bring thier own guns from home.\n \n And\n \n \n You totally manipulated your source.

   "Ok, this is a C&P of a response I started here, then added some to and copied to another board, then added more to and sent out as an E-mail to a couple of folks I like to argue with on the side. It is relevant to the thread, so here it is in all its glory:\n \n Yes, since it is the 21st century, I say we scrap the entire constitution, not just the second amendment. I want to start by killing people who say things I don't like or don't vote the way I want.\n \n Unfortunately for the GG's, the supreme court has ruled on more than one occasion that \"original intent\" is the premier standard to be used when interpreting the constitution. This is the document upon which our entire government and social system is based. Just ignoring it when it is inconvenient with your fascist ideas is not really a good idea. The constitution served us well for the first 150 years of our nation, and if we paid a little more attention to it, it would likely serve us well again. Instead, we have these XXXXXX running around going \"times have changed\" like that is some kind of excuse for ignoring people rights. \n \n We have gone from freedom of speech and assembly to freedom of speech and assembly as long as you don't block any traffic, you have the proper permits, and you are only protesting in designated protest zones. We have gone from a RKBA which \"Shall not be infringed\" to a bunch of yahoos wandering around mumbling about \"collective rights\". you want original intent? The revolutionary war STARTED because the British were marching on Lexington and concord with the intent of seizing the arsenals there. These were not muskets we are talking about. They planned to seize the privately owned cannons and artillery pieces. Today, there are actually folks out there that believe our founding fathers gave us a right to keep and bear arms, as long as it is not a black gun with a bayonet lug on it. \n \n Maybe protests were MEANT to block traffic, and be carried out without permits, and were not meant to be carried out only in designated zones, which are generally out in the middle of nowhere. You now have the right to protest in the desert, congratulations.\n \n Maybe individuals in this country were MEANT to have military style firearms (which would be why the founding fathers wrote about this almost obsessively and continually said things like \"Every American should have military style firearms\"). Maybe they really meant it when they said our leaders should rule with a gun to their head. \n \n For the first 150 years following Americas humble beginnings, we grew faster than any nation the world had ever seen. We went from being disobedient subject to being a superpower. Roughly 5% of our GDP went to support our government. Traffic was disrupted. I will give you that one. It was not at all uncommon for political protests to disrupt traffic and inconvenience the public at large. People got their messages out, though. People also owned military style weapons. Machine guns and hand grenades were available through mail order catalogs, but that was OK, because crime was still very low.\n \n Today, traffic flows without disruption, the government spends 56% of our GDP, and we take measures to \"protect\" people from folks with military style weans. Of course, crime is up 2300%, which tells me that perhaps the problem is not the guns. \n \n Why do you people want to destroy America? It was such a great place. People were free, the economy always went up, inflation was not killing us all, the government was not spending money like there is no tomorrow.\n \n I, for one, am just about sick of all the **** coming from both sides. This country is going to hell in a handbasket, and neither side seems to have any answers. They just keep pushing their fascist agendas. We have ended up with a single party system, cleverly disguised as a two party system pretending to be a 3 party system. Since roughly WWII, our government has consolidated a HUGE amount of power. This is power that the people once held. They have done it in the name of the common good, in the name of security, and in the name of keeping order. Now, you are sitting there thinking \"you can vote for a third party\". You are right, I can throw my vote away by voting for a third party. I do not live in a \"battleground state\", so my vote doesn't mean diddly anyway. Unfortunately, our two big parties have been at it so long, and have consolidate power so effectively, that it would be nearly impossible to elect a third party candidate. \n \n Part of this is because of the electoral system. The electoral college was a good idea, and still is today in its original form. It was created because at the time there were no nationwide newspapers, there was no TV or radio. Information traveled very slowly. It was not unusual for a presidential election to go by and the majority of the country not know who was running or what they stood for. so, you elected people from your state, folks you knew, and who you trusted to make good decisions. They convened with electors from other states, and learned about the candidates, then voted to elect the president. This was a good plan, and possibly the only way that it could have been done at the time. The states are responsible for the selection process for the electors for their particular state. for many, many years, you voted for each elector separately. When political parties became prevalent, they conveniently included each electors political party with that electors name so you could vote for the electors you wanted. this often led to splits in a states electoral votes, part of them going to one party, part to another. In some states, percentage of votes for each party determined how many of that states electoral votes went to a particular candidate.\n \n Then, our two parties got this really nifty idea that we could ensure a two party monopoly by ensuring that all of each states votes went to a single party. Under a system where a states electoral votes could be split, it was very conceivable that a third party could come out of basically nowhere and take the presidency. So, we started instituting this plan on a state by state basis. Support for the changes was, of course, bipartisan as both parties wished to ensure a shared monopoly of political power. \n \n Then came Ross Perot. This guy was an independent, had a billion dollars to spend in advertising, and on the surface seemed like a good choice for president. I think both parties breathed a sigh of relief when he started talking crazy talk about CIA plots to plant microchips in his head and alien schemes. They did learn a lesson though. Here was a guy who came out of nowhere and almost turned the two party system on its ear. The party leaderships learned form this, however, and it brought us redistricting and incumbent protection laws to ensure that this could never happen again. \n \n This brings us to today. We have two wankers running for president. The majority of Americans don't seem to feel that either one of them is a good choice, we are simply trying to vote for the lesser of two evils. The majority of Americans are not particularly fond of their congressional representatives. the other options we are given, though are no better than the guys we have there now. This is because NO candidate has a snowballs chance in hell of being elected without the support of their party, and the parties will not back anybody who has not been carefully vetted to ensure that they will dance the right dance when the time comes. \n \n Why do we need guns? We need guns because we have unseatable political parties that both seem hell bent on increasing the power of the government, and thus their own power. We need guns because we have a president who signed into law a bill passed by a bipartisan congress which suspends habeas corpus and makes it much easier for our government to spy on us, as well as removing certain surveillance activities from our system of checks and balances. We need guns because the McCain incumbent protection laws require organizations to hand over member ship rosters, and act that has always been considered a violation of the freedom of association inherent to the first amendment. We need guns because the nazi party stood up and asked for a law to be passed which would allow the suspension of elections in Germany \"for the safety and security of the nation\". A bipartisan commission here in the the good old US of A has recently made the same recommendation. If we could hold an election in 1864, we should sure as hell be able to hold on this year, regardless of what the terrorists throw at us. We need guns because our president actually argued that the judicial branch had no authority when it came to activities of the executive branch during times of war, and the majority of congress agreed with him (are you familiar with the concept of an elected dictator?). We need guns because our judicial branch has become a political puppet instead of the champions of the law that they were meant to be. \n \n The second amendment is far from outdated. If anything, it may be more important today than at any time in the history of America. It was Justice William O. Douglas who said \"As nightfall does not come all at once, neither does oppression. In both instances, there is a twilight. And it is in such twilight that we all must be aware of change in the air, however slight, lest we become unwitting victims of the darkness.\". His words ring true, and part of being \"aware of change in the air\" is NOT disarming yourself so as to make yourself easy prey.",

   "Thoughts on the advisability of allowing individual citizens a right to keep and bear private arms, the right of self defense, and the necessity of disarming slaves.\n \n A. Some general comments which I view as opposed to an individual RKBA:\n \n How miserable that man is who governs a people when six parts of seaven at least are Poore Endebted Discontented and Armed. Comment from the Royal Governor of Virginia concerning \"Bacon's Rebellion\" of 1676. quoted in H. Miller, The Case for Liberty, p. 76 (1965).\n \n I honestly think - and I am not an expert on the amendments - I think the only people in this nation who should be allowed to own guns are police officers. I don't care if you want to hunt, I don't care if you think it's your right. I say 'sorry'. It is 1999, we have had enough as a nation. You are not allowed to own a gun and if you do own a gun, I think you should go to prison. Rosie O'Donnell, The Rosie O'Donnell Show, April 21, 1999 (One day after the school shooting at Littleton, Colorado).\n \n Make mass searches and hold executions for found arms. V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 35, 4th ed., p. 286. From Congressional Record, April 28, 1970, p. H3601.\n \n We're going to have to take one step at a time, and the first step is necessarily, given political realities, going to be very modest. Our ultimate goal, total control of handguns in the United States, is going to take time. The first problem is to slow down the increasing number of handguns in this country. The second problem is to get handguns registered, and the final problem is to make the possession of all handguns, and all handgun ammunition illegal. Nelson T. Shields, founder of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence and former Chairman of Handgun Control, Inc., quoted in The New Yorker magazine, July 26, 1976, at Page 53f.\n \n The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty. So let's not have any native militia or native police. German troops alone will bear the sole responsibility for the maintenance of law and order throughout the occupied Russian territories, and a system of military strong-points must be evolved to cover the entire occupied country. Adolph Hitler, dinner talk on April 11, 1942, quoted in Hitler's Table Talk 1941-44: His Private Conversations, Second Edition (1973), Pg. 425-426.\n \n If the opposition disarms, well and good. If it refuses to disarm, we shall disarm it ourselves. Joseph Stalin, Reply to the discussion on the Political Reports of the Central Committee, Dec. 7, 1927. Stalin, Works, Vol. 10, p. 378. From Congressional Record, April 28, 1970, p. H3601..\n \n B. Some general comments which I view as supporting an individual RKBA:\n \n The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction. Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300. [For more information on the individual RKBA as recognized by English Common law, see my post \"The RKBA was an individual right recognized by English Common Law\" in the thread \"Why you can't rationalize the collective interpretation away.\"] \n \n Nothing will make a nation so unconquerable as a militia, or every man's being trained to arms. . . . And if the generality of housekeepers were only half disciplined, a designing prince, or ministry, would hardly dare to provoke the people by an open attack on their liberties. . . .But without the people's having some knowledge of arms, I see not what is to secure them against slavery. . . .The confidence, which a standing army gives a minister, puts him upon carrying things with a higher hand, than he would attempt to do, if the people were armed, and the court unarmed, that is, if there were no land-force in the nation, but a militia. Had we [England] at this time no standing army, we should not think of forcing money out of the pockets of three millions of our subjects. .[a long list of injustices suffered by the colonists is omitted here] . .There is no end to observations on the difference between the measures likely to be pursued by a minister backed by a standing army, and those of a court awed by the fear of an armed people.  English republican author James Burgh, 2 Political Disquisitions, pp. 390 and 475-76. (London 1774). Please note that when when popular demand for his work led to the printing of an edition in America, Benjamin Franklin served as the editor. The subscription list for this edition included George Washington, John Adams, John Hancock, and John Dickenson. David T Hardy, Armed Citizens, Citizen Armies: Toward a Jurisprudence of the Second Amendment, 9 Harv. J. L. & Pub. Pol'y 587 (1986).\n \n Patrick Henry's Anti-Federalist debate opinion:\n My great objection to this Government is, that it does not leave us the means of defending our rights; or, of waging war against tyrants. . . .The Honorable Gentleman who presides, told us, that to prevent abuses in our Government, we will assemble in Convention, recall our delegated powers, and punish our servants for abusing the trust reposed in them. Oh, Sir, we should have fine times indeed, if to punish tyrants, it were only sufficient to assemble the people. Your arms wherewith you could defend yourselves, are gone. . . . Did you ever read of any revolution in any nation, brought about by the punishment of those in power, inflicted by those who had no power at all? You read of a riot act in a country [England] which is called one of the freest in the world, where a few neighbors cannot assemble without the risk of being shot by hired soldiery, the engines of despotism. We may see such an act in America. A standing army we shall have also, to execute the execrable commands of tyranny: And how are you to punish them? Will you order them to be punished? Who shall obey these orders? Will your Mace-bearer be a match for a disciplined regiment? In what situation are we to be? . . . .What resistance could be made? The attempt would be madness.  Patrick Henry, Speeches of June 5 and 7, 1788, before the Virginia Ratifying Convention, reprinted in The Anti-Federalist Papers and the Constitutional Convention Debates, pages 199-216, Mentor Books, 1986, edited by Ralph Ketchum.\n \n Whenever, therefore, the profession of arms becomes a distinct order in the state. . .the end of the social compact is defeated. . . .No free government was ever founded, or ever preserved its liberty, without uniting the characters of the citizen and soldier in those destined for defense of the state. . . .Such a well regulated militia, composed of freeholders, citizens and husbandman, who take up arms to preserve their property, as individuals, and their rights as freemen. M. T. Cicero  (a pseudonym) M. T. Cicero (a pseudonym), Charleston State Gazette, September 8, 1788.\n \n A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves, and render regular troops in a great measure unnecessary. . . .the constitution ought to secure a genuine and guard against a select militia. . .and include. . .all men capable of bearing arms. . . . But, say gentlemen, the general militia are for the most part employed at home in their private concerns, cannot well be called out, or be depended upon; that we must have a select militia. . . .[of the select militia] These Corps, not much unlike regular troops, well ever produce an inattention to the general militia. . .whereas, to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them. . . .The mind that aims at a select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle; and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it, whenever they can prevail, no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it. Richard Henry Lee, Additional Letters from the Federal Farmer, p. 169-170 (1788)\n \n The supposed quietude of a good man allures the ruffian; while on the other hand, arms like laws discourage and keep the invader and the plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property. The same balance would be preserved were all the world destitute of arms, for all would be alike; but since some will not, others dare not lay them aside . . . . Horrid mischief would ensue were one half the world deprived of the use of them . . . .Thomas Paine, Thoughts on Defensive War, 1775. I Writings of Thomas Paine at 56 (1894).\n \n False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. The ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree. Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764.\n \n The right to keep and bear arms \"has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic.\" Former SCOTUS justice Joseph Story, 3 J. Story, Commentaries \u00ba 1890, p. 746 (1833), also cited as one of the \"writings of approved commentators\" on the nature of the RKBA in U.S. v Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 178 (1939).\n \n Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the Act of depriving a whole nation of arms, as the blackest.-Ghandi, 2 M. Gandhi, An Autobiography of the Story of My Experiments with the Truth, (M. Desai, trans. 1927).\n \n C. Some comments on the RKBA and slavery:\n \n And I cannot see, why arms should be denied to any man who is not a slave, since they are the only true badges of liberty. . . .The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave. He who has nothing, and belongs to another, must be defended by him, and needs no arms: but he who thinks he is his own master, and has anything he may call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses, or else he lives precariously and at discretion. And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury; yet, by degrees, he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command. Our ancestors, by being always armed, and frequently in action, defended themselves against the Romans, Danes, and English; and maintained their liberty against encroachments of their own princes. English republican author Andrew Fletcher, Political Works, pp. 35 and 221 (1749).\n \n Regarding slavery in America, the provisions of the 2nd. Amendment:\n \n obviously recognize the natural right of all men \"to keep and bear arms\" for their personal defense: and prohibit both Congress and the State governments from infringing the right of \"the people\"--that is, any of the people--to do so. . . .This right of man \"to keep and bear arms,\" is a right palpably inconsistent with the idea of being a slave. Yet the right is secured as effectively to those whom the States presume to call slaves, as to any whom the States condescend to acknowledge free.\n Under this provision any man has a right either to give or sell arms to those persons whom the States call slaves; and there is no constitutional power, in either the national or State governments, that can punish him for so doing; or that can take those arms from the slaves; or that can make it criminal for the slaves to use them, if, from the inefficiency of the laws, it should become necessary for them to do so, in defense of their own lives or liberties; for this constitutional right to keep arms implies the constitutional right to use them, if need be, for the defense of one's liberty or life.  Lysander Spooner, The Unconstitutionality of Slavery, p. 98 (1860 edition) This work was originally published in 1845, and by the force of its indictment of the American system of slavery Spooner became \"pre-eminent in the group of abolitionists who developed the constitutional law now incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment.\" J. TenBroek, Equal Under Law, p. 146 (1965)\n \n And, a response to attempts to disarm blacks in the south to preserve de facto slavery after the war:\n \n Editor Loyal Georgian: Have colored persons a right to own and carry firearms?--A Colored Citizen\n Almost every day we are asked questions similar to the above. We answer certainly you have the same right to own and carry arms that other citizens have. You are not only free but citizens of the United States and as such entitled to the same privileges granted to other citizens by the Constitution. . . .\n Article II, of the amendments to the Constitution of the United States, gives the people the right to bear arms, and states that this right shall not be infringed. Any person, white or black, may be disarmed if convicted of making an improper or dangerous use of weapons, but no military or civil officer has the right or authority to disarm any class of people, thereby placing them at the mercy of others. All men, without distinction of color, have the right to keep and bear arms to defend their homes, families or themselves.\n From issues of the Loyal Georgian, January 20, 27 and February 3, 1866.\n \n D. 4 prior instances in America of a government ensuring the disarmament of a class of individuals as a necessary precursor to violating their other liberties:\n \n 1. The sham \"registration and secure storage\" scheme imposed upon the citizens of Boston by General Gage:\n \n The inhabitants of Boston being confined within that town by the general their governor, and having, in order to procure their dismission, entered into a treaty with him, it was stipulated that the said inhabitants having deposited their arms with their own magistrates, should have liberty to depart, taking with them their own effects. They accordingly delivered up their arms, but in open violation of honor, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even savage nations esteemed sacred, the governor ordered the arms deposited as aforesaid, that they might be preserved for their owners, to be seized by a body of soldiers; detained the greatest part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their most valuable effects behind.\n The general, further emulating his ministerial masters, by a proclamation bearing date on the 12th. of June, after venting the grossest falsehoods and calumnies against the good people of these colonies, proceeds to '[D]eclare them all, either by name or description, to be rebels and traitors, to supersede the course of the common law, and instead thereof to publish and order the use and exercise of the law martial.' Quotes from the Continental Congress' Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms  [July 6, 1775, authored by Thomas Jefferson] beginning at p. 286 in Sources Of Our Liberties, American Bar Foundation, Richard L. Perry, editor, revised edition (William S. Hein & Co. 1990);\n \n 2. [The obvious one] The denial of a RKBA to black slaves in the South.\n \n 3. The disarmament and concentration-camp style internment of American citizens of Japanese ancestry during WWII; and finally\n \n 4. The denial of the right of Native Americans to own any meaningful class of firearms, an insidious practice which was not ended until 1979.\n \n I'm sorry this is such a long post, but I don't think we can ignore the lessons of history while we debate the nature and scope of the RKBA guaranteed by the 2nd. Amendment. \n ---------------------------------\n Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming its not an individual right or that it's too much of a safety hazzard don't see the danger of the big picture. They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like. Alan Dershowitz.",

   "\n A law article? PLEEEASE!\n \n Jouralist and newspapers don't make Constitutional law.\n \n You don't seem to understand our justice system too well.\n \n First off judicial opinions are NOT law. Only the holdings are law. There are NO judicial holding that decide that the right to bear arms is collective. Even your source of 1934 and Love is OPINION not holding.\n \n The 2nd Amendment is law and the right is individual. I'm not guessing the intent of the men who wrote the 2nd Amendment. The same men who wrote the 2nd Amendment wrote the Militia Act, and the Militia Act very clearly intends people to bring thier own guns from home.\n \n And\n \n \n You totally manipulated your source. I suggest you contact the site administrator of that cite and the author and see if they agree with you.\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Why do you feel the need to repeat this misinformation again in another thread? This seems very dishonest to me. Guncite did not write that article and the author is probably dead so how could I contact him? Courts have held that the right to bear arms is collective. \n \n \"We follow our sister circuits in holding that the Second Amendment is a right held by the states, and does not protect the possession of a weapon by a private citizen.\"\n Hickman v.

   "Whatever. The website did not write that article. They were just reprinting it.\n You keep ignoring what I say.\n\n \n What you fail to say, VOR, is Guncite lists both pro and con sites for review and study. For you to take one small part and say therefore, Guncite, supports your concept is a little disingenious. You also fail to mention which lower court you are quoting in giving the case. Others throughout our history have upheld the right as an individual right.\n \n You may want to consider, as well, this. The Bill of Rights is a list of declaratory and restrictive clauses. They declare certain things as truthful and right and restrict any abridgement of same. Read the Preamble to the Bill of Rights. The SCOTUS has also determined the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, as well as all of the Rights, as preceeding the Constitution and not depending upon that document for their existance. See US v Cruickshank, US Supreme Court. \n \n In US vs Verdugo-Uqardez, the SCOTUS has stated the same people in the First, Fourth, and Ninth Amendments are the same people as found in the Second Amendment, so if the Second Amendment does not protect an individual right, neither does the First Amendment, the Fourth, or the Fifth.",
