   "I live inside the US. The US is the most powerful country in the world in military. Its a filthy rich country. With our big houses, flashy cars, etc...\n Compared to most countries around the world America has got to be in the top three list.\n Like any government America does have its problems. Although I think the thing Americans don't realize is how petty there problems are compared to the rest of the world.\n The media mainly coversy issues inside the US. The US is occupied with its own issues that it doesn't give us nearly enough updates on world news. While a big story we might have in our news paper is an order from a judge in the Laci Peterson case or the removal of the confederate flag from the state house, this is nothing compared to real issues at hand.\n Other countries give constant updates on world issues in Iran, The Congo, Africa, North Korea, etc...\n While Americans \"BIG FIGHT\" is to be able to wear whatever shirt they want in public school, another country is battiling to have free education. We address free right of speech issues constantly, but how often do we pay attention to free speach in another countries. \n Ex.\n In Nigeria a reporter was speaking out against the government there. Nigeria is one of the richest countries in the world and around the 6th largest oil producer. The country is in absolute chaos compared with American scociety. The problem lies in corruption of the governemnt. Anyways the reporter, only trying to excercise his opinion of free speech to change the government began to receive death threats and was forced to leave the country. They had to leave their children behind. (An editor and his wife).\n \n But do Americans pay attention to this... No!\n They are completely swelled up with greed about some man pointing a gun at his wife over porn. (The headline : \"Man accused of pointing gun at wife over Net porn\") \n Now tell me which current event is more important?\n Thats the problem with America\n We shut out the rest of the world problems.....\n \n America: Let them eat cake\n \n This is why I despise most American media. We only pay attention to news that concerns us, and then eventually we forget about it. (Example : Afghanistan (sp) - The only time we pay attention there is when one of our soldiers is killed)\n \n Let me know what you think.....\n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

   "The reason our media is sensationalized is because the news is a television program, trying to get ratings and sponsors and make money, not report the news. They're looking to gather viewers and international news doesn't have the draw that the newest \"cure\" for baldness does, or the Laci Peterson or OJ Simpson dramas do. People tune in to see the dirty laundry, they crave it. They want to know about the Hollywood bunch who is divorcing who and why they care is beyond me, but they do. What is going on in Nigeria people don't care. The news isn't news, it's editorial that is flashy, with a big splash to garner ratings and make money. That's why you don't see it, because the people in the US don't even care what's gong on here short of what new hairstyle some star has, let alone any country overseas having any sort of issue. \n Additionally the same people who were in an uproar about the fact nothing was being done over the women in Afganistan being sent back to the Dark Ages by the Taliban were the first to scream and yell we don't belong over there when we did go in to remove the Taliban. The news plays to a fickle crowd and today's \"dolphin in the tuna net\" is tomorrows tuna.",

A station that would not cover kidnappings, murders, the break up of a Hollywood couple, or all of the other irrelevant things that stations such as CNN, and FOX cover.\n A downer is that some amount of tax funding would be required to first get it on its feet and since more people are bound to watch CNN it may still need little boosts once in a while.\n Of course the main up side to this is that finally America knows whats going on in the world.\n Bring the country out of the dark. With our current media's \"specialists\" ENDLESS speculation about the Laci Peterson case etc.\n I would be ok without any commentary on the news whatsoever. I can go on the internet for commentary, but I turn on the news and I want to hear facts.\n Perhaps Time Warner Cable should found this station....\n Just an idea.\n Let me know what you think.\n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",
