   "CAN RAW ENERGY CREATE ORDER?\n - BTG No. 144b December 2000\n by John D. Morris, Ph.D.*\n \u00a9 Copyright 2003 Institute for Creation Research. All Rights Reserved.\n \"Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them.\" (Ecclesiasties 12:1)\n Over the summer months no lack of energy hampered the growth of materials into a building. In addition to the sun's energy, there was an occasional thunderstorm and a frequent wind. Conditions could hardly have been better, one would think. \n But alas, soon the concrete hardened still in the sacks, the boards warped, dry wall cracked, and nails rusted. Even the precocious sign faded. All the materials were still there with plenty of energy, but only disorder resulted. What went wrong? \n What's wrong is the evolutionist fairy tale. Abundant energy acting on an open system are necessary conditions, but they are not sufficient. More is needed. \n For biological systems to grow, there must be some mechanism to take the incoming energy and transform it into useful forms. For plants this includes photosynthesis, for animals, digestion. These abilities are present in even the least complicated life forms, and without them energy would be deadly. Energy itself could not create such systems; they must be present at the start. \n Likewise, a blueprint for growth must be present to direct the converted energy into useful work. This is the amazing DNA code-an encyclopedia of precise information that the rest of the cell can read and obey. No raw energy could write this book on its own, but it must be present or else energy will be of no help. \n The time has come for evolutionists to drop their weary claim that the sun's raw energy is all that is necessary to produce order from disorder. Solar energy can't even produce a simple solar-powered home, and it certainly can't produce complex life. \n There was a great flurry of interest in constructing energy-efficient buildings during my tenure on the University of Oklahoma faculty. On my way to work each day I passed a huge sign proclaiming that a completely solar-powered house was to be built on that site. I noted with great interest as deliveries of brick and lumber and nails began to accumulate. Sacks of concrete and stacks of dry wall were piled near the staked-out location. I waited with great anticipation for the final project. \n I never learned the reason, but work never started. Perhaps there were financial or legal problems, but the workmen and their equipment never arrived as expected. No contractor showed up with his blueprints. But not to worry-all the raw materials were there, bathing daily in abundant Oklahoma sunshine-because remember, this was to be a solar-powered home. \n Evolutionists have taught for decades that the second law of thermodynamics-the entropy principle that things naturally decrease in complexity rather than increase-poses no barrier to evolution. Their claim is that while there is an overall downhill trend in nature, uphill innovations can occur locally in a system if abundant energy is available. Specifically the sun's energy provides all that is necessary to transform inorganic chemicals into a living cell and eventually into people. All that is necessary is an open system and abundant energy, especially the sun's energy. If complicated living organisms can be created in this way, certainly something not nearly so complicated as a house could be produced. Especially a solar-powered house! \n *Dr. John Morris is President of ICR.",

What it does do is override the tendancy within the 2LoTD where total usable energy in a system decreases.",

Don't tell me \"the sun is not the mecanics...\" tell me what is the mecanics. \n \n \n The Sun was crucial in the evolution of most life on the planet, but it may not have been the main cause of the very beginning of life. There are hypotheses that energy necessary, chemical catalysts available, Carbon, Nitrogen, Hydrogen, but not Oxygen apart from being part of the Water molecule. There are tectonic activated hot springs and chimneys in the deep sea. There is an availability of Sulfur, heat energy, and the triggering of a Sulphur based metabolism. It was internal energy from up welling and down welling of hot magma which in turn was fuelled by core radioactivity. Some even speculate that the very centre of the core may be pure Uranium.\n \n However, there is no need to debate the Second Law of Thermodynamics. It is a ruse by Magical Creationists who deliberately and in my opinion deceptively make Earth a closed entropy system.\n \n Cuchulainn\n \n PS: Fundies have an obligation to show why the fires of Hell are exempt from the 2nd Law.

   "Wait. Slow down here a minute.\n\n Yet again I type too fast for you. But as I have mentioned, just follow with your finger and move your lips. If you can't keep up with that then go back to the beginning and read it again.\n \nNow, Darwin, though not a scientist,\n\n Actually, at the time that On the Origin of Species was published Darwin was one of the most respected scientists in the world. He actually had an excellent scientific education from some of the leading scientists of the day before he ever embarked on the Beagle. You really need to learn the facts before you speak. Otherwise you make yourself look foolish.\n \nstumbled onto something absolutely amazing within the world of living things.\n\n No stumbling involved. He observed, hypothesized, predicted, and tested. Then he wrote his book.\n \nTo him, it could only point to God.\n\n Funny that he never mentioned that. What he did mention was that it was a natural process.\n \nBut what he feared most was that it would not be largely accepted in the favorable light in which he viewed it.\n\n Absolutely true. Some of Darwin's close friends were aware of his theory as early as 1844. But Darwin was, indeed, afraid of how his theory would be received and continued to refine it. Finally in 1858 Wallace sent Darwin a paper that proposed a mechanism for observed changes in living organisms, and asked that Darwin present the paper to the Linnean Society (the equivalent of peer reviewed journal publication today). Darwin did so, but upon the insistance of other scientists who were aware of Darwin's theory, Darwin also presented a paper. In 1859 Darwin published an \"abstract\" of his theory, \"On The Origin Of Species.\"\n \nBut, like so many simple discoveries with good beginnings, this one of Darwin's began to \"evolve.\" This idea gave rise to that. Grand notions gave rise to grander and even wild notions until what started out as a small miraculous window-view into God's fascinating world exploded into a revolution that would rock secular and religious worlds alike.\n\n Actually, Darwin tested his theories. And they have been severly tested since. Darwin was wrong on some minor points, the his major theories have been supported by repeated observation.\n \nIronically, what happened thereafter may be best described as a regression of reason. Remember those days?\n\n No, I don't. What are you babbling about?\n \nWe were calling each other animals and wondering if perhaps we shouldn't perhaps resign ourselves to their ignoble thought processes and lifestyle.\n\n My be is that I am older than you and I don't remember any such stupid scenario. What absolute XXXX!\n \nDarwin would have wanted nothing of the sort. The whole movement of his theories for living organisms was toward greater complexity and improvement and advancement of species.\n\n That's XXXX. You have never read Darwin, have you? He never made any such claims. You are either completely ignorant or a liar. Increased complexity, improvement or advancement are not part of Darwin's theory, and they are not part of modern evolutionary theory. You should at least have the integrity to learn the basics of what you profess to oppose. Why do christians seem to need to misrepresent science?\n \nThe advent of reason in man would be linked irrevocably to moral responsibility.

If you can't keep up with that then go back to the beginning and read it again.\n \n Actually, at the time that On the Origin of Species was published Darwin was one of the most respected scientists in the world. He actually had an excellent scientific education from some of the leading scientists of the day before he ever embarked on the Beagle. You really need to learn the facts before you speak. Otherwise you make yourself look foolish.\n \n No stumbling involved. He observed, hypothesized, predicted, and tested. Then he wrote his book.\n \n Funny that he never mentioned that. What he did mention was that it was a natural process.\n \n Absolutely true. Some of Darwin's close friends were aware of his theory as early as 1844. But Darwin was, indeed, afraid of how his theory would be received and continued to refine it. Finally in 1858 Wallace sent Darwin a paper that proposed a mechanism for observed changes in living organisms, and asked that Darwin present the paper to the Linnean Society (the equivalent of peer reviewed journal publication today). Darwin did so, but upon the insistance of other scientists who were aware of Darwin's theory, Darwin also presented a paper. In 1859 Darwin published an \"abstract\" of his theory, \"On The Origin Of Species.\"\n \n Actually, Darwin tested his theories. And they have been severly tested since. Darwin was wrong on some minor points, the his major theories have been supported by repeated observation.\n \n No, I don't. What are you babbling about?\n \n My be is that I am older than you and I don't remember any such stupid scenario. What absolute XXXX!\n \n That's XXXX. You have never read Darwin, have you? He never made any such claims. You are either completely ignorant or a liar. Increased complexity, improvement or advancement are not part of Darwin's theory, and they are not part of modern evolutionary theory. You should at least have the integrity to learn the basics of what you profess to oppose. Why do christians seem to need to misrepresent science?\n \n I submit that you can't tell us about any of Darwin's theories.

You are digging an ever deeper hole for yourself with every rebuttal you offer. It is becoming abundantly clear to me that you are the one who does not know of what he speaks. If you have missed the moral element of man in Darwin's theories, then we really have nowhere to go with this. Neither I nor anyone on this forum can continue to argue with a person who asserts things to be true or untrue based solely on his scanty knowledge of a subject. If we removed all the insults from your so-called discussions of a subject, I think we would be left with a spineless skeleton, one that would soon collapse. Your hero, Darwin, who never produced a scientific degree in anything was more of a philosopher than scientist. If he were with us today, I wouldn't have to do the talking now - he would be the one to sit you down and go over the ABC's of Darwinism and evolution, not to mention God and the moral responsibilities of man, the miracle and pinnacle of all living organisms. But why am I trying? You will, in your feeble way, tear this apart too - or at least you think you will. The unfortunate thing is that you seem to be looked up to on this forum, which means that you are influencing others to reason and agrue and insult just like you do. My schedule is calling, so suffice it to say that before I will go any further with you on this subject, I will have to ask you to review The Descent of Man and pay special attention to Darwin's detailed remarks surrounding enlightened man and morals.

   "Evolution is not progress. It is regress. Man has separated himself from God and as time increases godlessness increases in the world. Evolution suggests that it is possible to get better and better. It is the stuff of secularists that one day we will reach a man-made Utopia (see Appendix 1) \n \n Now that you accept that you are but a chance happening, without any special relevance (no soul), evolutionary science will build you up in it's image. Secularists compete for your attention; nationalists, capitalists, Marxists all promise a better society, one devoid of God (or with God in a lessor place). \"Once the idea took hold in the West that there were no rules, no limits and no natural laws, the only obstacle to a brighter future was understood to be backward religious ideas.\" Schaeffer, F \"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion\", p131). \n \n We have here a battle that has raged against Christianity since its warm rays first touched man. \n Simply put it is a battle of good vs. evil. \n More specifically it is truth vs. falsehood (dress up as truth). Evolution is not science, but faith. \n \"If evolution has so many scientific problems and bears such bad fruit, why is it so universally popular today? One reason is that it explains how life got here without having to deal with a creator God. If God is creator, He owns us and sets the rules. Many people think that God's rules interfere with their own creative plans. But what they don't realize is that God gave them that creative spirit, and desires to amplify it in their lives. Working in harmony with God's plans produces the only fruit that lasts. Everything else is like \"striving after the wind.\" \n Evolution produces a religious world-view that glorifies self-achievement. Many early scientists were Christians who desired to \"think God's thoughts after Him.\" These pioneers like George Washington Carver discovered countless uses for God's resources that improved the lives of many people. But today, the evolutionary world-view justifies pursuit of research for the motivation of vainglory. The result is often short-sighted inventions that create more problems than they solve. I remember seeing a sign on a chemistry professor's door that read something like this: \"If a person tells me he wants to go into research to better humanity, I advise him to rather go into charity. Science needs egotists, true egotists, whose motivation is for the sake of science itself.\" \" \n http://www.rae.org/godexist.html \n \n Despite evolutions specific attacks against religion, it confuses people by holding out an olive branch by stating that it is not anti-religious. This ambiguity adds to confusion. \"Summary: Evolution does not have moral consequences, and does not make cosmic purpose impossible.\" \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/social.html \n \n So what cosmic purpose could it allow? Certainly not Christianity. Christianity is not just a belief in Christ, and God, but that God created man for a purpose. That Jesus Christ came to redeem man, and thus also had a purpose. What purpose is there if we are simply apes that got lucky? \n What is becoming a talking point amongst some scientists is the anti-Christian pantheist theories of John Wheeler, Frank Tipler and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (ironic as he was a Jesuit). (Davies, P, & Gribbin, J, \"The Matter Myth\", p300ff). Evolution has tried to destroy people's belief in true religion. It has masqueraded as scientific truth. \n \"The anti-tradition and anti-Christianity of Marxist communis and Darwinian evolutionism only serve as a preparation for something far worse: a counter-tradition and counterfeit Christianity...\" (Fr Seraphim Rose, \"Genesis, Creation and Early Man\", p549.) \n \"The ultimate goal of this inversion...cannot but include a perverted concept of the deification of man\" (Ibid, p555). Thus like Adam, we are again tempted to set ourselves up as God. \n God is eternal. God has revealed his truth to us... as far as our understanding, that has changed, as we have grown in wisdom, revelation continues. God is the source of our knowledge about God. What is evolutionary science? It is our understanding of our universe, with ourselves as the fount of knowledge. Kuhn \"...deflated the view of science as an orderly process of asking questions and finding their answers.\" Gleick, J, \"Chaos: Making a New Science\", p36. I must stress here, it is not science that is evil, there are good Christian scientists everywhere, it is atheist scientists who believe that they are the supreme arbiter of knowledge (that there is no power beyond his own rationale, such as God). However it is atheistic scientists who believe that Christianity and science are at war. (\"Christianity on Trial\", Carroll, V & Shiflett, D., p79). It is time for Christians to realise that we are at war against this evil force. \n What is Evolutionary truth? It is a 'truth' that changes all the time. \n Let's now look at the changing 'truth' of evolution. \n There was Darwinism, then there's neo-Darwinism. \n The Earth was 100 million years old, then 1,000 million years old, now it's older. \n Darwin's Finch is a classic proof of observable evolution - of specification, but all these different 'species' of finch are able to mate... therefore they are all the same species. \n There was vestigial organs, (such as the tonsils -now they are no longer vestigial). \n There was embryonic evidence...\"Our gill slits are vestiges not of ancient fish but of ancient fish embryos...\" (Sagan, C \"The Dragons of Eden, p58). \n The ascent of man has equally competing theories of lines of descent. Cro-Magnon was sometimes portrayed as being an intermediary between us and a lower form, sometimes as a co-existing form. One documentary I saw dealt with Neanderthal Man as a separate species that arose in Africa then moved into Europe. It postulated that Neanderthal didn't 'die out' exactly, but interbred with modern man and Neanderthal gene pool mixed with ours. How were they then a different 'species'? Oh, well, as long as we can spout an explanation. \n There was radiometric dating which has been shown to be flawed (Miton, R \"Shattering the Myths of Darwinism\"). \n There was our ancestor \"Lucy\" which is found to be an extinct ape. Solly Zuckermann showed this back in 1954 but it still continues to be taught as fact (http://www.geocities.com/agseventyfour/agseventyfour.html). \n There were other supposed ancestors; Piltdown Man, Nebraska Man etc. \n All of these are truth? \n In my own field of interest - language development, we have the competing theories of Bickerton, Pinker and Bloom, Chomsky etc. all putting forth their theories, but as long as Evolution happened, then they are accepted as part of the flock that doesn't need a creative God. \n Appendix 1 - One of many utopian models put forward by anti-religious materialists. \n \"The era of liberation that erupted in 1989 will by 2040 have eliminated almost all overt tyranny. The major exception will be entrenched and sometimes subtle ethnic tyrannies that will linger for decades until asphyxiated by economic development and modernized communications. Socialism and communism having been discredited, economic securitarianism will linger (perhaps indefinitely) only as the sustaining sentiment behind welfare statism. The moral securitarianism motivated by fideist religion will remain the most serious global obstacle to human liberty, and will not fade as a political force until perhaps 2100. Global government will emerge slowly over the next few hundred years, as global regulatory bodies are set up to handle more and more government functions. Thus global government will emerge not necessarily from the UN and EU but from organizations like ISO and WTO. Only by around 2500 will there be a truly global federal government with sovereign (but limited) legislative, executive, and judicial powers. Any extra-planetary colonies will be federated into the global government no differently than terrestrial political units. Only the communications latency of interstellar colonization would create the need for sovereignties independent of Earth's. \n Private property and relatively free markets will endure indefinitely. Absolute poverty will continue to diminish as per-capita productivity continues to rise. Institutional relative poverty will continue in the absence of social policies to discourage dependency and encourage private accumulation of human and financial capital. Digital reproduction and distribution of copyrighted expressions will become increasingly rampant and could only be deterred through Gestapo-style inspections of digital watermarks. As a result, copyright will by 2040 be redefined to limit only commercial competition with the owner and abuses of attribution. Purchasing of copyrighted expression will be replaced by voluntary micropayments (of money or attention) made directly to copyright owners.\" \n http://humanknowledge.net/Thoughts.html#Volition",

You don't seem to be very careful with the truth. Or maybe intentionally stating facts that are known to be false is \"good.\"\n \nMore specifically it is truth vs. falsehood (dress up as truth).\n\n You mean fundamentalist christianity? Is this the principle you applied when you stated that the author of a book was unaware of some facts that he reported in the book? One might presume that you had actually read the book. Isn't that dressing up falsehood as truth?\n \nEvolution is not science, but faith.\n\n No. My faith is something else. I don't take any science on faith. Faith presumes that there is no evidence. Science is based on evidence - observations, hypotheses, predictions, and testing. Try to educate yourself. You look foolish when you spew like this.\n \n [snip of hysterical lies about the nature of evolutionary science]\n \n Who cares what you found on some fundy web site? Why do you think they are qualified to discuss science? Wouldn't it be better to learn the basics of what you claim to oppose rather than to make yourself look like a fool?\n \n [snip of denial]\n \n Wouldn't it have been nice if you had read and made an effort to understand? Let's just snip the rest of your paranoid religious claptrap because it is so meaningless and misguided. Maybe you might understand this.\n \n Religion is faith. Faith is to believe something without or in spite of the evidence. In the case of creationism and christian fundamentalism, there is faith in unseen and unknowable supernatural beings. There is no way to measure or observe the existance of these creatures. I stated this before in another thread when I asked for the means to quantify God. There is none. Therefore, the supernatural is not the proper subject of study by naturalistic means. Naturalistic study is the study of natualistic things that are not supernatural. It is the study of things that we can quantify. Science is naturalistic study. We can observe, measure, time, quantify the objects of scientific study. Thus, science is naturalistic.\n \n Now there are some who don't have the ability to realize that words sometimes have more than one meaning. For example, creationists don't seem to be able to realize that when an astronomer talks about the evolution of a star, he is not using the word with the same meaning as a biologist talking about the evolution of finches. The theory of evolution applies to living organisms and the mechanisms that cause and have caused them to change. Those mechanisms are naturalistic.\n \n In the same way, creationists don't seem to be able to distinguish between the naturalism of science, known as methodological naturalism, and some detached philosophy called philosophical naturalism. Science is methodological naturalism because science is limited to what can be studied by naturalistic methods. Since the supernatural is not natural, the supernatural is outside the scope of science. It is a limitation of science. Because of that, science does not and cannot make statements about the existance of the supernatural. If you wish to declare by faith that there are pink fairies that push the moon around the Earth, science can't show that you are wrong. Science can only offer naturalistic explanations based on quantifiable, naturalistic observations to show why the moon orbits the earth. Because the theories of science disagree with your dogma of fairies is not an attack on your faith.\n \n Neither is evolutionary biology an attack on religion. But creationists insist that because the observations of science are not in agreement with their faith in the supernatural, they believe that science is an attack on faith. It's really a sign of bad theology, weak faith, and intentional ignorance.",

   "\"Evolution is not progress.\"\n \n Lurch: Who ever said that it is?

Why do creationists insist on lumping anything and everything that they don't like under \"Darwinism\" and evolution? Most of what you have said is related to what is called social Darwinism. Social Darwinism is not related to evolution or Darwin. It was stated by Herbert Spencer before Darwin published Origins. If you are going to toss the word \"evolve\" around in all kinds of contexts and refuse to learn what it means in the context of evolutionary biology, then you are even less intelligent that I imagined. The \"evolution\" of feminist ideas is not evolution and is not related to Darwin. Stop acting like a fool.\n \n Evolution is a change in the frequency in alleles in a population over time.\n \n Unless you are claiming that feminism, naziism and Marxism are all genetic? If you want to argue against political ideas the go to the political forum and do so. Stop spewing nonsense.",

   "Don't be a boob. It is meant as a general statement.\n\n \n Why the insult to an honest question? Tell me that you could have worded your response a little more intelligently than this. I just wanted a clarification on what was seemingly a pretty crazy statement by yourself. Don't feel threatened by my questioning your intelligence or honesty, I simply wanted to get the facts straight.\n \n \nI didn't say that. I just mentioned creationists not all creationists, although it sure is common for creationists to lump things like the big bang, communism, naziism, perceived decline in morality, higher crime rates, and on and on as being the result of evolution or the teaching of evolution.\n\n \n You have to be specific and clear. You taught me that so I thought I would return the favor. Besides, my interpretation of your writing is accurate as far as English goes. You stated 'Why do creationists insist' which includes all people labeled as creationists and excludes none. I hope you will be more aware of this type of mistake on your part in the future. Also I find it hypocritical that you don't like that creationists lump things into groups when you just got finished doing that very same thing. Are you sure they were not making 'general statements' and you were just confused by them?\n \n \nNone of the above. Too bad you creationists (all of you) don't seem willing to actually learn the basics of what you claim to oppose. Isn't that dishonest?\n\n \n Wow, another blanket statement. Lets break this down. First you say 'all of them' when dealing with creationists. You add the word 'seem' to cover your back. Yet you throw in two insults 'Too bad' and 'dishonest' which I believe is intended for 'all' creationists. Since your publicly painting all creationists in a bad light due to your perception that they are unwilling to learn the basics of what I claim to oppose, could you point me to a study, a quote, or list out any evidence that you have which can back up this seemingly bias and inflammatory statement? Or don't you even believe in the accuracy of this statement in which case I'd like to know why you posted it in a way which could lead people to believe you treat the statement as fact? And if this is the case then did you post it just slap all those with creationist views in the face because of your bias against them? I'd also like to know why you posted the above statement off as a fact you believe in if it isn't something you believe. If you do think it is 100% true, I'd really like to see what evidence do you have to back up your post? To rebut your debate to that, I'll bet there is at least one creationist on this very board who is willing to learn the basics regardless as to whether they have or not. You do understand that is what you said, don't you? Your statement doesn't even force creationists to learn the basics in order for your statement to be proven wrong!\n \n If in your mind you do believe your statement, then I can prove that your ignorant of the true nature of creationists by finding just one who would be willing to learn the basics you mentioned. If you know your statement is incorrect then in essence you posted yet another intentional lie and were trying to mislead us all and insult all creationists. Either way, does this further show the ignorance or dishonesty your willing to show when a perceived creationist view (or conflicting view) confronts yours?\n \n \n I feel I have shown my point.\n \n PS, just to make sure we are clear on something, I'm not a creationist unless your definition isn't consistent with the true meaning of the word. Just wanted to make sure you understood that because your unclear statement 'all of you' indicates I'm part of that group while 'all of them' would have indicated I'm not part of the group.",

   "lurch it would be then a lot easier if you suggest someone who 'speaks for Darwinism'\n \n I ask this because I thought Dawkings, the Huxleys, Crick etc, were all pretty well-versed in the stuff. So, when they start spouting about the evils of Christianity, or the coldness that is reality (no emotions - just chemicals)... I take it that they are speaking for other, if not a majority of evolutionaries.\n \n You seem to know your evolutionary myths quite well. Do you speak for evolution?\n \n What are you passionate about anyway? And, why is this important? After-all your feelings could just be a genetic malfunction, or a magnetic surge, or maybe some other cause other than 'Free Will'.\n \n Also, can Darwinism explain emotions?\n \n \n If yes, then all the 'non-scientific' things such as art, literature etc, can then be part of the subject to which I addressed... you seem to say all these other things, politics etc, aren't part of the realm of Darwinism.\n \n If no, then there are some things to humanity beyond the scientific materialism of Darwinism.",
