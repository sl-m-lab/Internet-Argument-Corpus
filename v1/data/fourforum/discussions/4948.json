   "When one says the \"Greatest Ever\" I guess we have to look at both quality of the music and at its influence.\n I know it's repetitive and we kind of just pass it along because we've all heard it so much, but The Beatles really are the most important band of the rock era. No group comes close to their influence in modern music. You can hear it everywhere.\n \n But because I am an historian at heart, I also have to look at what came before. The Beatles would not have been possible without 50s American rock. Most importantly Buddy Holly. I think it's safe to say that without Buddy Holly we would not be talking about The Beatles right now.\n \n Strangely enough, Buddy Holly also inspired probably the second most important artist of the rock era: Bob Dylan.\n \n So, from an historical perspective, these are the most important musicians of this century in my mind, for what they made possible.\n \n *First of all, Jazz. I have to mention it as a movement because it's hard to pin down one single artist as the most important. Jazz, along with blues(and if you want to go even further back, the negro spiritual) are the two most important things to happen to music this century. Without them, nothing else would have been possible.\n \n *Robert Johnson- My god, this is the blues.\n \n *Woody Guthrie- No Bob Dylan, and no folk music without him.\n \n *Hank Williams- almost single-handedly invented country as we know it today.\n \n *Buddy Holly\n \n *Chuck Berry",

   "The Eagles\n \n Gary Stewart (now there's a singer/songwriter that didn't get the credit he deserved)\n\n \n Lots of those. I've known professional musicians who made it big and many, many more, equally talented, who didn't get the break. As an old man who grew up in Texas, to me Hank Sr. certainly has no peers though George Jones deserves credit for prolonging that era of pure country music performers and Alan Jackson came close. While Buddy Holly, a Lubbock boy, was seemingly an influence on others in the then emerging popularity of rock & roll, I think the blues and emergence of Chuck Berry and others, one had to see Fats Domino perform My Blue Heaven to appreciate the crossover from blues to rock, were more of an influence especially with the English groups using some chord changes. I was never impressed by folk music's almost crying socialism, so other than some of Dylan's early efforts, that fell off my charts pretty fast. Living in the City of San Francisco from 1967 through 1973 was an experience in rock music. I think one had to be there, loaded, in the Avalon or Fillmore West and experience something like Big Brother and The Holding Company with early Janis lead into Piece Of My Heart, along with many others who put their stamp on rock & roll. While living in Hawaii, in the middle '70s I attended what was then the 'last' Moody Blues concert, on Oahu, and after that my appreciation of 'new' rock went downhill. I then resided on Maui for a couple of years and was fortunate enough to have enjoyed many 'big' rock names jamming at private residences. Returning to the mainland US, grunge and other efforts left me feeling like an old friend on Maui was correct; Max, while toking up on a bomber of what sissies called one-hit 'Da kine', said young people were in a search for new music that, like most things in life young people search for, wasn't going to be there. They'd accept whatever the music industry offered and like it, and that rock & roll had just happened without motivation. I still like ZZ Top as a 'new' group and always bluegrass, but that's what's nice about popular music from any era; appreciation as a musician or listener is always a personal matter.",

   "I've thought about this thread a lot actually. :p \n \n There is no way I could narrow it down beyond a few singers/bands per \"genre\", or more importantly per \"era\". Deciding on the \"best\" is nearly impossible IMHO, there are way too many factors/criteria. A favourite is easier, but still not an easy task. :p \n \n In my initial post I was responding to who I thought was the best singer, plain and simple. Meaning the best/most unique/greatest range etc voice, not necessarily the most influential, popular etc....\n \n The fact is, many singers, and the front man most of the best rock n roll bands, even my favourite bands, are not good singers in the true sense of the word. Take away the backing and the volume, and your ears would likely hurt from how bad they are and how limited their range is. A lot of my favourite singers and bands fall into this category, including several listed above. Of course there are exceptions.\n \n I'm biased to old country music, but Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard have incredible voices, Jennings in particular. He had three octave range in his prime, ie he could sing the high notes as well as Roy Orbison and still get down as low as Johnny Cash, and his voice is instantly recognizable. Both singers have a depth, tone, and power to their voices that I have never encountered in another voice I've heard to date, in any genre of music. On top of that, there's no tricks, no overdubs, etc..., they can do it live just as well, in fact better in most cases, than on the records.\n \n To me, that's the ultimate test of a singer/band, is your live show as good or better than your recordings - I'm not talking about energy and atmosphere, I'm talking sound quality and musicianship. True greatness is effortless and natural IMHO.\n \n Anyhoo, that's my little rant for the day. :p \n \n Waxy",
