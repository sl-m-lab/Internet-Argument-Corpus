The decision is expected to embolden women's rights groups across Latin America to use courts in their countries to try to roll back some of the world's most stringent abortion laws. \n \n In a 5-to-3 decision handed down late Wednesday, the Constitutional Court overturned Colombia's complete ban on abortion and ruled that the procedure would be permitted when the life of a mother was in danger or the fetus was expected to die or in cases of rape or incest. Women's rights organizations in places as varied as Argentina and New York hailed the ruling. . . . But opponents in this heavily Roman Catholic region saw the decision as akin to legalizing murder. Cardinal Alfonso L\u00f3pez Trujillo, Colombia's highest Catholic Church official, told RCN radio here that the decision was \"an attack on human life.\" \n \n \"The depenalization of abortion is a judicial stupidity,\" Cardinal Trujillo said. \"The Constitutional Court does not have the right to say there is or there is not a crime. This is a bad decision, the fruit of international pressures that disrespect many Colombians.\" \n \n Colombia's conservative government, led by President \u00c1lvaro Uribe, has strongly supported the Catholic Church's position on abortion. . . . Four million abortions, most of them illegal, take place in Latin America annually, the United Nations reports, and up to 5,000 women are believed to die each year from complications that arise from the procedure. At least 300,000 illegal abortions are believed to take place in Colombia each year. . . .The Catholic Church hierarchy and some groups opposed to abortion vowed to fight on. \n \n \"We are calling for civil disobedience, so Colombians do not follow these practices,\" said Jos\u00e9 Galat, the rector of the Gran Colombia University. He has paid for full-page newspaper advertisements criticizing abortion rights advocates. \"We're going to call for a referendum to let the people decide if abortion should be legal or not because the court cannot impose this.\"",

   "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/24/opinion/24weds3.html\n \n May 24, 2006\n Editorial\n Abortion Ruling in Colombia \n Colombia, which until May 10 had completely banned abortion, has now legalized it under some circumstances. The country's Constitutional Court permitted the procedure in cases when the pregnancy endangers the life or health of the mother, or results from rape or incest, or if the fetus is unlikely to survive.\n \n Along with El Salvador and Chile, Colombia had been one of three countries in Latin America where abortion was completely prohibited. The decision is very important for Colombian women, who will no longer have to contend with a legal system that privileges a fetus's life over that of the mother. It also adds to a string of legal rulings relaxing abortion rules in Latin America, and will encourage abortion-rights advocates elsewhere.\n \n Almost as important as the ruling itself, however, are the reasons behind it. In the United States, the right to abortion rests on a woman's right to privacy. The Colombian court, in contrast, based its ruling on a woman's right to health, life and equality.\n \n This reasoning reflects the fact that illegal abortion in Colombia, as in most of Latin America, is a huge public health problem. It is shockingly common, ending one in four pregnancies in Colombia. Women there average more than one abortion over their fertile years. By the government's rough estimate, unsafe abortion is the third leading cause of maternal mortality. The health dangers are not shared equally, as wealthier women can pay competent doctors, while poor ones must resort to unsafe clinics or, worse, do it themselves.\n \n Catholic Church leaders have threatened to excommunicate the judges, along with women who undergo abortions and doctors who perform them. But most of Colombia's politicians who have spoken out, including the conservative president, \u00c1lvaro Uribe, say they respect the court ruling. Colombia must now overcome local pressure from the church and ensure that abortion is truly available to poor women in public hospitals. It should also address the lack of sex education and high rates of rape that have made abortion so tragically common.",
