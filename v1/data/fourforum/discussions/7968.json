   "With in the last 2 weeks, we have heard about 2 hoaxes in the news (at least where I am from.) One involved a woman who she and her husband told everyone that they had sextuplets.\n That story can be found here.\n \n \n In another news event, a girl in Independence, KS was reportedly kidnapped at gunpoint. The story here tells what really happened.\n \n \n I know one hoax was started to get money but the other had nothing to do with money. The second one could have been the girl seeking attention (which doesn't seem to be something she needs with her involvement in school) or it could be part of a family issue. I was wondering what were some thoughts on hoaxes like the ones mentioned (others can be mentioned) when they involve the law.",
